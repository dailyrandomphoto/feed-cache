    <title>The infrastructure deal could create pipelines for captured CO2  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Members Of Congress Work On Infrastructure Legislation On Capitol Hill" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dDlxXET5zt-6WM8SbfgDiU-CfIA=/0x1:3600x2401/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69671633/1233622087.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) walks back to his office after a bipartisan group of Senators and White House officials came to an agreement over the Biden administrations proposed infrastructure plan at the U.S. Capitol on June 23, 2021 in Washington, DC.&amp;nbsp; | Photo by Samuel Corum/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0mrQjt"&gt;A new generation of pipelines could be born out of the bipartisan infrastructure deal making its way through Congress. But instead of hauling oil and gas, the pipelines would carry planet-heating carbon dioxide. The massive bill would allocate funding for new infrastructure devoted to capturing carbon dioxide, and transporting it to places where it can be buried underground or used in products like carbonated &lt;a href="https://grist.org/article/direct-air-carbon-capture-global-thermostat/"&gt;soda&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RCw1wM"&gt;Carbon capture technology aims to scrub CO2 directly at the source of emissions — but it’s remained controversial among climate activists, with many seeing it as a false solution that distracts from emission reduction goals. But Congress’ new bipartisan infrastructure plan would invest billions of dollars into the idea, committing the US to ambitious carbon capture and removal schemes that have never been attempted at this large scale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ArX8rt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The infrastructure bill has opened the floodgates for carbon capture piping.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kqpXsE"&gt;“The infrastructure bill has opened the floodgates for carbon capture piping. Watch out,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/envirolawprof/status/1422247810246713363"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; Alan Ramo, professor emeritus at Golden Gate University School of Law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lDqFyO"&gt;The new provisions focus mostly on using carbon capture and removal to tackle industrial emissions, rather than emissions from the power sector. The Biden Administration &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404056/climate-tech-joe-biden-summit-carbon-capture-green-hydrogen"&gt;has particularly encouraged carbon capture&lt;/a&gt; for industries like cement and steel, which are difficult to electrify and decarbonize. (Cement alone is responsible for 8 percent of global CO2 emissions.) Focusing on those industries might keep carbon capture from being used as a way to extend the life of coal plants or other heavy-emitting power sources, a problem that’s come up with &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93y8dv/the-oil-industrys-new-climate-change-solution-is-more-pipelines?utm_medium=social+&amp;amp;utm_source=VICE_Twitter"&gt;carbon capture technologies used in the power sector&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yVcyng"&gt;The new infrastructure bill would fund a sort of network for industrial carbon capture and storage. There’s already been significant work on scrubber technology that removes carbon dioxide at the source, so the new bill directs much of its funding at building a pipeline network that would can carry that CO2 away from the initial emissions point. The bill also funds projects that could serve as a destination for that CO2, either using it in commercial products or injecting into the ground for storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c0CqJw"&gt;The full text of the bill, which senators released on August 1st, recasts the suite of emerging carbon capture and removal technologies as essentially a new type of critical infrastructure. “Carbon dioxide transport and storage infrastructure share similar barriers to deployment previously faced by other types of critical national infrastructure, such as high capital costs and chicken-and-egg challenges, that require Federal and State support, in combination with private investment, to be overcome,” the bill reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OD9U2g"&gt;All in all, the bipartisan infrastructure package earmarks more than $8.58 billion for carbon capture and removal. Much of the money is split between funding infrastructure for transporting carbon dioxide and finding a final destination for it. The Department of Energy would get $100 million to engineer “transport infrastructure,” aka pipelines for moving CO2. There’s another $2.1 billion to provide low-interest loans and grants for carbon dioxide transportation infrastructure projects from 2022 to 2026.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GiDYeH"&gt;The bill would also give the DOE $2.5 billion over five years to develop “commercial large-scale” projects to safely store CO2. It sets aside funds to permit wells for burying carbon dioxide deep in geologic formations. The bill specifically eyes the outer continental shelf — the offshore area beyond states’ jurisdiction — as one place for carbon sequestration and allows the Department of Interior to permit carbon storage projects there. The bill also creates a grant program for states and local governments to buy and use products made with captured carbon, which might include things like concrete and plastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GpwQGs"&gt;The bill also envisions four regional hubs across the US for “direct air capture” plants — facilities that draw carbon dioxide down directly from the atmosphere. Over the next five years, $3.5 billion would go toward these “regional hubs,” each capable of drawing down at least 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually (roughly as much as 120,000 homes in the US might generate from their energy use each year). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Operations At A Carbon Engineering Direct Air Capture Pilot Facility" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G7yrrk6kGOknt6sYhbZB27Qg-Gk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22758193/1186605536.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Technicians inspect the direct air capture system at the Carbon Engineering Ltd. pilot facility in Squamish, British Columbia, Canada, on Monday, Nov. 4th, 2019. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JLw8Cj"&gt;Carbon capture and removal is still expensive and at relatively early stages of development, which means it can likely only be developed with significant government funding. And there’s been even less attention paid to the pipeline infrastructure to support it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B50EZJ"&gt;“The problem is who pays for this giant pipeline initially, when there only are a handful of projects,” says Noah Deich, president of the nonprofit Carbon180, which advocates for the carbon removal technologies. “That’s what the legislation is incentivizing essentially, to build the big pipelines from the beginning so that it overcomes that chicken and egg issue and gets more and more of these industrial projects happening.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zo7nbt"&gt;But critics still worry that a focus on carbon capture and removal takes away from efforts to wean economies off fossil fuels in the first place, which puts a stop to carbon dioxide emissions and other pollutants that usually accompany it. Hundreds of environmental groups sent a &lt;a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/20072021/democrats-climate-infrastructure-legislation-carbon-capture-storage/"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; to Biden last month calling carbon capture “a dangerous distraction.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DGsN3k"&gt;The groups also warned that it would take money away from other important environmental efforts. The bipartisan infrastructure bill ended up including a lot less funding for climate action and environmental cleanup than the Biden administration proposed earlier this year. But the infrastructure package includes much of what advocates for carbon capture and removal had asked for in an earlier bill called the &lt;a href="https://carboncapturecoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SCALE-Act_Fact-Sheet-1.pdf"&gt;SCALE Act&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOJv6j"&gt;The infrastructure bill provides “minimal support” for a renewable energy transition while “squandering” billions on carbon capture, Carroll Muffett, the president and CEO of the Center for International Environmental Law said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “As a corporate giveaway, the energy provisions in the Infrastructure bill are a massive success. As a response to the climate emergency, they are a dismal failure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="JRHjXM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Like pipelines for fossil fuels, there are risks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tg6ckE"&gt;There are also fears around the pipelines themselves. CO2 pipelines would probably be concentrated in industrial areas, and thus would be less sprawling than pipelines used for fossil fuels. But that could add an extra burden on neighborhoods already overloaded with industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HlfYyL"&gt;And like pipelines for fossil fuels, there are risks that come with that infrastructure potentially failing. CO2 that’s captured is moved at high concentrations under high pressure. That makes it a potential asphyxiant if the infrastructure moving it fails. When a pipeline carrying CO2 for enhanced oil recovery in Mississippi &lt;a href="https://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/local/2020/02/27/yazoo-county-pipe-rupture-co-2-gas-leak-first-responders-rescues/4871726002/"&gt;ruptured last year&lt;/a&gt;, 45 people were treated at a hospital. A sheriff’s investigator described sick people acting “&lt;a href="https://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/local/2020/02/27/yazoo-county-pipe-rupture-co-2-gas-leak-first-responders-rescues/4871726002/"&gt;like zombies&lt;/a&gt;” after the incident.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMDQEC"&gt;“Transporting and storing carbon dioxide (CO2) involves a massive network of perilous pipelines connected to underground injection sites, each with their own set of dangers,” the July letter from environmental groups to Biden reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="na0HCV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BxDLf5"&gt;There are a smattering of deals happening across the web. Some products we’ve covered are seeing some of the lowest prices yet. Like an 11.5-inch tablet with an OLED screen. For a limited time, Lenovo is discounting its Tab P11 Pro tablet that has a vivid OLED screen from its usual $500 price down to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F174820374306%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26toolid%3D20008%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F8%2F3%2F22607346%2Flenovo-tab-samsung-galaxy-buds-logitech-gaming-mouse-deal-sale-amazon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;just $310 through Lenovo’s official eBay page&lt;/a&gt;. This is the base model that has 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1GgzJ0"&gt;My colleague Dan Seifert mentioned in the review of this product that this tablet is great for watching movies on, with its display and quad speakers packing a punch. This model is set to receive Android 11 in October 2021, and it will receive security updates through late 2023, &lt;a href="https://support.lenovo.com/ca/en/solutions/ht501098-android-upgrade-matrix"&gt;according to Lenovo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451264/lenovo-tab-p11-pro-tablet-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="5XPSkB"&gt;It’s also a great day to score discounts on Samsung wireless earbuds. Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Live in the bold, mystic blue colorway &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F194202087189%2F%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26toolid%3D20008%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F8%2F3%2F22607346%2Flenovo-tab-samsung-galaxy-buds-logitech-gaming-mouse-deal-sale-amazon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;are available refurbished directly through Samsung via eBay for just $70&lt;/a&gt;. These originally sold for $170, and seeing them for $100 new would be a deal worth leaping for. Samsung says these come in “like new” condition in their original packaging, and they have a two-year warranty. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review of this model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="kAwN9o"&gt;If you don’t want to shop at Woot, Amazon’s Warehouse for used and refurbished products is also offering great deals. Per &lt;a href="https://slickdeals.net/f/15194164-amazon-warehouse-20-discount-off-select-items?src=frontpage"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slickdeals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you can get 20 percent off (discount applies at checkout) on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-Cancelling-Charging-Included/dp/B089B6Y618/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=galaxy+buds+live&amp;amp;m=A2L77EE7U53NWQ&amp;amp;qid=1627995103&amp;amp;s=warehouse-deals&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Galaxy Buds Live in multiple colors&lt;/a&gt;, and the final price should equal or beat the deal on eBay. This 20 percent off deal applies to most products within Amazon’s Warehouse, so go ahead and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?i=warehouse-deals&amp;amp;bbn=16059675011&amp;amp;ascsubtag=2ba4c818f45911eb8dd13ebc8cc252b30INT"&gt;type in your dream product on the search bar at this page&lt;/a&gt; to see if you can score a discount.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The G502 Hero on the left is discounted today. It shares many features in common with the pricier wireless G502 Lightspeed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="U5RggM"&gt;If you’ve been looking for an affordable gaming mouse that’s stacked to the nines with buttons and has premium features like removable weight and a free-spinning scroll wheel, you’re in luck today. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GBZ4Q68/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech’s beloved G502 Hero wired gaming mouse is $38 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, down from its usual $45 or so price (Amazon says it will be “in stock soon,” so it may not ship immediately). It has a lot in common with the wireless G502 Lightspeed mouse that usually costs more than twice as much. The button layout, the build quality, and the performance are very similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="A8nCRZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10644920"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Crime-tracking app Citizen now includes a premium-priced safety help line</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Screenshots from Citizen Protect" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XR89B6eCqS-HSuZ2MBwgp6Amjqk=/255x0:2145x1260/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69671428/01.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Citizen&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="efp5YR"&gt;The crime-tracking app Citizen is now launching its own emergency response service, promising access to agents who can call 911 or keep tabs on a potentially dangerous situation. Protect, which costs $19.99 per month, builds on a beta program that launched earlier this year. It’s part of a larger — and sometimes controversial — expansion effort at the startup, which has built a crime-mapping system into a live broadcasting platform while experimenting with private security services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QgPWOm"&gt;Citizen Protect is essentially a private safety help line that draws on smartphone features like location tracking. When subscribers open the Citizen app, they can hit a button to call a “Protect Agent” via video, audio, or text. Agents are supposed to talk subscribers through unsafe scenarios and help callers navigate to a safe public place if necessary. They can dial 911 or a designated emergency contact and provide location information from the caller’s phone. And they can create a public Citizen incident with the subscriber’s consent, alerting nearby Citizen users to what’s happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QpyBq5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Users can call a “Protect Agent” via video, audio, or text&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="khzdy2"&gt;On iOS, subscribers can turn on an automated “Protect Mode” as well. This sets the app to listen for a “distress signal” such as a scream — after which it will ask if the user wants to call an agent, then connect to one automatically if there’s no answer. Users can also shake their phones rapidly to connect with an agent. (Citizen says it will add these options to Android soon.) If users are in trouble but can’t directly ask for help, agents can still listen in via a phone’s microphone and call 911 if they deem it necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jV5d5M"&gt;Citizen’s main service is a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/17/style/citizen-neighborhood-crime-app.html"&gt;crime-tracking app&lt;/a&gt; that posts reports of nearby safety incidents based on user tips, police scanner data, and other sources. It’s moved into live video as well, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595648/citizen-app-crime-scene-paid-live-streamer-nyc-la-emergencies"&gt;recruiting paid streamers&lt;/a&gt; to cover reports of missing children, house fires, and crime scenes. In a statement, Citizen CEO Andrew Frame said Protect marks an evolution from “a one-way system” for broadcasting safety alerts to “a two-way system where users can request help from Citizen.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Citizen Protect screenshots" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZJMByBbu8IMRzR-pW1dwlKpJoEk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22758167/04.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="17d4Y0"&gt;Citizen may have an incentive to publicize calls in a way that 911 operators don’t. Earlier this year the company launched OnAir, a live broadcast system that blends crime tracking with local reporting. In a high-profile misfire, Citizen OnAir streamers urged users to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447446/citizen-app-internal-slack-palisades-fire-arson-bounty-manhunt-los-angeles"&gt;hunt down an innocent man&lt;/a&gt; falsely suspected of arson. That said, publicity could be helpful to some subscribers: Citizen promotes its ability to spread the word about lost people and pets, for instance, crediting the app with 20 rescues since its 2017 launch. And it promises agents will never create a Citizen alert without permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4GaqOW"&gt;Citizen has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447756/citizen-app-private-security-securitas-los-angeles-professional"&gt;tested patrol cars rented from private security outfits&lt;/a&gt;, but at least so far, Protect isn’t a substitute for police or 911. Its agents don’t dispatch special private forces, and they’re purely remote operators. Some features also don’t seem like a huge upgrade to existing smartphone options. Apple’s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208076"&gt;Emergency SOS&lt;/a&gt; can discreetly call 911 and share location data alongside an emergency call, and it includes extra features like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20936113/apple-watch-emergency-sos-fall-detection-set-up-how-to"&gt;automatic fall detection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hiXooR"&gt;In a call with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Citizen promoted Protect for risky situations that aren’t yet 911-worthy emergencies. The company claims agents’ presence has helped deescalate disputes during the beta, offering examples like someone having a heated argument with a volatile roommate. It says some Black beta users have asked agents to watch if they’re stopped by law enforcement, building on Citizen’s existing &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/6/12/21284113/police-protests-surveillance-instagram-washington-dc"&gt;capabilities for monitoring police during protests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ag3K1I"&gt;Protect’s value hinges on its promise of quick and competent support across the roughly 60 US cities where it operates. Citizen tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Protect operators are hired directly, not subcontracted through another security service, and that its staff has comfortably supported around 100,000 beta users. It declined to disclose how many agents it employs, and it hasn’t offered detail on how often most Protect beta users call them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="X158oX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Citizen promotes Protect for risky situations that aren’t yet 911 emergencies&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l5qSlX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90639153/citizen-public-safety-surveillance"&gt;A &lt;em&gt;Fast Company&lt;/em&gt; article questioned&lt;/a&gt; the capabilities of Protect agents during the beta, noting that the qualifications in a job listing were “minimal.” Conversely, Citizen describes its agents as “highly trained safety experts” who sometimes have experience as social workers, police dispatchers, and emergency responders. Among other things, it says the employees complete a four-week Public Safety Telecommunicator certification course that includes training on bias and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pnszu4"&gt;Critics have accused Citizen of &lt;a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/08/it-creates-a-culture-of-fear-how-crime-tracking-apps-incite-unnecessary-panic/"&gt;inciting fear and paranoia&lt;/a&gt; so it can sell peace of mind through services like Protect. One former employee &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3dpyw/inside-crime-app-citizen-vigilante"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; that&lt;/a&gt; “the whole idea behind Protect is that you could convince people to pay for the product once you’ve gotten them to the highest point of anxiety you can possibly get them to.” Citizen has denied the claim, saying that it surfaces only “relevant, real-time information” about people’s surroundings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WTCgH3"&gt;But Protect could offer some support for people experiencing persistent health issues or threats like stalking. Unlike a 911 call, a Protect call doesn’t directly prompt a police dispatch that could turn violent. And there’s no sharing system that could amplify noncredible or bias-fueled accusations the way a social network might, so an agent could theoretically defuse situations without getting anyone else involved. While Protect is described as an app feature, its value will probably depend on the humans Citizen can hire — and how Citizen tells them to respond to users’ calls.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sri Lanka’s cannabis-seekers are gathering on Facebook</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Facebook groups have become a gray market for the country’s weed dealers&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="BwqatQ"&gt;One weekend about a year ago in Balangoda, a misty mountain town outside Colombo, the Sri Lankan capital, Sanjana was supposed to meet a dealer she found on &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/923602878094040"&gt;Thriloka Wijaya Pathra&lt;/a&gt;, a Facebook group for cannabis users in Sri Lanka. Like many strangers who had connected over Facebook, Sanjana had decided to buy a few joints of ganja (a local word for weed). Then a family emergency happened and Sanjana couldn’t make it. A few days later, another group member told Sanjana that police caught her dealer. Perhaps he was released after a fine. Perhaps he went behind the bars. Sanjana didn’t hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ObsZLX"&gt;“The only thing I know is that this stuff is illegal in Sri Lanka and it can get you in trouble,” Sanjana, now an 18-year-old, recalled to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, while waiting for another dealer to bring ganja grown domestically, 4.5 hours north of Colombo. “I was at my boyfriend’s place in Balangoda,” Sanjana said, chuckling. “If it’s two to three joints, I’ve heard they release you after a $30 fine. Plus my boyfriend works in the police. He could’ve got me out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iOfTEq"&gt;Cannabis has a complicated history in the island nation. While native medicinal practitioners used cannabis to treat illnesses in the past, a law introduced in 1935 under British colonial rule criminalized cannabis. Though a 1967 government act permitted registered Ayurvedic doctors to use cannabis for medicinal purposes, today Sri Lanka &lt;a href="https://sensiseeds.com/en/blog/countries/cannabis-in-sri-lanka-laws-use-history/"&gt;still considers&lt;/a&gt; cannabis to be a “dangerous drug,” and recreational use can result in fines and years of prison time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="RmFph9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“People feel that Facebook is safer than real life.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i0qzfS"&gt;Despite these laws, cannabis is the &lt;a href="https://www.unafei.or.jp/publications/pdf/RS_No107/No107_15_IP_SriLanka.pdf"&gt;most-used illicit drug in Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;, with an estimated &lt;a href="https://www.unodc.org/southasia/frontpage/2009/October/interview-with-mr.-mendes.html"&gt;600,000 users&lt;/a&gt;; natural scientist Wasantha Sena Weliange believes that number is much higher. In recent years, cannabis has become extremely popular with Gen Z.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o3nJPo"&gt;Buwanka, 25, is an Instagram influencer in Colombo who despised cannabis as a schoolkid. The anti-cannabis rhetoric, Buwanka said, comes from his parents’ generation, who believed cannabis was harmful. “Because that’s what everyone thought in the 1960s and 1970s. My parents fed me the same mentality. So as a teen, I was the first to report my classmates if they smoked ganja,” said Buwanka, who only wanted to reveal his first name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imALsD"&gt;But things changed when he left for college in Adelaide, Australia. Thousands of miles away from his Sri Lankan home, he began to feel lonely. When his roommate gave him ganja, he gave it a try. “I became happier. I started going out and joining all the cool events in the city.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ujf54"&gt;Buwanka now thinks that people refuse cannabis not because they dislike it, but because it’s tied to social stigma. “We constantly believe ganja is bad and if someone smokes ganja, they are addicts who have no use for society.” But Facebook communities, he said, are working toward changing this stereotype by gathering like-minded people into one place and creating a forum for discussion. “People feel that Facebook is safer than real life. They are more confident in sharing what they want on social media.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fNpxsY"&gt;When Sanjana joined Thriloka Wijaya Pathra two years ago, there were only a few thousand members — now there are over 177,000. The group, which takes its name from the Sanskrit for cannabis, provides a platform for cannabis users to get together and share information: different uses of cannabis, medicinal qualities, details on how to roll a joint, etc. Members post pictures of their cannabis plants in tiny pots grown in secret inside their houses. And of course there are memes and TikTok videos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Hp6i3c"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Dinesh considers himself “just a pawn” in a large drug supply chain&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hsZx2e"&gt;Anil, 19, smokes weed in Ja-Ela, a town just a few miles north of Colombo. He started smoking at 15 with his rugby teammates. “Every stoner grows a ganja plant, or at least we try,” he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, recalling his unsuccessful attempts to grow cannabis in a clay pot. “Because this shit is hard to find.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TtpXnY"&gt;In Sri Lanka, police often &lt;a href="http://www.colombopage.com/archive_19A/Feb26_1551154235CH.php"&gt;raid cannabis plantations&lt;/a&gt;, destroy them, and put traditional growers behind bars. This leads to a shortage of fresh, local weed. Smokers, Anil said, have found a solution: Kerala ganja — commonly known as &lt;em&gt;KG&lt;/em&gt; — smuggled from South India to Sri Lanka. Anil meets KG users in a place he calls “smokers den” in Colombo, a sort of cannabis retreat run by a 30-year-old in his private apartment where smokers can meet, chat, dance, and party. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s9uaJE"&gt;Although local distributors &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gopiharan/status/1005353974235463680?lang=en"&gt;spray poisonous ingredients&lt;/a&gt; like formaldehyde and domestic pest killers like Mortein on these products, making commonly available KG a &lt;a href="https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2019/09/08/health/medi-snippets-kerala-ganja-users-are-risk-heart-failure-stroke"&gt;harmful narcotic&lt;/a&gt;, Anil boasts that he smokes “pure KG” — cannabis without added chemicals — and can identify the “real stuff” when he sees it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1lcdF8"&gt;“There’s nothing like pure KG now. All KG is a shit mix of chemicals,” said Dinesh, 28, who is a drug dealer and a tuk-tuk driver in the Colombo suburb of Mattakkuliya. Like Dinesh, many weed distributors in Sri Lanka are tuk-tuk drivers who sell low-quality, cheap KG. Dinesh, who started dealing drugs when he was 16, soon after he dropped out of school, considers himself “just a pawn” in a large drug supply chain. He receives goods from several others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="JPcv68"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s cheap. It’s everywhere.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fzIZ9h"&gt;While his customers come from all walks of life, Dinesh said that most of them are teens. Most young users, he said, don’t come face to face; they send someone older to buy ganja.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QFGgGG"&gt;His prices start at $2 for a small packet of KG, enough for a joint. “This cheap stuff has lots of chemicals. The more chemicals, the more you feel,” said Dinesh. “It’s a different kind of high. It’s the sudden thrill that young boys, and occasionally girls, love.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0KZogY"&gt;Dinesh agrees that teens are aware of the harmful substances in chemically treated KG. “But it’s what most people can afford,” he said. “Rich kids come to me and buy &lt;a href="https://www.diffen.com/difference/Hashish_vs_Marijuana"&gt;hash&lt;/a&gt; and kush [imported drugs with higher levels of THC].” Dinesh sells a gram of kush for about 7,000 LKR ($40).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="80MSef"&gt;Janith, a 19-year-old in Colombo who goes to a paid private school, said his friends also use expensive edibles, like gummies from Canada that go for $100. Janith and his mates consider KG a “bad trip” they avoid. But young smokers often don’t have an idea about what is good or not, so they search on Reddit or join Facebook groups to find information and connect with fellow smokers, Janith said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XFS30h"&gt;Although a March &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/923602878094040/posts/1171718439949148"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; on the Thriloka Wijaya Pathra group asks members to not talk about KG, a June post from a member asks his fellow smokers what they prefer, KG or local ganja. Most users wrote KG. A handful of them said they use KG since local ganja is hard to find. Sanjana agreed. “It’s cheap. It’s everywhere.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qT4im9"&gt;Sanjana, who has smoked KG, believes that Facebook groups like Thriloka Wijaya Pathra play a key role in educating smokers. When Sanjana initially joined, she saw a series of Facebook posts about cannabis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="go9UsE"&gt;“Maybe there are bad sides to cannabis, but why would I stop something if it makes me feel good?” said Sanjana, “In the past, some people commented against using cannabis. But now people get correct information and see there’s no harm. It’s all thanks to these groups.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P63ayF"&gt;Gen Z aren’t the only ones using social media to talk about cannabis. When Buwanka posted an &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CG5IzyZhA_9/"&gt;IGTV video&lt;/a&gt; about cannabis and why it should be legalized in Sri Lanka about eight months ago, it caught attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IYQZ0R"&gt;But Buwanka’s video didn’t go viral on Instagram. It was when cannabis community groups on Facebook shared it that he received a roaring response. There were 138,000 views on popular Facebook pages like Weedboy. Comments poured in. People loved Buwanka’s video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="7k78VF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Only a handful of urban people use Instagram, but everyone’s on Facebook”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gKGY1Y"&gt;Buwanka said it was because he spoke in a local language, Sinhala. “Most cannabis users don’t speak English. When you go online, you can read about cannabis, but it’s all in English. I needed to do something that everyone could understand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9A2tfQ"&gt;“Only a handful of urban people use Instagram, but everyone’s on Facebook,” said Buwanka. “That’s why it went viral on Facebook.” While over &lt;a href="https://napoleoncat.com/stats/facebook-users-in-sri_lanka/2020/01"&gt;30 percent&lt;/a&gt; of Sri Lankans have a Facebook account, only &lt;a href="https://napoleoncat.com/stats/instagram-users-in-sri_lanka/2020/01"&gt;4.7 percent&lt;/a&gt; of Sri Lankans are on Instagram. Most Facebook users are young. Over a third of them are under 24. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9q6MnB"&gt;Of course, safe use of cannabis isn’t the only thing they talk about. While these Facebook groups don’t allow users to sell cannabis or share details about dealers in public, Buwanka said that Facebook users still talk about these things. “Especially during lockdowns, people would come to these groups and comment, ‘I’m from Gampola and we’ve run dry over here.’ Or, ‘My tuk-tuk dealer has tested positive for COVID. Can someone send me some ganja?’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rFFLP3"&gt;These groups have connected the cannabis community with one another, giving smokers a chance to share details outside the groups. Buwanka said that members chat on Messenger and share supplier details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UViayh"&gt;“You make friends in these groups, but it’s hard to send ganja to some other place because it’s risky. I know people put it in perfume bottles and send it via delivery guys,” said Sanjana. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rWhvCY"&gt;During holidays, Sanjana smokes a few joints with her 17-year-old cousin; they post about cannabis on Thriloka Wijaya Pathra and share photos. “Because our society expects girls to be cultural, people think that cannabis is only for boys and girls can’t use it,” said Sanjana. “That’s bullshit. Everyone can use it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJrYBW"&gt;Sanjana thinks that Facebook helps change how people think. “When I first posted, people wrote negative things. Boys thought, ‘Girls can’t use ganja.’ But now a lot of members support the idea of girls smoking,” said Sanjana, who responded to negative comments with a rolling-eyes emoji and wrote, “Girls need to feel good, just like you do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="oGw1r8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If you can just walk into a shop and buy fresh ganja at affordable prices, why would you choose harmful stuff?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9NZln4"&gt;While young smokers are finding community on Facebook, 56-year-old natural scientist Wasantha Sena Weliange, who is &lt;a href="https://www.themorning.lk/high-time-for-cannabis-legalisation/"&gt;fighting to legalize&lt;/a&gt; cannabis in Sri Lanka, runs his own &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/448451116534844"&gt;Facebook group&lt;/a&gt; to support generational cannabis farmers. Weliange, who wrote a Sinhala-language book about cannabis, is now building a hemp museum and a cannabis village in Thanamalvila in the southeast of the country. “On Facebook, we are trying to establish knowledge and influence young people to join the fight to legalize cannabis,” Weliange said. “We get calls from a lot of young people. They are happy to see this. They are curious. Some of them ask me, ‘Can I mix ganja with yogurt?’ or ‘What can we make from them?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="axtpw4"&gt;Weliange believes that legalizing cannabis will not only help farmers, but also prevent young people from using chemically processed KG and other harmful substances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5oJK6E"&gt;This also resonated with Buwanka. “If you can just walk into a shop and buy fresh ganja at affordable prices, why would you choose harmful stuff?” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HN44UP"&gt;While the government has discussed &lt;a href="http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2020/09/13/news-features/legalising-and-exporting-cannabis-cards"&gt;planting cannabis for export purposes&lt;/a&gt;, Sri Lanka’s &lt;a href="https://www.ucanews.com/news/sri-lankan-religious-leaders-oppose-cannabis-cultivation/89629"&gt;dominant Buddhist clergy&lt;/a&gt; are against decriminalizing cannabis for everyday use. But both Gen Z and older generations are still using it, and frequenting Facebook to meet each other. “If it wasn’t for social media, I don’t think we can come together around a tree and talk about cannabis,” Buwanka said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8KbEZM"&gt;Meanwhile, Anil still believes he can identify good KG, while Janith says friends make brownies when they get together. Dinesh knows his job is risky, as police can raid him, but he’s happy being a dealer as long as it brings him money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="4yGj66"&gt;“If they legalize it, I will be the first to plant ganja in my garden,” said Sanjana, who’s planning to study a Japanese-language course in order to go work in Japan with her cousin. “But the only problem is that cannabis is illegal in Japan. I’ve heard you can’t get around it like we do here.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch Boeing launch its astronaut capsule to space</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="NASA/Kim Shiflett" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hDIeWCBP92CG4HI8VoLtYlc4PN4=/0x116:1365x1026/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69671303/51347154310_cb53a69a6b_k.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Boeing’s Starliner capsule sits atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket | NASA/Kim Shiflett&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3MNIyb"&gt;Boeing is set to launch its Starliner astronaut capsule to the International Space Station (ISS) on Tuesday, more than a year and a half after its first orbital Starliner test failed to reach the station and returned home earlier than planned. The mission is a test, and there won’t be any humans on board. If all goes well, it’ll mark a crucial step toward Boeing and NASA’s goal to use Starliner for routine astronaut missions, and a key chance to salvage the aerospace giant’s reputation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22595730/boeing-starliner-astronaut-capsule-launch-nasa-oft2"&gt;after years of setbacks and controversies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lVlemU"&gt;The test mission, called Orbital Flight Test 2, will launch from Florida’s Cape Canaveral Space Force Station using an Atlas-V rocket built by United Launch Alliance. Starliner, sitting on top of the rocket, will do what &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/2/18244499/spacex-crew-dragon-launch-first-capsule-iss-nasa-passenger-flight"&gt;Boeing’s rival SpaceX did with its Crew Dragon capsule in early 2019&lt;/a&gt; — go to space, dock to the ISS, remain there for 10 days, then return back to Earth. Both companies have developed their capsules under NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, with Boeing’s Starliner contract at $4.5 billion and SpaceX’s at $2.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JVS5n1"&gt;Starliner, a seven-seated astronaut pod shaped like a flat acorn, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/22/21033757/boeing-cst-100-starliner-landing-success-oft-rough-flight"&gt;suffered a series of software glitches&lt;/a&gt; during its 2019 test flight, forcing Boeing to skip its space station docking and bring it home early just two days after launching to space. In the next 18 months, Boeing worked to settle 80 different concerns that sprang from lengthy technical investigations led by company employees and independent experts at NASA. Those 80 recommendations have been implemented, Boeing’s Starliner chief John Vollmer told reporters on Tuesday, and Starliner is ready to fly again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="w1Dg8e"&gt;What time is the launch?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GM2H0z"&gt;Liftoff is slated for 1:20PM ET on Tuesday, with &lt;a href="https://www.patrick.spaceforce.mil/About-Us/Weather/"&gt;forecasts&lt;/a&gt; from the Air Force predicting only a 40 percent chance of unfavorable launch weather. Boeing and NASA postponed the mission from last Friday after a new Russian science module that docked the day before Starliner’s planned launch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22601752/russia-nauka-module-software-glitch-iss-space-station-nasa"&gt;started uncontrollably firing its thrusters and pushed the entire space station out of position&lt;/a&gt;. NASA’s ISS team needed time to make sure everything on the space station was back to normal before welcoming a new spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sbNh1b"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If weather messes things up, the next chance to launch is Wednesday&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AybluV"&gt;If Tuesday’s launch gets called off because of weather, Boeing would try again on Wednesday, August 4th, at 1PM ET. Assuming it launches on Tuesday, Starliner will try docking to the International Space Station roughly 24 hours later, at 1:37PM ET on Wednesday, to begin its ten-day stay. NASA astronauts already on board the station — Shane Kimbrough, Megan McArthur, Mark Vande Hei — will run tests inside the capsule before it undocks roughly 10 days later. The exact time Starliner undocks to begin its trek home depends on weather forecasts over New Mexico, where the capsule will return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HIzTDJ"&gt;How to watch Starliner’s mission&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Swqpbf"&gt;Like all of its launches, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF9LpNpNjNI&amp;amp;ab_channel=NASA"&gt;NASA plans to stream Starliner’s launch on a YouTube feed&lt;/a&gt;, with live coverage starting at 12:30PM ET. NASA’s live coverage of Starliner’s ISS docking begins the following day, Wednesday, at 10:30AM ET, and will be viewable on the agency’s &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/nasalive"&gt;main live YouTube feed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon and Best Buy’s latest Fire TVs have a sleeker design and better HDR</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uFYqK_rdb5GVsalYEwVZlNPwJS8=/34x0:2485x1634/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69671298/B823E2AA_EE2D_4D51_9125_88DEF71EF1B4.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ddycRY"&gt;Amazon and Best Buy are continuing on with their TV partnership that started three years ago. Today, the companies announced new Insignia and Toshiba TVs that run Amazon’s Fire TV software. The latest F50 series improves on previous “Fire TV Edition” sets — Amazon is just calling them “Fire TVs” now — with expanded quantum dot HDR color for a more vivid picture. The new models also feature slimmer bezels, DTS Virtual-X audio from the built-in speakers, and continue to support Dolby Vision HDR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Boc3m"&gt;Pricing will start at $599.99 for a 50-inch model, and the F50 series tops out at 70 inches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5yK0L"&gt;Between different models and screen sizes (ranging from 24 inches to 75 inches) sold in the US and Canada, there are now over 80 Insignia and Toshiba Fire TVs available. Both are Best Buy’s house brands, and customers can order any of the TVs on Amazon’s website for in-store pickup at their nearest Best Buy store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CuOPgs"&gt;When they ship later this summer, the latest TVs will come preloaded with Amazon’s revamped, content-focused Fire TV software experience. The included remote will also support Alexa voice commands. You’ve still got to press and hold the Alexa button to make voice requests; Amazon and Best Buy continue to refrain from putting always-listening mics in these TVs, which seems like the right decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5WaDX2"&gt;These are still being positioned as inexpensive TVs that are centered around &lt;em&gt;video&lt;/em&gt; entertainment; if you’re looking for the best set for showcasing your new Xbox Series X or PS5, you’ll probably want to look elsewhere. While Amazon has released higher-end Fire TV sets in other countries (like an OLED from Grundig in Germany), so far there’s nothing in its US lineup that can go toe to toe with TCL’s flagship Roku TVs in picture quality. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blizzard president J. Allen Brack is out after sexual harassment suit, employee walkout</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2maphLdy35agORuQjR3vnvgp9TA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69671217/acastro_210729_1777_blizzard_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fWb4t6"&gt;In the last week or so, we’ve learned about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597113/activision-blizzard-california-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-discrimination-employee-action"&gt;the state of California filing a lawsuit against Blizzard citing numerous stories of sexual harassment and gender-based discrimination at the company&lt;/a&gt;. The revelations have been followed by even more stories of unacceptable behavior by leaders of the company, and now the president of Blizzard (who was named in the lawsuit) is leaving the company “to pursue new opportunities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1FJKdF"&gt;Employees were informed of J. Allen Brack’s departure this morning, and &lt;a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/blizzard/23706475/new-leadership-at-blizzard"&gt;an announcement&lt;/a&gt; from Activision Blizzard says that former Vicarious Visions leader Jen Oneal and former Xbox executive Mike Ybarra are now co-leaders of the developer. A note on &lt;a href="http://Blizzard.com"&gt;Blizzard.com&lt;/a&gt; says the two “are deeply committed to all of our employees; to the work ahead to ensure Blizzard is the safest, most welcoming workplace possible for women, and people of any gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or background; to upholding and reinforcing our values; and to rebuilding your trust.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ZtEkmH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the latest accusations Activision Blizzard employees have leveled at the company ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602655/activision-blizzard-employees-accusations-allegations-lawsuit"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="NpcOvA"&gt;Brack &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/10/3/17934432/mike-morhaime-blizzard-president-resigns"&gt;took over Blizzard in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, and prior to that, he led the development of &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt;, where the team included the only other person specifically named in the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) lawsuit, Alex Afrasiabi. Women told &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt; that working in the company was “akin to working in a frat house.” The &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; team was specifically cited as an “untouchable” source of the toxic culture, because of the money the franchise brought in and the long tenures of senior employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2ImdB"&gt;Ahead of their walkout, employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595922/activision-blizzard-employees-walk-out-sexual-harassment"&gt;made a list with four demands&lt;/a&gt; including an audit of executive staff, an end to forced arbitration clauses, and other changes to improve diversity and equity for marginalized groups at the company. These demands followed an inconsistent and self-admittedly “tone deaf” response from the company, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/24/22591611/activision-blizzard-brack-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-california"&gt;a letter from Brack&lt;/a&gt; where he claimed to have fought “bro culture” throughout his career — despite the lawsuit alleging he was aware of and enabling the behavior cited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="khp0sy"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It was great attending the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ActiBlizzWalkout?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ActiBlizzWalkout&lt;/a&gt; this morning - happy to see so many familiar faces. Together let's build a safe, brighter and fair future for everyone.  &lt;/p&gt;— Mike Ybarra (@Qwik) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Qwik/status/1420468544446222336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W8JnLG"&gt;Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick has not addressed the issues since his letter last week, and the announcement of Brack’s departure comes from COO Daniel Alegre. Saying that Oneal and Ybarra “will share responsibility for development and operational accountability” at Blizzard, he noted that Oneal has been providing leadership and support for the &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt; franchises, while Ybarra has been an EVP overseeing &lt;a href="http://Battle.net"&gt;Battle.net&lt;/a&gt; since joining Blizzard in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fWxyvM"&gt;Brack’s exit means he won’t be a part of Activision Blizzard’s Q2 earnings presentation and call &lt;a href="https://investor.activision.com/events/event-details/activision-blizzard-second-quarter-calendar-2021-results-conference-call"&gt;later today&lt;/a&gt;, as the company answers questions from investors and analysts about its current situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="FtUi9B"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;J. Allen Brack:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hPtY51"&gt;I am confident that Jen Oneal and Mike Ybarra will provide the leadership Blizzard needs to realize its full potential and will accelerate the pace of change. I anticipate they will do so with passion and enthusiasm and that they can be trusted to lead with the highest levels of integrity and commitment to the components of our culture that make Blizzard so special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Realme launches MagDart magnetic wireless charging devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k_uLABIWNFvtb7IAxYfsNGoK0h4=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69671195/MagDart_keynote_product_part_final_final.009___.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5RDuFl"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595550/realme-flash-magdart-wireless-charging-magnetic-android-specs"&gt;reported last week&lt;/a&gt;, Realme is working on a magnetic wireless charging system for its Android phones, and today it’s revealed a full range of products that’ll use the new technology. Realme is calling the system MagDart, and it’s basically a high-powered take on Apple’s MagSafe system for the iPhone 12 range of phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r8jHox"&gt;The key product in the lineup is the 50W MagDart charger, which Realme says is the world’s fastest magnetic wireless charger. It has an inescapably bulky cuboid design that makes room for a cooling fan, but Realme is banking that users will make the tradeoff for faster charging speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oD8xGq"&gt;When plugged into the company’s 65W SuperDart wired charger, Realme claims that the MagDart charger will fill a 4,500mAh phone battery up to 100 percent in 54 minutes. That’s almost as fast as what you get from Realme’s 50W wired charger.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UMWayB2ya6IR8I5bD7B1J1qihsc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22757981/MagDart_keynote_product_part_final_final.011___.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RFObBC"&gt;If you don’t want to have to plug a charging brick into a charging brick, Realme is also working on a somewhat sleeker and more convenient 15W MagDart charger, which basically looks like Apple’s MagSafe puck — though Realme points out it’s 26.4 percent thinner and claims faster charging speeds. It’ll fill a 4,500mAh battery in 90 minutes, according to Realme, which would indeed be &lt;a href="https://www.cambrionix.com/magsafe-usb-c-charging-speed-tested"&gt;much faster&lt;/a&gt; than Apple’s own 15W option.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RA93AmxmWRjo782pjm_7h35o2XE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22757985/MagDart_keynote_product_part_final_final.021___.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="H9ZFQG"&gt;Wireless charging convenience aside, a major advantage of a magnetic design like MagDart and MagSafe is the potential for slick portless accessories, and Realme has a bunch of those as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="6mfuyn"&gt;The 2-in-1 MagDart Power Bank is similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588777/apple-magsafe-battery-review-size-iphone-12-mini"&gt;Apple’s recently-released MagSafe Battery Pack,&lt;/a&gt; but it comes with a dock that lets you use the battery as a phone stand.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UVPrDZ-dVzmqXS8K8vO_CQ9Fbck=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22758014/MagDart_keynote_product_part_final_final.001___.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="ZKrtej"&gt;The MagDart Case is a carbon fiber-style case for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22534618/realme-gt-hands-on-europe-launch-price-specs"&gt;the new Realme GT flagship phone&lt;/a&gt; with a passthrough USB-C port and headphone jack as well as built-in MagDart connectivity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TQa74990q8Wpfirf_vgZoOLEsUM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22758017/MagDart_keynote_product_part_final_final.043___.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="mbW209"&gt;The MagDart Wallet is, you guessed it, a three-card sleeve similar to Apple’s MagSafe wallet. But this one has a kickstand.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8jKMiMMweJ5mfrbwMxdsjwDKU9M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22758020/MagDart_keynote_product_part_final_final.040___.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="qQDjyf"&gt;Perhaps best of all is the MagDart Beauty Light, a flip-up ring light for selfies that’s powered by reverse wireless charging. It has 60 mini LEDs and a dedicated control button that lets you adjust settings like brightness and color temperature.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V5tmot1sqNpTLFLqUmEHiD6E5ks=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22758023/MagDart_keynote_product_part_final_final.038___.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1wpXkD"&gt;Realme hasn’t said anything about a release date or pricing for any of these products, and the sole existing phone confirmed to work with any MagDart device is the Realme GT — and that’s only if you buy the dedicated case. Realme is demonstrating the ecosystem with a “concept phone” called the Realme Flash, which is pictured in the above images and does have MagDart directly built in, but there aren’t any plans to actually release it yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nhvDRX"&gt;That’s a pretty big catch for what’s ostensibly a launch for a major new ecosystem of products. But if Realme does integrate MagDart into its future phones, it could be a solid differentiator. Wireless charging is consistently one of the key omissions from Chinese phones that otherwise have impressive spec sheets — Oppo only recently adopted the tech, and Vivo is yet to get on board. And since Oppo’s VOOC fast-charging system made its way to OnePlus and Realme phones due to the companies’ shared ownership and supply chain, it’s plausible that the same could happen with MagDart.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter to work with AP and Reuters to provide more context around disputed topics</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kbbe8JZnKPwENA-YiNW6UM1aqzM=/0x0:4962x3308/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69671108/MisleadingInfo.png.img.fullhd.medium.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter’s added context for content on its platform.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="toli3h"&gt;Twitter is working with news agencies the &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;to more proactively combat misinformation on its platform, the &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/bringing-more-reliable-context-to-conversations-on-twitter"&gt;company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. The platform’s internal teams already work to explain and add context to Twitter content, but it says the two news agencies will help provide more authoritative information, especially when facts are in dispute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="meIFu2"&gt;In particular, Twitter says it wants to be more proactive about providing accurate information on topics as they develop, before misinformation emerges. “Rather than waiting until something goes viral, Twitter will contextualize developing discourse at pace with or in anticipation of the public conversation,” the platform says. &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;and the &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt; will also provide feedback on fact-checking provided via Twitter’s crowd-sourced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248903/twitter-birdwatch-fact-checking-misinformation"&gt;Birdwatch program&lt;/a&gt;, which is currently in a pilot phase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iixPOC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’re excited to announce a new collaboration with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AP?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Reuters?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Reuters&lt;/a&gt;! Conversations move fast on Twitter and we need to be able to surface credible context just as quickly. Learn more about where you’ll see these updates: &lt;a href="https://t.co/ptp5PWiFxq"&gt;https://t.co/ptp5PWiFxq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1422288755197726731?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uMSnC3"&gt;The collaboration is an expansion of Twitter’s existing attempts to stop misinformation from spreading on its platform. The company’s Curation team already adds explanatory content to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21418044/twitter-trending-topics-representative-pinned-tweets-descriptions-misinformation"&gt;trending topics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/11/21254733/twitter-covid-19-misleading-information-label-warnings-misinformation"&gt;certain misleading tweets&lt;/a&gt;, and will surface authoritative information when users search for specific terms, or during major events like elections or public health emergencies. But Twitter says the new partnerships will help “when Twitter’s Curation team doesn’t have the specific expertise or access to a high enough volume of reputable reporting on Twitter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hZM4nF"&gt;It will be the first time Twitter has formally collaborated with news agencies to provide accurate information on its site, the company &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/twitter-partners-with-ap-reuters-battle-misinformation-its-site-2021-08-02/"&gt;tells &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Associated Press &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;already work with Facebook to fact-check content on its platform, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-58065463"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BBC News&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BmVvGs"&gt;Twitter says its collaboration with the two news agencies will be separate from the work done by its own enforcement teams, and that neither &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt; nor &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;will be deciding whether tweets break Twitter’s rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JSk1qN"&gt;The new partnerships come as social media platforms are facing intense scrutiny from regulators for the amount of misinformation they spread. The problem has become particularly acute in light of the global COVID-19 pandemic, in which misinformation about the virus and now its vaccines has spread online. Last month, US surgeon general Vivek Murthy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578431/white-house-surgeon-general-facebook-youtube-twitter-covid-19-misinformation-vaccines"&gt;called on platforms&lt;/a&gt; to do more to combat coronavirus misinformation, including redesigning their algorithms to avoid amplifying it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J4Dbi7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SRCoGV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HP is flooding the zone with seven new gaming monitors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="HP gaming monitors" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4pw4exhbKOnJ7U2r6OREkwyejuk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69671039/hpecosystemmonitors.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The X34 1440p monitor sits in the middle of the fleet of new models.&lt;/em&gt; | HP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vb6p4B"&gt;HP has gone on a tear and announced seven new gaming monitors in its X lineup, featuring a range of sizes, panel types, and resolutions, as well as some that are curved or flat-screened. It seems like HP is aiming to deliver a flurry of options that have a high refresh rate, low response time, competent design, and crucially, competitive prices. HP is staggering this launch over the next few months, with availability starting now for some of its monitors and continuing through October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZaRHW"&gt;To being with, there’s HP’s X27, which is available now and comes in a 1080p version for $259.99 or a 1440p variant called the X27q that costs $339.99. Both are IPS panels with a 165Hz refresh rate and a 1ms response time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="16WfcB"&gt;Resolution differences aside, they’re very similar in design. Each features slim bezels on three sides and can be raised, swiveled, and rotated to your liking. If you don’t like the stand that’s included, they include VESA mounts so you can mount them to one of the many monitor arms that are available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aT6ebf"&gt;In terms of ports, these are simple offerings with a DisplayPort 1.4 port, a HDMI 2.0 port, and a headphone jack. Each panel can reach up to 400 nits of brightness (the X27q, the X32, and the X34 that’s mentioned below support HDR content, but at the HDR400 standard that isn’t all that bright), and there’s AMD’s FreeSync Premium for variable refresh rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9kKxW"&gt;(In fact, every monitor announced today has the same selection of ports, and each has an adaptive sync feature that works with both AMD and Nvidia GeForce GTX 10 series, GTX 16 series, and newer graphics cards. I’ve reached out to HP for clarification on how its adaptive sync compares to Nvidia G-Sync compatibility.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The X34 is the biggest option to come in HP’s late 2021 lineup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FWSpRA"&gt;Coming in August is a larger variant called the HP X32, a 1440p monitor with many of the same specs and features as the X27q (though it can’t pivot or swivel); it will cost $389.99. A month later, in September, the HP X34 will add an ultrawide option to the lineup; it will cost $459.99. It has a 21:9 aspect ratio display and a 3440 x 1440 resolution. It’s still limited to just one DisplayPort and a single HDMI port for video input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTHBYe"&gt;HP will release three different sizes of 1500R curved gaming monitors in October, and these are similar in design, port selection, and feature set to the flat panel options. These, however, have VA panels that usually boast more narrow viewing angles, but that’s less of an issue on a curved screen. They also have 350 nits of peak brightness compared to 400 nits in the flat panel monitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iD7pRv"&gt;The X27c with a 27-inch 1080p curved screen is $259.99 — the same price as the flat X27. The X27qc is the 1440p curved variant, bumping the cost just $10 over the non-curved option at $349.99. Finally, HP is releasing a 31.5-inch X32c with a bigger 1080p curved display that costs $309.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZTRJVt"&gt;Each of these monitors support VESA mounts and can be raised or lowered, but don’t support pivoting or swiveling. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="HP X32c" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ubaYhDTuX1h_nkUVeh4WFLi22tg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22756757/x32cmonitor.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;1500R isn’t as curvy as gaming monitors come these days, but it’s certainly more immersive than a flat panel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ae5hSK"&gt;Those are appealing prices if you’re thinking of dipping a toe into the world of curved gaming monitors. You could get two of each size and still spend less than the cost of a single &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22587089/samsung-odyssey-neo-g9-49-inch-curved-gaming-monitor-price-specs-release-date-features"&gt;Samsung 49-inch Odyssey Neo G9&lt;/a&gt;. The picture quality and features provided by that $2,499 monitor are way ahead of these curved HP models, but you’re paying dearly for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iPIbIj"&gt;In announcing &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; many monitors at once, it’s clear that HP wants to flood shelves with plenty of options for the latter half of 2021. Seven monitors might be overkill, but these could be worth checking out if you’re on a budget and don’t want to decide between buying a graphics card or a display.&lt;/p&gt;
