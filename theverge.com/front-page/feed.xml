    <title>HTC downplays leaked Vive Air headset, says it’s just a concept</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SYsyTF4bvv-TpiG6M1ysDzRnYdI=/128x0:2432x1536/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69161345/309526_01_vive_air_b_1500x2500.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leaked images appeared to show a new fitness-focused VR headset from HTC. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L9Vi1z"&gt;HTC has downplayed leaked images that appeared to show a new fitness-focused VR headset built by the firm. Pictures and details of the HTC Vive Air &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393527/htc-vive-air-fitness-focused-headset-leaks-images#comments"&gt;leaked online&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week on a design award website but HTC now says the headset is “only a concept.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HlFm5a"&gt;“It’s exciting to see our concept piece, the VIVE Air VR headset, win an iF Design Award,” the company said in a statement given to &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/htc-vive-air-concept/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;UploadVR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “While this is only a concept, the design language has elements and inspirations you’ll see elsewhere in our products. We’re not ones to rest on our laurels, so although it’s great to win this award, we have business to attend to — hopefully we’ll see you on 11/12 May at ViveCon.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R12T6vRvtAHyl17Zgn7nVAQNBMc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22456641/htc_vive_air_leak_.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HTC Vive Air claimed to be made from breathable knitted fabrics. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PuNMZE"&gt;This statement doesn’t &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; rule out that some similar product is in the works from HTC, but the company is definitely keeping things carefully ambiguous. It has been teasing a &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/htc-vive-headset-2021/"&gt;new headset reveal&lt;/a&gt; at ViveCon next month, but the images and hints we’ve seen so far suggest an enterprise-focused model rather than a fitness device for general consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WMEBdt"&gt;That’s a shame, as VR fitness is having &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22379859/vr-virtual-reality-fitness-work-out-supernatural-chris-milk-interview"&gt;something of a moment&lt;/a&gt;, and the idea of a specially-designed, lightweight and washable headset is an appealing idea. With HTC’s consumer business in the doldrums, though, it’s perhaps not a sensible target for the company right now. We’ll just have to wait and see what the firm has in store at ViveCon in May.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>B&amp;W’s first true wireless headphones have a workaround for in-flight entertainment </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eaxp5DWfrH0Alwu6BWaR1raEyfM=/0x0:3300x2200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69161331/High__PI7_Buds_Top_Rotation___White_A_3x.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PI7 true wireless headphones.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Bowers and Wilkins&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zsAeO4"&gt;Bowers and Wilkins’ debut pair of noise cancelling true wireless earbuds, the PI7, fix one of the key annoyances with the form-factor — it’s usable with in-flight entertainment systems because the case doubles as an audio transmitter. Plug the case into an audio source using an included 3.5mm to USB-C cable and it will retransmit the audio wirelessly to the earbuds. Alongside it, Bowers and Wilkins has also announced the cheaper PI5 true wireless headphones, which also offer noise-cancellation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NnepXh"&gt;Bowers and Wilkins claims the PI7’s transmitting case is an industry first, and it’s certainly the first time we’ve heard of such a feature. In contrast, trying to use other popular true wireless earbuds like the AirPods Pro with a plane’s built-in entertainment system &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20982261/airpods-in-flight-entertainment-bluetooth-adapter-twelvesouth-airfly-pro-review-price"&gt;requires a third-party dongle&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, the PI7’s transmitting case should also work with any other non-Bluetooth devices you own, like an old iPod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cLqruF0ZH3_gnLynmjgySjoaTLo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22459089/Low__PI5_Buds_Top_Rotation___Charcoal7_3x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bowers and Wilkins&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PI5 true wireless earbuds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xySwL8uW-F1o16NoZatVEpRveuw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22459092/Low__PI7_Case_45___White_A_3x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bowers and Wilkins&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PI7 headphones in their charging case, which doubles as a wireless transmitter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lD4XNX"&gt;Beyond the PI7’s fancy case, it offers a fairly standard set of features for a pair of true wireless headphones. The earbuds are noise cancelling, and are equipped with six microphones in total for calls or using voice assistants. It uses the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/31/17660460/aptx-adaptive-qualcomm-audio-compression-algorithm-android-pie-ifa-2018"&gt;AptX Adaptive standard&lt;/a&gt;, which should allow it to dynamically compress audio to maintain a stable connection, and its case can be charged wirelessly. The earbuds themselves have a modest battery life of 4 hours (compared to 4.5 for the AirPods Pro), while the case offers 16 hours more. The buds have an IP54 dust and water resistance rating, so they should survive light splashes and limited amounts of dust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4D6TOt"&gt;The cheaper PI5 earbuds also offer noise cancellation and come with a case that can be charged wirelessly, but they only have four microphones total. There’s also no mention of AptX Adaptive —  just regular AptX — and there’s no sign of the PI7’s audio retransmission case. Battery life for the PI5 appears to be slightly better than the more expensive PI7 however, with the earbuds offering 4.5 hours of playback on a single charge. The case offers 20 hours more. The PI5 also have a dust and water resistance rating of IP54.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MxJ7Ei"&gt;Both earbuds are available starting today. The PI7 cost $399 / £349 / €399, while the PI5 cost $249 / £199 / €249.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram is rolling out a new tool to automatically filter out abusive DMs </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WB7kRqVRBrqTKRAxFBIvPsWoeEg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69161216/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HQIZBl"&gt;Instagram announced a new tool today that will allow users to automatically filter out direct message requests containing offensive words, phrases, and emojis. The tool is targeted at celebrities and public figures who receive a large number of unwanted, harmful DMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1VujYE"&gt;The update builds on Instagram’s work to combat hate speech on the platform. In February, the company said it would begin &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276491/instagram-direct-message-hate-speech-account-disabled-policy"&gt;disabling the accounts of users who sent multiple harassing messages&lt;/a&gt;. In 2018, the company expanded its offensive comments filter to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/1/17308012/instagram-offensive-comment-filtering"&gt;automatically block comments that attack a person’s appearance or character&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qdRvcq"&gt;The message requests filter can be toggled on or off in a new section of the app called “hidden words.” When it’s on, offensive messages will be pushed to a separate folder. DMs in this folder are concealed, allowing users to browse messages without needing to read what they say. If a user taps into a message, they can read, delete, or report it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="laMCw2"&gt;The company says it worked with “leading anti-discrimination and anti-bullying organizations” to come up with a preset list of offensive phrases. Users can also customize their own list based on what they don’t want to see.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DqToNx"&gt;Instagram said the new feature will be rolling out to “several countries” in the coming weeks, though it did not specify which countries those are. The company plans to expand to more countries in the next few months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P4O2nd"&gt;As part of the announcement today, Instagram also said it is rolling out a tool to allow people to preemptively block new accounts from harassers. Now, when a user blocks someone in the app, they’ll have the option of blocking any new accounts that person creates. The company declined to specify how it does this, saying only that it uses a “variety of signals” to detect new accounts from those same users. The feature will be pushed out globally in the next few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TrNRMu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GM9SSk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Logitech announces cheaper Magic Keyboard alternative for new iPad Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cIhR5Hfs7KeT1zVyy3kYGUa0DJI=/0x1:1497x999/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69161192/lct.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="efHctY"&gt;Apple just announced an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22385675/apple-ipad-pro-m1-chip-specs-features-price"&gt;M1-powered update to the iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;, and Logitech has followed up with a new keyboard and trackpad accessory for the 11-inch and 12.9-inch models. The Combo Touch is a case with a Microsoft Surface-style kickstand and a detachable backlit keyboard with a trackpad. It connects over the iPad Pro’s Smart Connector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hSDFxZ"&gt;Logitech already released a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231088/logitech-combo-touch-ipad-keyboard-trackpad-case-review-price-specs-features"&gt;similar Combo Touch keyboard for 10.2-inch and 10.5-inch iPads&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a related &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fipad-keyboards%2Ffolio-touch.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F21%2F22395219%2Flogitech-combo-touch-keyboard-new-ipad-pro" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Folio Touch&lt;/a&gt; for the 11-inch iPad Pro and 10.9-inch iPad Air. The Folio Touch’s keyboard isn’t detachable and its trackpad is a little smaller than the new Combo Touch, but otherwise it’s a comparable product.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yKbpM07pVTlgcVfm02zqpYAPk0A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22459035/lct2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="d5nEia"&gt;This is the first time Logitech has offered a keyboard/trackpad option for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, however, and it’s significantly cheaper than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21227345/magic-keyboard-ipad-pro-tablet-laptop-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Apple’s own Magic Keyboard&lt;/a&gt;. The 11-inch model is $199.99 and the 12.9-inch model is $229.99 versus the $299 and $349 that Apple charges, meaning you could save about $100 or more on the sticker prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FX4sJC"&gt;You might actually prefer Logitech’s design, as well. It’s not as sleek as the Magic Keyboard, but the case will offer better protection for the iPad, the detachability and kickstand offers an extra degree of versatility, and the keyboard has a useful function row. The 11-inch model is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fipad-keyboards%2Fcombo-touch-ipad.920-010095.html%3Fcrid%3D1762%23buy-combo-touch-ipad&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F21%2F22395219%2Flogitech-combo-touch-keyboard-new-ipad-pro" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available to pre-order now&lt;/a&gt;, while the 12.9-inch version is listed as “coming soon.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Your AirTag can’t say horseshit but it can say shit horse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pOzVugXqLpd3tX4pcM19AHxVNfg=/126x0:683x371/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69160283/Screen_Shot_2021_04_20_at_3.51.50_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hs4Xss"&gt;After what feels like ages of rumors, speculation, and worry that I was getting way too obsessed with a Bluetooth item tracker that seemed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/2/17924312/tile-mate-pro-premium-subscription-launch-battery-range-price"&gt;similar to ones&lt;/a&gt; made by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22227621/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-price-release-date-tile-locator"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373410/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-plus-uwb-ar-bluetooth-price-release-date"&gt; other companies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/20844326/apple-airtags-bluetooth-tracker-keys-tile-features-price"&gt;AirTags are finally here&lt;/a&gt;. But before you preorder the Mentos-esque pucks, there’s something you should be aware of: if you want to engrave your AirTags, you can’t combine a horse and poop emoji in that order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="20rRSu"&gt;That’s right, the emoji version of “horseshit” is a no-go when getting an engraving for Apple’s newest product. Here’s what happens when you try to make that your engraving of choice:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NutL9CXqgO33Uqx7XCe7_CRxh-M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22458423/Screen_Shot_2021_04_20_at_4.48.33_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple says no to “horseshit” in emoji form.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QMOxcH"&gt;Curiously, poop and then horse (“shit horse”) is totally fine, though. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q1Uymr65Ow6aJYNmaOZraMUcD6w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22458224/Screen_Shot_2021_04_20_at_3.20.01_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple has no problem with “shit horse”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JxnslX"&gt;Fictional horse excrement is fair game too. Despite being a horn away from being exactly the same emoji, “unicorn shit” works fine. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r6JUfeJdQV-RlelRmLeRZXEqBfg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22458484/Screen_Shot_2021_04_20_at_5.27.33_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple is more forgiving of fictional horses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AMOJ6R"&gt;As do emoji representations I tried for “snake shit,” “monkey shit,” “chicken shit,” and even “shit bird.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="93hkSZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10457217"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="86gPs9"&gt;Similar limitations apply to actual offensive words as well. Apple gives you &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; enough letters for some creative diction, but catches some of the obvious offenders. “SUCK,” “NSFW,” and “BUTT” are still on the table though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fjKJne"&gt;This is all very silly on some level, but consistent with the conservative California Dad lens through which Apple seems to make most of its product decisions. The same emoji restrictions are present on AirPods and iPad engravings, for example. Though on those devices, “horseshit” does seem to work — so if you really want to brand your AirPods case that way, go for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mabrO7"&gt;We’ve reached out to Apple to see if these limitations are deliberate or a bug.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ca3vDl"&gt;Tim Cook, the mild-mannered Apple CEO, probably didn’t have to lift more than a finger to launch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394227/apple-ipad-pro-2021-how-where-to-buy-preorder-link"&gt;a new line of iPad Pros&lt;/a&gt; with the company’s Arm-based M1 chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YlFWXE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/7/18254958/tim-cook-apple-trump-username-changed-twitter-name-potus-president"&gt;Tim Apple&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand? He’s the kind of daring superspy who can pull off a high-security heist, slicing through plate glass, rappelling down buildings, and dodging lasers, all with a trusty grappling hook at his side — as you’ll see in the video above.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YYlMcEJK9MWmfi8-NurEkdWKq_E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22458419/tim_apple_cook_mission_impossible_4.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0cOS2X"&gt;Also, he’s apparently able to &lt;em&gt;unsocket&lt;/em&gt; a soldered-down chip, perhaps the most impressive trick of all — except perhaps for the one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/20/20974999/trump-is-lying-about-the-new-apple-factory"&gt;where he gave Donald Trump a “new” factory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22241646/apple-tim-cook-gave-the-first-mac-pro-to-trump"&gt;the “first” Mac Pro&lt;/a&gt; off its assembly line. Not bad for a 60-year-old, even one who’s in charge of the most profitable company in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V3KzH0"&gt;I sure hope he’s ready for the memes! Here’s one single GIF with everything you need.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are all the AirTag accessories we know about </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fYC-sV9f26gLYdwC4ya5f937KLY=/821x0:2261x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69159412/airtag_accessories_header_202104.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="afQCgp"&gt;The Apple AirTags &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/20844326/apple-airtags-bluetooth-tracker-keys-tile-features-price"&gt;have finally been announced&lt;/a&gt;, and with them come a ton of accessories to make them easier to use (so much easier than if it had, say, a built-in way to attach it to things). While a small tracking puck could be carried in a bag, there are a variety of other things that you may want to put an AirTag on that require some sort of holder or the judicious use of tape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aibtVD"&gt;These are all the accessories we could find that are either listed for preorder on the maker’s site or have a page on Apple’s store. We don’t have official ship dates for most of them, but it’s probably a safe bet that the ones on the Apple Store will become available when the AirTags do, on April 30th. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zukTwfmRIxQklWUdl7oFS7ls-Ow=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457924/HNPX2.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Belkin’s AirTag holder. Tie it to anything!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pAbwNc"&gt;Belkin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="RWmQC6"&gt;Belkin currently has two offerings, a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FHNPR2ZM%2FA%2Fbelkin-secure-holder-with-key-ring%3Ffnode%3D4a11a0f92a3f82e2bc68e69e973caa245ea296126f6a1dea5da19b97d0d9b65242da69bc60433105cb23b3dcbfae194c6018f7a0e0a92d0ee1a81f4dc9a5d78ffd2ec296ae3f8902c56b9bb67e4de40bd67223cf08e2e2b4ddc7c848f910584ae10043f1f735c80aea4750706def61ce&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;key ring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FHNPX2ZM%2FA%2Fbelkin-secure-holder-with-strap%3Ffnode%3D4a11a0f92a3f82e2bc68e69e973caa245ea296126f6a1dea5da19b97d0d9b65242da69bc60433105cb23b3dcbfae194c6018f7a0e0a92d0ee1a81f4dc9a5d78ffd2ec296ae3f8902c56b9bb67e4de40bd67223cf08e2e2b4ddc7c848f910584ae10043f1f735c80aea4750706def61ce&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a strap&lt;/a&gt;, which both sell for $12.95. Both products have a circular holder for the AirTag and come in white, black, blue, and pink. They’re currently listed as unavailable in Apple’s online store and as “coming soon” on Belkin’s site.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ACO1OVMfOG9bRTqGaMafFuiVKRI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457922/7245bb43_16cd_47d2_9cb4_94bc7f177b9a.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nomad&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I genuinely love this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lTlcNk"&gt;Nomad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="678fYv"&gt;Nomad also offers its take on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fairtags-leather-keychain&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a keychain&lt;/a&gt;, but (characteristically) its version is a leather pouch that encases the AirTag. The company also has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fairtags-glasses-strap&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a glasses strap&lt;/a&gt;, which acts both as a strap to keep your glasses handy and as an AirTag holder in case you manage to misplace them. Both are listed for $39.95 but are marked down to $29.95 if you preorder, which you are able to do now on Nomad’s site.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8DcdqCayePsBxP8zc6ye9XhXgWI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457915/detail_airtags_rugged_armor_01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Spigen&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spigen’s rugged AirTag case. Maybe you could attach it to your rock climbing gear?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XGObNE"&gt;Cyrill / Spigen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IwxThP"&gt;Cyrill is offering a &lt;a href="https://www.cyrill.com/collections/airtag/products/black-airtag?variant=36909671776414"&gt;vegan leather keychain accessory&lt;/a&gt; in two colors, black and “stone” (which is a light gray). It costs $19.99 and seems to be available now. Spigen, Cyrill’s parent company, is also offering its own AirTag cases: a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.spigen.com%2Fcollections%2Fapple-keynote%2Fproducts%2Fairtag-case-valentinus%3Fvariant%3D32709738725423&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;keychain accessory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.spigen.com%2Fcollections%2Fapple-keynote%2Fproducts%2Fairtag-case-rugged-armor%3Fvariant%3D32709737971759&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a ruggedized case&lt;/a&gt; with a hefty clip connector (and what appears to be a bottle opener, though it’s not listed as a feature). Both are $24.99 — the keychain is available to order today, and the rugged case is available for preorder.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the bag charm. I dare you to put it on a Gucci or Louis purse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kuvoxz"&gt;Hermès&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5fM4hd"&gt;Apple has a history with Hermès; the French luxury company made some jaw-droppingly expensive Apple Watch bands. True to form, the Apple Store lists a leather &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMX872AM%2FA%2Fairtag-herm%25C3%25A8s-key-ring%3Ffnode%3D232642819504aebff03bb7470b0ff950ae32a039afe8c3ea48212a87b560e67575c56ed76f20fa27ddcf08f907882b3a96f6c899909050607d95e6733392b73fcf15e79721673bff349549224cd612c4121172d3f147cf7c7dc16820d0044fc0894ea6b618566bf631d4821ab17ecf21&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;key ring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMX8A2AM%2FA%2Fairtag-herm%25C3%25A8s-luggage-tag%3Ffnode%3D232642819504aebff03bb7470b0ff950ae32a039afe8c3ea48212a87b560e67575c56ed76f20fa27ddcf08f907882b3a96f6c899909050607d95e6733392b73fcf15e79721673bff349549224cd612c4121172d3f147cf7c7dc16820d0044fc0894ea6b618566bf631d4821ab17ecf21&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;luggage tag&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMX862AM%2FA%2Fairtag-herm%25C3%25A8s-bag-charm%3Ffnode%3D232642819504aebff03bb7470b0ff950ae32a039afe8c3ea48212a87b560e67575c56ed76f20fa27ddcf08f907882b3a96f6c899909050607d95e6733392b73fcf15e79721673bff349549224cd612c4121172d3f147cf7c7dc16820d0044fc0894ea6b618566bf631d4821ab17ecf21&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;bag charm&lt;/a&gt; made by Hermès — costing $349, $449, and $299 respectively. It is worth noting, though, that the accessories do include an AirTag with a custom “Hermès” engraving, so you can flex while you find. The key ring and bag charm come in orange, brown, and what looks like black but is listed as “bleu indigo.” The luggage tag is currently only shown in brown. Like Belkin’s offerings, they are currently unavailable through the Apple Store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="pqFTWr"&gt;Of course, Apple offers its own first-party accessories.

    <title>Woman detained for protesting Tesla at Shanghai auto show </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L50eoy"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-regulators-summon-tesla-on-quality-issues-11612788928?mod=article_inline"&gt;simmering issue of how Tesla deals with customer complaints in China&lt;/a&gt; came to a boil this week as police detained a woman after she protested at Tesla’s booth at the Auto Shanghai 2021 trade show. The woman was dragged off the show floor after jumping on top of a Tesla Model 3, where she shouted about a brake issue the company has been criticized for with its China-made cars. Tesla has since said it will conduct a self-inspection of its service and operations in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fa1HRq"&gt;The woman, who police referred to only by her surname “Zhang,” according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, was detained for “disrupting public order.” She has protested before about the brake issue, after she was involved in a crash. She is reportedly being held for five days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tL3aHP"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A female Tesla owner climbed on top of a car’s roof at the Tesla booth to protest her car’s brake malfunction at the Shanghai auto show Monday. The booth beefed up its security after the incident. &lt;a href="https://t.co/ct7RmF1agM"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ct7RmF1agM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Global Times (@globaltimesnews) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/globaltimesnews/status/1384021874439462918?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G2VoLj"&gt;Video of Zhang on top of the Tesla went viral on Monday across China’s biggest social networks, and on Twitter, where &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/globaltimesnews/status/1384021874439462918"&gt;state-owned tabloid Global Times shared a clip&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DuEOTL"&gt;Tesla’s China division initially said on Chinese platform Weibo that Zhang had crashed her car because she was speeding, but &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/tesla-china-backlash/"&gt;admitted&lt;/a&gt; it still hasn’t “fulfilled [its] wish” to “win assurance and understanding from consumers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Szdywe"&gt;That response stoked an already fervent reaction to the protest. Another state-owned news outlet, CCTV, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/autoshow-chinese-woman-who-stormed-tesla-display-car-show-detained-5-days-2021-04-20/"&gt;called for an investigation&lt;/a&gt; into the alleged brake problems, while a third, Xinhua, said &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1998869/a-womans-tesla-protest-stole-the-spotlight-at-shanghai-auto-show/"&gt;Tesla showed “no sincerity in solving the problem.”&lt;/a&gt; Government agencies have spoken up, too. The Commission for Political and Legal Affairs of the Communist Party of China Central Committee said on WeChat that Tesla should respect Chinese consumers and comply with local laws and regulations, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-20/tesla-knocks-keep-coming-as-china-chides-over-vehicle-safety?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, while the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said “enterprises should not be arrogant and unreasonable,” according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vAZgbP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tesla’s initial response only stoked the criticism from customers and state agents&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pNhzmi"&gt;The reaction was so intense that Tesla released a second statement Tuesday apologizing for not handling Zhang’s complaints sooner. It also capitulated slightly on the brake issue, saying in the same statement that it will now review its service and operations as a result of the protest and the backlash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dDDRnH"&gt;Tesla has been making cars in China since it opened a new factory outside Shanghai in early 2020 — the first in the country to be wholly-owned by a foreign automaker. While that factory already accounts for a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-19/tesla-china-demand-powers-ahead-with-record-registrations?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;huge part of Tesla’s global sales&lt;/a&gt;, the company has been plagued with complaints about the quality of the cars it makes there. Tesla was rebuked by multiple government agencies earlier this year in China over &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-regulators-summon-tesla-on-quality-issues-11612788928?mod=article_inline"&gt;how it’s handled customer complaints about the quality of its cars&lt;/a&gt;. In response, the company said it “sincerely accepted the guidance of government departments” and that it had “deeply reflected on [its] shortcomings.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r3PIbX"&gt;Tesla’s response to pressure from the Chinese government is a stark response to how it acts in the US, where CEO Elon Musk &lt;a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/tesla-s-tone-with-china-authorities-differs-from-musk-s-in-u-s"&gt;often teases regulators&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple forgot to revolutionize the Magic Mouse’s infamous charging port</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_H3Aff0QEFsuLJU19YnTZ4K1AP8=/231x0:2639x1605/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69159997/Screen_Shot_2021_04_20_at_2.11.38_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the new Magic Mouse colors.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kX4Lxl"&gt;Apple revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394034/apple-new-imac-m1-chip-colors-design-specs-price-release-date"&gt;a redesigned iMac and Magic Keyboard&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22384756/apple-spring-loaded-event-recap-biggest-announcements-airtag-ipad-pro-imac"&gt;its “Spring Loaded” event&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, but didn’t, for some reason, decide to change the Magic Mouse 2’s infamous charging solution. While the mouse will come in new colors to match the new iMacs, Apple confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that its charging port is still on the bottom — meaning that five and a half years after its introduction, Apple still seems to think that the best way to charge the mouse is by flipping it over (rendering it useless) and plugging in a Lightning cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VmjxDi"&gt;The Magic Mouse’s charging situation has long been a bit of a joke — my former colleague Nick Statt equated it to looking like “a beetle with its legs in the air” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/8/9872746/apple-bad-hardware-design-iphone-case-pencil-magic-mouse"&gt;all the way back in December 2015&lt;/a&gt;, and frankly, I’m having a hard time coming up with a better description.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JY7mfNejfVDbX486GvNIzYAolMo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9833361/Apple_Magic_Mouse_Bad_Design_2.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Magic Mouse 2, charging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2oB2Xr"&gt;Why didn’t Apple didn’t take the opportunity to change things up alongside the new iMac and Magic Keyboard? The company made obvious and good improvements to both of those products. Why not tweak the Magic Mouse’s design to have, say, a charging port in the front? That’s how wired / wireless mice have done it for years, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse"&gt;including our favorite gaming mouse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="woB3ta"&gt;There is some hope that Apple is willing to dump bad design, though. The first Apple Pencil had a similarly meme-worthy charging solution that required you to plug it directly into a iPad’s Lightning port, but Apple fixed that years later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/30/18023772/new-apple-pencil-2-2018-ipad-stylus-price-release-date"&gt;with the Apple Pencil 2&lt;/a&gt; by letting it wirelessly charge off the side of iPads that support it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H29froDJmJ7jGd02m_Yr6TsF07M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13358115/Apple_Pencil_Bad_Design.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The old Apple Pencil, charging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="p46ecz"&gt;And Apple finally responded to complaints about the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300891/apple-tv-siri-remote-touchpad-button-design-form-function"&gt;frustratingly finicky&lt;/a&gt; touchpad on the Apple TV’s remote today by unveiling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394196/apple-tv-4k-new-siri-remote-sold-separately-price-buttons"&gt;the new Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt;, which has a scroll wheel and a clickpad. I’m crossing my fingers Apple will update the Magic Mouse next.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will now let you buy an M1 Mac Mini with 10-gigabit networking</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZIff1-czpgmAu09IH-jKzuHA-cU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69159929/cwelch_201114_4292_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z1igo4"&gt;The M1-powered Mac Mini &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmac-mini&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394631%2Fapple-m1-silicon-mac-mini-intel-networking-10gb-ethernet" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;can now be configured&lt;/a&gt; to included 10-gigabit networking, an option that the computer was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;notably missing compared to its Intel-powered counterpart&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/20/apple-silently-updates-m1-mac-mini-with-optional-10-gigabit-ethernet-port/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The update to the 2020 computer seems to have come during Apple’s store update that came with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22384756/apple-spring-loaded-event-recap-biggest-announcements-airtag-ipad-pro-imac"&gt;bigger product announcements today&lt;/a&gt;, including a new iMac and iPad Pros. Adding the faster networking will add $100 to the price of the computer — the same price as if you were to add 10Gbps to the Intel version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="expeBB"&gt;When Apple added the 10Gbps port as an option to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/16/18097117/apple-mac-mini-2018-review-upgrade-faster-more-powerful-features-price"&gt;the Mac Mini in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, it was welcomed by those running home and professional servers, as well as anyone who needed fast network access from a cheaper Mac (like video professionals using network-attached storage). But when Apple introduced a faster version of the computer with its own custom chip, the ability to add networking faster than the standard Gigabit Ethernet was no longer there. If the lack of 10Gb networking took the (as of now) least expensive M1 computer out of the running for you, it’s now an option again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NI1UyM"&gt;You can order the Apple Silicon Mac Mini with faster networking today, but it may be a bit of a wait for the configuration — Apple estimates that I could have a stock M1 Mac Mini shipped to me in two days, but adding the 10Gb ethernet turns that into two weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
