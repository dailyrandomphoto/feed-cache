    <title>OnlyFans’ inexplicable ban on porn might be explained by this BBC investigation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="OnlyFans Photo Illustrations" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Re2FKkGtcXQhnLCLbjcAzeOLFtw=/0x0:3543x2362/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69750958/1232558630.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UkT6uk"&gt;Earlier today, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632797/onlyfans-prohibit-sexually-explicit-content-porn-creators"&gt;OnlyFans stunned the world&lt;/a&gt; by revealing it would ditch the thing it’s famous for: sexually explicit videos and photography. Yes, OnlyFans is banning porn, starting October 1st. But at least one publication wasn’t completely shocked by the decision — because it came in the middle of &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-58255865"&gt;a BBC investigation&lt;/a&gt; into how the video sharing site was &lt;em&gt;knowingly &lt;/em&gt;letting creators slide despite publishing illegal content on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="02U8yR"&gt;Instead of banning an account or sounding the alarm, the company explicitly recommends in a “compliance manual” that moderators should first issue a series of three warnings about why each piece of content has been removed. Unless it’s a successful creator, of course, in which case “accounts with higher numbers of subscribers can be given additional warnings when rules are broken,” the BBC writes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kOOXU0"&gt;Oh, and the site’s most successful creators? Those are handled by a different team, according to the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Vx59DX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More important users were apparently tolerated longer&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DytMjh"&gt;While OnlyFans told the BBC that the leaked “compliance manuals” it obtained are not “official guidance,” the news organization is quick to point out that one of them has the company’s chief operating officer listed as making edits to the document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hpgrh2"&gt;The BBC’s investigation doesn’t end there: it also scoured the site for illegal content, watched videos about exploiting homeless people, spoke to some of OnlyFans’ moderators itself, quoted a US Homeland Security agent about how many child abuse images originate there, and tested to see if OnlyFans would notice if it set up accounts advertising themselves as young teenagers with photos for sale. (OnlyFans didn’t, until the BBC pointed it out.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CtTjFi"&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-58255865"&gt;read the full story here&lt;/a&gt;. It’s damning, and so it wouldn’t wholly be surprising if OnlyFans’ sudden &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628521/onlyfans-app-ios-android-oftv-no-nudity"&gt;pivot to safe-for-work imagery&lt;/a&gt; might have something to do with the intense amount of scrutiny the company saw imminently headed its way. It’s also worth noting the company &lt;a href="https://onlyfans.com/transparency/july2021"&gt;just today rushed out its first transparency report&lt;/a&gt;, which — while claiming “we invest heavily in fighting child sexual exploitation online” — pairs that claim with incredibly few details, and only for the month of July 2021. In July, it contributed a single CSAM hash to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children’s database, and deactivated a grand total of 15 accounts for alleged CSAM activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sg7Lxb"&gt;Onlyfans didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JVaB4i"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ulOIGG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s how much it costs to fix a Z Fold 3 or Z Flip 3 with a broken screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OTDk2waIZmsFLjnEJEzqlkj8r94=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69750869/dseifert_4711_samsung_z_flip_3_4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3KW8h2"&gt;Samsung’s new foldables are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;quite impressive&lt;/a&gt;, and the company has focused on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum"&gt;making them as durable as possible&lt;/a&gt; — but sometimes, accidents happen. We asked Samsung how much it would cost to replace a Z Flip or Z Fold 3’s screen should something happen to it, and here’s what the company told us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eV8jmP"&gt;Samsung provides a &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/support/warranty/?model=N0053854" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one year warranty&lt;/a&gt; with the phones, so if your screen breaks in a way that’s covered, you shouldn’t have to pay for a repair. Out of warranty, fixing the interior folding screen of a Z Fold 3 costs $479. Doing the same for a Z Flip 3 costs $369. Thankfully, the external displays are much less expensive — fixing a broken outer screen will set you back $149 for the Fold and $99 for the Flip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MngxoL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Out of warranty, the Fold’s folding screen costs $479 to replace, and the Flip’s costs $369&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Wh3XmT"&gt;Samsung also offers its Samsung Care Plus subscription, which costs $12.99 a month for either phone (though Samsung is currently running a preorder deal where you don’t have to make Care Plus payments for 12 months). For Care Plus subscribers, Samsung says there’s a $249 charge for an out-of-warranty screen repair — though the company says that the “deductible covers up to three screen repairs per year.” Care Plus also extends your warranty for two more years after the original expires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w2U2HC"&gt;For traditional, non-folding phones, there’s often the option to repair the screen yourself, which can end up costing less than having the manufacturer do it. However, for Samsung’s new foldables, this isn’t likely to be easy. Samsung’s aforementioned push for durability means &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum"&gt;the phones are filled with a lot of sticky, hard to remove stuff&lt;/a&gt; like tape, glue, and goo. The company says the folding screens are made out of multiple layers, which are sealed with a “pressure-sensitive adhesive.” As someone who’s taken apart their share of devices, that sounds like an absolute nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qyTv7z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The repair prices for the new foldables are less than the ones for the older versions&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q5Dhxz"&gt;That said, this isn’t much of a change. It’s not like Samsung’s previous foldables were particularly easy to repair. And while the company’s prices are higher than those for more traditional phone repairs — a broken iPhone 12 screen &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/iphone/repair/service/screen-replacement"&gt;costs $279 to replace&lt;/a&gt;; a Galaxy S21 5G’s costs $199 — Samsung is actually charging less than it used to. &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/support/repair/pricing/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;According to Samsung’s site&lt;/a&gt;, the Z Fold 2’s inner screen costs $549 to replace out of warranty and the Z Flip 5G’s costs $499, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/24/20881040/samsung-galaxy-fold-screen-replacemet-premier-service-cost-unboxing"&gt;depending on when you bought the phone&lt;/a&gt;, you may be eligible for a one-time replacement &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/support/repair/pricing/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for significantly less&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="r7SH13"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How Samsung beefed up its new folding phones: metal, tape, and a dab of goo","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Adobe is acquiring collaborative video software maker Frame.io for $1.275 billion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RCi2X_fsERfUjLnEXvdGJN09N-g=/57x0:1136x719/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69750828/Screen_Shot_2021_08_19_at_4.01.35_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Frame.io&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dkTUp7"&gt;Adobe &lt;a href="https://news.adobe.com/news/news-details/2021/Adobe-to-Acquire-Frame.io/default.aspx"&gt;announced on Thursday&lt;/a&gt; that it’s acquiring the company behind popular &lt;a href="http://frame.io"&gt;collaborative video production software of the same name&lt;/a&gt;, Frame.io, for $1.275 billion. Adobe says it tried to create its own collaboration software on its own, but settled on buying Frame.io because some customers were already using it in their workflows, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-19/adobe-to-buy-frame-io-for-1-3-billion-in-cash-in-video-push?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AgA7wp"&gt;Frame.io takes the frequently time consuming process of reviewing edits and footage, and makes it asynchronous and on the web, Google Workspace-style. Editors, clients, and whoever else can use the company’s cloud-based software to store and view footage, and leave feedback on edits, just by sharing a link. Frame.io also offers integrations with popular video editing software like Adobe’s Premiere Pro, Apple’s Final Cut Pro, and Avid Media Composer. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is no stranger to Frame.io — our video team has been using the software for the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2rKU3k"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tI7AcNfHXeQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yleuqz"&gt;Frame.io will operate independently until Adobe’s deal closes, after which the company’s founders, Frame.io CEO Emery Wells and co-founder John Traver, will join Adobe. Wells will continue to lead the Frame.io team and report directly to Adobe’s chief product office Scott Belsky, Adobe says. &lt;a href="https://blog.frame.io/2021/08/19/adobe-announces-intent-to-acquire-frameio/"&gt;In a statement on the acquisition&lt;/a&gt;, Wells adds “the Frame.io product you know and love is not going anywhere,” and says Adobe’s ownership will offer more resources, and closer integrations with Premiere Pro and Creative Cloud. Frame.io will also continue supporting non-Adobe software like Final Cut Pro, Avid, and DaVinci Resolve, according to Wells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jAYWzY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Adobe’s Creative Cloud might be getting bigger&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NCdwOV"&gt;Not outlined in either announcement is what subscribing to Frame.io will look like in the future once the deal closes. Currently you can &lt;a href="https://www.frame.io/pricing"&gt;use a limited version of Frame.io for free&lt;/a&gt;, or pay $15 per month, $25 per month, or custom enterprise pricing for varying amounts of cloud storage and users. It’s not hard to imagine those plans getting seamlessly integrated into a Creative Cloud subscription at some point in the future. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has asked Adobe if it plans to include Frame.io in its existing subscriptions going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C8ORG9"&gt;Adobe’s made moves to add its own collaboration features into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/23/21075970/adobe-premiere-pro-productions-google-doc-drive-collaborative-editing"&gt;Premiere Pro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274936/adobe-invite-edit-collaborate-photoshop-illustrator-fresco"&gt;Photoshop, and Illustrator&lt;/a&gt; in the past, but nothing that seems quite the same as Frame.io. Buying the company could naturally sweeten the deal for anyone who’s already a Creative Cloud subscriber, while strengthening Adobe’s tight hold on the creative industry as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spawn Together campaign surpasses $1 million fundraising goal for AbleGamers charity</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Steven Spohn wearing a suit, sitting in his wheelchair in front of a backdrop with “The Game Awards” on it. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1nfbmnWT3OKRc2lgOvifV9mQDc8=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69750562/888461160.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5Du9pe"&gt;Steven Spohn passed a goal this week that he’s been chasing for nearly a year. He raised over a million dollars for &lt;a href="https://ablegamers.org"&gt;AbleGamers&lt;/a&gt;, a charity that seeks to improve accessibility in games and connects disabled people with peer support and adaptive tech for gaming. Spohn has been its COO for 15 years.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0MyYKf"&gt;The charity’s mission, he says, is about giving people with disabilities access to “that sense of independence and that feeling of exploration or excitement or relaxation, whatever it is you’re going for, to help you mentally get through the tough times.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eVNYH9"&gt;Spohn has multiple progressive illnesses that impact his functioning. He started the fundraising campaign, Spawn Together, in September of last year to celebrate his 40th birthday. He says he hoped that more funds for AbleGamers would enable it to continue its work as he eventually loses more mobility or the ability to talk or type. “I just want to make sure that when I’m not able to do that stuff, that everything’s gonna keep going as well as it can,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="19yTY9"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Today is my 40th birthday!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For my 39th birthday, I made friends with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheRock?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TheRock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To celebrate this milestone, I'm going to raise $1,000,000 for charity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I'm going to need your help. &lt;a href="https://t.co/bu1t9KKRg1"&gt;pic.twitter.com/bu1t9KKRg1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Steven Spohn (Spawn) (@stevenspohn) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stevenspohn/status/1305905174632857607?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 15, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JCfkQi"&gt;Though Spohn’s goal was a million dollars, he didn’t think he’d actually reach it. “I thought, ‘hey, you know, I’ll raise a couple thousand, maybe $100,000. It’ll be great, we’ll spend some money on hiring a new peer counselor and then we’ll be good,’” he says. “Well, that just kept leading into more and more opportunities.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jwrzgM"&gt;In November, streamer Ben “DrLupo” Lupo announced during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/2/21546694/twitch-virtual-twitchcon-glitchcon-date"&gt;GlitchCon&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/twitch-to-donate-1-million-to-ablegamers-to-help-gamers-with-disabilities"&gt;Twitch was donating $1 million&lt;/a&gt; to AbleGamers. Spohn was ecstatic, but he decided not to count Twitch’s donation toward his personal goal. He wanted to continue gathering smaller amounts at a time through his campaign, rather than only relying on big companies. “I can’t depend on one large corporation to decide to hand over a million bucks every single year,” he says, “there had to be a way to do it where we didn’t have to depend on one CEO saying, ‘you know what, give it to them.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lqVfCv"&gt;Hundreds of streamers helped raise money over the course of the campaign, with Twitch matching donations up to certain amounts. Last week, Kayla “lilsimsie” Sims raised nearly $60,000 during a birthday stream, and Twitch matched $35,000. A few days later, Spohn checked the Spawn Together page and realized the total &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stevenspohn/status/1427324879486046215"&gt;had surpassed the goal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ugy6Tq"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;WE RAISED $95,000 FOR ABLEGAMERS TODAY&lt;/p&gt;— Kayla (@lilsimsie) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lilsimsie/status/1426367677791100937?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dAx9xM"&gt;“I think the most important thing about Spawn Together,” says Spohn, “was trying to prove a point that if people banded together, they could do a good thing, and really move the needle for a cause together by doing tiny good things all at the same time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gb7glV"&gt;Spohn says there’s still plenty of work to do. “I’ve definitely grown up over the year and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;realized that although million dollars is big, it doesn’t leave the organization to run for 20 years on its own.” He says the money will help AbleGamers hire more peer counselors, occupational therapists, and other experts to keep expanding its work.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T TV will officially become DirecTV Stream next week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OinA03PZVPpaBuocoQNiLrsiIA0=/154x0:1690x1024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69750375/Screen_Shot_2021_08_19_at_1.40.11_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: DirecTV&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="x5jZBY"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T TV and its defunct AT&amp;amp;T TV Now sibling will officially become DirecTV Stream, a new unified service spun out of a deal between TPG Capital and AT&amp;amp;T for the telecommunication giant’s streaming properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d221R0"&gt;DirecTV began updating AT&amp;amp;T TV and AT&amp;amp;T TV Now customers of the change on August 14th. On the welcome screens of both services’ mobile apps informing them that the change would officially take place on August 26th, a spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. DirectTV Stream rebrands AT&amp;amp;T’s services acquired in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22608577/att-directv-tpg-deal-u-verse-att-tv-new-company"&gt;TPG Capital deal&lt;/a&gt;, which did not include HBO Max. (WarnerMedia, home to HBO Max, is set to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22448140/warner-bros-discovery-warnermedia-new-name-merger-att"&gt;merge with Discovery&lt;/a&gt; in mid-2022.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AuFsLd"&gt;According to a company &lt;a href="https://www.directv.com/stream/"&gt;news release&lt;/a&gt;, “AT&amp;amp;T satellite, streaming or IP video customers will automatically keep their video service, any bundled wireless, internet or HBO Max services, and associated discounts with no action needed.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pPf9GG"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T TV &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21160860/att-tv-now-available-android-tv-google-assistant-streaming"&gt;launched last year&lt;/a&gt; as the company’s premium TV streaming experience. AT&amp;amp;T TV Now, the company’s skinny streaming bundle, technically &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226881/att-tv-now-streaming-skinny-bundle-cord-cutting-youtube-hulu-fubo"&gt;became AT&amp;amp;T TV&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, and new customers could no longer sign up for Now. (The company &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/at-t-tv-now-is-merging-with-at-t-tv-wait-what-1846043744"&gt;said at the time&lt;/a&gt; that AT&amp;amp;T TV Now customers would still be able to access their accounts, however.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="20dzAE"&gt;If all of this sounds needlessly confusing, it is. With any luck, this will be the last significant branding change that AT&amp;amp;T’s existing or future streaming customers see for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Epic v. Google lawsuit finally makes sense</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iYRBVuShNCOOnz3wVKL8J-JgXL8=/208x0:1828x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69750286/Fortnite_20200615140742.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="55bmIs"&gt;There was never any question what Epic Games wanted when it took Apple to court: the 48-second &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367924/watch-epic-nineteen-eighty-fortnite-short-apple-app-store-ban"&gt;“Nineteen Eighty-Fortnite”&lt;/a&gt; made it clear &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423567/apple-epic-app-store-policies-fortnite-trial-day-4"&gt;App Store hypocrisy&lt;/a&gt; was the agenda. But the justification for a parallel case against Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368363/epic-google-fortnite-lawsuit-antitrust-app-play-store-apple-removal"&gt;wasn’t as clear-cut&lt;/a&gt; until today — it’s only now we’re learning about the most damning accusations against the Android giant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uoZrI0"&gt;On Thursday, Judge James Donato unsealed &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21046008-epic-v-google-unredacted-complaint#document/p37"&gt;a fully unredacted version&lt;/a&gt; of Epic’s original complaint against Google (via &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/leah_nylen/status/1428411904381304845"&gt;Leah Nylen&lt;/a&gt;), and it alleges the company was so worried about Epic setting a precedent by abandoning the Play Store that it unleashed a broad effort to keep developers from following the company’s lead. That included &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632818/google-project-hug-game-developers-play-store-millions-epic-lawsuit-complaint"&gt;straight-up paying top game developers&lt;/a&gt;, including Activision Blizzard to stick around, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632806/google-epic-premier-device-program-lg-motorola-hmd"&gt;sharing additional chunks of its revenue with phone makers&lt;/a&gt; if they agreed not to preinstall any other app stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YE8IbU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Project Hug” and the “Premier Device Program”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9UborJ"&gt;Remember &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632806/google-epic-premier-device-program-lg-motorola-hmd"&gt;when Google allegedly forced OnePlus to break off a deal&lt;/a&gt; that would have seen the Fortnite Launcher preinstalled on phones? LG and Motorola reportedly struck a deal where they got 12 percent of the search revenue from their customers, and up to 6 percent of the money they spent in the Play Store, to be exclusive to Google. OnePlus sister brands Oppo and Vivo were also onboard, with owner BBK committing the vast majority of its phones to the exclusive program. Nokia phone maker HMD Global signed up too, as did Sony, Sharp, Xiaomi, and another unnamed brand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ynzVsv"&gt;If those tactics sound familiar, it might be because &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22568111/google-play-android-samsung-galaxy-store-quash-threatened-app-distribution-antitrust"&gt;36 state attorneys general alleged that Google used the exact same hush-hush deals against Samsung’s Galaxy Store&lt;/a&gt;, in the antitrust lawsuit they filed against Google in July. Google called it “Project Agave,” according to Epic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JpKUBF"&gt;Apparently, Google viewed the so-called “Premier Device Program” as a huge success:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="kuCls9"&gt;In a presentation prepared by and presented to senior Google Play executives, Google noted that in the short time since the beginning of the program, over 200 million new devices were covered. The same presentation shows that Google believed that the new RSAs successfully eliminated the “risk of app developer contagion”; noting that there was “no risk” under the “Current Premier tier”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="pnq2US"&gt;Google even suggested the idea of &lt;em&gt;buying &lt;/em&gt;Epic to remove the threat — going behind Epic’s back and approaching minority owner Tencent, the Chinese tech giant that currently has a 40 percent stake in Epic. The suggestions were “to either (a) buy Epic shares from Tencent to get more control over Epic”, or “(b) join up with Tencent to buy 100% of Epic,” the unredacted complaint reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="93tFmJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s not clear Google actually approached Tencent&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lnUzKk"&gt;And that’s on top of the dealings Google had with Epic directly in July 2018, when Alphabet’s CFO and other senior Google executives reportedly offered up to $208 million in “special benefits” over three years to bring &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; to Google Play — in what would effectively be Google taking 25 percent of the game’s revenue instead of the standard 30 percent. Google allegedly tried to convince Epic to take the deal by pointing out the “frankly abysmal” 15+ step process gamers would have to endure to sideload &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NLxov6"&gt;Intriguingly, that would have been the month &lt;em&gt;before &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/3/17645982/epic-games-fortnite-android-version-bypass-google-play-store"&gt;Epic announced it would ditch the Play Store&lt;/a&gt;. That suggests Google had early access to Epic’s sideloading plans, despite CEO Tim Sweeney’s February 2018 instructions to his team to “SAY NOTHING TILL IT SHIPS”:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6YTWJSsyzdTIREOfuuhHNrU-WCw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22793574/say_nothing_till_it_ships.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QSOkbv"&gt;It also suggests Google, not Epic, might have been the one originally offering special deals. A year later, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/9/21003553/google-play-store-fortnite-epic-games-30-percent-cut-dispute"&gt;Epic had to defend the idea&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt; was the one asking for a “special billing exception,” a sequence of events that appears to have thwarted Epic’s original plans — if you read item #38 in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;my big story about the best emails from the Epic v. Apple trial&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll see Epic was planning to spring a legal trap for Google long before Apple became the primary target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YkpqoC"&gt;Why was Google running so scared that it allegedly resorted to these tactics? Apparently, it believed billions of dollars were at stake. According to Epic’s assessment, Google thought Epic had created a “contagion risk” that would spread to other game developers too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="f4hGE1"&gt;In particular, documents that Google’s Finance Director for Platforms and Ecosystems prepared for the CFO of Alphabet around the time of Fortnite’s launch on Android showed that Google feared what it termed a “contagion risk” resulting from more and more app developers forgoing Google Play. Google feared that the “contagion” would spread in this way: first, inspired by Epic’s example, “[p]owerful developers” such as “Blizzard, Valve, Sony, Nintendo”—creators of some of the most popular and profitable entertainment—would be “able to go on their own”, bypassing Play by directly distributing their own apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t6OXzz"&gt;Then, other “[m]ajor developers”, including Electronic Arts, King, Supercell and Ubisoft, will choose to “colaunch off Play”, collaborating to forego Google’s distribution services as well. And finally, Google even identified a risk that “[a]ll remaining titles [will] co-launch off Play”. Google calculated the total at-risk revenue from the threatened loss of market share in Android app distribution to be $3.6B, with the probability-weighted loss “conservative[ly]” estimated at $550M through 2021. Google also recognized that the “[r]ecent Fortnite + Samsung partnership further amplifies risk &amp;amp; urgency of problem” facing its monopoly position in Android app distribution. Google was determined not to let this happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="BlWnW6"&gt;“Epic’s partnership with Samsung and determination to bypass Google Play for distribution of Fortnite struck fear into senior Google executives,” Epic wrote, adding that Google saw it stood to lose up to $6B in revenue by 2022 alone, if Samsung, Amazon and other app stores were able to peel off game developers from Google Play.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A Google presentation looking back at 2018 mentions “Hug” incentives for game developers to keep them from “going it alone”." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D13nRLOKrrBTyDTqOCPgg5bEcHI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22793540/epic_google_hug.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;A Google presentation looking back at 2018 mentions “Hug” incentives for game developers to keep them from “going it alone”.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6pfH35"&gt;Epic’s unredacted complaint might also explain some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;other tidbits we spotted in filings too&lt;/a&gt;, like Epic CEO Tim Sweeney’s cryptic assurance to Samsung’s DJ Koh that “You have my assurance Epic will support Samsung 100% in any battle with Google” (#32), or the reason Epic included &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21046076-google-struggling-in-gaming-2019-dx-5326_redacted"&gt;an entire presentation in evidence&lt;/a&gt; about how Google felt it might be struggling in gaming. You can see a very relevant slide from that above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFUupB"&gt;It’s not clear Epic was ever going to succeed with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on phones the way it succeeded with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;on consoles: as I discuss in the final section of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;the Epic v. Apple emails story&lt;/a&gt;, mobile is a tiny fraction of the company’s business and likely not the preferred place to play — more of a gateway drug than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qDu4RU"&gt;But it sounds like Google certainly didn’t help Epic’s chances there, and it’s impossible to say how much more popular &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Mobile&lt;/em&gt; might have been if Epic never challenged the standard app store toll or had an easier time establishing its own store. &lt;a href="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/21044001-2020-march-fortnite-mobile-biz-update-vs-consoles-w-exact-numbers-huawei-restrictions-damn-android-numbers-are-low/#document/p2"&gt;The documents show&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; was exceptionally anemic on Android, even while competitors like &lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; were blowing up around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qD2laT"&gt;It also shows Google trying to quietly build the kind of walled garden that Apple has explicitly aimed for from the beginning. The company was allegedly locking down phone manufacturers with elaborate contracts, directly appealing to software developers to keep them on the Play store, and treating any alternative software channel as an existential threat — all of which makes an antitrust lawsuit against the more open of the two major mobile operating systems much more plausible.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SpaceX’s lunar lander contract on hold again pending Blue Origin’s lawsuit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tesla Gigafactory - Elon Musk" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/du-Giw-V26KVUFL4JzpuFj3_Svc=/0x171:4978x3490/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69750284/1234657348.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Patrick Pleul/picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y2LRlq"&gt;SpaceX’s $3 billion contract to build a lunar lander for NASA was put on hold for a second time on Thursday after Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin sued over the award, according to court filings. NASA voluntarily agreed to temporarily suspend the contract until November 1st while the US Court of Federal Claims, where Blue Origin filed suit last week, adjudicates the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUqLbu"&gt;Blue Origin had asked the court to grant a pause on SpaceX’s contract while the litigation plays out, according to a person familiar with the company’s sealed filings. NASA, eager to land astronauts on the Moon around 2024, agreed to halt SpaceX’s contract on the condition that all parties agreed to “an expedited litigation schedule that concludes on Nov. 1,” a spokesperson for the agency said. “NASA officials are continuing to work with the Department of Justice to review the details of the case and look forward to a timely resolution of this matter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gJeq9y"&gt;Oral arguments are set for October 14th, the judge said. SpaceX had intervened in the lawsuit earlier this week to “ensure that the court has a complete and accurate picture” of the protest, the company told the judge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FEILUa"&gt;Blue Origin &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22623022/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-sue-nasa-lawsuit-hls-lunar-lander"&gt;sued NASA last week&lt;/a&gt; over the agency’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387887/elon-musk-spacex-win-nasa-lunar-lander-contract-artemis"&gt;April decision to pick only SpaceX’s Starship&lt;/a&gt; rocket system for the agency’s first human lunar landing system since 1972. NASA had said it could pick up to two companies for the award, but opted for one after getting less funding from Congress than it requested. Blue Origin lodged a sealed complaint with the court weeks after its initial protest was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602082/nasa-gao-spacex-blue-origin-dynetics-lunar-lander"&gt;rejected by the Government Accountability Office&lt;/a&gt;. That protest, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404528/nasa-bezo-blue-origin-protest-spacex-contract"&gt;filed in April&lt;/a&gt;, put SpaceX’s lunar lander contract &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22412771/nasa-spacex-hls-moon-lander-blue-origin-protest"&gt;on hold&lt;/a&gt; for 95 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pBxel8"&gt;The decision to give the contract to Elon Musk’s SpaceX over proposals from Blue Origin and Dynetics, unleashed a campaign from Blue Origin to publicly cast SpaceX’s Starship system as unsafe and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22457893/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-nasa-spacex-senate-competition-bill-nasa-moon-lander"&gt;lobby Congress for more NASA funding&lt;/a&gt; that could convince the agency to pick a second company. Blue Origin’s unsuccessful protest at the GAO alleged NASA ran afoul of contracting law and claimed the agency should’ve canceled or changed the terms of the program when it learned it wouldn’t have had enough money to fund two separate contracts. It also said NASA unfairly negotiated the terms of SpaceX’s proposal before making its award, without giving the same opportunities to Blue Origin and Dynetics. The GAO rejected both arguments and backed NASA’s decision as lawful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2wbEb3"&gt;Despite the delays triggered by Blue Origin’s protests, SpaceX has made swift progress on its Starship system and has moved the program along using mostly private funds. The first Starship prototype bound for orbit — a key development milestone for SpaceX — should be ready for launch “in a few weeks,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1426715232475533319?s=20"&gt;Musk tweeted on August 14th.&lt;/a&gt; But the rocket can’t launch until the Federal Aviation Administration finishes a lengthy environmental review of SpaceX’s launch site in Boca Chica, Texas, the company’s central Starship hub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zc2r5X"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 19th, 7PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adds statement from a NASA spokesperson.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

On November 11th, exactly 10 years after its original launch date, the game is getting a free next-gen upgrade that will be available to all owners of &lt;em&gt;Skyrim Special Edition&lt;/em&gt;. And that’s not all — Bethesda is going to add three free pieces of Creation Club content to the game for all &lt;em&gt;Special Edition&lt;/em&gt; owners, including the ability to go fishing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nmn1NK"&gt;Bethesda is also releasing &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; edition of the game on November 11th, which is aptly named the &lt;em&gt;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition. &lt;/em&gt;This version includes everything in &lt;em&gt;Special Edition&lt;/em&gt;, the three free pieces of Creation Club content, and “over 500 pieces of unique content from Creation Club,” including quests, weapons, and more. If you already own &lt;em&gt;Special Edition &lt;/em&gt;or play the game on Xbox Game Pass, Bethesda will let you purchase an upgrade to &lt;em&gt;Anniversary Edition&lt;/em&gt;, but hasn’t detailed the price. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Skyrim Anniversary Edition&lt;em&gt; will be released on November 11th.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dQepC9"&gt;With the upcoming next-gen upgrade, &lt;em&gt;Skyrim&lt;/em&gt; will have been ported across three entire console generations. Bethesda has also released a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/15/16771826/fallout-doom-skyrim-virtual-reality-reviews"&gt;VR port&lt;/a&gt; and, perhaps most famously, a port for Amazon’s Alexa assistant called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/10/17447608/bethesda-e3-2018-skyrim-alexa-key"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skyrim: Very Special Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter makes small changes to direct messages </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2WF13pHjAoE7dD5i1Ob-i_cW2TM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69750176/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Twitter is making some small updates to its direct messages | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6Q2Xw4"&gt;Twitter on Thursday said it’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1428408769835421701?s=20"&gt;introducing several new updates &lt;/a&gt;to its direct messages, which will roll out to some users in the next few weeks. The changes include the ability to send a direct message to multiple people in separate conversations because who among us has not accidentally started a group chat that way. Now, you can share a tweet in up to 20 separate DM conversations, if the goss is hot enough to share with that many individual tweeters at once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rAt1D0"&gt;The feature is coming to the iOS and web versions of Twitter first, and Android “soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tnfQlk"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;No more (awkward) accidental group chats when you DM a Tweet to multiple people. Now you can share the same Tweet in up to 20 different DM convos, separately.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rolling out on iOS and web, and soon on Android. (2/5) &lt;a href="https://t.co/oHYseF3EJE"&gt;pic.twitter.com/oHYseF3EJE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1428408781239504898?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u7ITNh"&gt;For iOS users, Twitter is tweaking DM timestamps; now instead of stamping each message within a DM conversation with the date and time, the&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1428408787245928453?s=20"&gt; messages will be grouped by day&lt;/a&gt;. This will reduce “timestamp clutter,” Twitter says. And, iOS users will soon be able to access the “add reaction” buttons not only by double-tapping but by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1428408786126057484?s=20"&gt;long-pressing on a message&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xqzy3R"&gt;Android users, sorry, but you’ll be waiting to access those last two features, although you will get the ability along with iOS users to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1428408784981004290?s=20"&gt;quick-scroll through a DM conversation&lt;/a&gt; and return to the most recent message by pressing a down-arrow button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RpiLY6"&gt;Twitter has added many new features in the past several months, including a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629097/twitter-misinformation-health-covid19-reporting-feature-white-house"&gt;new process to report COVID misinformation&lt;/a&gt;, an update to its API to make it easier for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22631036/twitter-spaces-developers-api-v2"&gt;other apps to point to its Spaces&lt;/a&gt; audio chats, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620438/twitter-changes-font-chirp-design-icon"&gt;change to its font&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to the new DM features, on Thursday Twitter also announced it was testing a feature that would make it easier for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632414/twitter-newsletter-subscription-button-revue-profile"&gt;users to subscribe to Twitter users’ Revue newsletters &lt;/a&gt;directly from a Twitter profile. That’s rolling out to web and Android users to start. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vzl7RT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Policy groups request Apple abandon plans to scan devices for child abuse imagery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OSXBPBTPSMgp9m4g8l2fX1ML5tw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69749739/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Policy groups have asked Apple to abandon plans to scan iPhones for images of abuse | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SwiiC4"&gt;An international coalition of policy and civil rights groups published an open letter Thursday asking Apple to “abandon its recently announced plans to build surveillance capabilities into iPhones, iPads and other Apple products.” The groups include the American Civil Liberties Union, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Access Now, Privacy International, and the Tor Project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5UopXV"&gt;Earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611721/apple-csam-child-abuse-scanning-hash-system-ncmec"&gt;Apple announced its plans &lt;/a&gt;to use new tech within iOS to detect potential child abuse imagery with the goal of limiting the spread of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) online. Apple also announced a new “communication safety” feature, which will use on-device machine learning to identify and blur sexually explicit images received by children in its Messages app. Parents of children age 12 and younger can be notified if the child views or sends such an image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H8Vimb"&gt;“Though these capabilities are intended to protect children and to reduce the spread of child sexual abuse material, we are concerned that they will be used to censor protected speech, threaten the privacy and security of people around the world, and have disastrous consequences for many children,” the groups wrote in &lt;a href="https://cdt.org/insights/international-coalition-calls-on-apple-to-abandon-plan-to-build-surveillance-capabilities-into-iphones-ipads-and-other-products"&gt;the letter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CYhVGE"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fchild-safety%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F19%2F22632722%2Fapple-child-abuse-scan-ios-abandon-request-privacy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new “Child Safety” page&lt;/a&gt; details the plans, which call for on-device scanning before an image is backed up in iCloud. The scanning does not occur until a file is being backed up to iCloud, and Apple says it only receives data about a match if the cryptographic vouchers (uploaded to iCloud along with the image) for an account meet a threshold of matching known CSAM. Apple and other cloud email providers have used hash systems to scan for CSAM sent via email, but the new program would apply the same scans to images stored in iCloud, even if the user never shares or sends them to anyone else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="g4EOs7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s controversial new child protection features, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="RJIEhX"&gt;In response to concerns about how the technology might be misused, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616381/apple-child-sexual-abuse-material-scanning-icloud-faq-pushback-privacy"&gt;Apple followed up by saying&lt;/a&gt; it would limit its use to detecting CSAM “and we will not accede to any government’s request to expand it,” the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dBqYM0"&gt;Much of the pushback against the new measures has been focused on the device-scanning feature, but the civil rights and privacy groups said the plan to blur nudity in children’s iMessages could potentially put children in danger and will break iMessage’s end-to-end encryption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zKP6zM"&gt;“Once this backdoor feature is built in, governments could compel Apple to extend notification to other accounts, and to detect images that are objectionable for reasons other than being sexually explicit,” the letter states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xvN7IH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
