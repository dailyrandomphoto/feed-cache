    <title>REvil ransomware attacks systems using Kaseya’s remote IT management software</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ncWJdH"&gt;Just in time to ruin the holiday weekend, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22545675/ransomware-cryptocurrency-regulation-hacks"&gt;ransomware attackers&lt;/a&gt; have apparently used Kaseya — a software platform designed to help manage IT services remotely — to deliver their payload. Sophos director and ethical hacker Mark Loman &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markloman/status/1411035534554808331"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; about the attack earlier today, and now reports that affected systems will demand $44,999 to be unlocked. A note on Kaseya’s website implores customers to shut off their VSA servers for now “because one of the first things the attacker does is shutoff administrative access to the VSA.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iiPDUk"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;News Flash: cybercriminals are a$$holes.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keep all the Incident Response teams in mind this holiday weekend as they're in the thick of it...again.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you use Kaseya VSA, shut it down *now* until told to reactivate and initiate IR. Here's the binary: &lt;a href="https://t.co/NIuGJZW84p"&gt;https://t.co/NIuGJZW84p&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/GSXPlOPjFt"&gt;https://t.co/GSXPlOPjFt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Chris Krebs (@C_C_Krebs) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/C_C_Krebs/status/1411046946349924359?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p2vfPv"&gt;According to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-hits-200-companies-in-msp-supply-chain-attack/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the attack targeted six large MSPs and has encrypted data for as many as 200 companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0xaRdz"&gt;At &lt;a href="https://doublepulsar.com/kaseya-supply-chain-attack-delivers-mass-ransomware-event-to-us-companies-76e4ec6ec64b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;DoublePulsar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Kevin Beaumont has posted more details about how the attack seems to work, with REvil ransomware arriving via a Kaseya update and using the platform’s administrative privileges to infect systems. Once the Managed Service Providers are infected, their systems can attack the clients that they provide remote IT services for (network management, system updates, and backups, among other things).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sHOwjZ"&gt;In a statement, Kaseya told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that “We are investigating a potential attack against the VSA that indicates to have been limited to a small number of our on-premises customers only.” A notice claims that all of its cloud servers are now in “maintenance mode,” a move that the spokesperson said is being taken due to an “abundance of caution.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="j6JBdm"&gt;We are investigating a potential attack against the VSA that indicates to have been limited to a small number of our on-premises customers only. We have proactively shut down our SaaS servers out of an abundance of caution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nTR6ZQ"&gt;We are in the process of investigating the root cause of the incident with the utmost vigilance, we have: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SF9JKd"&gt;a.		Notified all of our on-premise customers to immediately shutdown their VSA servers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YmjRSH"&gt;b.		Shutdown our SaaS Servers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fH2C5b"&gt;We have been further notified by a few security firms of the issue and we are working closely with them as well. While we continue to investigate the incident, we will update our customers (and interested parties) as we have more information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0NY8bG"&gt;Dana Liedholm - SVP, Corporate Communications Kaseya&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4kS3K"&gt;Today’s attack has been linked to the notorious REvil ransomware gang (already linked to attacks on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/20/22341642/acer-ransomware-microsoft-exchange-revil-security"&gt;Acer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466003/jbs-cyberattack-fbi-revil-sodinokibi-criminal-group"&gt;meat supplier JBS&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year), and &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/revil-ransomware-executes-supply-chain-attack-via-malicious-kaseya-update/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Record&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; notes that, collecting incidents under more than one name, this may be the third time Kaseya software has been a vector for their exploits.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony makes clear it will still sell PSP games on the PS3 and Vita stores</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="psp 3000 stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nEoRAqrBwVN4CkG490I9gt2x-E4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69536044/DSCF5387.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qXCone"&gt;In March, Sony received widespread backlash for announcing plans &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356791/sony-playstation-store-close-ps3-vita-psp-game-downloads"&gt;to shut down the PS3 and Vita stores&lt;/a&gt; and remove the ability to purchase PSP games from both storefronts. The criticism led Sony to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22392126/sony-ps3-ps-vita-stores-open-backtrack-psp-july-2nd-mistake"&gt;reverse course in part&lt;/a&gt;, promising to keep the PS3 and Vita stores open, but the company stayed committed to ending “PSP commerce functionality” on July 2nd. While it was unclear exactly what that meant at the time, Sony has shed a little more light on the situation: you’ll still be able to buy new PSP games on the PS3 and Vita stores, but you won’t be able to buy new DLC, according to the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/support/important-notice/"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/important-notice/"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; support pages (&lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-will-keep-selling-psp-games-after-all-1847215665"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;).&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AmFeqe"&gt;Here are the three new updates Sony made to clarify things, including that it will remove the ability to make searches or download DLC from the PSP store on July 6th:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="sCQXRe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does this mean for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2pvwCi"&gt;When the PlayStation®Store for PlayStation®Portable (PSP) was previously closed in 2016, you were still able to perform searches and make in-game purchases. Starting July 6th, 2021, you’ll no longer be able to perform searches or make in-game purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bNVTXp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about PSP content that you already own?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wEGwlE"&gt;You’ll still be able to download your previously purchased PSP content. You can download your previously purchased PSP content onto your PSP by accessing the Download List on the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9vFHuc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about PSP content that is available for purchase on the PS3 and PS Vita stores?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dm4Ais"&gt;You’ll still be able to purchase and play PSP content that is available on the PS3 and PS Vita stores. However, you’ll no longer be able to make purchases via the in-game store for PSP content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xwKtyB"&gt;All of this naturally only applies to games that were sold digitally, but it helps preserve some of the PSP’s history and back catalog, since &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwignZaFjsXxAhVsnWoFHaGcAf4QFnoECAUQAw&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygon.com%2F2016%2F2%2F29%2F11135200%2Fsony-shutting-down-psp-store&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw24MH2mb4ltvPAMcI99Hq-D"&gt;the native PSP storefront shutdown in 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ekYN5"&gt;In comparison to Microsoft, which uses backwards compatibility across multiple generations as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21150594/microsoft-xbox-series-x-backwards-compatibility-support-smart-delivery"&gt;major selling point for the Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;, playing older games on Sony’s consoles can often be a bit more complicated than just popping in an old disc. The Playstation 5 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21509379/sony-ps5-backward-compatibility-ps4-games-support-features"&gt;currently plays most Playstation 4 games&lt;/a&gt;, but if you want to play games from older generations on Sony’s newest console, you’ll need to pony up for a Playstation Now subscription, which lets you play Playstation 3 and Playstation 2 games streamed from the cloud, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22150718/demons-souls-remake-ps5-playstation-5-sony-game-of-the-year-2020"&gt;buy full price remakes of the classics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VJBxut"&gt;For the PSP, there’s still a feasible way to buy games for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/4/20991654/psp-vita-portable-playstation-console-sony-25-anniversary"&gt;the beloved handheld&lt;/a&gt;, at least for now — even it means purchasing the games from one of two stores on entirely different hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Another day, another WD security flaw</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wdUGFo9tjQf9jyb0TmO1dix6reE=/378x43:2522x1472/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69536032/Screen_Shot_2021_07_02_at_12.59.46_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: WD&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8nTzMb"&gt;After a security vulnerability led to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549677/wd-my-book-live-data-deletion-unplug-lan-cable-threat-actor"&gt;some WD NAS owners having their data wiped&lt;/a&gt;, a new vulnerability has been discovered in more of WD’s devices (&lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/07/another-0-day-looms-for-many-western-digital-users/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;KrebsOnSecurity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The vulnerability, discovered by security researchers Pedro Ribeiro and Radek Domanski, is seemingly present on Cloud OS 3 devices and not on the newer Cloud OS 5, which WD recently released as an update. The problem is that, according to Ribeiro and Domanski, many of WD’s users don’t like the new version. That’s because it’s missing certain functions and features &lt;a href="https://support-en.wd.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/29389"&gt;that were available in Cloud OS 3&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.westerndigital.com%2Fsupport%2Fproductsecurity%2Fwdc-21004-recommended-upgrade-to-mycloud-os-5&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F2%2F22561140%2Fwd-cloud-os-3-security-flaw-update-patch-disconnect" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;WD has said&lt;/a&gt; it won’t be updating Cloud OS 3 with security patches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0PG4dA"&gt;There’s also the possibility that some users won’t be able to upgrade to Cloud OS 5. According to &lt;a href="https://support-en.wd.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/29230"&gt;WD’s supported devices page&lt;/a&gt;, the updated software isn’t available for the MyCloud EX2, EX4, or certain versions of the My Cloud and My Cloud Mirror. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YJ6vWe"&gt;If you own a device that can’t be updated to Cloud OS 5, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.westerndigital.com%2Fsupport%2Fproductsecurity%2Fwdc-21004-recommended-upgrade-to-mycloud-os-5&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F2%2F22561140%2Fwd-cloud-os-3-security-flaw-update-patch-disconnect" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;WD’s advice&lt;/a&gt; is to upgrade to one that can. The other option, according to a statement WD &lt;a href="https://www.comparitech.com/blog/information-security/security-vulnerabilities-80000-devices-update-now/"&gt;gave to &lt;em&gt;Comparitech&lt;/em&gt; last year&lt;/a&gt;, is to turn off remote dashboard access to the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ANtXb5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A hacker could potentially brick your NAS&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gLRCMV"&gt;The researchers found that they could get into a Cloud OS 3 device by remotely updating it with modified firmware. The firmware update functionality is meant to be accessible only to authenticated users, but they were able to get around that because the NAS seemingly has a user on it with a blank password, which they were able to use to authenticate in some cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TYPj6A"&gt;Their version of the exploit allows them to carry out commands on the NAS, but other versions could be used for any number of nefarious purposes. Also, because the hack exploits the firmware update function, a hacker could purposefully or even accidentally brick the device. The researchers have built their own custom security patch, but it has to be re-applied to the device every time it reboots. You can see more details about it in a video they made explaining the exploit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EcVbtb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vsg9YgvGBec?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CCVqTf"&gt;While the vulnerability found by the researchers seems especially egregious, it may not be the only one out there — &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.westerndigital.com%2Fsupport%2Fproductsecurity%2Fwdc-21004-recommended-upgrade-to-mycloud-os-5&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F2%2F22561140%2Fwd-cloud-os-3-security-flaw-update-patch-disconnect" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;WD’s post&lt;/a&gt; recommending people upgrade to Cloud OS 5 says that it defends against entire classes of attacks. With that in mind, if you own a device that can’t run the new OS, it’s probably time to think about an upgrade, either to one of WD’s new devices, or to another NAS option.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peacock premier tiers will stream the 2021 Stanley Cup games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KWIS8Zg-T-kOOUnLI6Enhl9s4NQ=/49x0:951x601/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69535991/peacock.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ylF484"&gt;NBCUniversal’s streaming service Peacock will stream every remaining 2021 Stanley Cup Final match, just as the service’s parent company will stream the games on broadcast NBC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7po7Ii"&gt;The service &lt;a href="https://viewer.mediafly.com/mediavillage/interactive/2929fed4187b40648b79a9839e70e91fproduct169208/index.html#/brand/ddfffeac-5bfe-497f-9bfb-d359535d0079/press-releases/75874562-4b64-4c7a-a695-acbd99021cdb"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; this week that the matches would kick off with a stream of Game 3 between the Tampa Bay Lightning and Montreal Canadiens. The streaming coverage will cover up to five games and will be available through Peacock’s premium tiers, which cost $5 per month with ads or $10 per month to go ad-free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TNtZCA"&gt;The announcement marks a noticeable push by NBCUniversal to round out the sports programming on its marquee streaming service. In addition to coverage of Tour de France and Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics, among other sporting events, the service is also the exclusive home of WWE Network events, including the forthcoming SummerSlam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TnHXEw"&gt;Peacock may be the scrappy little guy in the room, but it’s sure offering a lot more niche sports coverage than many of its contemporaries. Your move, Paramount Plus.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Qualcomm CEO sees former Apple execs as key to beating M1</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M0mltVZY3kM-rUP2rOcALXXWqBM=/26x0:455x286/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69535459/ca_mwc.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Qualcomm&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7p0LX3"&gt;Qualcomm’s new CEO, Cristiano Amon, has big plans for competing with Apple when it comes to laptop performance, thanks to the ex-Apple employees Qualcomm brought on when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22229497/qualcomm-apple-nuvia-acquisition-cpu-chip-design-data-center"&gt;it acquired Nuvia earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. He &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-ceo-focus-idUSKCN2E75QY"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that he believes Qualcomm could make the world’s best processor, which would require designing a chip better than Apple’s M1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvbyn8"&gt;Before assuming his new role as CEO, Amon was head of Qualcomm’s semiconductor division and was in charge of the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22229497/qualcomm-apple-nuvia-acquisition-cpu-chip-design-data-center"&gt;acquisition of Nuvia for $1.4 billion&lt;/a&gt;. The startup was founded by three former Apple engineers who specialized in chip design and worked on Apple’s A-series SOCs. Those founders joined Qualcomm, and it’s apparent now that they’ll be focusing on making chips for consumer computers (though the company wouldn’t turn down the chance to license its tech to data centers, according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;). Qualcomm hopes to start selling Arm laptop chips, powered by Nuvia’s designs, next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jm3rlX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple hasn’t added 5G, or any cellular compatibility at all, to its M1 Macs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="soFLVj"&gt;Amon also hopes to use the company’s experience in making 5G chips and smartphone processors to help provide a better laptop experience, by building 5G connectivity into its laptop-focused CPUs. Adding 5G, or any cellular compatibility at all, is something that Apple hasn’t done yet for its M1 Macs, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/macbook-air-and-pro-with-m1-opens-the-door-to-5g-it-cant-come-soon-enough/"&gt;despite demand from some&lt;/a&gt; (though it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22385675/apple-ipad-pro-m1-chip-specs-features-price"&gt;M1-powered iPad Pro has a 5G option&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NehvPD"&gt;It’s safe to say that if Qualcomm wants to become a dominant player in powering laptops like it is in the smartphone market, it has a lot of work to do. While Microsoft does use Qualcomm-designed chips &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496677/microsoft-surface-pro-x-refresh-sq2-processor-new-platinum-color-option"&gt;in its Surface Pro X&lt;/a&gt; (which made an appearance at the Windows 11 event), the list of &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/mobile-computing/mobile-pcs"&gt;Windows PCs with Qualcomm inside&lt;/a&gt; isn’t a long one. It’s also unlikely that Intel is planning on just letting Arm take over the laptop space without a fight — the &lt;a href="https://www.extremetech.com/computing/313803-intel-makes-it-official-hybrid-cpu-cores-arrive-with-alder-lake"&gt;company is working on hybrid CPUs&lt;/a&gt; that, like Arm, mix high-power and efficiency-focused cores to provide better battery life, but using an x86 architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxBCE8"&gt;Amon &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-ceo-focus-idUSKCN2E75QY"&gt;also talked to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about challenges and opportunities the company faces due to sanctions in China and about the company’s struggles to become a household name like Intel or AMD.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lordstown Motors is now being investigated by the Justice Department</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RKpJHzbiCZ39IV6h6FcUidSJMcU=/375x0:1125x500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69535245/lordstown_news_antvm.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MMpocp"&gt;The Department of Justice has opened an investigation into troubled electric vehicle startup Lordstown Motors, which is backed by General Motors and went public late last year but has yet to get its pickup — the Endurance — into production, according to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;. It’s the second official probe into the startup, as the Securities and Exchange Commission &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336751/lordstown-motors-sec-inquiry-review-hindenburg-investigation-orders"&gt;opened an investigation earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; into Lordstown Motors executives’ misleading claims about how many preorders it had logged for the Endurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SHzchr"&gt;The new investigation, which is being run by the US Attorney’s office in the Southern District of New York, comes just weeks after Lordstown Motors’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532976/lordstown-motors-ceo-steve-burns-resign-short-seller-investigation"&gt;CEO and founder was pushed out&lt;/a&gt; following a law firm’s probe into those misleading claims. The startup’s chief financial officer and other executives and personnel close to the founder were also let go at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pifWiw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Newly public EV startups are suddenly under intense scrutiny&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KhjKvw"&gt;“Lordstown Motors is committed to cooperating with any regulatory or governmental investigations and inquiries,” a representative for the startup said in a statement. “We look forward to closing this chapter so that our new leadership – and entire dedicated team – can focus solely on producing the first and best full-size all-electric pickup truck, the Lordstown Endurance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cL8LLK"&gt;It’s unclear exactly what the Justice Department is examining, though SDNY often focuses on financial crimes and allegations of fraud. The DOJ is also investigating electric trucking startup Nikola, and the SEC has opened &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22441025/canoo-sec-investigation-spac-merger-projections"&gt;a probe into fellow EV startup Canoo&lt;/a&gt;. The press office for the SDNY did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xsVnYI"&gt;Steve Burns, the founder, started Lordstown Motors in 2019 after leaving his previous startup, another electric vehicle company called Workhorse. He essentially founded Lordstown Motors in order to buy a recently shuttered plant in Lordstown, Ohio where GM once built the Chevy Cruze. GM also took a stake in the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JTrMB0"&gt;The purchase — and the startup itself — received praise from the Trump administration. Then-President Donald Trump &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/8/20954956/gm-lordstown-motors-factory-workhorse-electric-vehicles-trump-ev"&gt;said Lordstown Motors buying the factory&lt;/a&gt; was “GREAT NEWS” for the state, and later featured the startup at a White House event. Former Vice President Mike Pence even appeared at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21302966/lordstown-motors-electric-pickup-truck-ev-endurance-unveiling-pence"&gt;the Endurance reveal event&lt;/a&gt; in June 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XQrnvs"&gt;Buying the GM factory was supposed to give Lordstown Motors an edge over other startups that are building their own factories. Burns also found one with the truck, too, as he licensed intellectual property for an electric pickup that Workhorse had developed but never put into production — a deal worth millions of dollars for his former company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KtZYGm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"GM sells Lordstown factory to the offshoot of a struggling EV startup","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/8/20954956/gm-lordstown-motors-factory-workhorse-electric-vehicles-trump-ev"},{"title":"GM-backed startup Lordstown Motors accused of faking preorders","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22327207/general-motors-lordstown-hindenburg-short-electric-truck-orders"},{"title":"Lordstown Motors probed by SEC for allegedly misleading investors","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336751/lordstown-motors-sec-inquiry-review-hindenburg-investigation-orders"},{"title":"Lordstown Motors CEO resigns after investigation into preorders","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532976/lordstown-motors-ceo-steve-burns-resign-short-seller-investigation"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wlBu5u"&gt;In 2020, Lordstown Motors was one of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453051/ev-startup-spac-lordstown-lucid-canoo-faraday-fisker"&gt;number of electric vehicle startups&lt;/a&gt; that went public by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352433/gm-lordstown-motors-electric-truck-startup-public-merger-spac"&gt;merging with a special purpose acquisition company&lt;/a&gt;, a process that helped it raise $675 million. Afterward, Burns and the company touted that they had logged around 100,000 preorders for the Endurance in late 2020 and early 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1paEuS"&gt;But in March, short-selling research firm Hindenburg Research &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22327207/general-motors-lordstown-hindenburg-short-electric-truck-orders"&gt;published a report&lt;/a&gt; that accused Lordstown Motors of, among other things, faking some of those preorders, and sourcing some to fleet brokerage firms that couldn’t afford the number of vehicles they were supposed to buy. Burns initially pushed back hard, saying “there’s always haters” and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336751/lordstown-motors-sec-inquiry-review-hindenburg-investigation-orders"&gt;quoting Taylor Swift’s “Shake it Off” to a local news outlet&lt;/a&gt;. Soon after, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336751/lordstown-motors-sec-inquiry-review-hindenburg-investigation-orders"&gt;the company disclosed the SEC probe&lt;/a&gt; and launched its own review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EUmOLw"&gt;In May, Lordstown Motors admitted that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453051/ev-startup-spac-lordstown-lucid-canoo-faraday-fisker"&gt;needed more money to survive&lt;/a&gt; and lowered the number of vehicles it hopes to produce by the end of 2021. It has also stopped work on its second vehicle, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535457/lordstown-motors-electric-van-project-camping-world-work-stopped-endurance"&gt;an electric van&lt;/a&gt;, and said that it only has enough funding to last until May 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="vG9xT7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Lordstown Motors raised $675 million in late 2020 but needs more cash&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KEoAfT"&gt;The review — conducted by a law firm with ties to Lordstown Motors — wrapped up in June. It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532976/lordstown-motors-ceo-steve-burns-resign-short-seller-investigation"&gt;confirmed that Burns and others had made misleading claims about the preorders&lt;/a&gt;, and he resigned as a result. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3CJNo6"&gt;Lordstown Motors has since tapped another former Workhorse executive, Angela Strand, to serve as interim CEO. She is being paid $100,000 per month to serve in the role while the company hunts for a permanent replacement, &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1759546/000110465921085206/tm2119909d2_8k.htm"&gt;according to a recent filing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FTC says Broadcom violated antitrust law with TV set-top box deals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Broadcom Expected To Beat Quarterly Earnings Expectations" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AenBV5qFLmmJuNSZBuw0ToH1pVE=/116x0:5213x3398/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69535145/1321540122.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mPsPIt"&gt;The US Federal Trade Commission has sued chip maker Broadcom for allegedly abusing a monopoly on semiconductor components. &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/1810205broadcomcomplaint.pdf"&gt;A newly issued complaint&lt;/a&gt; accuses Broadcom of threatening to charge higher prices, refuse technical support, or cut off chip sales if its customers bought other products from competing companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PWSiKw"&gt;Starting in 2016, Broadcom allegedly struck “exclusive or near-exclusive” deals with at least 10 companies manufacturing video set-top boxes and broadband devices like modems. It allegedly required these “strategic” partners to use a variety of Broadcom components even if they weren’t the best or cheapest option for a given device. Nonexclusive “tactical” partners were charged higher prices for slower product delivery and customer support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3AUWfl"&gt;When manufacturers bid to have cable and internet providers like AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon buy their products, the complaint says Broadcom “actively monitored” whether any of those products included components from Broadcom competitors. “Broadcom communicated to customers that disloyalty as to even a single bid involving a single relevant product could mean loss of strategic partner terms,” the FTC claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gAEGlw"&gt;In one case, Broadcom allegedly retaliated against a company that hadn’t yet agreed to exclusivity, cutting off “all supply and support” when it submitted a bid that included a non-Broadcom component. The company allegedly withdrew the bid and signed the exclusivity deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ciBAfN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are pleased to move toward resolving this broadband matter with the FTC”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8IsCMD"&gt;The FTC wants Broadcom to &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/7._acco_-_broadcom_-_executed.pdf"&gt;sign a consent order&lt;/a&gt; agreeing to back off its restrictive exclusivity agreements. In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Broadcom indicated it was willing to cooperate. “We are pleased to move toward resolving this broadband matter with the FTC on terms that are substantially similar to our previous settlement with the EC involving the same products,” said a spokesperson, referring to &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/european-antitrust-regulators-settle-with-broadcom-a-year-after-interim-measures-flex/"&gt;a 2020 agreement&lt;/a&gt; with the European Commission. The EC agreement included a commitment to suspend all exclusive or quasi-exclusive deals and refrain from signing new deals with similar terms for seven years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W4Gn3r"&gt;The spokesperson said Broadcom was “equally pleased” that the FTC had not proceeded with an investigation into other parts of its business; the agency had reportedly been looking at &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-20/broadcom-chip-business-targeted-in-widening-u-s-antitrust-probe"&gt;potential anti-competitive practices&lt;/a&gt; in areas like Wi-Fi chip sales. “While we disagree that our actions violated the law and disagree with the FTC’s characterizations of our business, we look forward to putting this matter behind us and continuing to focus on supporting our customers through an environment of accelerated digital transformation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WfL1rr"&gt;In its suit, the FTC claims Broadcom wanted to lock out potential competitors at a turning point for the set-top box industry. The complaint says Broadcom had particular dominance in the market for traditional broadcast TV set-top box components and faced more potential competition for streaming box components, a category that’s grown rapidly thanks to TV cord-cutting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oJSV7A"&gt;Broadcom allegedly recognized that “as many consumers cut the cord, there are many other consumers who will continue using broadcast [set-top boxes] for some time to come,” and companies will need support for those boxes for years. “Broadcom recognized these threats and opportunities,” the complaint says, and it used its power to make sure potential rivals’ sales opportunities were “severely restricted.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus is merging OxygenOS with Oppo’s ColorOS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aPHIxc6qbeKB7raEULtvG27U7zw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69535023/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0063_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sxGtmt"&gt;Following last month’s announcement &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538105/oneplus-oppo-merge-integration-ownership-bbk"&gt;that OnePlus was integrating with Oppo&lt;/a&gt;, effectively becoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22543184/oppo-oneplus-merger-brand-pete-lau-bbk-memo"&gt;a sub-brand of the phone manufacturer&lt;/a&gt;, the company &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/update-to-the-oxygenos-codebase-and-software-maintenance-schedule.1462181/"&gt;announced on Friday&lt;/a&gt; that it’s also merging OxygenOS with Oppo’s ColorOS operating system (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/07/02/oneplus-android-update-schedule-years-oxygenos-coloros/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OuNLqJ"&gt;Both companies’ software will remain separate and continue to serve their individual regions (OxygenOS for OnePlus phones globally, ColorOS on OnePlus and Oppo devices in China) but share a common codebase, which OnePlus says should standardize its software experience and streamline the development process for future OxygenOS updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="14iqGm"&gt;OnePlus says the change will also allow the company to guarantee better Android update  support going forward, something Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355777/samsung-android-os-update-promise-galaxy-phones-3-generations"&gt;has also tried to improve on&lt;/a&gt; in the last few years. OnePlus lays out the life span for updates as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="exG21w"&gt;Flagship phones including the T and R models get three major Android updates and four years of security updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dpAw7u"&gt;Nord and Nord CE phones get two major Android updates and three years of security updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FOtNuJ"&gt;Nord N phones will get one major Android update and three years of security updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="jIYDoF"&gt;OnePlus does limit those update commitments to the OnePlus 8 and up, so older OnePlus devices will be out of luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CsAxF6"&gt;As the next step in whatever is going on with OnePlus, Oppo, and the wider BBK Electronics umbrella, merging the companies’ software on the backend seems like a net positive for OnePlus users. How independent OnePlus is now that it’s “integrated” seems about as unclear as when it was independent, owned by BBK, and seemingly sharing some parts with Oppo, but as long as phones are supported, it hopefully shouldn’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;

If you do, you’ll be able to play the game as soon as it launches and you’ll get access to a special sword that gives you extra experience for each monster kill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ESt0ht"&gt;The announcement comes a week before &lt;a href="https://www.witchercon.com/en"&gt;WitcherCon&lt;/a&gt;, a celebration of the franchise hosted by CD Projekt Red and Netflix, which streams &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075927/netflix-the-witcher-viewer-numbers-length-metrics-q4-2019-earnings"&gt;the hit TV series&lt;/a&gt;. There could be some exciting news from the event as it seems likely we’ll hear more details about the second season of the show (which Netflix has already shared a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22462967/the-witcher-season-2-trailer-netflix-geeked-week"&gt;very brief teaser of&lt;/a&gt;), and CD Projekt Red has already promised that a next-gen update for &lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-witcher-3s-next-gen-update-will-be-released-in-the-second-half-of-2021/"&gt;set to release this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GdAIoV"&gt;An internal survey designed by Apple employees shows respondents want the option to work from home and fear their colleagues may have to leave if the company forces people back to the office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uEnm38"&gt;In the survey, which was sent out in early June, nearly 90 percent of respondents said they “strongly agree” with the statement “location-flexible working options are a very important issue to me.” A total of 1,749 people answered the question. Employees defined “location-flexible” as the option to work from home indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LKJjwy"&gt;The news comes on the heels of Tim Cook’s announcement that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;Apple will be rolling out a new hybrid work model&lt;/a&gt; that will require employees to return to the office three days a week starting in early September. While the move is a big shift for Apple, which discouraged remote work prior to the pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22491629/apple-employees-push-back-return-office-internal-letter-tim-cook"&gt;it’s still too strict for some workers&lt;/a&gt;. They say that without the option to work from home whenever they want, some will be forced to resign. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="obip8K"&gt;The survey is not scientific — it was sent out in a Slack channel for employees to discuss remote work, and only a tiny fraction of Apple’s 147,000-person workforce likely even knew it existed. But the fact that well over a thousand employees participated in a grassroots survey that wasn’t sanctioned by Apple executives is significant. It hints at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453302/apple-culture-secrecy-leak-antonio-garcia-martinez-letter"&gt;a shift in Apple’s famously hierarchical culture&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PvY73t"&gt;In response to the statement “I am worried that some of my colleagues will have to leave Apple due to LACK of location-flexible work options,” 58.5 percent said they “strongly agree.” A total of 1,743 people answered the question. A smaller portion — 36.7 percent — said they are worried &lt;em&gt;they’ll&lt;/em&gt; have to resign due to the lack of flexibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CSIdpP"&gt;Employees sent the survey results to Cook and Deirdre O’Brien, senior vice president of retail and people, on June 14th. They included a video with personal testimonies from 24 Apple workers on why remote working options are important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nts8Qm"&gt;Two weeks later, Apple sent out a video &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22556615/apple-response-hybrid-work-model-employee-letter-remote"&gt;doubling down on the hybrid model&lt;/a&gt;, saying “we believe that in-person collaboration is essential to our culture and our future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G19vHQ"&gt;The video irked some employees, who felt executives hadn’t listened to their perspective. Even employees who don’t want to work from home forever say the company needs to consider more flexibility while &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/30/world/asia/virus-delta-variant-global.html"&gt;the Delta variant continues to surge&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4E0oqS"&gt;While Apple is encouraging employees to get vaccinated, it’s not requiring everyone to wear masks in the office, saying instead that “choosing to wear a mask in places where protocols have been lifted is a personal decision.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lsKatx"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
