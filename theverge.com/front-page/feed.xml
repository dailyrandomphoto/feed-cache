    <title>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 remake studio will now focus exclusively on Blizzard games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iVpcMHQvb1d7PEm_tTJq0hzMmns=/82x0:972x593/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68707635/Tony_Hawk_ProSkater_ANishimura.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UPjGp9"&gt;Vicarious Visions, the studio that developed &lt;em&gt;Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy&lt;/em&gt; and the remake for &lt;em&gt;Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2,&lt;/em&gt; has been reassigned within Activision Blizzard, &lt;a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-01-22-vicarious-visions-merged-into-blizzard"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GamesIndustry.biz&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. Moving forward, the studio’s team of about 200 people will now be “fully dedicated to existing Blizzard games and initiatives.” That means for any games Vicarious Visions works on in the future, it will not serve as the lead development studio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FuOL2b"&gt;“After collaborating with Vicarious Visions for some time and developing a great relationship, Blizzard realized there was an opportunity for [Vicarious Visions] to provide long-term support,” a Blizzard spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;GamesIndustry.biz&lt;/em&gt;. The studio did not specify what projects Vicarious Visions is providing support for currently, as Blizzard Entertainment is currently working on three titles — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/2/18056370/diablo-immortal-mobile-blizzard-blizzcon-2018"&gt;an ARPG hack and slash mobile game, &lt;em&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to sequels for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942565/diablo-4-announced-release-date-blizzcon-2019"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20943766/blizzard-overwatch-2-sequel-announcement-blizzcon-2019"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JorMM9"&gt;As part of the merger, Jen Oneal, who previously served as the studio’s head, has been promoted as the executive vice president of development at Blizzard. Vicarious Visions was founded in 1990 and became a subsidiary of Activision in 2005. Throughout its 30-plus year lifespan, the studio has worked on various projects across numerous franchises, including &lt;em&gt;Tony Hawk&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Crash Bandicoot&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Guitar Hero.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this story about COVID-19 vaccine fights on Facebook</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rsUPSMmZCpOfmYXtBOIXay7TsMw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68707559/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vja78H"&gt;Adequate COVID-19 vaccine distribution still seems like the greatest obstacle to slowing the spread of the pandemic, but if you’re looking to worry about the other threat that’s still blocking progress — an unwillingness to take the vaccine at all — and the creative efforts on Facebook that are going into stopping it, &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-fights-over-the-covid-19-vaccine-are-everywhere-on-facebook/"&gt;you should go read this &lt;em&gt;FiveThirtyEight&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u7coZH"&gt;Facebook’s taken steps to combat misinformation related to the pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150425/facebook-covid-19-vaccine-coronavirus-misinformation-ban"&gt;removing false claims about COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514535/facebook-anti-vaxx-ad-ban-moderation-covid-19-vaccine"&gt;banning ads that discourage vaccine use&lt;/a&gt;, but reporter Kaleigh Rogers highlights some of the more direct outreach that pro-vaccine activists are doing to combat misinformation. From “honeypot” Facebook groups designed to capture the anti-vax curious to direct outreach from groups like C.I.C.A.D.A. (Community Immunity Champions and Defenders Association) flooding comments with positive vaccine information, there’s a daily struggle to change minds (and dunk on the misinformed). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0S7e5c"&gt;The larger problem remains, though: Facebook’s advertising-based business can often incentivize emotional reactions to posts that drive people into the arms of the anti-vax movement. COVID-19’s popularity as a topic of discussion on Facebook has made it even easier for anti-vaxxers to reuse false narratives about the “dangers” of vaccines to quickly bring people into the fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Y4BTe"&gt;Until Facebook comes up with a new way to combat misinformation or changes how its algorithm chooses to surface posts, this kind of work will remain important. Rogers summarizes those efforts well, along with the obvious problem of Facebook’s core design. You can &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-fights-over-the-covid-19-vaccine-are-everywhere-on-facebook/"&gt;read the whole article on &lt;em&gt;FiveThirtyEight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An EU parliament website for COVID testing allegedly broke the EU’s privacy laws</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kNSA0iY514tOFQcWIPiKlftAPWU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68706922/acastro_1800724_1777_EU_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NxqwGd"&gt;The European Parliament is being investigated by the European Data Protection Supervisor &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/privacy-complaint-targets-european-parliaments-covid-19-test-booking-site/"&gt;after allegations that its COVID testing website didn’t meet EU privacy standards&lt;/a&gt;. Six members of the European Parliament (MEPs) have &lt;a href="https://noyb.eu/en/data-transfers-us-and-insufficient-cookie-information-noyb-files-complaint-behalf-six-meps-against"&gt;worked with data watchdog group noyb&lt;/a&gt; to bring the complaint, saying that the site illegally sent data to the US and that its cookie banners were deceptive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tssvAN"&gt;The website was set up to help MEPs schedule COVID tests, and while it didn’t handle any health information itself, sending data to the US for processing would still be illegal. &lt;a href="https://noyb.eu/en/data-transfers-us-and-insufficient-cookie-information-noyb-files-complaint-behalf-six-meps-against"&gt;According to the complaint&lt;/a&gt;, the testing website made over 150 requests to third parties, including Google and Stripe. Under EU law, data can only be transferred to the US if “an adequate level of protection for the personal data [can] be ensured,” and noyb argues that the companies “clearly fall under relevant US surveillance laws that allow [targeting of] EU citizens.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6o3XMA"&gt;The complaint also alleges that the cookie banners on the site didn’t disclose all of the cookies that would be stored on the user’s computer, and that the banners prodded users toward the “Accept All” button. Since cookies are used to track users across websites, and some of the ones found were from the aforementioned US companies, it’s understandable that EU regulators might be caught off guard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MAat7Z"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-eu-privacy-idUSKBN29R1EB"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the European Data Protection Supervisor started investigating the site back in October, following other complaints from MEPs. A spokesperson said that the information from noyb was “of direct relevance to this complaint [and would] be examined thoroughly.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2gbIva"&gt;EU privacy laws can sometimes be hard for web developers to grasp, but most web developers aren’t under direction of the lawmakers themselves. Creation of the site was contracted out to a third-party company, but you’d hope that there was a specification for “follows all EU privacy laws” included in the brief.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="55vS2b"&gt;Speaking to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, noyb’s chairman Max Schrems said EU institutions like the parliament “have to lead by example,” and it seems that, in this instance, they haven’t lived up to that responsibility. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon tries to delay warehouse union vote in Alabama</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mYv6nkC3jLeugvj2DcCyxMJfpSs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68706680/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X9njjC"&gt;Amazon is trying to delay a union vote in Bessemer, Alabama, appealing a US labor board decision to allow 6,000 warehouse workers to vote by mail on unionization. The company is arguing for the election to be held in person, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/10-RC-269250"&gt;documents filed with the National Labor Relations Board&lt;/a&gt; (NLRB) Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BSs6K2"&gt;Amazon’s argument is that mail-in voting decreases voter turnout. It says the NLRB looked at the wrong COVID-19 infection data when determining how to hold the vote, using the positivity rate in Jefferson County, where the warehouse is located, rather than the positivity rate at the warehouse itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5nwLBS"&gt;Workers in Bessemer are set to vote on whether to unionize with the Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Union starting on February 8th. Ballots must be mailed in by March 29th, and the vote count should take place on March 30th. It will be the tech giant’s first union election in the US since 2014, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-labor/amazon-seeks-to-halt-union-election-at-alabama-warehouse-idUSKBN29R23P"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YiL2yC"&gt;In December, the National Labor Relations Board &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/02/amazon-union-vote-hearing/"&gt;rejected an earlier attempt by the tech giant to delay a hearing on the union effort&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jQGcRi"&gt;In a filing on January 21st, Amazon said if the acting regional director had looked at more recent COVID-19 data, she would have seen the county infection rate was decreasing. “If a manual election is improper here, it is hard to imagine any circumstances in which a Regional Director would allow manual elections until COVID-19 is eradicated,” the company wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="otYPHh"&gt;The NLRB had previously reported the Jefferson County infection rate was over 17 percent in early January, and noted that new cases were rising. Now, Amazon is arguing that not only was this data wrong, but the NLRB should be using data from its warehouse instead. The positivity rate there, according to Amazon, is far lower. “Frankly, it defies belief that, when three medical experts essentially agree that the conditions at [the warehouse] are safer than in another geographic area, a reasonable fact finder would ignore that consensus to concentrate on that other geographic area in making a safety-related determination,” it wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HpEMYv"&gt;The NLRB could become even less favorable to Amazon with the election of Joe Biden, who has already made aggressive moves to shift the board’s stance toward unions. On Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/biden-quickly-moves-to-force-out-peter-robb-trumps-labor-board-attorney_n_6008adc1c5b697df1a0bb88e"&gt;President Biden fired Peter Robb&lt;/a&gt;, general counsel of the NLRB and a longtime opponent of labor groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="si591F"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/20462335-amazon-filing/?embed=1&amp;amp;title=1" title="amazon-filing (Hosted by DocumentCloud)" width="700" height="905" style="border: 1px solid #aaa;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-forms"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MNo1Tb"&gt;Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google search on mobile is getting a redesign</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zOqV751QsMg5zZ_cRzREpq8CnEM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68706649/acastro_180427_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sF9PFg"&gt;Google is redesigning how search results look on mobile, the company announced &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/search/mobile-redesign-2021"&gt;in a blog on Friday&lt;/a&gt;. “We wanted to take a step back to simplify a bit so people could find what they’re looking for faster and more easily,” Aileen Cheng, who led the redesign, said in the blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWJgjX"&gt;The redesign will have larger and bolder text that’s intended to be easier to scan quickly, and you’ll see more of Google’s font in results. Search results will also take up more of the width of your screen, thanks in part to reduced shadows. Google also says the redesign will use color “more intentionally” to help highlight important information without being distracting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TB0O87"&gt;To get an idea of how the redesign differs from the current experience, compare this render of the redesign with a screenshot of the current search experience I took from my iPhone 12 mini. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rgy90U6pgXZbA3DiBn7rPHMJyrI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22253128/OSRP_NEW.max_1000x1000.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LUoY1cfOnZDauik-Hu3Bx-yTAfA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22253126/IMG_0168.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2YBvC8"&gt;It looks like the new design puts more information higher up the page and reduces some visual clutter, which will hopefully make results easier to parse without forcing you to scroll down too far to find what you’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X7S1wM"&gt;Google says the redesign will roll out in the coming days.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FTC fines three ticket scalping companies for illegally using bots</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Elton John Farewell Yellow Brick Road Tour - Auckland" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m7VN7ih4D6MZiyhqaug2XlaIRgY=/0x0:2999x1999/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68706536/1206593986.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dave Simpson/WireImage&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gOt24P"&gt;The Federal Trade Commission issued multimillion-dollar fines against three bot-powered ticket scalping operations. &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/01/ftc-brings-first-ever-cases-under-bots-act"&gt;The FTC says&lt;/a&gt; these organizations bought over 150,000 event tickets over the past four years, nabbing them with automated tools that evaded online purchasing limits. After reselling these tickets for an estimated $26.1 million, they’ve been accused of breaking a 2016 anti-bot law — the first time this law has been applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="baQqWd"&gt;Regulators reached a proposed settlement with the ticket selling groups, including $31.6 million in fines. However, most of these fines were suspended because of an inability to pay. The three groups will pay a total of $3.7 million instead, and they’ll have to maintain records demonstrating their future compliance with the law. The settlement must still be approved by a judge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OzmBiE"&gt;The Better Online Ticket Sales (BOTS) Act bans using software to circumvent ticket purchase limits — a practice that lets resellers buy tickets in bulk and resell them at a steep markup. “Not only does this deprive loyal fans of the chance to see their favorite performers and shows, it is against the law,” said FTC consumer protection bureau director Andrew Smith in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FFPXKi"&gt;While the complaints don’t specify which shows the scalpers were targeting, they note that the list includes many sporting events and other performances, including Elton John concerts.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft risks a year of goodwill with its Xbox Live price hike</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h5BJ17yE9XMSgU9_kfoRkSTBTWg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68706389/acastro_190530_1777_xbox_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JmJrxe"&gt;Microsoft spent most of 2020 building up goodwill for its Xbox Game Pass service and next-gen consoles, but a new Xbox Live Gold price hike risks wiping all of that out. The Xbox maker announced a number of changes to Xbox Live Gold pricing today — you should &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244173/microsoft-xbox-live-gold-price-increase-pricing"&gt;read our full post for details&lt;/a&gt; — and the bottom line is that it’s moving from $60 a year to $120 for most people. That’s a huge jump and a badly timed one: it’s happening in the middle of a pandemic, just as Microsoft has reported &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21537015/microsoft-q1-2021-earnings-revenue-cloud-services-surface-gaming-xbox"&gt;big boosts&lt;/a&gt; to its gaming revenue &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21334725/microsoft-q4-2020-earnings-azure-surface-xbox-gains-growth-profits-sales"&gt;throughout 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bnHvWO"&gt;The reason for the move is obvious — get people on Xbox Game Pass — but Microsoft has done it in a clumsy and poorly timed way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ORfkf9"&gt;Xbox fans are understandably angry. Microsoft stands alone in being the only major platform holder to force players of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt;, and other popular free-to-play games to pay a subscription fee for access to multiplayer. That fee has now doubled annually for most Xbox players, as the majority of people buy codes to top up their Xbox Live subscription. Microsoft quietly removed these $59.99 12-month codes last year, and the six-month codes are now priced at $59.99. You can probably still find 12-month codes from resellers and retailers, but they’re officially discontinued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eDpf8O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10297752"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FgxXHK"&gt;That means many &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; players will now have to pay $120 a year just to play on an Xbox console. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;on PlayStation and Nintendo Switch is free, and even on Microsoft’s own Windows platform, it’s free to play. In fact, PC gamers playing Xbox Live-enabled games don’t even have to pay for Xbox Live Gold to access multiplayer. It’s a bizarre situation for Microsoft to knowingly place itself into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DrYd5K"&gt;Microsoft’s announcement doesn’t even attempt to justify this price hike. In a &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/01/22/update-on-xbox-live-gold-pricing/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; that reads like it was written by a lawyer, Microsoft says “periodically, we assess the value and pricing of our services to reflect changes in regional marketplaces and to continue to invest in the Xbox community,” before announcing the changes. The only justification is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="EMzwsS"&gt;We invest in our community by strengthening the digital safety of our players, enabling new ways to share, communicate and play with your friends, and delivering industry leading reliability across our network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="LhjwIS"&gt;What Microsoft’s announcement doesn’t detail is the real reason for these price changes: Xbox Game Pass. Microsoft quickly managed to entice &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21242004/xbox-game-pass-10-million-subscribers-microsoft-q3-2020-earnings"&gt;10 million people onto Xbox Game Pass&lt;/a&gt; last year, with $1 deals and more. That figure soon jumped 50 percent to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21449219/xbox-game-pass-15-million-subscribers-microsoft-growth"&gt;15 million in September&lt;/a&gt;, making Xbox Game Pass look like a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21242479/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-subscribers-phil-spencer-comments"&gt;very clever bet for Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GU2sZa"&gt;Xbox Game Pass has been praised widely, but Microsoft is now clearly trying to aggressively move its existing Xbox Live Gold player base over to the service. Microsoft is allowing Xbox Live Gold subscribers to switch to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate (usually $14.99 per month) and convert the amount of time in months or years into Ultimate subscriptions. That’s a good initial deal for Xbox Live Gold subscribers, but the end goal is clearly for Microsoft to earn more revenue per Xbox user in the future once they’re hooked to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and everything it offers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="xcloud" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l9NsQMpMNCES4feF5DNZZSX5DH8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21950537/vpavic_xcloud_20201009_0011_Edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Nick Statt / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xbox Game Pass Ultimate includes xCloud streaming.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5YTyLM"&gt;This move may also allow Microsoft to keep pushing Xbox Game Pass throughout 2021 without having to increase its pricing. Microsoft has so far resisted an Xbox Game Pass price increase, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21429922/xbox-game-pass-for-pc-price-increase-september-17"&gt;except for the introductory pricing&lt;/a&gt; for its PC subscription. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q726YO"&gt;I’ve argued before that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/24/21336892/microsoft-xbox-series-x-game-pass-event-showcase-future"&gt;Xbox Game Pass is Microsoft’s true next-gen console&lt;/a&gt;, and the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21449178/microsoft-xbox-bethesda-zenimax-media-acquisition-xbox-game-pass"&gt;acquisition of Bethesda for $7.5 billion&lt;/a&gt; reinforced that late last year. Microsoft has some big plans for Xbox Game Pass for 2021 and beyond, but it’s clearly keen to move its legacy Xbox Live subscribers over to the service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jvfip9"&gt;Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is a killer deal with access to more than 100 games, xCloud game streaming, and Xbox Live Gold for $14.99 per month. Microsoft has just tackled this migration abruptly and with terrible timing and messaging. Many are still considering whether to buy an Xbox or a PS5, as both consoles are still sold out. The blow of an Xbox Live Gold price increase could have been softened for new and existing Xbox owners with the removal of the need for Xbox Live Gold for free-to-play multiplayer games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmZnBx"&gt;That’s something that Microsoft should consider, particularly as the company has announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349236/halo-infinite-multiplayer-free-to-play-120fps-rumors"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; multiplayer will be free to play&lt;/a&gt; when it launches later this year. If this Xbox Live Gold requirement still stands, it puts &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; in the awkward position of being free to play on PC but needing a $10.99 monthly subscription on Xbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ve8hLq"&gt;All of this leaves Microsoft in the odd position of now offering one of the best deals in gaming (Xbox Game Pass) and now one of the worst (Xbox Live Gold). For those not interested in Xbox Game Pass, it’s a bitter pill to swallow.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s 2021 MacBook Pros will reportedly bring back the SD card slot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple MacBook Pro with Retina display 2015" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F8U4fJCiw3vwAPazZYBy2f1EbU0=/0x0:1016x677/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68705924/oo04-09_1247tt.0.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vXsdDT"&gt;Apple may finally be bringing an integrated SD card slot to its upcoming 2021 models of its MacBook Pro laptops, according to a new report from &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-22/apple-aapl-plans-new-macbook-air-with-magsafe-macbook-pro-with-sd-card-slot?sref=kKj7hWAI&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_content=tech&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-tech"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Gurman&lt;/a&gt;, in a move that would restore the popular port standard to the company’s computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OVEfNJ"&gt;The MacBook Pro lineup hasn’t offered an SD card slot since Apple removed the feature in its 2016 redesign, which excised all the ports from the laptops in favor of four universal USB-C ports. This forced many professional users — who rely on the popular memory card format to import photos and videos to their computers for editing — to turn to much-reviled dongles to get the same functionality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vAP3av"&gt;The news comes after an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;earlier report&lt;/a&gt; from Gurman that originally detailed some of the changes that Apple was planning for the upcoming 14-inch and 16-inch designs. These changes include removing the controversial Touch Bar interface in exchange for physical function keys; offering a more squared-off design that’s in line with the recent iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPhone 12 lineups; adding brighter displays; and bringing back Apple’s magnetic MagSafe chargers. That’s all in addition to the biggest change, which will see the high-end laptops move from Intel’s processors to a more powerful version of Apple’s in-house, ARM-based M1 chipset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vREWBe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"2021 MacBook Pro will ditch the Touch Bar and bring back MagSafe, say reports","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"},{"title":"Apple reportedly planning new MacBook Air design with MagSafe charging","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244011/apple-new-macbook-air-design-magsafe-charger-report"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="weImFK"&gt;Noted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo corroborated those reports by claiming that the new laptops would offer additional ports, but today marks the first confirmation of the SD card slot specifically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wfF7Bc"&gt;The news of the SD card slot’s return actually comes as an aside in a larger report on Apple’s planned refresh for a “high-end” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244011/apple-new-macbook-air-design-magsafe-charger-report"&gt;MacBook Air model&lt;/a&gt;, which is said to offer similar MagSafe and processor benefits as the new MacBook Pros. Unfortunately, though, there’s no mention of the SD card slot being offered on the upcoming Air refresh — just a pair of USB-C ports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fwyZTq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3ZuUA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offers noise cancellation and better sound than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZuVjFm"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Apple AirPods 2 review: even more wireless|63428" data-volume-uuid="c798b260f" data-volume-id="63428" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-892" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;These are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. The AirPods usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted.  You can currently find Apple’s most affordable AirPods for $129 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441%3Fwmlspartner%3Dwlpa%26selectedSellerId%3D433%26%26adid%3D22222222227281354149%26wl0%3D%26wl1%3Dg%26wl2%3Dc%26wl3%3D339987579106%26wl4%3Dpla-667825192756%26wl5%3D9008008%26wl6%3D%26wl7%3D%26wl8%3D%26wl9%3Dpla%26wl10%3D111830562%26wl11%3Donline%26wl12%3D604342441%26veh%3Dsem%26gclid%3DCjwKCAiAoOz-BRBdEiwAyuvA61H2BRTbBBeDsoekxoiD1iyavhCvjOe-rc1VRE8KROBAR83M_YmAIBoC31kQAvD_BwE&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%3Fref%3Dtgt_adv_XS000000%26AFID%3Dgoogle_pla_df%26fndsrc%3Dtgtao%26DFA%3D71700000014846099%26CPNG%3DPLA_Electronics%252BShopping_Brand%26adgroup%3DSC_Electronics%26LID%3D700000001170770pgs%26LNM%3DPRODUCT_GROUP%26network%3Dg%26device%3Dc%26location%3D9008008%26targetid%3Dpla-82462042369%26ds_rl%3D1246978%26ds_rl%3D1248099%26gclid%3DCjwKCAiAoOz-BRBdEiwAyuvA6-IseMU-VKzo5xzTTBT8BVk65z1R7t_lZHR-ApDuYug7wocNVuNr-RoCuiUQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature (if you have no use for it, just get the more affordable option above), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;even the best ones are fairly inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but keep a lookout for deals that bring the price down to $160 or below. Currently, the lowest price is $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; or you can get them for $160 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=4781ccd9dac6fb8bf9e60c657cd3fbba&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%3Fref%3Dtgt_adv_XS000000%26AFID%3Dgoogle_pla_df%26fndsrc%3Dtgtao%26DFA%3D71700000014846099%26CPNG%3DPLA_Electronics%252BShopping_Brand%26adgroup%3DSC_Electronics%26LID%3D700000001170770pgs%26LNM%3DPRODUCT_GROUP%26network%3Dg%26device%3Dc%26location%3D9008008%26targetid%3Dpla-82462042369%26ds_rl%3D1246978%26ds_rl%3D1248099%26gclid%3DCjwKCAiAoOz-BRBdEiwAyuvA6z1zgThWDp2tf3j60kOubPIybm5uNl4EBzedCsO2Rm4cjFVJV1QJbxoCUaAQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OGXtAu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Uv43TD"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="AirPods Pro review: the perfect earbuds for the iPhone|73652" data-volume-uuid="c840e1e11" data-volume-id="73652" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-514" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt; Compared to the options above, Apple’s high-end truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality, noise cancellation, and now support Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. We think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;they’re the best wireless earbuds that iPhone owners&lt;/a&gt; can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yaMGwU"&gt;The AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their $249 retail price, and in fact, sometimes drop down to $200 and lower. Right now, if you want the lowest price for these wireless earbuds and don’t mind buying refurbished, they are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730154636955201273" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$200 at Best Buy (Geek Squad Certified)&lt;/a&gt;. If you want a new pair, the lowest price currently available is &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/VergeEvergreen/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-airpods-pro-22?ref=mwj_cd_deal_8" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$205 at Woot&lt;/a&gt;. You can also get them for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$209 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="NZ3HCO"&gt;This week on &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s flagship podcast &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s own Nilay Patel, Dieter Bohn, Julia Alexander, and Chaim Gartenberg run through the news, reviews, and rumors in the world of tech this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFE8NH"&gt;Dieter published his review of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;so&lt;em&gt; The Vergecast &lt;/em&gt;discusses the updates and fixes in this iteration of the flagship phone. Has Samsung redeemed itself from the S20 Ultra? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PDng4p"&gt;Second half of the show, there were a bunch of Apple rumors this week — reports of the company planning a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233191/apple-silicon-redesigned-imac-mac-pro-rumor-features"&gt;Mac redesign&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233644/foldable-iphone-apple-screens-report"&gt;foldable phone&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242131/apple-vr-headset-2022-fabric-design-fan-price-details-rumors"&gt;a VR headset&lt;/a&gt; — so the crew theorizes what these products could look like, what their function could be, and when these would actually be available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfuxwD"&gt;The show wraps up with some updates to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/streaming-wars"&gt;the streaming wars&lt;/a&gt;: ViacomCBS’s new rebranded streaming service Paramount Plus now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238502/paramount-plus-launch-date-cbs-all-access-streaming-event-shows-movies"&gt;has a launch date for March 4th&lt;/a&gt;. Julia Alexander details what shows and movies we’ll see on the service and how well it could handle in an already competitive market. &lt;/p&gt;
