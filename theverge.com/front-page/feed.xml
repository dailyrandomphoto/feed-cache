    <title>Personal info for 1.3 million Clubhouse users reportedly leaked online</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4eTW0P"&gt;Personal data for some 1.3 million users of the social audio app Clubhouse has been leaked online, &lt;a href="https://cybernews.com/security/clubhouse-data-leak-1-3-million-user-records-leaked-for-free-online/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyber News&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. a SQL database with users’ IDs, names, usernames, Twitter and Instagram handles and follower counts were posted to an online hacker forum. According to &lt;em&gt;Cyber News, &lt;/em&gt;it did not appear that sensitive user information such as credit card numbers were among the leaked info. But the information could be used in phishing attempts to get users to hand over that more sensitive info. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6HNpFD"&gt;Last week, &lt;em&gt;Cyber News&lt;/em&gt; reported on another data breach from a social platform: it found that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22374464/linkedin-data-leak-500-million-accounts-scraped-microsoft"&gt;personal data for 500 million LinkedIn users&lt;/a&gt; had been scraped and posted online. The Microsoft-owned company said that no private member account data from LinkedIn was included in the leak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nqEDzU"&gt;That news came just a couple of days after it was discovered that personal data for some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22366822/facebook-personal-data-533-million-leaks-online-email-phone-numbers"&gt;533 million Facebook users&lt;/a&gt; also was leaked online for free. The Facebook leak reportedly included users’ phone numbers, birthdates, locations, email addresses, and full names. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Z3HPp"&gt;Clubhouse had a monster first year—despite being invite-only and available only on iOS devices— seeing more than 10 million downloads. Twitter, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22359332/linkedin-clubhouse-clone-social-audio-networking-room"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22356682/discord-stage-channels-clubhouse-like-feature-voice"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356993/spotify-locker-room-clubhouse-launch-acquisition"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/slack-wants-to-be-more-than-a-text-based-messaging-platform/"&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; have all launched or are working on competing social audio platforms, and  &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276645/facebook-clubhouse-social-audio-app-develop"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; reportedly has one in the works as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KSXhPP"&gt;Clubhouse did not immediately reply to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>South Korea EV battery makers reach settlement in US trade dispute</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="SK Innovation Co logo seen" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PNVSVxaa-7fxRKIiooXAgtOYbqE=/0x384:4608x3456/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69108820/1070303268.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BqngrE"&gt;South Korean electric-vehicle battery makers SK Innovation and LG Energy Solution have reached a settlment in a US trade dispute, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-10/ford-vw-battery-supplier-said-to-reach-deal-to-avoid-import-ban?utm_source=url_link&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. Under the terms of the agreement, SK will pay $1.8 billion (2 trillion won) in cash and royalties to LG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YOtNIP"&gt;In a joint statement the companies said they would “work to help the development of EV battery industry in South Korea and the US. through healthy competition and friendly cooperation,” adding that they would “work together to strengthen the battery network and environmentally-friendly policy that the Biden administration is pursuing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8suLsg"&gt;In February, the US International Trade Commission &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9481d70b-827b-476d-9e0b-21245321e289"&gt;imposed a 10-year import ban&lt;/a&gt; on SK Innovation— due to take effect Sunday— following allegations it illegally obtained technology from rival LG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9EOjAq"&gt;The settlement will prevent an import ban on SK Innovation batteries into the US, which would have been problematic for the Biden administration. Ford and Volkswagen both are slated to start production on electric vehicles next year, using batteries made at SK’s plant in Georgia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z0gJBi"&gt;“This settlement agreement is a win for American workers and the American auto industry,” President Biden &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/11/statement-by-president-joe-biden-on-the-electric-battery-dispute-settlement/"&gt;said in a statement Sunday&lt;/a&gt;. “A key part of my plan to Build Back Better is to have the electric vehicles and batteries of the future built here in America, all across America, by American workers. We need a strong, diversified and resilient US-based electric vehicle battery supply chain, so we can supply the growing global demand for these vehicles and components.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cp0N8A"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG leaves behind more than a flip phone-shaped hole in our hearts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2nix_zd-RTVqievZhpUQKgS4w_Y=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69108712/ajohnson_210222_4437__005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LG Stylo 6 is one of the company’s bestselling phones in recent history.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The company leaves a void that brands like Motorola and TCL are well-positioned to fill&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="zHTSjt"&gt;LG’s exit from the smartphone business felt inevitable in the weeks leading up to it as rumors mounted. When it was finally confirmed, Avi Greengart, a longtime consumer tech analyst and president of Techsponential, noticed a trend toward nostalgia in the reactions to the news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zosnHP"&gt;“I’m not getting a lot of people saying ‘What will I do to replace my LG G8X ThinQ?’ I’m getting ‘Aw, my first phone was an LG flip phone, and it was durable and reliable and I loved it.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GuJe7t"&gt;As someone who spent many years covering the digital camera market, it’s a very familiar moment to me. We mourn the loss of the brand that gave us our first flip phone or our first camera with a tweet and a broken heart emoji. But truthfully, we moved on long ago, as did most of the rest of the phone- or camera-buying population. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="t7t3Mw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Through last year, LG still held close to 10 percent market share in the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ChXH3e"&gt;Things &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/28/11525306/lg-g5-earnings-q1-2016"&gt;weren’t looking good&lt;/a&gt; for LG’s phone business in 2016 when it introduced the modular G5, and the ecosystem’s failure to take off perpetuated what would become years of losses for the mobile division. In 2020, the smartphone business &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fglobal%2Fpdf%2Fir_report%2F20%25204Q%2520Earning%2520Release%2520of%2520LGE.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F11%2F22375938%2Flg-smartphone-business-exit-tcl-motorola" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recorded an operational loss of around $750 million for the year&lt;/a&gt;; the company promised to “closely review the direction of the business,” and we know now how that turned out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IHTQMi"&gt;While most shoppers have moved on, there are still gaps left in the market when a Kodak or an LG packs it in. “This is a void. When they do leave, this will be a void,” says Ryan Reith, program vice president for IDC’s Mobile Device Tracker division. He says that through last year, LG still held close to 10 percent market share in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84KiyC"&gt;In particular, the company still had a solid foothold in the prepaid device business. Greengart doesn’t think there will be any lack of appetite to snap up that share of the market. “The competition there is brutal. The real question is will US carriers invite a new brand in — someone like Xiaomi would be my longshot.” The company’s Redmi and Poco lineups might be good candidates, with a focus on bringing high-end features and solid performance to affordable handsets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="8l9WYc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The real question is will US carriers invite a new brand in — someone like Xiaomi would be my longshot.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LfyPlb"&gt;Greengart also notes that OnePlus already has a foot in the door at Metro by T-Mobile, the carrier’s prepaid sub-brand. Samsung has already announced that it will sell two of its least expensive A-series phones, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22370189/samsung-galaxy-a52-a42-a32-5g-a12-a02s-price-specs-price"&gt;the A02s and A12&lt;/a&gt;, through prepaid brands like Cricket and Metro this spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pWl2U6"&gt;As for the sub-$300 space in general, there’s no shortage of brands ready to pounce. “I would say the two brands that are probably going to take that share going to be Motorola and TCL,” Reith says. He notes that Motorola is already well-positioned to pick up LG’s Latin American customers, which was recently about 30 percent of its mobile phone business. Even on an individual device level, there are obvious heirs: one of LG’s last bestselling devices is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22301223/lg-stylo-6-review"&gt;Stylo 6&lt;/a&gt;, and its sole competitor, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311690/motorola-moto-g-stylus-2021-review-price-specs"&gt;Moto G Stylus&lt;/a&gt;, is quite frankly a better phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b19Eaj"&gt;TCL has also made it clear in the past couple of years that it’s eager to get its own brand devices into more consumers’ hands, in addition to the phones the company already makes for other brands. Reith says he’s “bullish” on the company’s prospects, as more US shoppers have become familiar with the brand name by way of its TV business. If one thing’s certain, it’s that more than a few companies are in a good position to fill that void LG leaves behind. As Greengart puts it, “Undoubtedly there will be plenty of substitutes; in fact there already are.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="o55aMP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Undoubtedly there will be plenty of substitutes; in fact there already are.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DH5Gs2"&gt;Although LG only had a small presence in the premium market, there’s a gap left there too — even if it’s mostly symbolic. The few devices the company still sold were an alternative to the two dominant brands in the US: Apple and Samsung. Especially considering the lower cost of entry to the S21 series this year, those remaining customers will likely be easily scooped up by the duopoly. “The market is mostly Apple and Samsung in the United States,” says Greengart. “If it was concentrated before, it’s even more concentrated today.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c6wpis"&gt;Realistically though, the market had already spoken. LG’s efforts at bold, unusual designs in the premium space never caught on and spelled serious trouble for the business. Reith points to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536659/lg-wing-review-dual-screen-price-specs-features"&gt;the LG Wing&lt;/a&gt; as an example. “To come up with a design like that… it takes so much money for R&amp;amp;D, that when you put that out and it only sells thousands of units — not hundreds of thousands, but &lt;em&gt;thousands&lt;/em&gt; of units — it’s a big, big loss,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="rfzHOP"&gt;LG’s premium devices may have been interesting and unique, but the market spoke, and the company’s mobile phone exit became seemingly inevitable. That’s how these things work, and a multitude of companies are ready to swoop in and pick up where LG left off. But whether you follow mobile tech closely or just have a special place in your heart for your old flip phone, many of us will still take the opportunity to pause and shed a digital emoji tear.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google reportedly ran secret ‘Project Bernanke’ that boosted its own ad-buying system over competitors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uSEhvxYAFq6hozN3kqmpgE3Mr3M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69108688/acastro_180427_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="l1nPWG"&gt;Google reportedly ran a secret project called “Project Bernanke” that relied on bidding data collected from advertisers using its ad exchange to benefit the company’s own ad system, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/googles-secret-project-bernanke-revealed-in-texas-antitrust-case-11618097760?mod=djemalertNEWS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. First discovered by newswire &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KhushitaVasant/status/1379955848118726659?s=20"&gt;service MLex&lt;/a&gt;, the name of the project was visible in an inadvertently unredacted document Google had filed as part of an antitrust lawsuit in Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3EKR7S"&gt;A federal judge has since let Google refile the document under seal. But according to the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;, “Bernanke” was not disclosed to outside advertisers, and proved lucrative for Google, generating hundreds of millions of dollars for the company. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178988/google-antitrust-ad-tech-lawsuit-texas-attorney-general-paxton"&gt;Texas filed an antitrust lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against Google in December, alleging that the search giant was using anticompetitive tactics in which “Bernanke” was a major part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="skiRF5"&gt;Google wrote in the unredacted filing that data from Project Bernanke was “comparable to data maintained by other buying tools,” according to the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;. The company was able to access historical data about bids made through Google Ads, to change bids by its clients and boost the clients’ chances of winning auctions for ad impressions, putting rival ad tools at a disadvantage. Texas cited in court documents an internal presentation from 2013 in which Google said Project Bernanke would bring in $230 million in revenue for that year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NaRVoq"&gt;Why Google chose to name the secret project “Bernanke” is not clear. Ben Bernanke, who was chair of the Federal Reserve from 2006 to 2014, is probably the best-known Bernanke in the public sphere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="21R7Dw"&gt;In an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Google spokesperson said the complaint by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton “misrepresents many aspects of our ad tech business. We look forward to making our case in court.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QmGMH2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 11th 10:54AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Adds comment from Google spokesperson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>China fines Alibaba $2.8 billion after antitrust investigation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Alibaba Nanjing Headquarters" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l3wlEvRxpLN5hTnZ03DiEKI6zOc=/0x0:3500x2333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69107211/1311787370.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Fang Dongxu/VCG via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Yux4pg"&gt;China has hit Alibaba, one of the country’s biggest online retailers, with a record $2.8 billion (18.2 billion yuan) fine, after an investigation found the ecommerce giant violated China’s anti-monopoly law, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/09/technology/china-alibaba-monopoly-fine.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported. The fine, which represents 4 percent of Alibaba’s 2019 domestic sales, is three times higher than the $975 million fine &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/9/8009589/qualcomm-fined-975-million-by-chinese-anti-monopoly-regulators"&gt;China imposed on US chip company Qualcomm&lt;/a&gt; back in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PkY5lr"&gt;The Chinese government launched an investigation into Alibaba in December to determine whether the company was preventing merchants from selling their products on other platforms. China’s market regulator found that Alibaba’s practices had a negative effect on online retail competition and innovation. Alibaba used data and algorithms to strengthen its own position in the marketplace, resulting in an “improper competitive advantage,” China’s State Administration for Market Regulation &lt;a href="http://www.samr.gov.cn/xw/zj/202104/t20210410_327702.html"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. The company will have to reduce its anticompetitive tactics and provide compliance reports to the government for the next three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s4oONk"&gt;Alibaba &lt;a href="https://www.alizila.com/a-letter-to-our-customers-and-to-the-community/"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt; it accepted the fine and pledged to make improvements to better serve its “responsibility to society.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ywXy4W"&gt;“We will further strengthen our focus on customer value creation and customer experience, as well as continuing to introduce measures to lower entry barriers and business costs of operating on our platforms,” the company’s statement reads. “We are committed to ensuring an operating environment for our merchants and partners that is more open, more equitable, more efficient and more inclusive in sharing the fruits of growth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sb2yOI"&gt;The hefty fine is not likely to hurt Alibaba’s bottom line too severely, however; in February, the company reported a third quarter profit — for the &lt;a href="https://www.alibabagroup.com/en/news/press_pdf/p210202.pdf"&gt;final three months of calendar year 2020&lt;/a&gt; alone— of $12 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aXkfjq"&gt;Correction: An earlier version of this story had an incorrect figure for the fine China imposed on Qualcomm. It was $975 million. We regret the error. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TI5ZPn"&gt;A federal judge has granted the New York attorney general’s request to move a lawsuit against Amazon back to New York state court, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-new-york-lawsuits/judge-hands-amazon-a-setback-in-new-york-lawsuit-over-covid-19-shortfalls-idUSKBN2BW2TW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. AG &lt;a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=muvelgaOEvSt6Yc1gGqzAg=="&gt;Letitia James’ lawsuit alleges&lt;/a&gt; that the ecommerce giant failed to protect workers at its Brooklyn and Staten Island warehouses from COVID-19 during the early months of the pandemic, and retaliated against employees who complained about the lack of safety measures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A54XYG"&gt;Amazon had sought to have the case moved to federal court, arguing that workplace safety issues were not under James’ purview. The company pre-emptively &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22279819/amazon-new-york-ag-state-lawsuit-covid-19-warehouse-conditions-pandemic"&gt;sued James on February 12th&lt;/a&gt;, and James sued &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287204/new-york-amazon-lawsuit-worker-safety-failures"&gt;Amazon four days later&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon then moved the lawsuit to federal court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="enrq32"&gt;“Amazon has forced its employees to work in unsafe conditions throughout this pandemic,” James said in a statement following US District Judge Jed Rakoff’s order. “We are pleased with today’s decision to allow this case to be heard in state court, where it belongs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8XXZS0"&gt;The ruling did not address the merits of the lawsuit, which seeks improved conditions for workers and damages for two Amazon workers who say the company retaliated against them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FpGYSa"&gt;Workers at Amazon’s JKF8 warehouse in Staten Island said last March that they didn’t have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21199942/amazon-warehouse-coronavirus-covid-new-york-protest-walkout"&gt;necessary protective equipment&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/24/21233891/amazon-coronavirus-protest-sick-out-tech-workers-climate-justice"&gt;fired several workers who protested&lt;/a&gt; the conditions, including Chris Smalls, who had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21199942/amazon-warehouse-coronavirus-covid-new-york-protest-walkout"&gt;organized a walkout&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nGfROt"&gt;At the time, &lt;a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2020/ag-james-statement-firing-amazon-worker-who-organized-walkout"&gt;James called Smalls’ firing “disgraceful”&lt;/a&gt; and pushed for an investigation by the National Labor Relations Board. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/technology/amazon-coronavirus-whistleblowers.html"&gt;Amazon said at the time&lt;/a&gt; that the workers “were not terminated for talking publicly about working conditions” but for violating safety policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fzldyv"&gt;Amazon did not immediately reply to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gf0RNF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>First flight test for NASA’s Ingenuity helicopter pushed to Wednesday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Stbpub_rH8IYvuSpE182JbrU3eA=/0x62:1578x1114/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69106684/PIA24581.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GhxL8g"&gt;NASA engineers have decided to delay the Ingenuity helicopter’s debut flight on Mars to at least Wednesday, April 14th, after running into a minor computer glitch during a rotor spin test late Friday night, the agency said on Saturday. The tiny craft is healthy, but engineers need some more time to review telemetry data from the unexpected hiccup before proceeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="On4tsu"&gt;Ingenuity, a mini four-pound helicopter that arrived on Mars February 18th attached to NASA’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289668/nasa-mars-perseverance-rover-success"&gt;Perseverance rover&lt;/a&gt;, was initially slated to carry out its first flight test late Sunday night (or, mid-day Mars time). The first bits of data on whether the flight attempt was successful was expected to come early Monday morning, around 4AM ET. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1wHfcD"&gt;But data from a high-speed rotor test carried out on Friday showed the test sequence “ended early due to a ‘watchdog’ timer expiration,” &lt;a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/25795/ingenuitys-blades-are-released/"&gt;NASA said&lt;/a&gt;. It happened as Ingenuity’s computer was trying to switch from pre-flight mode to flight mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y0qGUr"&gt;Ingenuity’s “watchdog timer” is just that — a software-based watchdog that oversees the helicopter’s test sequences and alerts engineers if anything looks abnormal. “It helps the system stay safe by not proceeding if an issue is observed and worked as planned,” NASA said in a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PD4ocC"&gt;NASA emphasized the craft is healthy, and Ingenuity is still in good contact with engineers at the agency’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="790zTJ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22366887/nasa-mars-rover-perseverance-ingenuity-helicopter-drops-off"&gt;Ingenuity was deployed&lt;/a&gt; by Perseverance on the Martian surface on April 4th, kicking off a 31-day clock in which five flight tests are planned. For its first flight demonstration, the helicopter will ascend 10 feet above the surface and hover for about 30 seconds, aiming to achieve the first-ever powered flight on another world. Depending how the first test goes, subsequent tests will involve Ingenuity soaring to higher altitudes and buzzing around within its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346773/nasa-mars-ingenuity-helicopter-perseverance-rover-flight-zone"&gt;running track-shaped flight zone&lt;/a&gt; at Mars’ Jezero Crater.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook spent $23 million for CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s security in 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vVU0OnzOEuKz-iOe3mZsbY453DU=/0x0:5157x3438/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69106640/1201476988.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by KENZO TRIBOUILLARD/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d0kgVF"&gt;A new filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission shows that Facebook spent more than $23 million last year on security for CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Facebook’s annual reviews of company security “identified specific threats to Mr. Zuckerberg,” according to a  &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/000132680121000022/facebook2021definitiveprox.htm"&gt;proxy statement filed Friday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n5fk6H"&gt;“He is synonymous with Facebook, and as a result, negative sentiment regarding our company is directly associated with, and often transferred to, Mr. Zuckerberg,” the proxy says of the Facebook CEO’s role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ppohbs"&gt;The company’s annual review of security programs showed the costs of protecting Zuckerberg and his family rose in 2020 mainly due to COVID-19 travel protocols, increased security coverage during the 2020 US election season “and other periods with increased security risk,” as well as rising costs for security personnel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z5AIES"&gt;The “all other compensation” section of the proxy statement shows Facebook spent $23 million for personal security at Zuckerberg’s residences and for travel for him and his family. The CEO also got an additional $10 million to put toward security personnel and other security costs. The cost of base security was up to $13.4 million last year, compared to $10.4 million the year prior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PhByCd"&gt;“The compensation, nominating &amp;amp; governance committee believes that these costs are appropriate and necessary in light of the threat landscape and the fact that Mr. Zuckerberg has requested to receive only $1 in annual salary and does not receive any bonus payments, equity awards, or other incentive compensation,” according to the proxy statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SqRM3L"&gt;Also in the proxy filed Friday, Facebook said it will put forward a proposal at its May 26th shareholder meeting to offer personal security to non-employee directors from time to time, which it says is necessary due to “ongoing scrutiny faced by our directors as a result of their service on our board of directors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ern7kK"&gt;Facebook approved personal security services for some of the non-employee directors in January and February “in light of the high level of scrutiny faced by our company and our executive officers and directors, as well as the dynamic and charged atmosphere following the 2020 U.S. elections and the attack on the U.S. Capitol Building on January 6, 2021,” according to the proxy statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PYeSlE"&gt;A January report by the Tech Transparency Project found that some extremists rioters at the Capitol attack had used &lt;a href="https://www.techtransparencyproject.org/articles/capitol-attack-was-months-making-facebook"&gt;private groups on Facebook for months&lt;/a&gt; to plan and coordinate the January 6th insurgency, despite &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4kbd5KqbIM"&gt;remarks by Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg&lt;/a&gt; that the “events were largely organized on platforms that don’t have our ability to stop hate, don’t have our standards and don’t have our transparency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N1Ij1A"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HUAvsM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NDFNKI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Zu1J0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ujMqXR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SAoLFa"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The team behind Age of Empires IV wants you to learn history while playing the game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/blSolxAoNmpnI23s7V0mXX59Ctw=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69106611/aoe4_campaign_002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DeQa2j"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Age of Empires&lt;/em&gt; games have always taken place against a historical backdrop, but Microsoft and Relic Entertainment want to take things even further with &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires IV&lt;/em&gt;. The game will feature narrated documentaries throughout the campaigns, time period-accurate language and music, as well as art and game design that looks to take inspiration from both world history and the history of the &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires&lt;/em&gt; franchise. On release, &lt;em&gt;Age IV &lt;/em&gt;will focus on the Middle Ages, having players start with small agrarian villages and build up to castles and kings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vY425V"&gt;While players can experience hundreds of years of history in a single match, the game will also feature campaigns that let players go through real-life stories that span generations. So far, the only one announced has been the Norman conquest starting with the Battle of Hastings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4j6gCv"&gt;The campaigns in &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires&lt;/em&gt; have always added some historical context to the battles and missions you’ll be doing, but in &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires IV,&lt;/em&gt; each will be accompanied by documentary footage shot on location. The team behind the game says this is in celebration of history but also works to give players context around what they’re doing. It’s easy to see how this could add to gameplay: skirmishes are fun, but knowing &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; you want to win a battle can really add to the drama of it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zcNiFL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The game wants to present plenty of historical context during every game mode&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dI5SU5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/10/22372742/age-of-empires-fan-preview-new-civilzations-ambush-siege-features"&gt;We got to see some&lt;/a&gt; of the documentary footage in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OJ14RVFDGQ"&gt;the Fan Preview event&lt;/a&gt;, and it looked like the type of thing that would fit in on Netflix or The History Channel, complete with narration, props, and actors in costume. During an interview, Emma Bridle, the director of customer voice for &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires,&lt;/em&gt; told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that she had grown up in England but learned things about British history from the campaign documentaries. (That is great to hear because, as an American, it’ll be even more of a learning experience because I know almost absolutely nothing about British history.) &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cPip_5vP5f0bKIxyDQvK_apS7c8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22434728/Age_of_Empires___Fan_Preview_5OJ14RVFDGQ_Animated_Image__Large_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Gif: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Part of the re-enactments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HaInLp"&gt;The team is also hoping to bring history to life through the audio: starting out, civilizations will be speaking in the ancient versions of their tongues. For example, if you’re playing as the English, you probably won’t be able to understand your units at the beginning of the game, as they’ll be speaking a version of English that’s unrecognizable to modern-day players. However, as you progress, you’ll start to understand more and more of what they say as the language evolves toward what we speak today. Similarly, the music starts as a stripped-down score with only a few instruments, evolving throughout the game to be a full orchestra as your civilization advances. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ypeu4jUglFCf8yq3UUz6m7OWc-Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22432875/AOEIVBuilding.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;According to the game’s art director, the golden people were inspired by illuminated manuscripts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WS9WRx"&gt;In between talking about real-life history, the team also talked about the history of &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires&lt;/em&gt; as a franchise and how &lt;em&gt;Age IV&lt;/em&gt; will continue and evolve its legacy. To anyone who’s played an &lt;em&gt;AoE&lt;/em&gt; game, the art style will look instantly familiar but will have additional flourishes like the golden illuminated people that show the work being done on your buildings. The developers also talked about taking a look at the design of the old game to try to figure out what mechanics and behaviors were deliberate design decisions and which were due to technical limitations that could be tweaked and expanded upon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wFPHkw"&gt;As someone who is a fan of &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires&lt;/em&gt; but is generally ignorant about history, I’m looking forward to being able to learn as I play. While previous games in the franchise did have historical dressing, I can’t say they taught me much. Perhaps that will change with &lt;em&gt;Age IV.&lt;/em&gt; But it seems that the game wants to present plenty of historical context during every game mode, both about ancient civilizations and not-so-ancient games.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Everything we learned about Age of Empires IV’s new civilizations, campaigns, and wololos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LGTXc5zc-EPlIY_23Q82V6JvN90=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69106533/aoe4_naval_002.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7EMU9b"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYeEH4"&gt;We haven’t heard much about &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires IV&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/22/16182760/age-of-empires-iv-development-microsoft-pc-release-date"&gt;since it was announced in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, but we’ve finally been given a look at the game, which includes the Mongols and Delhi Sultanate as playable civilizations. Microsoft and developer Relic Entertainment showed off a healthy amount of gameplay footage as well as new features and civilizations coming to the series &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OJ14RVFDGQ"&gt;in a “Fan Preview” event&lt;/a&gt;. The game also has a release window: fall 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xhNIzS"&gt;The last main entry in the long-running historical strategy series &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Empires_III"&gt;was released in 2005&lt;/a&gt;, and the new game looks to build on the formula created by previous entries, while adding features made possible by 15-ish years of technological improvements. That includes the obvious things — like 4K and HDR — to more strategy game-centric upgrades, like new pathfinding that will accommodate tons of units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NUEI7x"&gt;According to the team behind the game, there will be eight civilizations in the initial release of the game. So far, we know four of them: the Delhi Sultanate are making their first appearances in &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires&lt;/em&gt;, and the Mongols (who are getting a big upgrade), Chinese and English will be returning. So far, there hasn’t been a lot of information about the unique abilities and traits of each civilization. However, we did get to see that the Delhi Sultanate will include elephant units and that the Mongols will have the ability to pack up and move their buildings and towns (which is mind-blowing to see in action).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r9tZy1q0LDg4dju75xP_B92QyY8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430111/aoe4_mon_008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A highly portable Mongol camp.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7vJynW"&gt;During a Q&amp;amp;A, Relic talked a lot about adding asymmetry to civilizations; the team wanted to make sure that each played differently, with the randomly generated maps playing to different civilizations’ strengths and weaknesses. For example, a wide-open map could benefit the Mongols with their highly mobile units and towns, while a map with a lot of chokepoints could benefit the defense-heavy English. There will still be similar classes of units, but the developers wanted to make sure that players could switch up the gameplay style if they wanted to and even main a certain civilization if they really like its mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxqoRG"&gt;The game’s creators also talked about the evolution of campaigns, which act as a sort of story mode in &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires&lt;/em&gt;. They revealed that there would be four campaigns in the game but only shared details about one: the Norman conquest. I’m not enough of a history buff to know anything about that, but it seems like the game will be trying to teach me. The team talked extensively about the fact that campaigns would include documentary footage with narration about the real-life historical events that you’ll be playing through.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7A3PVL767VmQbkJjCZcocmu3LJE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430127/aoe4_campaign_002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I bet this campaign screenshot is really cool if you know the historical context.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="S5bYYy"&gt;The game will also include some new mechanics. The studio showed off a very interesting feature called stealth force, which allows players to create ambushes where enemies will not be able to see their units hiding and waiting. It’s a feature the creators hope will not only add excitement and tension to gameplay, but will actually give you a reason to keep scout units around, as you’ll need to make sure there isn’t an entire army hiding along your route. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pk1guGRtwQwt181BNG9l5AEXl_g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430116/aoe4_campaigngameplay_004.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6A6j98"&gt;The event also showed off wall combat, where units were able to fight both in front of and on top of castle walls, and siege mechanics, where a base could be surrounded by units and — as the name implies — siege weapons. These two mechanics should help to make raiding and defending castles more strategic. We also got a brief glimpse at an area-of-effect wololo, something that’s very intriguing for fans of &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires&lt;/em&gt; and memes alike. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wololo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sWbDqn"&gt;Fans of older entries in the series also have things to look forward to. The developers talked about &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires IV&lt;/em&gt; being a spiritual successor to &lt;em&gt;AoE II&lt;/em&gt;, while still incorporating some elements from &lt;em&gt;III,&lt;/em&gt; such as the addition of choice into the aging-up mechanics. The Definitive Edition of &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;II&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;III&lt;/em&gt; are also getting updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOMzqL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition&lt;/em&gt; is getting its second expansion pack, titled Dawn of Dukes, which will focus on Eastern Europe. Co-op will also be coming to the game at some point this year, which will allow you to play through certain campaigns and battles with friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OUUAcH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition&lt;/em&gt; is getting the United States added as a civilization in an update. Cleverly, the update will be free if you play through a challenge, but players who don’t want to go through the effort will be able to purchase it from Steam or the Microsoft Store. It was also revealed that the first &lt;em&gt;AoE III: Definitive Edition&lt;/em&gt; expansion is being worked on and will feature African civilizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dTLJ1f"&gt;As someone who played hundreds of hours of &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires II&lt;/em&gt;, I’m excited for the tech tree advancements in &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires IV&lt;/em&gt;. Of course, I’d also love more details, especially after such a long wait since the announcement. What other civilizations will we get to play? What do the plans for future expansions look like? Will there be fun cheat codes? These questions are unanswered for now, but it seems like it won’t be entire age before we find out. I look forward to finding out that I forgot everything about how to play the game and immediately getting crushed by an easy AI when it finally releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BANN4W"&gt;Age of Empires IV will be available on Windows 10 PCs through Steam, the Microsoft Store, and Xbox Game Pass for PC in fall 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w6OcVQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;A previous version of this article stated that the Mongols would be making their first appearance in &lt;/em&gt;Age of Empires IV&lt;em&gt;, but they were also in &lt;/em&gt;Age of Empires II&lt;em&gt;. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
