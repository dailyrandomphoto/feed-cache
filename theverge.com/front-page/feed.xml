    <title>Google says Bing users search for Google more than anything else</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5z8x5CBaVjPKA_RFq44BAlTgck4=/0x0:1284x856/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69935667/Screen_Shot_2021_09_30_at_3.56.31_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DUkEcn"&gt;“Google” is the most searched term on Bing “by far,” according to a lawyer working for Google’s parent company, Alphabet. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-28/google-tells-judges-it-s-so-popular-it-s-bing-s-top-search-term?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Google made the argument while trying to get its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/18/17580694/google-android-eu-fine-antitrust"&gt;$5 billion antitrust fine from the EU&lt;/a&gt; overturned, using the statistic as evidence that people use Google by choice, not force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D7oJXT"&gt;The fine Google faces is from the European Commission, which says that Google has abused its position as the maker of Android. The regulator says that Google will have to stop forcing handset makers to pre-install Chrome and Google search if they want to have Android. Google’s argument? That most people would just use its search engine anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XcX5eB"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/top-bing-searches/"&gt;statistics compiled by SEO company Ahrefs&lt;/a&gt;, “google” is indeed the top searched term on Bing worldwide. It’s followed by “youtube,” “facebook,” “gmail,” and “amazon,” but it beats the runner-up by around 5 million searches. Looking at data for just the US, Facebook is number one, with Google being number three. At first glance, it does seem like people are using Microsoft’s search engine to get to Google’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RVLrGH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Bing is the seventh most searched term on Bing in the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SNFEwv"&gt;But hold on a minute. According to Ahrefs statistics, “bing homepage quiz” is Bing’s fifth most searched term in the US, and “bing” itself is number seven. The search engine’s own name is its tenth most-searched term globally. What’s going on here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjFckH"&gt;Well, part of it may be because of defaults. For Microsoft Edge (and Internet Explorer before it), Bing is the default search engine — if you type something into that bar that isn’t a URL, it’s going to take you to the Bing results page. If you’ve ever watched someone who isn’t particularly good with computers try to visit a website, you may know where this is going. For many folks, typing in “Google” and clicking on the first link that comes up is how they get to Google, and it’s the same for Facebook, YouTube, and any other website they try to visit. Why bother adding a .com to the end when you can usually get to what you’re looking for with an extra click?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Yfw5uo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Please do the four extra keystrokes to type .com&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DnUlYR"&gt;Of course, most techy people know why that’s not the best route — I’ve personally had to help relatives who’ve gotten viruses because somebody made a malicious ad that popped up as the first result on Google when searching for a popular website. But that’s how some people use the web. The numbers are also potentially bolstered by Bing’s integration with the Start Menu search bar. If you click on one of the web results, it’ll take you straight to Microsoft’s search engine (and people may search for “Google” there a lot, given &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers#Summary_tables"&gt;Google Chrome’s popularity&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x78wS9"&gt;When contacted asking whether it could verify what Bing’s most searched term was, Microsoft said it didn’t have anything to share. Google also didn’t respond to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fic9IG"&gt;As for whether this helps or hurts Google’s argument, that’s really for the judge to decide. It’s just funny that, at least in part, Microsoft’s default search may have helped Google make its argument against the massive fine proposed for &lt;em&gt;its&lt;/em&gt; default search.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube TV and NBCUniversal agree to ‘short’ extension to avoid channels disappearing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration the NBC Sunday Night Football..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gQs2Mooy9zkEvi7IFzPtYRsZ0vQ=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69935171/1224647361.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5IhHkm"&gt;Following a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22695937/nbcuniversal-youtube-tv-carriage-dispute"&gt;public standoff&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week, YouTube TV and NBCUniversal have agreed to a “short” extension over the streaming service carrying several of the broadcaster’s channels. That means that at least for now, YouTube TV will continue to carry more than a dozen major NBCUniversal-owned channels, including NBC regional sports networks. But it also means YouTube TV’s monthly subscription cost won’t be getting $10 cheaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XCSHvl"&gt;Had talks broken down, NBCUniversal programming would have been removed from YouTube TV at midnight ET. “NBCUniversal and YouTube TV have agreed to a short extension while parties continue talks,” an NBCUniversal spokesperson tells &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jank0/status/1443773993119469570"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2021/09/youtube-tv-nbcu-deal-explained.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vulture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “NBCUniversal will not go dark on YouTube TV at midnight eastern tonight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7xOXNS"&gt;YouTube said in a &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-tv-and-nbc-programming-update/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week that should the companies fail to reach an agreement about carriage, it would slash its monthly subscription cost from $65 per month to $55 per month — undercutting comparatively priced live TV streaming services like Hulu with Live TV and FuboTV. But that would mean that YouTube TV users would lose a dozen-plus NBC channels, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="9uT75t"&gt;NBC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FXM4fG"&gt;Bravo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6kLUEx"&gt;CNBC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fzHULB"&gt;E!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2YViN7"&gt;Golf Channel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uD9Jpf"&gt;MSNBC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hRIX6q"&gt;Oxygen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4akJE3"&gt;Syfy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4Jx8NK"&gt;Telemundo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Tx1jfb"&gt;The Olympic Channel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nh0mtc"&gt;Universal Kids&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="F0LgTZ"&gt;Universo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7CLBb8"&gt;USA Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="DoKsAs"&gt;As well as regional sports networks that include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="G9EjTj"&gt;NBC Sports Bay Area&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1gauL3"&gt;NBC Sports Boston&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZQPTSH"&gt;NBC Sports California&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YwwI4q"&gt;NBC Sports Chicago&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3okHSr"&gt;NBC Sports Philadelphia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bGCh71"&gt;NBC Sports Washington&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rYhCfK"&gt;SNY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="qGTwmA"&gt;According to NBCUniversal, the standoff over carriage — which has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/14/18623037/disney-hulu-netflix-warnermedia-att-friends-the-office-this-is-us-streaming"&gt;become&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/21445118/roku-nbc-tv-everywhere-channels-peacock-streaming-distribution-comcast"&gt;all&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21495642/youtube-tv-fox-regional-sports-networks-streaming-sinclair-mlb-nhl-nba"&gt;too&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/27/21156521/youtube-tv-fox-rsn-regional-sports-network-yes-sinclair"&gt;common&lt;/a&gt; in the streaming wars, particularly when it comes to regional sports programming — involved a demand for what an NBCUniversal source close to the matter described as a fair rate relating to marketplace terms. A spokesperson for YouTube, meanwhile, said that the company was negotiating for terms that it sees as fair based on industry standards and the size of its service. The spokesperson also said that NBCUniversal asked YouTube TV to bundle Peacock, which the spokesperson claimed would result in users paying twice for the same content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0gxJz"&gt;YouTube preemptively said earlier this week that users looking for NBCUniversal-owned programming could head to NBCUniversal’s own flagship streaming service Peacock to access their NBC programming. Peacock’s Premium tier costs $5 per month, meaning that YouTube TV users would be saving a few bucks. But they would have to use two different apps to stream content that is accessible in a single, dedicated live TV service.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EA promotes Laura Miele to COO, making her one of the most powerful women in gaming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Collision 2019 - Day Three" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W5-JFhyssYLXCn-cWqTNDKU-Pkw=/0x0:4910x3273/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69934904/1145669613.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo By Stephen McCarthy/Sportsfile via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="awuqT7"&gt;Electronic Arts is promoting chief studios officer Laura Miele to chief operating officer, &lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/news/driving-transformation-for-players-and-growth-for-our-company"&gt;the company announced Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. The change is a big promotion for Miele, who already had significant leadership at the company overseeing 25 different studios. The new role will give Miele greater oversight over the company and arguably makes her the most powerful woman in gaming, an industry where there are few female executives, fewer in the C-suite, and where those C-suite execs are often in charge of HR or finance rather than the company’s products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kciWhb"&gt;Ubisoft did make Virginie Hass its chief studios operating officer last August, following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332534/ubisoft-serge-hascoet-harassment-sexism-racism-metoo"&gt;scandals over a toxic culture including sexual harassment and misconduct&lt;/a&gt; that went as high as the C-suite ranks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zfm5u"&gt;Miele joined EA in 1996 and has served as chief studios officer since April 2018. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke with Miele in July, where she discussed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22587115/ea-pandemic-game-development-laura-miele-interview"&gt;how the pandemic changed development&lt;/a&gt; at EA. Miele will move into the role over the next few months, according to an &lt;a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000712515/4bb534e7-2a16-45c6-8908-d94aba9bb285.pdf"&gt;SEC filing (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vpHJ1w"&gt;EA also announced that chief financial officer Blake Jorgensen will be leaving the company. He’s expected to depart in 2022, and a search to replace him “will begin immediately.” Chris Bruzzo, who was previously the company’s executive vice president of marketing, commercial, and positive play, will become the company’s chief experience officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="sgkv2m"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"EA exec on how the pandemic changed development: ‘I don’t think we will ever go back’","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22587115/ea-pandemic-game-development-laura-miele-interview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Foxconn is buying Lordstown Motors’ Ohio EV factory for $230 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Lordstown Motors Headquarters Ahead Of Earnings Figures" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HfWt7XNqGKBkt7qkW6nzTYD6sRk=/4x0:3996x2661/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69931850/1232963349.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="63Shtf"&gt;iPhone assembler Foxconn is buying an automotive factory from struggling EV startup Lordstown Motors for around $230 million, the companies &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/09/30/2306712/0/en/Lordstown-Motors-and-Hon-Hai-Technology-Group-Announce-Agreement-in-Principle.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; late Thursday. Foxconn says it has agreed to build Lordstown Motors’ electric pickup truck at the plant, which is where General Motors used to make the Chevrolet Cruze, and that the startup will remain a tenant there. Lordstown Motors will also “agree to provide Foxconn with certain rights with respect to future vehicle programs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TmMNZn"&gt;The deal gives the Taiwanese conglomerate its first automotive factory, and a significant new presence in the United States — one that the company will use as it tries to establish itself as a global electric vehicle automaker. Foxconn previously announced a massive LCD panel factory in Wisconsin &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump"&gt;but has failed to live up to the myriad promises&lt;/a&gt; it made to that state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nTnp27"&gt;As part of the deal, Foxconn is also buying $50 million worth of Lordstown Motors shares. The startup has recently admitted it needs to raise money quickly in order to survive, despite going public last year. News of the factory sale was first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-30/lordstown-nears-deal-to-sell-ohio-car-plant-to-taiwan-s-foxconn?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; early&lt;/a&gt; Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ozNjEu"&gt;Lordstown Motors bought the 6.2-million-square-foot facility from General Motors in 2019 shortly after the Detroit automaker closed it down — a decision that drew the ire of then-president Trump. The startup previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620787/lordstown-motors-q2-2021-earnings-gm-factory-production-manufacturing"&gt;announced in August&lt;/a&gt; that it was planning to rent out space at the factory in an effort to make money amid a serious cash crunch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M05uqb"&gt;Since buying it, Lordstown Motors has put about $240 million worth of work into getting the factory ready to build its electric pickup truck, the Endurance. A spokesperson for Lordstown Motors declined to comment. Foxconn did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Tys6q"&gt;When GM sold the factory to Lordstown Motors, Trump praised the deal as “GREAT NEWS FOR OHIO!” But the startup — which was founded by the former CEO of Workhorse, another struggling EV startup — has run into an incredible amount of trouble ever since, despite going public and raising hundreds of millions of dollars in 2020. Lordstown Motors’ CEO was forced out earlier this year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532976/lordstown-motors-ceo-steve-burns-resign-short-seller-investigation"&gt;after he was caught lying about the veracity of the preorders for its truck&lt;/a&gt;. The startup has lowered its initial production goals for that truck, too. Both the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560891/lordstown-motors-sdny-doj-investigation"&gt;launched probes into Lordstown Motors&lt;/a&gt;, and the company has said it only has enough money to survive through mid-2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tSzMQv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Inside Foxconn’s empty buildings, empty factories, and empty promises in Wisconsin","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump"},{"title":"Foxconn is dangling a shiny new EV plant in front of Wisconsin","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22569992/foxconn-fisker-wisconsin-electric-vehicle-factory-talks"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wBAayZ"&gt;Foxconn has spent much of the last year talking about expanding into electric vehicles as a way to diversify away from consumer electronics. It has struck deals with the likes of Geely, which is China’s largest private automaker, as well as Fisker Inc., a California EV startup that has yet to make an electric vehicle. Foxconn has also developed its own electric vehicle platform that it intends to sell to other automakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aU7S1x"&gt;In March, Foxconn said it would reveal the location where it would build EVs with Fisker Inc. by July, but that self-imposed deadline came and went. The company had considered using the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump"&gt;mostly empty complex it built in Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt; — another project that the Trump administration touted highly — but Fisker founder Henrik Fisker said he didn’t want to build his cars in a state that &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2021/08/09/fisker-ev-plans-for-underused-foxconn-site-hit-snag-on-wisconsin-auto-sales-rules/?sh=2f5f19ea79de"&gt;wouldn’t allow him to sell directly to consumers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jiNo7Q"&gt;Foxconn said Thursday that, as part of the deal, Fisker Inc. will be allowed to make vehicles with the Taiwanese conglomerate in the Ohio factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OrBkVA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 30th, 8:32PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added new information from the press release about the deal between Foxconn and Lordstown Motors, and changed the headline to reflect that the deal has been officially announced. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zoom won’t buy Five9 after all</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eX8ITlt86e3STudJYXS6_SOInFs=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69934738/acastro_200331_1777_zoom_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9JxH8h"&gt;Five9 will remain independent — its deal to be acquired by Zoom is off. Though a &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210930006016/en/"&gt;press release from Five9&lt;/a&gt; says it was “terminated by mutual agreement,” it’s also the case that Five9 shareholders rejected the $14.7 billion deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzYv5n"&gt;Zoom originally announced the acquisition &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583371/zoom-buys-five9-14-7-billion-videoconferencing-lockdown"&gt;on July 18th&lt;/a&gt;. Five9 automates managing customer contacts for businesses, and the deal was supposed to bolster Zoom’s business offerings. Its major competitors are behemoths like Microsoft and Google, and the deal would have helped the smaller company expand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBFwf8"&gt;This was supposed to be an &lt;a href="https://investors.zoom.us/news-releases/news-release-details/zoom-acquire-five9"&gt;all-stock transaction&lt;/a&gt;, but unfortunately for Zoom, its stock price has lost more than a quarter of its value since they announced the acquisition. Usually, when a company is bought, shareholders receive a premium over their stock price; because this was an all-stock deal, however, Zoom would be picking up Five9 &lt;em&gt;at a discount.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c8unhg"&gt;Earlier this month, Institutional Shareholder Services, an independent proxy advisor, &lt;a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/technology/iss-tells-five9-investors-to-reject-zoom-s-14-7-billion-offer"&gt;recommended shareholders vote against the deal&lt;/a&gt;. The government also had a thing or two to say about possible &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/zooms-nearly-15-billion-deal-for-five9-under-u-s-government-review-over-china-ties-11632247337"&gt;national security risks&lt;/a&gt;, which probably didn’t help matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yn1LuN"&gt;In a blog post &lt;a href="https://blog.zoom.us/zoom-whats-next/"&gt;published Thursday&lt;/a&gt;, Zoom CEO Eric Yuan says the failed acquisition won’t significantly affect Zoom’s plans. Five9 “was in no way foundational to the success of our platform nor was it the only way for us to offer our customers a compelling contact center solution,” he said. Zoom plans to keep its “long-standing partnerships” with Five9 and other companies that offer similar services.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney and Scarlett Johansson have settled their lawsuit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ELzQ-sgHRiddp7JxPAbw7A9NBOs=/232x0:2737x1670/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69934715/fbg7020_comp_v003_bf38a189.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9pOEWt"&gt;Three months after Scarlett Johansson &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22600396/scarlett-johansson-suing-disney-black-widow-release"&gt;sued Disney over its streaming release of &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, arguing she stood to lose millions of dollars because her salary was based on the box office performance of the film, the suit has now been settled, according to &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/scarlett-johansson-disney-settle-black-widow-lawsuit-1235022598/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/scarlett-johansson-disney-lawsuit-settled-1235078355"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/30/business/scarlett-johansson-disney-black-widow.html?smid=tw-share"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and others. Representatives for Johansson confirmed the settlement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oeinh2"&gt;While the terms of the settlement don’t appear to be public, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/09/disney-black-widow-lawsuit-scarlett-johansson-rsettlement-1234847437/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline &lt;/em&gt;cites a source&lt;/a&gt; saying that the deal was in the “tens of millions.” Both parties have paid lip service to continuing to work together: Johansson told &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt; that she was “happy to have resolved our differences with Disney,” and “look[s] forward to continuing our collaboration in years to come.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mAqxgN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Johansson will be in at least one upcoming Disney movie&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MkbdLR"&gt;“We appreciate her contributions to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and look forward to working together on a number of upcoming projects, including Disney’s &lt;em&gt;Tower of Terror,” &lt;/em&gt;wrote Disney Studios chairman Alan Bergman, according to &lt;em&gt;THR&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="drjqkk"&gt;When filing the lawsuit, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22600396/scarlett-johansson-suing-disney-black-widow-release"&gt;the actress claimed&lt;/a&gt; that her contract with the film studio didn’t allow for films to be released on streaming the same day they came to theaters. Disney, however, released &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; day-and-date on Disney Plus (a practice that it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434964/disney-theatrical-window-45-days-shorter-streaming-shang-chi-free-guy"&gt;now started to walk back&lt;/a&gt; on with a 45-day theater window). &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/scarlett-johansson-sues-disney-over-black-widow-streaming-release-11627579278?st=b43fty44c1jljjq&amp;amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this move could have cost Johansson $50 million, as her salary was tied to the film’s box office performance — the argument goes that since people were able to see it at home, they didn’t pay for it in theaters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rgwsJT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Disney claims Johansson earned $20 million for work on &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xe0A8w"&gt;During the lawsuit, Disney said that Johansson &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-disney-and-scarlett-johansson-reached-the-point-of-no-return-11630688765"&gt;had been paid $20 million for her role&lt;/a&gt; in the film, and could earn more from its release on Disney Plus, where viewers had to pay $30 to watch it during its initial release. &lt;a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl2122089985/"&gt;Box Office Mojo estimates&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; brought in almost $379 million from its theater run. When attempting to negotiate with Disney, Johansson’s team &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-disney-and-scarlett-johansson-reached-the-point-of-no-return-11630688765"&gt;reportedly based their numbers&lt;/a&gt; on an estimate that the film would’ve brought in $1.2 billion had it not been for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21437889/black-widow-delayed-release-date-marvel-cinematic-universe-disney-streaming-mulan"&gt;multiple COVID delays&lt;/a&gt; and eventual joint release on Disney Plus. That figure is similar to what other Marvel movies like &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Far From Home &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Captain Marvel &lt;/em&gt;are estimated to have earned from their pre-pandemic theater runs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iWVQWS"&gt;Other stars &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-disney-and-scarlett-johansson-reached-the-point-of-no-return-11630688765"&gt;like Emma Stone&lt;/a&gt; have negotiated to be paid extra for films released during the pandemic, but Johansson said that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611516/scarlett-johansson-disney-lawsuit-streaming-services-transparency"&gt;her contract with Disney was signed in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, before it even announced its streaming service. &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; lead Elizabeth Olsen &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2021/08/awards-insider-elizabeth-olsen-and-jason-sudeikis-bring-their-characters-to-the-world-of-streaming"&gt;declared her support for Johansson’s suit&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;, saying that she was worried about theaters going away. Others in the industry have expressed concern about how streaming services would affect actors’ paychecks, given the lack of transparency that can come with viewing numbers. It’s notable when a streaming service like Netflix &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22697364/netflix-viewing-data-code-2021"&gt;publicly states how many accounts watch certain shows&lt;/a&gt;, because that’s not the norm.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lil Nas X, Bella Poarch, Grimes, and more are releasing TikTok NFTs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Celebrities Visit The SiriusXM Studios In New York City" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XbWRBB61EUoHBcpfCP6QGxYa_tw=/0x0:2760x1840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69934187/1340301664.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Cindy Ord/Getty Images for SiriusXM&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9arAGY"&gt;Because no peace can be found in the age of man, TikTok has decided to partner with select creators, celebrities, and online entities like Lil Nas X, Bella Poarch, and Grimes &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-launches-first-creator-led-nft-collection-powered-by-immutable-x"&gt;to release a collection of non-fungible tokens&lt;/a&gt;. These TikTok Top Moments, as the company is calling them, are inspired by six “culturally significant” TikTok videos in the form of one-of-one NFTs. TikTok plans to auction them alongside a selection of limited edition NFTs it’ll sell weekly throughout October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fFdwrI"&gt;The partnerships, creators, and new material being tokenized and put up for auction vary. Musician Lil Nas X is up first on October 6th with a collaboration with artist Rudy Willingham, while Grimes is collaborating with Brittany Broski (“Kombucha Girl”), and separately with Bella Poarch. TikTok’s full list of collaborations goes into more detail about these selections and more, but is oddly missing details on how creators will actually get paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="bVW4QX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"NFTs, explained ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="uuB5td"&gt;“Proceeds will largely go directly to the creators and NFT artists involved,” TikTok writes, but the company declined to break down specific percentages when asked by &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;TikTok says a majority of the earnings will go to the creators of the NFTs. The rest will go to Immutable X, which handles NFT trading for the set, and the Museum of the Moving Image, which will be hosting a TikTok exhibit displaying the six main pieces in the TikTok collection. TikTok will not take any proceeds from sales, and says that the weekly drops of limited edition NFTs will “be sold at accessible price points to ensure each creator’s audience can own a piece of their history.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ivFK8C"&gt;While “owning” a viral TikTok might be an exciting idea, it’s worth acknowledging the environmental impact it could pose. NFTs and other blockchain-based projects &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change"&gt;have the potential to use massive amounts of energy&lt;/a&gt;, by design. Immutable X says the NFTs it helps TikTok mint will be carbon neutral, but not all NFTs or NFT marketplaces are created equal. Similarly, whether you actually “own” the video NFT you purchase is — outside of the philosophical implications — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331818/nifty-gateway-hack-steal-nfts-credit-card"&gt;dependent on the security&lt;/a&gt; of wherever they’re stored. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pixel phones can automatically record and upload video in an emergency</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ll17K8onLEikeQeERYoLNcP_L2E=/0x0:1325x883/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69934104/pixel_4a_blue.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bFfyTE"&gt;One of the features Google offers exclusively through its Pixel Android phones is the Personal Safety app. Over the years, it’s added features like a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/1/21276908/google-pixel-feature-drop-june-2020-safety-check-bedtime"&gt;safety check-in&lt;/a&gt; that automatically notifies your emergency contacts if you don’t respond as scheduled and the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20892875/google-pixel-personal-safety-app-car-crash-detection"&gt;automatically dial 911 if it detects you’ve been in a car accident&lt;/a&gt;. Now &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/personal-safety-emergency-sos-feature/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA-Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-pixels-personal-safety-app-can-now-automatically-record-video-during-an-emergency/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;point out a new feature that can automatically record video if you activate the built-in Emergency SOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PhyMgt"&gt;We installed the update &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.safetyhub"&gt;from Google Play&lt;/a&gt; on a Pixel device. It informs users that it can record continuously for up to 45 minutes once it’s activated, assuming your phone has enough storage. If there’s an internet connection, the video will get automatically backed up to your Google Account, where it will be stored for seven days. If you tell the app to Share Automatically, it will send a link for that video file to any Emergency Contacts you’ve selected.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Pixel Emergency SOS settings screens" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4amWXmqiGkbZkS4EXoJhTcCKKko=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22891927/pixel_emergency_sos_settings.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Cameron Faulkner&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Pixel Emergency SOS settings screens&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CQoRwE"&gt;If you have a Pixel phone, you can find the feature in the Personal Safety app’s settings. To activate the Emergency SOS, users press the phone’s power button five times. While it’s active, the phone is still available for you to use with a minimized viewfinder and notification icon to indicate that a recording is happening. The SOS can do other things depending on your settings, including calling 911, choosing to play (or not play) an alarm sound when activated, or share information with your emergency contacts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BEneYV"&gt;For other phones, Google &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/05/19/android-12s-new-emergency-sos-feature-is-back-in-beta-1/"&gt;tested a version of Emergency SOS in early betas for Android 12&lt;/a&gt;, but right now, this app and feature set is only for the Pixel line.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA: Neiman Marcus still exists and it was hacked</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A Neiman Marcus storefront" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CoLg9O50PTnTx74Jdpg5hwVL5a0=/0x62:5685x3852/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69934061/1228428799.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Luxury retailer Neiman Marcus has notified 4.6 million customers about a data breach | Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6E9nLs"&gt;Luxury retailer Neiman Marcus &lt;a href="https://www.neimanmarcusgroup.com/2021-09-30-Neiman-Marcus-Confirms-Unauthorized-Access-to-Customer-Online-Accounts"&gt;said Thursday&lt;/a&gt; it had notified 4.6 million customers that their personal information, including credit card numbers. may have been part of a May 2020 data breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pkYh2l"&gt;The Dallas-based company said in a news release that an “unauthorized third party obtained personal information associated with certain Neiman Marcus customers’ online accounts.” Neiman Marcus notified law enforcement, and is “working quickly to determine the nature and scope of the matter.” The company did not say who was responsible for the breach or how they were able to access its systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h5XNxb"&gt;The data access may have included names and contact information, credit card numbers, and expiration dates— but not the CVV numbers on the back of the cards— Neiman Marcus gift cards, usernames, passwords, and security questions and answers “associated with Neiman Marcus online accounts.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zn0srX"&gt;According to the company, more than 85 percent of the 3.1 million payment and virtual gift cards affected “were expired or invalid,” and no active store brand credit cards were affected. Parent company Neiman Marcus Group (NMG)  said its other retailers Bergdorf Goodman and Horchow did not appear to have been part of the breach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3fW59f"&gt;After it learned of the breach, NMG says it required customers who had not changed their online account passwords since May 2020 to reset them. CEO Geoffroy van Raemdonck said NMG would “continue to take actions to enhance our system security and safeguard information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="baAWFo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.neimanmarcus.com%2Feditorial%2Fsecurity%2Fonline-accounts&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F30%2F22703171%2Fneiman-marcus-hacked-security-credit-cards" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The company has set up a website&lt;/a&gt; for customers to get more information about the breach, as well as a phone number: 866-571-9725.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How the Surface Laptop Studio and Surface Pro 8 stack up against other creator laptops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Surface Laptop Studio" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KG1pPCiMFMJcaHhRsaVgZ3en4r0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69933878/bfarsace_210921_4770_0019.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5FWQMS"&gt;Microsoft announced a new version of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22685923/microsoft-surface-pro-8-specs-price-release-date"&gt;Surface Pro&lt;/a&gt; last week, along with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22686010/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-price-specs-release-date"&gt;Surface Laptop Studio&lt;/a&gt;. The Surface Pro 8 feels very much like a logical evolution of Microsoft’s tablet / laptop. Some of the more notable improvements include a 120Hz display with slimmer bezels, Thunderbolt 4 support, as well as a reworked surface keyboard that includes a dedicated space to store and charge the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22686095/microsoft-surface-slim-pen-2-haptics-features-price-release-date"&gt;Surface Slim Pen 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vCXxU1"&gt;Meanwhile, the Surface Laptop Studio features a uniquely hinged screen and more powerful hardware. This is effectively a replacement for the Surface Book 3, with a three-point adjustable display that can lay flat for drawing or snap upright to deliver a more traditional laptop experience. This laptop comes equipped with an Nvidia RTX 3050 Ti GPU and a four-core, 4.8GHz, 11th Gen Intel processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CY3oWn"&gt;Perhaps the coolest thing to come out of the event was the Surface Slim Pen 2, which aesthetically appears like any other stylus, but includes haptic feedback to simulate the subtle tactile response you get from putting a pen to paper. While the inclusion of a stylus is hardly revolutionary, improvements to the overall user experience are nice to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mpq31I"&gt;But how do the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22686705/microsoft-surface-pro-8-keyboard-screen-photos-video-hands-on"&gt;Surface Pro 8&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22686706/microsoft-surface-studio-laptop-design-specs-photos-hands-on"&gt;Surface Laptop Studio&lt;/a&gt; stack up against other laptops that occupy the creator and power user space? We’ve collected a few of our favorites below for comparison based on our early impressions and spec sheets, with full reviews to follow in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tYNcsP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to preorder all of the new Surface hardware","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22683783/microsoft-surface-pro-x-8-3-go-laptop-studio-preorder-price-date"},{"title":"Here’s how much buying into Microsoft’s pro Surface vision actually costs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22688403/surface-pro-8-duo-studio-x-go-true-price-keyboard-pen-stylus-bundle"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="ot9Igy"&gt;Versus the Surface Laptop Studio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Ma4ruS"&gt;We chose the 14-inch models of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22264792/hp-spectre-x360-14-laptop-stylus-oled-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Spectre X360&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22430445/acer-conceptd-7-ezel-2021-review"&gt;Acer ConceptD Ezel&lt;/a&gt; because of their competitive pricing, which includes a stylus, and also for their ability to reorient themselves in some creative ways. (The new Microsoft devices don’t include the Surface Slim Pen 2, which costs $130 separately.) &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeCreatorLaptops093021&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fpdp%2Fhp-spectre-x360-laptop-14t-ea000-touch-1q881av-1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The Spectre&lt;/a&gt; is technically a 2-in-1 and can operate effectively as a tablet if you flip the screen over, though it doesn’t hold it up at an angle quite like the Surface Laptop Studio. The &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Facer-conceptd-7-ezel-cc715-71-7196-laptop%2F8v916pqmq44c%3Focid%3DAID2200057_aff_7593_1243925%26tduid%3D%28ir__0thgbaanw9kfqhhygvquhus6yn2xrv21qkgxj29e00%29%287593%29%281243925%29%28nOD_rLJHOac-8dpOdXgdIleApxHzJMABfw%29%28%29%26activetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab%26ranMID%3D24542%26ranEAID%3DnOD%252frLJHOac%26ranSiteID%3DnOD_rLJHOac-8dpOdXgdIleApxHzJMABfw%26epi%3DnOD_rLJHOac-8dpOdXgdIleApxHzJMABfw%26irgwc%3D1%26irclickid%3D_0thgbaanw9kfqhhygvquhus6yn2xrv21qkgxj29e00" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ConceptD Ezel&lt;/a&gt;, meanwhile, can flip out its screen and prop itself up like an easel or lay flat like a tablet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7CWKEi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10777072"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qmwVig"&gt;We also threw in the Laptop Studio’s predecessor, the 13.5-inch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21271796/microsoft-surface-book-3-review-price-specs-features-13-5-screen"&gt;Surface Book 3&lt;/a&gt;. The screen may not fold or flip, but it can still operate as a tablet when detached from its keyboard. We considered adding the 15-inch version of the Surface Book 3, but its &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fstore%2Fconfigure%2FSurface-Book-3%2F8XBW9G3Z71F1%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starting price of $2,300&lt;/a&gt; made it just a little too expensive when stacked against its competition.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lS2sz3"&gt;Still, the Surface Laptop Studio sets itself apart by offering a greater battery life and likely a superior dedicated GPU option to any of these other machines. It also has the distinction of being the only laptop in our lineup with a 120Hz refresh rate display, a feature typically reserved for gaming laptops. You’d generally need to look at a gaming-class laptop if you need a higher-end GPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="30BNMX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10768014"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HKxepF"&gt;Versus the Surface Pro 8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3PomAq"&gt;The unique form factor of Surface devices makes them tough to compare, but the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569871/lenovo-yoga-9i-14-inch-laptop-review"&gt;Lenovo Yoga 9i&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;Apple MacBook M1 Air&lt;/a&gt; make a strong case as ultraportables outside the Surface ecosystem that cater to creatives, and we’re also including the previous-gen &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-pro-7%2F8n17j0m5zzqs%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Surface Pro 7&lt;/a&gt; for comparison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="04Pq9K"&gt;Like previous generations of Surface, the new Surface Pro 8 doesn’t come with a pen or keyboard to start. The &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-slim-pen-2%2F8tb9xw8rwc14%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%253aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new Slim Pen 2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-pro-signature-keyboard%2F90fj6zkw1rzb%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%253aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Surface Pro Signature Keyboard&lt;/a&gt; will cost you $130 and $180, respectively, but can also be &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-pro-signature-keyboard-with-slim-pen-2%2F8vdb5vrkc5tq%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%253aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;bundled for $280&lt;/a&gt;. Obviously, the other laptops we’re discussing come with built-in keyboards, and the Yoga i9 includes the pen as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zk9g3e"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10771697"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="95GkMo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfFKTLj8MM4#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The Lenovo&lt;/a&gt; also shares many of the same hardware specifications as the Surface Pro 8, with options for an 11th Gen Core i5 or i7 CPU. It does make a couple of compromises, most notably in the resolution and refresh rate of its display. These caveats could be overlooked by anyone who needs to save a little more money, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gpMQIw"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LNQCX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook M1 Air&lt;/a&gt; is really the outlier of this lineup, not just because of its OS, but because it’s also the only laptop we picked that doesn’t have a touchscreen or can operate as a 2-in-1. It does, however, strike a solid balance in terms of features, performance, and price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nL0Tae"&gt;The biggest draw for the Surface Pro 8 — besides its unique form factor — is the display, which boasts the highest resolution and refresh rate out of the contenders below. It’s also the only model that features a 4K rear camera.  &lt;/p&gt;
