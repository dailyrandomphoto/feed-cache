    <title>Bungie confirms Destiny 2 crossplay is coming in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IFBVZc0uA_ExCL4o4-azewywDmY=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68478687/dst1Cf94b9e9a.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Bungie&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zkL9Wa"&gt;Bungie has confirmed &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; will be getting crossplay support at some point next year. While Bungie didn’t specify which platforms will support the feature, hopefully you’ll be able to dive into &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; with players across every platform on which the game is available. That includes PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X / S, PC, and Stadia. Earlier this year, it seemed as though a 2021 launch date for crossplay was &lt;a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-crossplay-is-on-bungies-roadmap-heres-wh/1100-6478183/"&gt;the goal&lt;/a&gt;, but Bungie was more definite about a launch next year in a &lt;a href="https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/49957"&gt;blog post published on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oLVExl"&gt;Bungie has slowly been making the game more platform-agnostic. The studio added cross-save support, which lets you bring your save from one platform to another, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/8/20793948/destiny-2-cross-save-bungie-date-august-21-release-shadowkeep"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. And alongside the next-gen update for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X / S &lt;a href="https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/49650"&gt;that’s out today&lt;/a&gt;, the game will support cross-generation play, meaning that PS5 players will still be able to play with people on PS4, for example. The next-gen update also allows the game to run at up to 60fps and 4K resolution on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, adds an FOV slider, and improves load times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QRtxWi"&gt;However, &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21246229/pc-gaming-cheating-aimbots-wallhacks-hacking-tools-developer-response-problem"&gt;still doesn’t have&lt;/a&gt; full anti-cheat on PC. If Bungie doesn’t implement stricter anti-cheating measures before the launch of crossplay, console players may run into cheaters if they are able to play with people on PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="4bJnb3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The world’s biggest PC games are fighting a new surge of cheaters and hackers","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21246229/pc-gaming-cheating-aimbots-wallhacks-hacking-tools-developer-response-problem"},{"title":"Bungie is launching cross-save for Destiny 2 on August 21st","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/8/20793948/destiny-2-cross-save-bungie-date-august-21-release-shadowkeep"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>YouTube live streams now support HDR  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S2L2DRm6rO5nip8gwmTMxU7oT5g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68478580/acastro_180321_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="myY5Sq"&gt;Starting today, YouTube creators can live-stream their videos in high dynamic range (HDR), the company has announced. The platform has supported &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/7/13547710/google-youtube-hdr-video-support"&gt;HDR in prerecorded content&lt;/a&gt; since 2016, but now, live content can also benefit from the technology. YouTube claims it’s “the first major platform to support live HDR.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hSu8Bs"&gt;HDR is a technology that lets videos show a wider range of colors and brightness. Blacks can be darker and whites can be brighter, revealing more detail in the shadows and highlights of an image, respectively. The result is that images appear much more punchy and vibrant leading &lt;a href="https://hdtvtest.co.uk/n/Experts-Say-HDR-Is-More-Important-Than-4K-and-8K-Resolution"&gt;some to argue&lt;/a&gt; that the jump from SDR (standard dynamic range) to HDR offers a bigger benefit than the jump from 1080p to 4K. YouTube added support for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/30/13783272/youtube-update-4k-live-streaming-support-360-video"&gt;4K live-streaming back in 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S6yoct"&gt;In order to benefit from the new technology, creators will need to use one of the &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10265272"&gt;supported encoders&lt;/a&gt; Google lists, and viewers will need to be watching on a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10265272"&gt;supported playback device&lt;/a&gt; like the YouTube app on HDR TVs, a Chromecast Ultra, or an Android device with an HDR display. YouTube says it plans to add support for more encoders and mobile devices to stream HDR content in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is still making its mysterious Fuchsia OS, and now it wants your help</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MCKWRoM8amdC5-uQM6GzAiNkymQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68478578/fuschia.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GL7PIz"&gt;It’s been over four years &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/15/12480566/google-fuchsia-new-operating-system"&gt;since we first found out that Google is developing a new operating system called Fuchsia&lt;/a&gt;. It’s unique because it’s not based on a Linux kernel; instead, it uses a microkernel called Zircon. It’s also unique because, despite being developed “in the open” on publicly browsable repositories, nobody really understands what the OS is for, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/9/18563521/google-fuchsia-os-android-chrome-hiroshi-lockheimer-secrets-revealed"&gt;Google executives have been remarkably coy&lt;/a&gt; about it all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3gaIPY"&gt;Today, that mix of trends continues as the company announces that it’s opening up a little more by asking for more public contributors from outside its organization. Google says it has “created new public mailing lists for project discussions, added a governance model to clarify how strategic decisions are made, and opened up the issue tracker for public contributors to see what’s being worked on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDYGO8"&gt;It’s been a while since we’ve seen a dive into the code and documentation Google has made available, though there are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/5/8/15579846/google-fuchsia-os-magenta-armadillo-first-look-ui"&gt;some early UI examples&lt;/a&gt;. Google’s post today emphasizes that “Fuchsia is not ready for general product development or as a development target,” but it’s likely that the announcement will spur another round of analysis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CijmpO"&gt;We know that Fuchsia isn’t necessarily meant to be a one-for-one replacement for Android or Chrome OS. The most interesting clues to Fuchsia’s practical implementations come from the fact that we know it has been tested on hardware that eventually gets released as Google smart speakers — though when they’re released, they aren’t running Fuchsia. Kyle Bradshaw at &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; has &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/03/06/fuchsia-friday-nelson-luis-hint-made-by-google/"&gt;laid out several examples&lt;/a&gt; of Fuchsia codenames lining up with “Made by Google” devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gIKs24"&gt;Google simply calls Fuchsia a “production-grade operating system that is secure, updatable, inclusive, and pragmatic.” In an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/9/18563521/google-fuchsia-os-android-chrome-hiroshi-lockheimer-secrets-revealed"&gt;interview on &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, Google’s Hiroshi Lockheimer characterized Fuchsia may be optimized for “certain other form factors” beyond phones or laptops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="BHUBnN"&gt;We’re looking at what a new take on an operating system could be like. And so I know out there people are getting pretty excited saying, ‘Oh this is the new Android,” or, “This is the new Chrome OS.” Fuchsia is really not about that. Fuchsia is about just pushing the state of the art in terms of operating systems and things that we learn from Fuchsia we can incorporate into other products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ybokLu"&gt;Along with the new mailing lists and call for contributors, Google is also publishing a “technical roadmap,” but it mainly focuses on low-level OS stuff like “a driver framework for updating the kernel independently of the drivers” and the “Fuchsia Interface Definition Language.” Fuchsia’s roadmap implies that many of the initial subsystems are being revamped, with a new IO library and component architecture, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fUUlWs"&gt;Google runs lots of open-source projects that are nominally developed by anybody but in practice are mostly made by Google’s engineers. Fuchsia looks to be the same sort of thing. In the new governance model the company is announcing today, it says “Google steers the direction of Fuchsia and makes platform decisions” but encourages outside contributions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KnOgLU"&gt;Developers can visit &lt;a href="http://fuchsia.dev"&gt;fuchsia.dev&lt;/a&gt; to find out more and also download the code necessary to build the source code and run an emulator.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>COVID-19 vaccine starts working within two weeks after first shot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="NHS England Starts Covid-19 Vaccination Campaign" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OA-Wx5gG17jIcaIbt53mXR7p6CE=/0x0:3500x2333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68478296/1230010917.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Staff administer the Pfizer and BioNTech to people in the UK.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Victoria Jones / Pool / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kbWrNH"&gt;The Pfizer and BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is safe, effective, and starts working within about two weeks of the first dose, according to &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download"&gt;documents&lt;/a&gt; published by the Food and Drug Administration today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YM96R9"&gt;The materials are the first look at the vaccine data from the perspective of the FDA staff, rather than the drug companies. They were released ahead of the agency’s vaccine advisory committee meeting on December 10th. Like data released by Pfizer, the FDA’s briefing document shows that the vaccine is 95 percent effective at protecting against symptomatic COVID-19, and there are no serious safety concerns with the shot. It worked similarly for people in all racial and ethnic groups and of all ages in which it was tested. (There isn’t data available on children younger than 16.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ePHkd3"&gt;“This is what an A+ report card looks like for a vaccine,” Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/08/health/covid-vaccine-pfizer.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oSPx4j"&gt;While the FDA will decide whether to authorize the vaccine on Thursday, other countries have already started administering the shots. Early this morning, a 90-year-old woman in the United Kingdom became the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-begins-rollout-of-pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-in-a-first-for-the-west-11607419672"&gt;first person&lt;/a&gt; to receive the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine outside of a clinical trial. The UK authorized the vaccine for emergency use last week and started a mass vaccination campaign today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jfyKGG"&gt;Protection could kick in quickly. About 10 days after the first dose, more cases of COVID-19 started appearing in the group of people who received the placebo than in the group that took the vaccine, according to the materials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="E0j1pN"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;FDA just posted the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine data here.&lt;br&gt;Lots of good stuff.&lt;a href="https://t.co/ycGOU5fQkp"&gt;https://t.co/ycGOU5fQkp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;example: Looks like one dose may induce meaningful protection around day 10. &lt;a href="https://t.co/KiYnQoi0wM"&gt;pic.twitter.com/KiYnQoi0wM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— William Gibson (@wgibson) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wgibson/status/1336298050315313158?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 8, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hPmTZ4"&gt;That doesn’t mean one shot is enough, however. The study wasn’t designed to figure that out, and most participants went on to get a second dose. The second dose of a vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/20/21587664/pfizer-moderna-covid-19-coronavirus-vaccine-two-doses-shots"&gt;functions as a booster&lt;/a&gt;, triggering the immune system to produce long-lasting memory cells that stick around to protect against the virus in the future. Even if the first dose offers some protection in the short-term, the second dose is critical. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mWbZSG"&gt;The FDA’s analysis notes there are still data gaps around the vaccine. The clinical trial only followed people for two months, and it’s unclear how long protection from COVID-19 will last. It’s unclear how well the vaccine could work in kids, and there isn’t data on pregnant people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Efgk8M"&gt;The trial also wasn’t designed to check if the vaccine can stop people from spreading the virus. Preventing symptomatic illness is a huge benefit. It would prevent some of the devastating consequences of the virus, keep people out of the hospital, and ease the strain on the health care system. But if people who were vaccinated could still have asymptomatic infections, the vaccines wouldn’t necessarily stop the spread entirely. Other measures, like mask wearing and social distancing, would still be important. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kZdJhN"&gt;The FDA’s vaccine advisory committee will meet on Thursday, and the agency could authorize the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine for emergency use soon after. States are preparing to give the first shots to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21779433/covid-vaccine-priority-health-care-workers-long-term-care"&gt;health care workers&lt;/a&gt; on December 15th. The company said it could have enough of this vaccine for 12.5 million people by the end of 2020, and the United States has access to 100 million more doses — enough for 50 million people with two shots each. The Trump administration &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/07/us/trump-covid-vaccine-pfizer.html"&gt;turned down an option&lt;/a&gt; to order more doses from Pfizer, raising concerns about shortages through the spring if there are not vaccines from other companies available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RnLQgm"&gt;You can read the FDA’s full report &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pokémon Go’s next paid event is a virtual tour of Kanto</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ha3aokJtztGoG8mFt_Nq5p0QGgo=/0x160:3840x2720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68478183/OOzO8_rA.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R7LnSI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go &lt;/em&gt;is celebrating its fifth anniversary with a virtual event, Niantic announced today. The Pokémon Go Tour, a ticketed one-day event set to take place on February 20th, 2021, will allow players to choose from either a Red or Green Version-themed experience — a throwback to the original Game Boy titles released in Japan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9h8lbh"&gt;In addition to research, trades, and event-exclusive items, all of the original 150 pokémon will be available as shiny versions. Both versions include pokémon specific to that experience. In order to get all 150, you’ll have to trade with friends who purchased the other event version; Niantic will increase the trade range to 40 km to make it easier on players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pr2NFG"&gt;Tickets go on sale today for $11.99 and are available in-app. The event will run from 9AM to 9PM in players’ local time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fVdBxU"&gt;Last month, Niantic announced its biggest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572831/pokemon-go-update-kalos-region-seasons-level-50"&gt;update&lt;/a&gt; to the game yet with seasons, a new level cap, and addition pokémon. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch SpaceX fly a prototype of its Starship rocket to its highest altitude yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/izSE1T1styfUSfanRx1Gt8cG_90=/0x0:3840x2560/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68478163/SN8_20201110.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tIuNfK"&gt;Sometime today, SpaceX hopes to conduct a pivotal test flight of its next-generation Starship rocket, flying a prototype of the vehicle to its highest altitude yet. The company plans to launch the massive rocket to a height of nearly 8 miles, or 12.5 kilometers, up above SpaceX’s facility in Boca Chica, Texas, before landing the vehicle back down on the ground again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YISOcP"&gt;The test is meant to prove out Starship’s capability of launching and landing upright, something the spacecraft will be expected to do both on Earth and on other worlds. SpaceX aims to use Starship to send cargo and people to deep-space destinations like the Moon and Mars. A test like this will help demonstrate Starship’s ability to perform a controlled flight and see if the rocket’s hardware — particularly the three main Raptor engines — functions as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HFXPd7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Launch and landing are just part of the test today&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ej2px2"&gt;Launch and landing are just part of today’s test. On its website, SpaceX claims the Starship prototype will actually perform “a landing flip maneuver, which would be a first for a vehicle of this size.” There aren’t many details about the maneuver publicly available, but it’s a risky test that could easily go wrong, with SpaceX CEO Elon Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1331388984023461888?s=20"&gt;only giving the flight a “1/3 chance” of success&lt;/a&gt;. SpaceX itself is also deemphasizing the possibility that the test will pull off a perfect launch and landing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0UA3Gf"&gt;“With a test such as this, success is not measured by completion of specific objectives but rather how much we can learn, which will inform and improve the probability of success in the future as SpaceX rapidly advances development of Starship,” &lt;a href="https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/starship/index.html"&gt;SpaceX wrote about the flight on its website&lt;/a&gt;. But if all goes well, the flight will put the company on course to attempt even more ambitious tests in the future, eventually culminating in Starship’s first launch to orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P30HAF"&gt;For this test, SpaceX plans to provide a live stream of the flight, which will go live just ahead of takeoff. However, it’s hard to give a solid time for when that will happen. The Federal Aviation Administration released flight restrictions for the airspace around Boca Chica from 9AM to 6PM ET, and there are flight restrictions in place for Wednesday and Thursday of this week, too. “The schedule is dynamic and likely to change, as is the case with all development testing,” SpaceX writes. The company will &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpaceX"&gt;provide updates through Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, so be sure to follow SpaceX throughout the day to catch a glimpse of this rocket’s flight.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to buy Apple’s new AirPods Max headphones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CfiK42iNqsVMxlGzJ_eeS-Kmsqg=/0x0:980x653/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68478037/apple_airpods_max_listening_experience_12082020_big_carousel.jpg.large.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cXTBOA"&gt;After many months of rumors, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/21438042/apple-max-studio-noise-canceling-headphones-price-date"&gt;Apple officially announced the AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt;, its own over-the-ear, wireless, noise-canceling headphones. This is the first pair of noise-canceling headphones to feature the Apple logo. They cost $549 and are available for preorder now with shipping slated for December 15th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="swfJ7i"&gt;Unlike the AirPods and AirPods Pro, the AirPods Max come in multiple colors (dark gray, silver, blue, green, and pink). They feature high-fidelity audio, adaptive EQ, active noise cancellation, and spatial audio. Apple says the headphones offer a 20-hour battery life with charging done through Apple’s Lightning connector and not through a USB-C cable. (No, a charging brick does not come in the box.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzaX5q"&gt;We’ll be reviewing the new wireless headphones soon, but if you are interested in placing an order ahead of time, below are the retailers that currently have product listings available.  Currently, only Apple has listed them for sale, but we expect Best Buy and other retailers to put up listings soon and will update this article when they do.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dell’s G3 gaming laptop is a bargain at $700</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Dell G5 15 SE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cx078yliUadU7md0Czb7hqelMtI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68477910/cfaulkner_200714_4098_0016.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pictured here is the Dell G5 15 SE. The G3 that’s discounted today looks very similar, though it has red accents.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FXFB2t"&gt;Today’s hand-picked batch of best tech deals is mostly centered on laptops and tablets, which I’m always happy to see discounted. Whether you want to get stuff done or just do some gaming on an iPad, a more budget-friendly Android tablet from Samsung, or on a Windows 10 laptop, there are a few solid options to choose from. There are also some excellent price cuts on two Chromebooks below that come recommended by &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;reviewer Monica Chin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="932bst"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LXhesf"&gt;Deals on Windows 10 machines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="nRQHcG"&gt;Dell’s G3 15.6-inch gaming laptop is $700 (usually $1,000) at Best Buy, and it’s a solid machine for the price. You probably won’t be able to run &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; at a smooth frame rate above medium settings, but it should handle less demanding games without much effort. This deal will likely be over after today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LYbB2Q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10215032"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jq298Z"&gt;The Surface Pro 7 from Microsoft is cheaper than ever at Best Buy and the Microsoft Store. For $899, you’ll get a 12.3-inch Windows 10 tablet in a matte black finish with a 10th Gen Intel Core i5 CPU, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD inside. This deal includes a Type Cover, which is usually at least a $100 additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="g0nn23"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9644155"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="EYjlKf"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PQuo51"&gt;Save on tablets from Apple and Samsung&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Si7EeU"&gt;Apple’s eighth-generation iPad with 128GB of storage is down to $380 at Amazon and Best Buy (usually $430). The best deal happened a few weeks ago at Best Buy, knocking $70 off the price, but if you missed out on that one, this is the next best deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1lFbgX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508346"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v01dvu"&gt;Samsung’s new Galaxy Tab A7 with 32GB of storage is just $150, down from $230. This one’s tough to beat if you’re looking for a budget-friendly option. And for the money, you’re getting a good value. It has an FHD+ display with slim bezels, Android 10 software, the Snapdragon 662 processor, and 3GB of RAM, which should keep it running through most tasks breezily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UtvmUp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9581085"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="h6CaYV"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6lKoDp"&gt;To keep it simple, get a Chromebook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="SG4hAB"&gt;Lenovo’s Chromebook Duet is like the Surface Pro 7 with its detachable keyboard, but it runs Chrome OS. Right now, the 128GB version is just $230 at Best Buy, which matches the lowest price we’ve seen yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3ZhZ2m"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9505920"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OWd7i3"&gt;For something far more deluxe, Acer’s Chromebook Spin 713 is a 2-in-1 Chromebook that can be used either as a laptop or a tablet. It features a 13.5-inch 3:2 aspect ratio display at QHD resolution. Compared to the Duet above, it’s a powerhouse, containing a 10th Gen Intel Core I5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 128GB SSD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PoAdKQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9505954"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FmmrXW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ynEbmB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Persona 5 Strikers will arrive on the Switch, PS4, and Steam in February</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EeQb_4oLctVF-1BS3N1uWyTMM2k=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68477750/kS_hoRvg.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hU2UIq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Persona 5 Strikers&lt;/em&gt;, an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/25/18515753/persona-5-scramble-nintendo-switch-action-rpg"&gt;action RPG follow-up&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15098458/persona-5-review-ps4-ps3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Persona 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, will head to the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Steam on February 23rd. The game will be available four days early, on February 19th, for those who preorder the digital deluxe version. Developer Atlus confirmed the news today, just days after its release was &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/4/22153871/persona-5-strikers-release-date-ps4-switch-pc-west"&gt;leaked&lt;/a&gt; via YouTube trailer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8A1Gmf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Persona 5 &lt;/em&gt;launched worldwide in 2017; an enhanced version, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21199604/persona-5-royal-review-ps4-atlus-rpg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Persona 5 Royal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, had its wide release earlier this year. Unlike the original game, which features turn-based combat, &lt;em&gt;Persona 5 Strikers&lt;/em&gt; is an action-oriented take on the series from Dynasty Warriors developer Omega Force.&lt;em&gt; Strikers&lt;/em&gt; takes place after the events of the original story when the Phantom Thieves find their vacation interrupted by a new threat. Where&lt;em&gt; Persona 5&lt;/em&gt; took place strictly in Tokyo, &lt;em&gt;Strikers&lt;/em&gt; will also take players to six different cities. In addition to early access, the digital deluxe edition of the game includes a digital artbook, soundtrack, and behind-the-scenes video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XJBpcp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Persona 5 Strikers&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21209572/persona-5-scramble-nintendo-switch-ps4-japan-launch"&gt;already available&lt;/a&gt; in Japan (where it’s known as &lt;em&gt;Persona 5 Scramble: The Phantom Strikers&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp’s new carts feature is aimed at simplifying in-app shopping</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CHlBBkayv2xw-Xn1tVdFHI6RaIM=/200x0:2353x1435/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68477610/Cart__English_2_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: WhatsApp&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oXg6VY"&gt;WhatsApp is introducing a &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/12/making-it-easier-to-shop-on-whatsapp-with-carts/"&gt;new shopping carts feature&lt;/a&gt; that lets you order multiple items with a single message from businesses on the service. It works in conjunction with the service’s &lt;a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/introducing-catalogs-for-small-businesses/?lang=en"&gt;existing catalogs feature&lt;/a&gt;. Now, while browsing a business’s wares, you can add multiple items to your shopping cart and send the entire order in a single message, replacing the back-and-forth communication that needed to happen previously. The feature will be available globally starting today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zfoE8X"&gt;Shopping might not be the first thing that comes to mind when you think of the Facebook-owned messaging service, but it’s become an increasingly popular venue for small businesses around the world to sell their products. Over 175 million people used the service to message a WhatsApp Business account each day as of &lt;a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/shopping-payments-and-customer-service-on-whatsapp"&gt;late October&lt;/a&gt;, the company said. Businesses manage their WhatsApp presence via the WhatsApp Business app, which had over 50 million users worldwide &lt;a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/new-ways-to-reach-a-business-on-whatsapp"&gt;as of July this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wFuAd7fd-7HVu3vn5pPLmivOh4E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22154216/Cart__English_2_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: WhatsApp&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new feature lets you order multiple items with a single message.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9NDaOx"&gt;WhatsApp’s popularity as a shopping service means that the company recently announced that it’s &lt;a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/shopping-payments-and-customer-service-on-whatsapp"&gt;investing in new business features&lt;/a&gt;. These include offering hosting services for businesses to manage their WhatsApp messages and expanding ways for customers to make purchases right from a chat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qY3O12"&gt;Despite its popularity as a shopping destination, WhatsApp’s support for actually making payments in-app is still in its early stages globally, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/facebook-adds-carts-to-whatsapp-to-make-shopping-easier/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;. Although it recently launched its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21301470/whatsapp-payments-brazil-suspended-central-bank-risk-regulators"&gt;payments feature in India&lt;/a&gt;, its rollout in Brazil hit a speed bump when the country’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21301470/whatsapp-payments-brazil-suspended-central-bank-risk-regulators"&gt;central bank suspended the service&lt;/a&gt; soon after its launch. However, &lt;a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-banks-payment-platform/brazil-launches-pix-instant-payments-system-whatsapp-to-enter-soon-idUKKBN27W25C"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that the president of the country’s central bank, Roberto Campos Neto, recently indicated that he expected them to relaunch peer-to-peer payments “soon,” following the launch of Brazil’s new state-owned instant payments system.&lt;/p&gt;
