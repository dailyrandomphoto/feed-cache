    <title>COVID-19 hospitalization rates in adolescents went up during March and April</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VNQruz"&gt;In March and April, when COVID-19 vaccinations were starting to keep older adults out of the hospital, more and more children between 12 and 17 years old were being admitted. Many were seriously sick: around one-third of kids in this age group who were in the hospital for COVID-19 this year were in the intensive care unit, a new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7023e1.htm?s_cid=mm7023e1_w"&gt;report shows&lt;/a&gt;. None died. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1fJ0mI"&gt;The risk of getting seriously ill and needing to be hospitalized from COVID-19 &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-age.html"&gt;increases with age&lt;/a&gt;, but kids and teenagers can still get sick. Hospitalization rates from COVID-19 in this group were, overall, around 2.5 to 3 times higher than those from the flu over the last three flu seasons. The new CDC data underscores the importance of COVID-19 vaccination for adolescents, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WHCOVIDResponse/status/1400470124306612225"&gt;during a press briefing&lt;/a&gt; Thursday. Vaccine shots are now authorized for anyone over the age of 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jXCOrO"&gt;“[The findings] force us to redouble our motivation to get our adolescents and young adults vaccinated,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WGBFV7"&gt;The CDC report looked at data from a network of health centers in 14 states. It found that 204 adolescents were hospitalized for COVID-19 between January 1st and March 31st, 2021. Of that group, 64 were admitted to an intensive care unit and 10 were placed on a ventilator. Around two-thirds had underlying medical conditions, but about 30 percent did not, showing that healthy kids can still get seriously sick. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cXTMvPmHtX-MwHG5EvzFGCXhIEE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22637273/Screen_Shot_2021_06_04_at_10.14.53_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Hospitalization rates for adolescents with COVID-19 peaked in January before declining, but went up again in March.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="js9OAG"&gt;Hospitalization rates for this age group peaked during January, dropped off in February, and then started climbing back up during the beginning of March. Maryland and Michigan both had their highest ever rates in April — &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/maryland-covid-cases.html"&gt;both&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/michigan-covid-cases.html"&gt;states&lt;/a&gt; saw overall surges in case numbers during that time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3U2Gs6"&gt;A combination of factors may have contributed to that uptick, the CDC report said. Kids started returning to school and in-person extracurricular activities during that time, and COVID-19 outbreaks can occur in those environments. In addition, variant forms of the virus that can spread more easily were circulating. Some areas also started to ease up on COVID-19 restrictions as adults got vaccinated against the disease, which could have let the virus spread among people, including adolescents, who weren’t yet eligible for the shots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aLFzKy"&gt;Almost &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations"&gt;6.4 million kids&lt;/a&gt; between 12 and 17 in the US have had at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, as of June 4th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PWLWYc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 14 basics: how to quit an app on your iPhone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 mini feels very comfortable to hold." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fgEerp6jUFsMW4StV7QQVqy-HvE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69406377/vpavic_4279_20201108_0321.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DBAgE4"&gt;Even iOS apps occasionally misbehave — they can crash, or freeze, or otherwise stop working. If you’re new to iOS, or just haven’t had this happen before, you may not know how to actually quit an app (as opposed to just swiping it off your screen). Here’s how to quit an app using iOS 14:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="fFpjG3"&gt;Open the App Switcher by either swiping up from the bottom of the screen and then pausing in the middle, or (if you have a Home button) double pressing the Home button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vYnTbm"&gt;You’ll see an overlapping view of all your open apps. Swipe to the right or left until you find the app you want to quit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HZCbTg"&gt;Swipe up on the app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Open the App Switcher and swipe sideways to find the app you want to quit." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zpaPAZ_gFiuw50kCvgvDaYPH8j8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22554891/IMG_A27F4BD48743_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Open the App Switcher and swipe sideways to find the app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="When you’ve found the misbehaving app, swipe it up to quit." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h3_ou0hV4pgpbnjCrn9sFtkrgrE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22554901/IMG_9FA2A8039FFE_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When you’ve found the misbehaving app, swipe it up to quit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n10e51"&gt;Unfortunately, there isn’t any way to close all of your apps at once, should you wish to do so — you’ll have to simply swipe them off one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NtwsFo"&gt;If for any reason swiping the app off doesn’t solve the problem, then &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/restart-iphone-iph841379c3d/14.0/ios/14.0"&gt;shut down your phone&lt;/a&gt; by pressing and holding the side button and either volume button until you see sliders appear. Drag the one that says “slide to power off” to the right. (If you have an iPhone with a Home button, instead, press and hold the side or the Sleep / Wake button.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lLm1Bc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok updates US privacy policy to collect ‘faceprints and voiceprints’ (but won’t explain what they are) </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tessellated TikTok logos against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uonr3tviUKodKdtIHzcj405XuX8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69406214/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H7xqmQ"&gt;TikTok has updated &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy?lang=en#privacy-us"&gt;its privacy policy in the US&lt;/a&gt; to notify users that the app might, in future, collect new types of biometric information including “faceprints and voiceprints.” But when reached by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, TikTok was unable to explain what types of data these terms referred to, or why the app might need to access this information in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IhUGNi"&gt;The company’s privacy policy was updated on June 2nd, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/tiktok-just-gave-itself-permission-to-collect-biometric-data-on-u-s-users-including-faceprints-and-voiceprints/"&gt;as spotted by &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (An archived version of the old policy can be &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210601030054/https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy"&gt;read here&lt;/a&gt;.) The new policy lays out in some detail the ways in which the TikTok app now has permission to analyze users’ content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p7UKOS"&gt;The policy states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="hDZaBQ"&gt;“We may collect information about the images and audio that are a part of your User Content, such as identifying the objects and scenery that appear, the existence and location within an image of face and body features and attributes, the nature of the audio, and the text of the words spoken in your User Content. We may collect this information to enable special video effects, for content moderation, for demographic classification, for content and ad recommendations, and for other non-personally-identifying operations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="lRqpKF"&gt;As is often the case with privacy policies, there’s a lot of conflation here between outcomes that users are probably fine with (like adding video effects) and outcomes they might think are more invasive (like ad targeting and “demographic classification.”) There’s also a lot of broad language used in order to cover any future updates TikTok might add to the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CKi7An"&gt;The new privacy policy is more explicit that the app can now collect biometric data — that is, the measurement of physical characteristics, including the aforementioned “faceprints and voiceprints.” The policy says TikTok will seek consent from users before collecting this information, but only when it is required to do so by the law. As &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; notes, this doesn’t mean an awful lot in the US, given that only a &lt;a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/government/biometrics/biometric-data"&gt;few states&lt;/a&gt; (including Illinois, Texas, and California) offer these sorts of legal protections. And indeed, TikTok might think that agreeing to its terms of service constitutes all the consent it will need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vK1kPk"&gt;It’s possible that the changes to TikTok’s privacy policy are a response to a recent national class action lawsuit against the company, in which it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301704/tiktok-92-million-settlement-class-action-privacy-lawsuit"&gt;agreed to pay $92 million&lt;/a&gt; to claimants alleging a variety of privacy violations. As we reported on the case in February: “As part of the settlement, TikTok has agreed to avoid several behaviors that could compromise user privacy unless it specifically discloses those behaviors in its privacy policy.” When asked if these changes were a response to the class action lawsuit, though, TikTok declined to comment on the record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1kjjOG"&gt;In response to various questions about what data the company is now collecting on users, how it defines “faceprints and voiceprints,” what data it might collect in the future, and what it might do with that information, a spokesperson said only: “As part of our ongoing commitment to transparency, we recently updated our Privacy Policy to provide more clarity on the information we may collect.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UgHLkX"&gt;There’s more information, yes, but still not a lot of clarity. For an app that has struggled with various privacy issues (the perception of which is often exacerbated by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21322612/tiktok-security-china-bytedance-spying-app-privacy"&gt;political paranoia&lt;/a&gt;), it seems there’s more work yet to do.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xW0scO"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A0UHIl"&gt;This week, &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; dedicates the show to operating systems — updates, releases, and rumors from this past week. Nilay and Dieter talk with &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; senior editor Tom Warren and managing editor Alex Cranz about what to expect at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22457534/apple-wwdc-2021-rumors-ios-15-new-macbook-pro-what-to-expect"&gt;Apple’s developer conference next week&lt;/a&gt; (HomeOS?), where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466394/microsoft-windows-11-launch-teaser-rumors"&gt;Microsoft will take their OS next&lt;/a&gt; (Windows 11?), and the debut of some new systems like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22463666/huawei-matepad-pro-harmonyos-tablet-features-specs"&gt;Huawei’s HarmonyOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22452620/google-fuchsia-os-nest-hub-smart-display-update-operating-system-linux-kernal"&gt;Google’s Fuchsia OS&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s Sweet Tooth makes the end of the world a little cozier</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Sweet Tooth" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bCohRwsmb8x6OeGALsRXWOEKxKU=/0x0:3600x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69406102/STOOTH_101_Unit_03788R.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bJVY1z"&gt;Gus may have antlers like a deer, but he’s a puppy dog at heart. The main character of Netflix’s new series &lt;em&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt;, based on the comic by Jeff Lemire, is a young boy struggling to survive in a world ravaged by a pandemic. But while the world around him descends into chaos, Gus, played by Christian Convery, never loses his sense of wide-eyed optimism. His ears perk up — literally — if he hears about chocolate or candy apples, and he has an almost naive belief in people who shouldn’t always be trusted. At a time when we’re inundated with grim post-apocalyptic stories about how dark humanity can get, &lt;em&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt; and its adorable lead offer something very welcome: hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IeUwpk"&gt;Most of the set-up is familiar territory. A pandemic has killed off much of the human race, and those left behind are attempting to rebuild something resembling a society, some via force, others through community. What makes &lt;em&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt; different are creatures called hybrids: human-animal mixtures that first appeared (birthed from human parents) at the same time the “sick,” as it’s called, began killing people. They’re absolutely adorable little things that would make &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CG5iu6Un-Lh/"&gt;Anne Geddes&lt;/a&gt; proud. But most people can’t seem to look past the apparent connection between hybrids and the pandemic — and this doesn’t bode well for the hybrids.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fhGYKqX0zexwsXgtyiyRyh2GDLU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22636946/STOOTH_103_Unit_02642R.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Kirsty Griffin / Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4ZY1d6"&gt;Gus doesn’t know much about any of this. At the outset of the show, the deer-child lives in an isolated cabin with his father, who teaches him what he’ll need to know to survive. Gus is forced to learn a series of rules — mostly, they involve running away from danger and staying quiet — while his dad teaches him how to farm, fix things, and even read via handmade versions of classic books he rewrites from memory. Gus believes that the world outside of their charmed plot of land is consumed by fire. Because of this, he’s never supposed to go beyond the fence that surrounds them. But, for reasons that I won’t spoil (but which you can probably guess), Gus ends up leaving the property and traveling with a big man known primarily as Big Man (Nonso Anozie) in search of the mother he’s never actually met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="SH8Mno"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10590678"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7nMar3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt; starts slow, and it’s better off for it. Early on, the show doesn’t seem too concerned with the larger mysteries of the sickness, the hybrids, or how the two connect. There’s a side story involving a troubled doctor that becomes more important later on, but for the first few episodes the show is almost entirely about Gus. First, his almost idyllic life at home, as he celebrates birthdays with new books and handmade stuffed animals. The vibe is warm and comforting, with lots of cozy sweaters, wood cabins, and roaring fireplaces — and just a hint of danger lurking in the background. (Executive producer Amanda Burrell previously described the show’s aesthetic as “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22454611/sweet-tooth-netflix-post-apocalyptic-world-interview"&gt;storybook dystopia&lt;/a&gt;.”) Even after he ventures out into the big, scary outside world, things aren’t particularly dark; this isn’t the kind of post-apocalyptic world littered with discarded bodies and horrible monsters. It’s our world, just a bit quieter and greener. And with a few roving gangs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TY9BKk"&gt;It’s not just the aesthetic that makes the show inviting, though. It’s Gus himself. He’s such a sweet and trusting kid that you can’t help but root for him. Even when things get dark — and they will — he maintains a sense of optimism that’s rare for this kind of story. I especially love that you can &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; his mood; Gus is mostly human, but, as mentioned before, he has the antlers and ears of a deer. So when he’s feeling sad or excited, his ears will perk up or lay flat depending on his emotional state. It’s adorable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sweet Tooth" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8UtSUwyPEO7Hi4rm_evVu4wwf9s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22637248/SweetTooth_Season1_Episode1_00_05_51_12R.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fhSH5G"&gt;Gus being this warm, comforting emotional core is important, because &lt;em&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt; does eventually reveal its darker side. After a few episodes, the layers start to peel back, revealing things like militarized forces hoarding supplies, the systematic hunting and exploitation of hybrid children, and well-meaning doctors who will do anything, no matter how grisly, to find a cure for the virus. These are balanced out by other factions, like a zoo that’s been transformed into a hybrid sanctuary, and a rowdy army of kids living free of adult supervision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gy3Cws"&gt;The problem is that most of this is crammed into the second half of the eight-episode season, throwing off the pacing. &lt;em&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt; steadily goes from a slow burn that lingers on characters and moments, to a race to explain the many mysteries of the disease, hybrids, and Gus’s origin. The season also ends on a massive cliffhanger, making it feel a bit like a prologue, rather than a standalone story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pj19x9"&gt;At its most confident, &lt;em&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt; is remarkable. Post-apocalyptic settings are so commonplace that they’re almost generic at this point; grim, gray worlds punctuated by blood and gore (and the occasional zombie). &lt;em&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt; manages to carve out its own space, one that’s incredibly inviting. I just wish it kept up that feeling through the later half of the season. When the show devolves into mystery and action, it loses much of what makes it unique — but at least Gus is still there to help you make it through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g2X1Wx"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Sweet Tooth &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;debuts on Netflix on June 4th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s AirPods Max are $30 off at Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9st56iOy91X0sdGE_jo8wjIUbJQ=/0x0:2075x1383/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69405646/AirPodsMax.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1FZwy8"&gt;Apple’s over-ear AirPods Max are $30 less than usual at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Silver/dp/B08PZD76NP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733321576396561727#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; today. Normally $549, every color option is $520 (Best Buy has most, but not all, colors at this price). Are they worth the purchase even with this slightly more affordable cost? If you’re a discerning shopper looking for unparalleled design and build quality, as well as great sound quality and ease of use, then perhaps they’ll be worth it to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iXCx2k"&gt;This price is hundreds more than the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony’s WH-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bose’s Noise Cancelling Headphones 700&lt;/a&gt;, both of which will serve most people very well. My colleague &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Chris Welch notes in his review&lt;/a&gt;, though, that the AirPods Max are tough to beat on the little details that might make a big difference with your day-to-day use of them. Things like the comfort, intuitive Digital Crown controls, easy device switching, and spatial audio give them the nod versus other options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LYT1Nd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aDynKN"&gt;If you want to spend far less than the cost of the AirPods Max today, we have other deals to show you, like this one on the Shure digital condenser mic that can plug in via USB or Lightning for Apple products. &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-11552259?sid=VergeDeals&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.guitarcenter.com%2FShure%2FMOTIV-MV5-Digital-Condenser-Microphone-With-USB-and-Lightning-Cables-Included-Gray-1433776528834.gc" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It’s available for almost half off at Guitar Center for $5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.guitarcenter.com/Shure/MOTIV-MV5-Digital-Condenser-Microphone-With-USB-and-Lightning-Cables-Included-Gray-1433776528834.gc" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; (normally $100). This is the Motiv MV5, which the site lists as the previous generation model. It offers real-time audio monitoring with its 3.5mm jack, and it can connect to PC, macOS, Android, and iOS devices that use the Lightning port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RosQhT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10590511"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TmrScM"&gt;If you’re still gaming on a PS4, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21064320/sony-ps4-dualshock-4-back-button-attachment-review-gaming-pro-controller" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Back Button Attachment&lt;/a&gt; for your DualShock 4 controller might be of interest. Originally $30, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-dualshock-4-back-button-attachment%2F-%2FA-79382326&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1082904/2092?subId1=VergeDeals&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-dualshock-4-back-button-attachment%2F-%2FA-79382326" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;s just $15 at Target&lt;/a&gt;. The accessory attaches at the bottom and provides two paddle buttons that can be mapped to activate whichever button on the controller you’d like. For instance, if clicking R3 is annoying to you, just map it to one of the paddles. Or perhaps it’s where you’d like one of the D-pad arrows to be delegated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WPrEeE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10590518"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eVcqsP"&gt;Fitbit’s Charge 4 fitness tracker is down to $100 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084CQSL3Q/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1742479826213234853#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; (originally $150). This model is a good fit for people who want comprehensive tracking without the need for a bigger, pricier smartwatch. It has built-in GPS for tracking walks, runs, and bike rides, as well as a heart rate monitor and support for contactless payments. Both the black and maroon models are discounted at Amazon, and they include small and large bands in the box. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4VLpKb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10590539"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Apple WWDC 2021: iOS 15, new MacBook Pros, and what else to expect</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6qq4VZ46b6ppEuSTkzmyvRj8pXY=/154x0:1807x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69405394/Apple_wwdc21_newsroom_article_tile_033021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A promotional image for WWDC 2021.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LrPAza"&gt;Apple’s annual developer extravaganza, the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), is coming up fast, kicking off with the keynote presentation on June 7th at 1PM ET. Like last year, WWDC will be an entirely digital and online-only event due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and for the keynote, that means we can likely expect another tightly produced video highlighting everything Apple has in store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RcZ4wB"&gt;While we aren’t expecting any announcements on the level of Apple’s shift to custom silicon in its computers, which was WWDC 2020’s big news, Apple presumably has some notable changes in the works for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and its other operating systems. And if the current rumors pan out, we could also see brand-new MacBook Pros with the return of some long-missed features, such as MagSafe charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHOWsh"&gt;Read on to learn everything we expect from the big show. And don’t be surprised if Apple has a few surprises in store, too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The large FaceID notch is still there, but it eventually feels normal." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s9nbJbUEu2WEZNOlTas0gOz9CFU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21973495/vpavic_4243_20201018_0144.0.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Z1kYgB"&gt;iOS 15 may bring improvements to notifications and iMessage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XOV5HQ"&gt;We haven’t heard much about what may be coming to Apple’s next version of its mobile operating system, which will presumably be called iOS 15, but we could see big changes to notifications and possibly iMessage, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-22/apple-plans-notifications-ipad-home-screen-upgrades-for-ios-15?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xGgV0K"&gt;For notifications, you may be able to have different notification settings for situations like driving, working, sleeping, or even a custom category, and you’ll be able to flip those on as you need to. You might also be able to set automatic replies based on which notification setting you’re currently using, like what you can do now with Do Not Disturb while driving mode. Personally, I’m hoping iOS 15 will let me allow notifications from a select few people while silencing just about everything else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ejmorG"&gt;As for iMessages, Apple is apparently working on features to make it act like “more of a social network” to compete with Facebook’s WhatsApp, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; said, but those features are still “early in development” and could be announced at a later date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HHBN4P"&gt;Apple also plans to add a feature that shows you apps that are silently collecting data about you, continuing the company’s trend of adding privacy-focused updates to its operating systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qs0a7Q"&gt;For iPadOS 15, you can apparently expect a major update to the homescreen, including the ability to put widgets anywhere you want. And with Apple just introducing the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;M1-powered iPad Pros&lt;/a&gt;, here’s hoping we see some new upgrades to take advantage of the new chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RWYOGr"&gt;In May, Apple also announced &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F05%2Fapple-previews-powerful-software-updates-designed-for-people-with-disabilities%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22457534%2Fapple-wwdc-2021-rumors-ios-15-new-macbook-pro-what-to-expect" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a lot of new accessibility features&lt;/a&gt; coming to Apple’s operating systems, such as improvements in iOS to VoiceOver, support for bidirectional hearing aids, a built-in background sounds player, and new Memoji customizations like cochlear implants. Apple said these features would arrive “later this year,” which suggests they’ll be included in iOS 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="h7c0nD"&gt;We don’t know much about macOS, watchOS 8, and tvOS 15 — but we could see a new “homeOS”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NohEvo"&gt;We haven’t heard all that much about upcoming software updates for the Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV, so we’ll just have to wait and see what Apple is cooking up. One tidbit: macOS could be a “more minor” update, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; says. That wouldn’t be too much of a surprise, given that the macOS operating system got a big overhaul &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21564490/macos-big-sur-review-apple-macbook-pro-air-mac-ipad-m1"&gt;with Big Sur&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AblZZZ"&gt;However, we could see the introduction of a brand-new operating system called “homeOS,” which was recently mentioned in and later removed from &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/02/apple-homeos-mentioned-in-job-listing/"&gt;an Apple job listing&lt;/a&gt;. While it’s unclear exactly which devices this OS is for, perhaps it will work on Apple’s home-focused products like the Apple TV and HomePod Mini.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UDG2Pc"&gt;New, redesigned MacBook Pros and a new Apple CPU could be announced&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5KJ6oA"&gt;Apple doesn’t always introduce new hardware at WWDC, but this year, new MacBook Pros seem like a possibility. In a May 18th report, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-18/apple-readies-macbook-pro-macbook-air-revamps-with-faster-chips"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; said&lt;/a&gt; that new MacBook Pros might arrive “as soon as early this summer,” which could indicate an announcement at WWDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6QmUJq"&gt;These new laptops would have new Apple-designed processors that would “greatly outpace the performance and capabilities of the current M1 chips,” according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. The M1 is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review"&gt;already pretty dang good&lt;/a&gt;, so it sounds like these new chips could be even more impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tGX9qI"&gt;Apple is apparently planning on releasing &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; chips for the new Pros. Both should have eight high-performance cores and two energy-efficient cores, while leaving you with the option of either 16 or 32 graphics cores. (By comparison, the M1’s CPU has four high-performance and four energy-efficient cores, while its GPU is offered with either seven or eight cores.) You’ll probably also be able to spec the laptops with as much as 64GB of memory, up from a max of 16GB on M1-equipped computers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h5MBrI"&gt;The new laptops should be offered with either 14-inch or 16-inch screens and those screens could have “brighter, higher contrast” displays, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;according to a &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report from January&lt;/a&gt;. The laptops may also have a new design with flat edges as in the iPhone 12, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/new-macbook-pro-models-magsafe-ports/"&gt;analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in January&lt;/a&gt;. I’m curious to see what that design might look like in practice — I worry that the hard edges could be uncomfortable if you have the laptop on your lap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4OiOCO"&gt;The best rumor is that the new design may also mark the return of some of the ports and features that were taken away with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13490774/apple-macbook-pro-review-2016-13-inch-laptop"&gt;now-infamous 2016 MacBook Pro redesign&lt;/a&gt;, including a MagSafe charger, an HDMI port, and an SD card slot, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; said in its May report. And, according to Kuo, the OLED Touch Bar currently found on Intel-based MacBook Pros will apparently be removed in favor of physical function keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cueoYL"&gt;We could see at least one other new Mac&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Sr0eKZ"&gt;While it seems like MacBook Pros are the only new hardware we’ll be seeing at WWDC this year, that hasn’t stopped some other Mac rumors from swirling lately, and there’s always the chance Apple could announce more at its big event. According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, Apple also has “a revamped MacBook Air, a new low-end MacBook Pro, and an all-new Mac Pro workstation” in the works as well as a “higher-end Mac Mini desktop and larger iMac,” all of which would be powered by Apple’s custom silicon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xpTzLE"&gt;The new Mac Mini may have the same chip as the new MacBook Pros. The new Mac Pro could be a beast, with processors that are “either twice or four times as powerful as the new high-end MacBook Pro chip.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8DBcX"&gt;And the redesigned “higher-end” MacBook Air could arrive as early as the end of this year. Frankly, I hope that refreshed Air arrives even later. I just bought the M1-equipped Air and it’s one of the best computers I’ve ever used, but I have a bad feeling I’ll be first in line to buy a redesigned and more capable Air anyway. (Especially if it gets the MagSafe charger that’s rumored for the new Pros.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SdMhc8"&gt;Apple might have dropped a hint about its AR / VR headset&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hWxuz9"&gt;Apple has long been rumored to have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266190/apple-vr-headset-ar-glasses-8k-displays-cameras-hand-tracking-details-report"&gt;a mixed reality headset in the works&lt;/a&gt;, and recently, we’ve learned a few more potential details about it. The headset might be &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; expensive — approximately $3,000, according to one report — though it could be packed with 8K displays, more than a dozen cameras to track hand movements and capture footage, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346564/apple-mixed-vr-virtual-augmented-reality-headset-light-ming-chi-kuo"&gt;might weigh less than an iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rbDfpo"&gt;While the headset could be a ways out, as it’s not expected to ship until 2022 at the earliest, a few suspicious details in Apple’s WWDC promotional images &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be hinting toward some kind of reveal of Apple’s upcoming headset or the software on which it runs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sEwuRw"&gt;Check out this image below (that I also used at the top of this post), which Apple released alongside the announcement of WWDC in March. Notice the way the app icons are reflected in the glasses — I could imagine some sort of mixed reality headset showing icons in front of your eyes in a similar way.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GVsPoR1G837_6LQp6aHbEOLrLa4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22549429/Apple_wwdc21_newsroom_article_tile_033021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Those icons sure are reflected in an interesting spot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJi4b2"&gt;Apple continued that reflections motif with new images released in May — you can see things from the laptop screens reflected in all of the eyes of the Memojis.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bPEFWi2kCP_J0PT-w7N3kd70zVg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22549430/Apple_WWDC21_details_announcement_052421.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Look at those reflections.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Xq7x4h"&gt;Now, these reflections may just be Apple’s artists flexing their design chops. And if I had to guess, given how far out a rumored mixed reality headset is, I don’t think we’re going to see anything about it at WWDC this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d1tXnv"&gt;But Apple has surprised us in the past, and maybe these images are an indication of one more thing Apple has in store for WWDC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6SP4Jl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ySvSwa"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden’s proposed budget keeps a block on recreational weed sales in Washington, DC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Hemp plants in Hedersleben" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QTbxLIds4hCswNK_LW1V1QTXy3g=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69405392/1227889847.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="48XIFE"&gt;A rider that has effectively blocked recreational cannabis for years in Washington, DC appears in President Joe Biden’s proposed 2022 budget, which may keep weed on the back burner yet again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z4Ufdh"&gt;Even though residents of DC &lt;a href="https://wamu.org/story/14/11/05/pot_legalization_approved_by_dc_voters/"&gt;voted to legalize&lt;/a&gt; possession of recreational marijuana in 2014, the measure has been in limbo since then, &lt;a href="https://dcist.com/story/21/06/01/biden-budget-keeps-ban-on-weed-sales-in-dc/"&gt;derailed by a rider&lt;/a&gt; to DC’s appropriations bill first introduced by Rep. Andy Harris (R-MD), that prohibits the District from spending its local funds on commercialization of recreational cannabis, such as dispensaries. And Biden’s proposed 2022 budget includes the rider’s language yet again.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SmKpWy"&gt;Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC) &lt;a href="https://norton.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/norton-secures-major-victories-for-dc-in-biden-budget-disappointed-with"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt; she was having a hard time reconciling the Biden administration's support for DC statehood with its budget that would prevent DC from commercializing recreational cannabis. “With Democrats controlling the White House, House and Senate, we have the best opportunity in over a decade to enact a D.C. appropriations bill that does not contain any anti-home-rule riders,” Norton said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DB7KnL"&gt;Asked if the president plans to remove the language from the proposed budget, a Biden administration official said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the president “continues to strongly support DC statehood, under which the people of DC could make policy choices just like other states.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KfuEqv"&gt;DC has long had a so-called “&lt;a href="https://dcist.com/story/16/09/16/weed-delivery-in-dc/"&gt;gray market&lt;/a&gt;” for marijuana, with medical cannabis legal, and recreational cannabis technically legal, but unable to be taxed or regulated because of the Harris rider. DC voters first &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/daily/sept99/marijuana21.htm"&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; medical marijuana in 1998, but it too was initially blocked, by the Barr Amendment, legislation that Congress finally overturned in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DpF0i1"&gt;Biden, once a leading voice in the “&lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/20/18677998/joe-biden-1994-crime-bill-law-mass-incarceration"&gt;War on Drugs&lt;/a&gt;” of the 1980s and ’90s, said during the 2020 presidential campaign that it was “time to decriminalize” marijuana use, but so far during his administration there’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22243311/democrats-biden-marijuana-policy-reschedule-drug"&gt;little action to do so&lt;/a&gt; at the federal level. Dozens of US states have legalized medical marijuana, recreational marijuana, or both, and public opinion &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/323582/support-legal-marijuana-inches-new-high.aspx"&gt;supporting legal weed is at an all-time high&lt;/a&gt;. And Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), and Sens. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Ron Wyden (D-OR), have said they would work together &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22243311/democrats-biden-marijuana-policy-reschedule-drug"&gt;to advance comprehensive cannabis reform&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2lzCeQ"&gt;In February, DC Mayor Muriel &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MayorBowser/status/1365368726967775234?"&gt;Bowser proposed legislation&lt;/a&gt; “to create an equitable adult-use cannabis program” in DC, which would impose a 17 percent tax on cannabis sales. But it’s unlikely to take effect if the rider remains in Biden’s proposed 2022 budget. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eHDJQT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M4djcW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99c8QD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZHwhLr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EU and UK open antitrust investigations into Facebook Marketplace</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dveNeQEMR-wwqpYH2-rTxmPR804=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69404905/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mwtjs4"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_2848"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-investigates-facebook-s-use-of-ad-data"&gt;UK regulators&lt;/a&gt; have opened antitrust investigations into Facebook over concerns its Marketplace service is unfairly distorting competition for classified ads. Both are interested in whether or not Facebook unfairly used advertising data to compete in the classified ads market, and are collaborating as part of the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZgCYVc"&gt;“Facebook collects vast troves of data on the activities of users of its social network and beyond, enabling it to target specific customer groups,” the European Commission’s competition head, Margrethe Vestager, said in a statement. “We will look in detail at whether this data gives Facebook an undue competitive advantage in particular on the online classified ads sector, where people buy and sell goods every day, and where Facebook also competes with companies from which it collects data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="brlIJ3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We will look in detail at whether this data gives Facebook an undue competitive advantage”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WpeTnh"&gt;In particular, the commission says a preliminary investigation has raised concerns that Facebook may be using data from rival classified ads services that advertise on its platform to compete with them. The commission and UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will now carry out in-depth formal investigations to assess these concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aoTpzI"&gt;In addition to concerns about Facebook Marketplace and classified ads, the UK’s CMA is also investigating Facebook’s dating service on similar grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CqELAS"&gt;In a statement, a spokesperson from Facebook said it believes the allegations are “without merit,” adding that both Facebook Marketplace and Facebook Dating are part of “highly competitive” markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="undEjj"&gt;“We are always developing new and better services to meet evolving demand from people who use Facebook. Marketplace and Dating offer people more choices and both products operate in a highly competitive environment with many large incumbents,” the spokesperson said. “We will continue to cooperate fully with the investigations to demonstrate that they are without merit.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oT1FdC"&gt;The European Commission has been scrutinizing Facebook Marketplace for years. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-marketplace-faces-eu-antitrust-probe-source-2021-05-26/"&gt;Reuters notes&lt;/a&gt; that European officials sent out questionnaires about the service back in 2019, only for Facebook to push back against the investigation &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-53558947"&gt;the following year&lt;/a&gt;, arguing that the scale of the EU’s document request meant it would have to hand over unrelated, yet highly sensitive, information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iii5zs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/3/13145242/facebook-marketplace-launch-buy-sell-ebay-craigslist-amazon"&gt;Launched in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook’s Marketplace service allows people to buy and sell items from locals. It’s now used by 800 million Facebook users across 70 countries, according to Reuters. Rivals have reportedly complained that Facebook gives itself an unfair advantage by being able to advertise Marketplace for free to its 2 billion users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qFeKmp"&gt;This is the first time Facebook has been formally investigated by the EU, the &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3750ad46-04c3-4010-9fc1-fe2427c8520c"&gt;&lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt; previously noted&lt;/a&gt;, with the case joining similar anti-competitive investigations by the bloc into the likes of Apple, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22407376/apple-european-union-antitrust-charges-app-store-music-competition-commission-margrethe-vestager"&gt;the EU formally accused Apple&lt;/a&gt; of violating antitrust rules with its App Store policies, and last November &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21558119/amazon-european-union-antitrust-charges-competition-commission-margrethe-vestager"&gt;the commission said Amazon&lt;/a&gt; was misusing the data it collects from third-party marketplace sellers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JpWGvD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 4th, 7:03AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated with Facebook’s statement on the investigations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new TV remote is great, but only when apps properly support it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vGjeS3jkHTEzIJSHAoxONF76doc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69404757/DSCF3948_4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JbNWB6"&gt;Users are complaining that the Disney Plus and HBO Max Apple TV apps aren’t properly supporting the excellent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22446699/apple-tv-4k-hd-siri-remote-review-features-price"&gt;new Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt;. Disney Plus has &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/appletv/comments/nrem4m/disney_doesnt_work_with_new_apple_tv_remotes/"&gt;yet to be updated&lt;/a&gt; to make use of the remote’s helpful scroll wheel scrubbing feature, which works on rival Netflix and Apple TV Plus apps. The HBO Max app has more issues, &lt;a href="https://www.screentimes.net/article/hbo-max-tvos-update-breaks-several-key-features-degrading-experience-significantly"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screen Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, and lacks support for several of the remote’s features and voice commands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MNBA7o"&gt;When we tried the HBO Max app for ourselves, we found it doesn’t seem to support the new remote’s D-pad. Instead, we could only use the remote’s touchpad circle, which is technically an element of the remote you’re supposed to be able to disable. Scrubbing using the touchpad works, just very badly. The cause of these problems appears to be a recent app update, which replaced the standard tvOS playback UI with HBO’s own (and apparently far less capable) version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DBClAz"&gt;It just goes to show that a platform holder can build a powerful combination of hardware and software in support of third-party apps and services, but it doesn’t mean anything unless those same apps and services actually bother to add support. We’ve reached out to both Disney Plus and HBO Max to see if they’re aware of the issues, and to find out when users can expect a fix.&lt;/p&gt;
