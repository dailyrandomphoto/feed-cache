    <title>Avengers: Endgame directors’ production company signs overall deal with Spotify </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dOcN_Amil1APhrcja3SBd4YU48g=/151x0:1747x1064/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68855433/Screen_Shot_2021_02_22_at_9.00.24_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4vH7qy"&gt;Anthony and Joe Russo’s AGBO production company is entering the audio space in a new multiyear deal with Spotify, following its massive success with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21526664/netflix-movies-billion-dollar-box-office-blockbuster-ted-sarandos-earnings"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Extraction &lt;/em&gt;on Netflix&lt;/a&gt; and the upcoming Tom Holland-led feature &lt;a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/cherry/umc.cmc.40gvwq6hnbilmnxuutvmejx4r?ctx_brand=tvs.sbd.4000&amp;amp;itscg=MC_20000&amp;amp;itsct=atvp_brand_omd&amp;amp;mttn3pid=a_google_adwords&amp;amp;mttnagencyid=1625&amp;amp;mttncc=US&amp;amp;mttnsiteid=143238&amp;amp;mttnsubad=OUS2019895_1-491374017553-c&amp;amp;mttnsubkw=120033862727_kwd-330092397590_CJq46RN4_&amp;amp;mttnsubplmnt="&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cherry &lt;/em&gt;on Apple TV Plus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ejR8Kn"&gt;The directors, best known for their work on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18513309/avengers-endgame-spoiler-free-review-marvel-cinematic-universe-iron-man-thor-captain-america-phase-4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avengers: Infinity War &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as well as sitcoms like &lt;em&gt;Arrested Development&lt;/em&gt;, will produce several series for Spotify. The move comes at a time when Spotify is trying to assert itself as the dominant podcast platform. With the Russo brothers, known for their specific type of blockbuster storytelling, the company is looking “to tell more stories that have the power to span generations and territories.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="liM9CW"&gt;Spotify has signed other deals with storytellers and celebrities in recent months. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21453026/spotify-chernin-entertainment-partnership-first-look-podcast-ip"&gt;Chernin Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-01-21/spotify-and-ava-duvernays-array-partner-to-produce-scripted-and-unscripted-podcasts/"&gt;Ava DuVernay&lt;/a&gt;, and, most notably, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21263927/joe-rogan-spotify-experience-exclusive-content-episodes-youtube"&gt;Joe Rogan&lt;/a&gt; have all signed deals with Spotify to produce exclusive content for the platform. While many people may still use Spotify as a music-only platform, the company hasn’t hidden its ambitious podcasting goals, where executives are hoping to boost subscriber numbers and advertising revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWB8KG"&gt;Spotify hasn’t announced if the Russo brothers are already working on their first series for Spotify or if everything is still in early stages of development at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DC Comics is launching a podcast universe on Spotify </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q6EQPKEJ5AiwmoCoPhucDFWd0BM=/0x0:1220x813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68855429/dc_spotify.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qdIQYp"&gt;DC is launching another universe to tell its superhero stories — but this time, it’s not on HBO Max or Cartoon Network: it’s on Spotify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eei277"&gt;The publisher is working on nine shows for Spotify, including shows about Catwoman, Wonder Woman, the Riddler, Batgirl, Superman and Lois Lane, and more — although DC creative director Jim Lee didn’t give too much more information about what those shows entail right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cqAYHQ"&gt;Spotify and DC Comics signed a podcasting deal last June. The multiseries, multiyear deal was part of a bigger partnership between &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21294489/spotify-dc-comics-podcast-exclusive-deal"&gt;Spotify and DC Comics’ parent company&lt;/a&gt;, WarnerMedia. The first project out of the partnership is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21493298/spotify-dc-comics-batman-podcast-bruce-wayne-premiere"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Batman Unburied&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which will explore the “darker aspects of Bruce Wayne’s psychology.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jGflmD"&gt;Competition within the podcasting space has heated up over the last few years. DC Comics’ biggest competitor, Marvel, &lt;a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/podcasts/marvel-entertainment-and-siriusxm-enter-a-major-multi-year-deal-to-create-original-podcasts-for-siriusxm-and-pandora"&gt;has its own podcasting deal&lt;/a&gt; with Pandora. The company also has a deal with podcasting platform Stitcher for several series. Both Pandora and Stitcher are owned by SiriusXM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uECgKl"&gt;It’s a good time for all three companies, as there’s more superhero content than ever before and interest from millions of people to find and devour new content. With &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22202992/dc-films-multiverse-batman-wonder-woman-aquaman-hbo-max-dceu-marvel-disney-plus"&gt;shows like &lt;em&gt;GCPD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Pacemaker &lt;/em&gt;coming to HBO Max (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21377631/the-batman-teaser-trailer-robert-pattinson-matt-reeves-dc-fandome"&gt;spinoffs of &lt;em&gt;The Batman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and James Gunn’s &lt;em&gt;Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt;), it’s a perfect opportunity to have content, well, everywhere. (Not to mention &lt;em&gt;Zack Snyder’s Justice League &lt;/em&gt;is just around the corner.) For example, Jeffrey Wright will take on a role in a DC Comics &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/jeffrey-wright-starring-in-batman-podcast-from-hbo-max-exclusive"&gt;podcast show for Spotify&lt;/a&gt;, but he’s also Detective Jim Gordon in &lt;em&gt;The Batman.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jy7XVH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify HiFi is a lossless streaming tier coming later this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dRpWCiVtheHUbyN9uvHc4w3pjOU=/158x0:1835x1118/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68855332/Screen_Shot_2021_02_22_at_11.29.46_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p1sCH4"&gt;Spotify is going hi-fi. Well, “HiFi.” It’s taken longer than competitors like Tidal and Amazon Music, but today, the leading subscription music service announced a new lossless streaming tier that will allow listeners to get the most from their digital music library. The news came at the company’s Spotify “Stream On” virtual event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GCiu0i"&gt;Spotify HiFi will be available later this year and “will deliver music in CD-quality, lossless audio format to your device and Spotify Connect-enabled speakers, which means fans will be able to experience more depth and clarity while enjoying their favorite tracks.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9Ubjjf"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W07MvWbuWkI?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zvJorF"&gt;Spotify has done small tests of higher-quality streaming in the past, but now it’s going to launch the feature more widely — with the caveat that it’ll be available only “in select markets.” Pricing is yet to be announced. Higher-quality streaming has apparently been among the top requests from its customers; as it stands today, Spotify tops out at 320kbps audio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uHW4MD"&gt;Amazon rolled out Amazon Music HD &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20869526/amazon-music-hd-lossless-flac-tier-spotify-apple"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. The lossless plan costs $14.99 per month (or $12.99 for Prime customers), a premium over the standard Amazon Music Unlimited service. Tidal, which has supported high-resolution audio since its very beginning, is priced slightly higher at $19.99 monthly for the “Hi-Fi” plan. Tidal offers what it calls “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftidal.com%2Fmasters&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F22%2F22295273%2Fspotify-hifi-announced-lossless-streaming-hd-quality" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Tidal Masters&lt;/a&gt;” that go up to high-resolution 96 kHz / 24 bit audio. Smaller services like Qobuz have also sought to appeal to audiophiles with lossless streaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pheala"&gt;Apple Music, on the other hand, still lacks any kind of lossless streaming tier, despite Apple selling the very high-end AirPods Max headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nEjlku"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>5G in the US is disappointing right now, but it’s going to get better</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ACCGYzU2wR3-6BaupyrR4XrSoRA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68855298/acastro_180430_1777_5G_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;In the US, 5G remains a work in progress, despite carriers waving “5G Mission Accomplished” banners for years | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The fourth industrial revolution will not be televised&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="2rF2Fy"&gt;After an introduction from Consumer Technology Association president Gary Shapiro, Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg takes the stage. He wears a simple black T-shirt with an unmistakable red check and begins delivering his keynote speech. The topic at hand is 5G, something Vestberg speaks about enthusiastically. The keynote covers the eight “currencies” of 5G, features a professional athlete, and highlights how 5G will transform the drone industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OPtmvC"&gt;That was CES 2019. It was also CES 2021. Verizon hasn’t been alone in fueling the 5G hype machine; AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile have been talking up their 5G networks for years. Now, it’s showtime. With major flagship phones and a lot more budget devices supporting it, this is the year when a critical mass of phone buyers will finally see for themselves what all this talk is about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QaXFel"&gt;Here’s the bad news: if they’ve been listening to the hype, they’re going to be disappointed. We’ve been promised a fourth industrial revolution with fantastical things like remote surgery and driverless cars. Instead, what we have now is widespread 5G that’s more or less the same speed as (or even slower than) 4G and super-fast mmWave 5G in &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; parts of &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; major cities with highly limited range. So where is this 5G future we’ve been promised? The truth is that it’s coming along, but it will materialize more slowly and in less obvious ways than what we’ve been led to believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uEFYKL"&gt;Spectrum wars&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="dzciVm"&gt;To understand the complicated 5G situation in the US right now, you first need to know that there are low-, mid-, and high-band frequencies that carriers can use. Low-band is slower but offers widespread coverage. High-band, often called mmWave, is very fast but extremely limited in range. Mid-band sits in a sweet spot between the two, with good range and better-than-LTE speeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rXZ3ph"&gt;If you were building a 5G network from scratch, you’d probably want a bunch of mid-band spectrum, right? The trouble is, spectrum is a limited resource. &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/authors/sascha-segan"&gt;Sascha Segan&lt;/a&gt;, lead mobile analyst at &lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt; and a wealth of 5G knowledge, sums up part of the spectrum problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VjjNjv"&gt;“Our government did not make the right channels available to the carriers,” he says. “Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T have basically just been using leftover odds and ends of their 4G spectrum... putting the 5G encoding on these leftover bits and bobs so they can pop a 5G icon on the screen. And the performance is meaningless.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="hRkK5K"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s kind of like having that super fast sports car and you’re stuck on the Santa Monica freeway.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xixtRf"&gt;The technology Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T are using to get nationwide 5G coverage is called Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS), which allows 4G and 5G to coexist on the same spectrum. That helps carriers make the transition from one technology to the other, but it comes at a cost. Michael Thelander, president and founder of wireless industry research firm &lt;a href="https://signalsresearch.com/"&gt;Signals Research Group&lt;/a&gt;, sums it up this way: “It’s kind of like having that super fast sports car and you’re stuck on the Santa Monica freeway. You can’t experience the full capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Sv52l"&gt;T-Mobile, on the other hand, doesn’t need to rely on spectrum sharing as much as the other two, thanks to its acquisition of Sprint and its mid-band spectrum. That has given it an edge in its 5G offerings thus far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WD5bmM"&gt;By early 2022, though, we will likely see Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T catching up. A swath of mid-band spectrum known as C-band went up for auction in late 2020. And while we don’t know which companies won which blocks of spectrum, we know those two carriers, in particular, spent big; bidding &lt;a href="https://auctiondata.fcc.gov/public/projects/auction107"&gt;topped out at over $80 billion&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uw17dY"&gt;What happens next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="VsP8hz"&gt;The networks might not be firing on all cylinders yet, but more and more mobile devices are ready for them. In fact, by the end of the year, it may be harder to find a non-5G phone than one that supports the technology. Not only do Apple and Samsung’s flagship phones support 5G across their lineups, but it’s also making its way into more midrange and budget devices, thanks to new 5G-ready low-end processors like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22204586/qualcomm-snapdragon-480-5g-android-smartphone-price"&gt;Qualcomm Snapdragon 480&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fiBmo5"&gt;More people than ever will buy a 5G phone this year — likely not because they really wanted 5G, but because the phone they were going to get anyway supports it. The good news is that there really isn’t a downside to buying a 5G phone now if it’s time to upgrade. The “5G tax” that put a higher price tag on 5G phones over the past couple of years seems to be disappearing, and we haven’t noticed any other drawbacks like excessive battery drain in our testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YuP5JW4ilTFsD1GqJPcjnL_wagE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21973509/vpavic_4243_20201017_0144.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 series includes 5G connectivity across the lineup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sPWa6a"&gt;So what’s the reaction like so far from, say, someone who bought an iPhone 12 — not for 5G, but because it’s the new iPhone? “They’re frustrated and angry,” says Segan. “With both Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T, because of what I’ll call technical difficulties, their nationwide 5G is often slower than their 4G. So people are getting these iPhones and they’re finding that frequently they have worse performance than they had before 5G.” The “technical difficulties” he refers to include DSS in Verizon’s case and the limitations of the narrow 5MHz band that AT&amp;amp;T often uses for its 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p5fWGR"&gt;That’s not great. But a couple of factors will make a difference over the next year. First, that C-band spectrum will start coming online around the end of the year. If you’re one of the frustrated owners of an iPhone 12 or Galaxy S21, there’s good news: your phone is already approved to use C-band, so if you’re on Verizon or AT&amp;amp;T, you should see speed improvements when that happens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="u7PitC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They’re finding that frequently they have worse performance than they had before 5G”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MvPKH7"&gt;Not all 5G phones support C-band, though. Those that don’t will need a software update to use it, and there’s no guarantee that your phone’s manufacturer will offer one. Inexpensive 5G models, in particular, may not see a C-band update, even if they have the hardware to support it. Phone makers need to apply for Federal Communications Commission approval to enable it and may be less likely to bother with the cost of this step for phones with a shorter lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BFIJxS"&gt;The other factor is something that will likely happen sooner than C-band becoming available: large gatherings. That’s when Segan thinks Verizon’s Ultra Wideband could really shine. “When we’re all vaccinated, I think people are going to be desperate... for all of these dense, crowded, communal experiences that we will have been missing for a year and a half. And so Verizon should be working on applications and experiences right now like the thing they did at the Super Bowl, or what they’ve talked about doing at Disney World, that you can only do on Ultra Wideband.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4L8b2T"&gt;Again, that will depend on your 5G phone supporting the right &lt;em&gt;kind&lt;/em&gt; of 5G — not every 5G phone supports mmWave. The aforementioned iPhone and Samsung flagships do, and other Verizon models that support are denoted as “UW.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oDOGa4"&gt;Where are our jetpacks?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ftsEj7"&gt;And what about the stuff of CES keynotes like remote surgery and self-driving cars? That’s on the way, too, but it’ll take longer. Thelander explains: “The first focus of 5G was really a feature called ‘enhanced mobile broadband’ and that’s just getting fast data speeds to the consumer on their smartphone. Things like factory automation and the functionality behind that, that was really developed afterwards, so it lags, from a standardization perspective.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="TCL 10 5G UW" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-45gdo6AJkDTvjeyQhEZkf3YK80=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21990050/cfaulkner_201023_4258_0009.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first focus of 5G has been to boost mobile data speeds for consumers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uvow5O"&gt;Getting the technology piece sorted out is only half of the equation. “Once you’ve got a certain feature or functionality defined in a standard, now a vendor has to go out and build that functionality, then you have to test it, and then you have to have the industry adopt it,” Thelander says. “The technology may be there, the standard may be there, it may work fine, but it has to be implemented and rolled out. And you have to have the business case for it. How do you make money off of it? All those types of things… it just takes time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="SQZrz1"&gt;Despite networks constantly waving their “&lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/mission-accomplished"&gt;5G Mission Accomplished&lt;/a&gt;” banners in TV commercials over the past year, 5G is very much still a work in progress. It’s going to get better, but how soon that happens for you depends on a lot of factors: which phone you have and what bands it supports, which network you’re on, where you are, and what you’re doing. It seems clear now that there &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/23/18637213/5g-race-us-leadership-china-fcc-lte"&gt;never really was a “Race to 5G”&lt;/a&gt; — just technological progress as usual, which is often slow, confusing, and uneven. That’s a little bit harder to sell in a keynote or a commercial.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to score a COVID-19 vaccine appointment </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_u2r1v0qpkmDCofvfzLEcU6WDG4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68809161/acastro_201217_1777_vaccine_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DzZXIa"&gt;One of the most frustrating tasks for many of us these days is finding how and where to get an appointment for a COVID-19 vaccination. It can be a real exercise in exasperation: the websites are often difficult to navigate and prone to frequent crashes; in addition, after finding an open appointment slot and filling out multiple pages of questions, you are often told that the opening has disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Vp4Bt"&gt;In view of all this, we’ve tried to gather as much helpful information as we can about ways to research and snag vaccination appointments for yourself and others. We’ll update this as more information presents itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JYv8ZW"&gt;Research the vaccination qualifications in your state&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jJJ2mU"&gt;To begin with, it’s a good idea to try to pin down if you or the person you are assisting is currently qualified for the COVID-19 vaccine. Find the vaccine information site (or sites) that is being run by your state and / or city. This will also help you figure out when you might be qualified if you aren’t already. If you can’t find it via a quick search, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/plan-your-vaccine/"&gt;NBC News has created a simple website&lt;/a&gt; that lets you find out what the current situation is in your specific state. &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/covid-19/where-to-get-covid-19-vaccine"&gt;Prescription company GoodRx&lt;/a&gt; offers similar information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="N5dWHX"&gt;Find all the places that might offer appointments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XK1Cc0"&gt;There are, fortunately or unfortunately, many different sites where you can go to find out if you can get an appointment to be vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dgvDmn"&gt;For example, here in New York City, we’ve had to navigate separate sites run by the city and the state. Various hospital systems also have their own sites, as do pharmacies such as Walgreens and CVS, which have recently begun offering appointments for vaccinations. It’s a lot to check — and it can be enormously confusing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="usTdFX"&gt;As a result, your first step is probably to check your state’s government health website (searching your state name and “COVID vaccine” will probably do it). If you’re an urban dweller, check for your city’s information site as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H8ot2F"&gt;While most personal physicians do not have access to vaccines, your doctor may be able to tell you some of the places to check. Other resources include your local hospital system, your union (especially if your employment qualifies you for a vaccination), and, of course, friends and colleagues, many of whom have probably been doing their own searches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WZ6Bfn"&gt;As you find resources and sites, make sure to bookmark them. I keep a folder on my bookmarks bar called “COVID” — you may want to name yours something more cheerful.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Looking for an available vaccine appointment can be frustrating, but persistence can pay off." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8lP4_R3np2CX9crqTcg9Mq6I2Js=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13963741/IMG_1653.1419968302.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looking for an available vaccine appointment can be frustrating, but persistence can pay off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6uguNM"&gt;Have all your information ready&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1Dt0LZ"&gt;Many of us who have tried to register for vaccination appointments have gone through the experience of filling out several screens of information only to find that, by the time we got to the end, the appointment was gone. So it’s a good idea to have all your data — such as your name, age, address, insurance info, and the registration ID / password for the site — immediately at hand. The faster you can go through the registration process, the more likely you are to actually get an appointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tRD8jU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; colleague Cory Zapatka says that he highly recommends using a password manager if you have one. He created accounts with all the vaccination sites in his area, even if they didn’t have appointments available at the time, so that if / when the time came, he could just auto-fill and get in right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q9bBlc"&gt;And if you do get an appointment, make sure you have the appropriate paperwork already handy — especially since available appointments can be last minute. Necessary paperwork could include proof of employment, proof of age, or proof of a qualifying condition. Since the last one may require a doctor’s note or other record, it’s a good idea to call your doctor now — or if you’ve got access to a doctor’s or hospital website, that may offer you access to the proof you need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5dqUcf"&gt;One more thing: check to see if you’ve gotten all the email that has been sent to you by your vaccine supplier. At least one staff member of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; found a necessary consent form hiding in her spam folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wCK4vB"&gt;Watch for news of upcoming vaccination sites&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="bDlWg4"&gt;Keep an eye on the news. More and more sites and hubs are being added as the US gears up for a stronger push. If you see a news item saying that a hub is about to open, find the site for the hub and keep checking — once it does open, the available slots will probably go quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rz172X"&gt;One thing that sometimes helps is to look for patterns in the appearance of new appointments. For example, when I heard that the pharmacy chain Walgreens was going to begin giving out vaccines in my area, I spent a couple of days going onto the site, and suddenly realized that there was a pattern: the company was only scheduling appointments two to four days in advance and was adding new appointments each day just after midnight. Once I understood the pattern, I was able to get appointments for a couple of friends, and let others know about it as well. (Note: since vaccine supplies and scheduling methods can change on a dime, this particular strategy may no longer work by the time you read this.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sites like the NYC Vaccine List can help by gathering together available resources in one place." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FsRia6ki1VqiuNodQvjKHdK9-ek=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22299690/Screen_Shot_2021_02_12_at_8.47.56_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sites like the NYC Vaccine List can help by gathering together available resources in one place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gz26d4"&gt;Look for help online&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PgrwN8"&gt;There are a number of online resources popping up headed by developers and other technology-savvy folks who have taken the time and effort to try to make sense of this confusion. (Thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/10/covid-vaccine-appointment-websites/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/09/nyregion/vaccine-website-appointment-nyc.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for some of these listings.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Vhk2GI"&gt;An NYC site called &lt;a href="https://www.turbovax.info/"&gt;TurboVax&lt;/a&gt; pulls “the latest appointments from 43 city and state-run vaccine sites in the NYC area” and puts them on Twitter. Followers who set their Twitter notifications for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/turbovax"&gt;@turbovax&lt;/a&gt; can quickly find out about newly opened appointment slots. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="c0AX5B"&gt;Another called &lt;a href="https://nycvaccinelist.com/"&gt;NYC Vaccine List&lt;/a&gt; uses a combination of scripts and checks by volunteers to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/31/22256167/covid-vaccine-website-nyc-appointment"&gt;scour various sites for openings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="111Dwk"&gt;In California, &lt;a href="https://www.vaccinateca.com/"&gt;VaccinateCA&lt;/a&gt; checks pharmacies and hospitals for information about open appointments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZYJAS8"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://vaccinatenj.com/"&gt;Vaccinate NJ&lt;/a&gt; also uses volunteers to try to help state residents find vaccine opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZJic26"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.covid19vaccinetx.com/"&gt;Covid 19 Vaccine TX&lt;/a&gt; is a crowdsourced resource for registering with local counties and finding locations where vaccines may be available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WLYqtL"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.macovidvaccines.com/"&gt;MA Covid Vaccine Appointments site&lt;/a&gt; offers lists of and links to sites with available appointments. A volunteer-run Massachusetts site, &lt;a href="https://vaccinatema.com/"&gt;Vaccinate MA&lt;/a&gt;, tries to improve on the state website with a map-based design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yR8waA"&gt;A volunteer group in the state of Washington has launched the &lt;a href="https://www.covidwa.com/"&gt;WA COVID Vaccine Finder&lt;/a&gt; as an aggregation resource for vaccination appointments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="C1YLfR"&gt;There are several sites that aggregate the aggregators: &lt;a href="https://wherecanigetavaccine.com/"&gt;Where Can I Get A Vaccine?&lt;/a&gt; offers a list of sites available for various US states. &lt;a href="https://covidshotfinder.com/"&gt;COVIDShotFinder&lt;/a&gt; lets you select a state or county and look for the various vaccine resources available. &lt;a href="https://www.findashot.org/"&gt;Find A Shot&lt;/a&gt; also shows you possible openings depending on your state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jdCWU8"&gt;One possible strategy is to use page-change-monitoring tools such as &lt;a href="https://visualping.io/blog/how-to-be-alerted-of-covid-19-vaccine-availability-in-your-local-pharmacy/"&gt;Visualping&lt;/a&gt; to generate alerts for when new appointments become available. These apps watch websites for you and send alerts to your email, text, or even Slack account when new information appears. They can be very useful (and allow you to take time for, say, lunch). But since these are, for the most part, business apps, you may need to pay for the privilege. For example, while &lt;a href="https://visualping.io/pricing"&gt;Visualping does have a free service&lt;/a&gt;, it is limited to pinging you once an hour up to 65 times a month, which may not be often enough if you’re trying to score an appointment.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="nhHjOx"&gt;By the way, if you’re a developer and / or coder who wants to help, check out &lt;a href="https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/"&gt;US Digital Response&lt;/a&gt;, an independent organization which, according to its website, “connects experienced, pro-bono technologists with local government and non-profit organizations responding to crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you are able, it’s a good idea to reach out and help those who may not be able to get appointments on their own.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8mSy40"&gt;If you can, help others&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Kz9AlN"&gt;One of the worst things about the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines is that those who need it the most are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227531/covid-vaccine-website-appointments-accessible-seniors"&gt;often the least likely to be able to navigate the technology required to get an appointment&lt;/a&gt;: older people, differently abled people, or those who don’t have or can’t afford computers and / or internet connections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W2VOR9"&gt;If you have the time and talent, reach out to anyone you know who may not be able to get an appointment on their own. This could be as simple as finding phone numbers they can call to try to schedule an appointment, going online and getting an appointment for them, or helping them get to and from the vaccination site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Evm4o5"&gt;You could also see if there are any groups that are organizing help. &lt;a href="https://www.westsiderag.com/2021/01/19/need-help-signing-up-for-a-vaccine-a-young-tech-savvy-person-can-help-you"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The West Side Rag&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for example, reports that a group of New Yorkers created the &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScO11RAr7tqHU6LJp_ZNMl5mRbxdg-zc1lO1SuVHBBDLTyJrg/closedform"&gt;Vaccine Appointment Assistance Team (VAAT)&lt;/a&gt; to help their non-technically-savvy neighbors navigate the process. (At the time this was written, because of low supplies of vaccine, VAAT had temporarily suspended their services.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rm5plO"&gt;Look for leftover vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="M5v0nn"&gt;While the vaccines can last for six months while they’re kept frozen, once thawed and refrigerated, the Pfizer vaccine will last five days while the Moderna vaccine will last for 30 days. As a result, when people don’t show up for their appointments, some centers will &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22229169/leftover-vaccines-random-people-grocery-stores-pharmacies"&gt;offer vaccinations to those who may not immediately qualify&lt;/a&gt; rather than waste vaccines that would otherwise be rendered unusable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EI3933"&gt;However, running to a nearby pharmacy or vaccine hub in the hit-and-miss hopes that there will be some shots waiting at the end of the day isn’t the most effective way to be vaccinated. (Besides, getting hypothermia while waiting in the cold isn’t going to help.) At least one group is trying to ameliorate the situation: a pilot project called &lt;a href="https://vaxstandby.com/"&gt;Vaccination Standby&lt;/a&gt; says that it will monitor providers around the US for word of extra doses and text notifications to those whose zip codes are near the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nAc3tM"&gt;There are also local organizations that are offering standby lists. For example, Buncombe County in North Carolina has a &lt;a href="https://www.buncombecounty.org/countycenter/news-detail.aspx?id=19137"&gt;vaccination waitlist and standby list&lt;/a&gt;, as does the &lt;a href="https://www.co.monroe.in.us/egov/documents/1611179705_09719.pdf"&gt;Monroe County Health Department&lt;/a&gt; in Indiana. Check your local government site to see if there’s one in your area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Fg3eNk"&gt;Be persistent!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JTTPvK"&gt;Yes, it’s frustrating as hell, but keep at it. If a website crashes, try again. If you’re dropped from a phone call, call again (and have a game, video, or book ready to keep yourself occupied while you’re on hold). If you can’t find anything during working hours, try late at night or very early in the morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBXxUO"&gt;Persistence may be one of the most important aspects of getting an appointment for a COVID-19 vaccination. You may be tempted to give up, especially after hitting the “no appointments available” wall time and time again. But until vaccine production is ramped up enough to cover more of our population, and until distribution becomes more organized and easier to manage, simple stubbornness may be your best tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwiVs8"&gt;And hopefully this article, and all the advice it contains, will soon be unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1QdqaC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 12th, 11:10AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article has been updated to include the WA Covid Vaccine Finder.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rW1K6i"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 16th, 10:10AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article has been updated to include a mention of webpage change monitoring tools.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Jkqbm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 19th, 11AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article has been updated to include another Massachusetts site and two general vaccination finding sites.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eSy6ej"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 22nd, 10:40AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article has been updated to add the Find A Shot site.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZwQk0g"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This sleek spaceship render is a planned esports arena in Toronto</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wMTi0hD3MozFp7Kmi5kNe_i8eH8=/120x0:1395x850/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68855131/Screen_Shot_2021_02_18_at_2.52.21_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Re1ysE"&gt;If all goes according to plan, in a few years, Toronto’s esports teams will have a futuristic new home. Today, Overactive Media — the ownership group behind the Toronto Defiant of the &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League and the &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; League’s Toronto Ultra — announced plans for a new 7,000-seat venue in the city, which is designed to host both competitive gaming matches and other events like concerts. The venue is expected to cost around $500 million to build and open in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GxRcD7"&gt;The new arena will be located at Exhibition Place in Toronto, which is also home to BMO Field, where soccer club Toronto FC plays. It’s being designed by Populous, the prolific architecture firm behind recent projects like Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London and T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. “The design of the theatre was neither conceived as a sports arena nor an opera house, rather, a new typology that straddles the two: a state-of-the-art performance venue,” Populous lead designer Jonathan Mallie said in a statement.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“The theatre architecture creates a merger of the old and the new.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nJowj6"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AzAFae3dnrQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Q6LKnB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Call of Duty League will look very different in its second season","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22276595/call-of-duty-league-cdl-2021-season-preview-johanna-faries-interview"},{"title":"After years of following pro sports, League of Legends esports leagues are ‘finally free to be ourselves’","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22228929/league-of-legends-championship-series-2021-season-esports-chris-greeley-interview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eWDmJO"&gt;The planned venue is far from the first esports arena — among other existing venues, the &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League’s Philadelphia Fusion are also planning &lt;a href="https://fusionarenaphilly.com/"&gt;a smaller-scale home base&lt;/a&gt; — but it does point to an ongoing trend. Organizations and leagues are searching for new ways to make money, diversifying their efforts beyond just professional teams, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20849569/100-thieves-nadeshot-esports-supreme-drake"&gt;typically through avenues like apparel and content&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ruFhV3"&gt;But a venue like this represents something more ambitious. While esports teams will be the anchor, much like a traditional sports arena, the goal is to keep the building packed on a nightly basis. Overactive says it plans to host more than 200 events a year, and, aside from esports and concerts, that is expected to include “major city-wide conventions, corporate events and product launches, and awards shows.” Meanwhile, the company also says that it is “already in active discussions to attract some of the biggest esport events in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MSCHF’s latest drop lets you control a Boston Dynamics robot with a paintball gun on its back</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_R8h9kvdzcXMt3S7mpasr0qeh2c=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68855096/G84A2170.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vq5eBY"&gt;At least one future is here right now. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21320127/mschf-products-jesus-shoes-puff-chicken-office-business"&gt;The prankster art / marketing collective MSCHF&lt;/a&gt; recently spent $74,500 to purchase a Spot robo-dog from Boston Dynamics. It mounted a Tippmann 98 paintball gun on its back and is &lt;a href="https://spotsrampage.com/"&gt;allowing people around the world to remotely control the bot via their phones in an art gallery&lt;/a&gt; filled with its own work for two minutes at a time. MSCHF is calling it &lt;a href="https://spotsrampage.com/"&gt;Spot’s Rampage&lt;/a&gt;, and the event is happening on February 24th at 1PM ET. Quoth MSCHF’s latest manifesto: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="manifesto"&gt;When killer robots come to America they will be wrapped in fur, carrying a ball. Spot is Rob Rhinehart’s ideal pet: it never shits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mQ8zwL"&gt;Good Boy, Spot! Everyone in this world takes one look at cute little Spot and knows: this thing will definitely be used by police and the military to murder people. And what do police departments have? Strong unions! Spot is employee of the month. You never need to union bust a robot - but a robot can union bust you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="slUsGG"&gt;Right! Boston Dynamics is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a fan. MSCHF says the company offered it another two Spot robots for free because it hated the idea. Naturally, there’s a tweet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/8BjVXhfZjP"&gt;pic.twitter.com/8BjVXhfZjP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Boston Dynamics (@BostonDynamics) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BostonDynamics/status/1362921918781943816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SneVI9"&gt;The outrage feels a little off, doesn’t it? It doth protest too much, as it were. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21144648/boston-dynamics-spot-robot-mass-state-police-trial-issues"&gt;News stories&lt;/a&gt; over the last couple of years report that police departments have been testing these somewhat terrifying robot dogs to see if they’re useful out in the field. Which is to say: if your company is going to take funding from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to develop robots, don’t be surprised if people see potentially nefarious uses for the things it makes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JdmyNA"&gt;Anyway, controlling Spot is pretty fun. I got to test-drive the robot / paintball gun combo the other day, and I have to say that I, like everyone else who tested it, suddenly understood what it might feel like to be a drone pilot. Although it doesn’t do much. “We learned this shortly after getting it: everything you’ve ever seen in one of those Boston Dynamics videos is not really actually doable once you have it,” says MSCHF Swiss army knife Daniel Greenberg. “It really does nothing other than walk, to be totally honest.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Hw5id"&gt;Nevertheless, the MSCHF folks agree that it’s utterly terrifying to see Spot walking around with a gun on its back. “It feels like five years from now, I could be walking around Brooklyn and just see one of these things with like a taser on it being controlled by the cops,” Greenberg says. “Who knows what the future holds?” (And yes, the group did test pilot their Spot on Brooklyn sidewalks; people stared.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bqgkMe"&gt;Though apparently it’s quite difficult to get a gun in New York where MSCHF is based — and yes, that even includes paintball guns. As one of the engineers who worked on the project points out: you can’t buy paintball guns on Amazon in NYC. The team ended up going to a combo scuba diving / paintball store to find the gun and ammunition. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QfXF0xnNHV2mL3vnZMKoEftsNDo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22320239/G84A2201.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: MSCHF&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NjfkcN"&gt;The event is a one-time-only thing. “There’s no waitlist. There’s no paying. There’s no data collection beyond the site,” says Greenberg. “And it’s going to change drivers every two minutes. So if you’re on the site, and you’re lucky, great. If not, it is what it is.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mxL9zZ"&gt;When I was controlling Spot, it felt almost exactly like playing a video game on a controller with two analog sticks. There was some lag, which was not terribly difficult to compensate for. If you’ve played any game on a controller since Sony introduced its DualShock controller, MSCHF’s UI will feel extremely familiar. Also familiar is that Spot comes with an end user license agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="STceNq"&gt;“There is a danger that that Boston Dynamics might just shut it off,” says programmer Matthew Rayfield. “Just based on some of the documentation and policies, you have to sign to use this and get this, it seems that there are certain uses, including violent type stuff, that they don’t want it used for,” he continues. “And it does seem like reading that they have a kill switch that they might just flip.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fngIUu"&gt;The MSCHF team has been working on this drop since October when they got their hands on the bot. Programming it is apparently quite user-friendly. Boston Dynamics has abstracted it enough that Rayfield says the hardest part was getting the paintball gun to work reliably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ba8Px"&gt;My run ended after 10 minutes or so when the robot fell over on the gallery floor. (It was slippery with the paint from previous drivers.) The robot, they said, was stuck; it couldn’t get back up without human help. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBFbIQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best streaming device to buy in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An image of the Google Chromecast, the best streaming stick of 2021 for most people, resting on a soundbar." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4898BPrHNtUJ2D0ryKE7CVuH4mg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67310264/DSCF2108.7.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Getting something great only costs $50&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="R6sqE4"&gt;Looking for a new TV gadget to stream all of your favorite entertainment? Buying an excellent streaming device is easier in 2021 than ever before — and the prices only continue to drop and get more appealing: $50 is the sweet spot if you want a streaming stick or set-top box that can do crisp 4K resolution, Dolby Vision / HDR, and immersive Dolby Atmos surround sound. Each of the picks below has its own strengths, whether it’s a snazzier interface, better voice controls, or a more comprehensive universal search for digging through all of your services. Depending on your wants, there are several good contenders, but the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chromecast with Google TV&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; stands out as the best streaming device for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xj845F"&gt;Pretty much any 4K TV you buy today will come with a batch of built-in streaming apps. But they won’t always have &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;. (For example, my LG OLED doesn’t have HBO Max.) So a dedicated streaming device is the best way to guarantee you’ll be able to watch that show or movie everyone’s been talking about. You can spend less money on entry-level Roku or Amazon streaming players, but you’ll be better off with one of our recommendations if you want your purchase to last. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id="4mn8ET"&gt;BEST STREAMING DEVICES OF 2021&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="2VmT6S"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The features and fantastic price of the Chromecast with Google TV make it the best streaming stick for most people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9cOJvp"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;Chromecast with Google TV&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="liPByI"&gt;The best streaming stick for most people&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3U9Abh"&gt;Google has done the best job figuring out what the home screen on a streaming stick should look like. That’s really the long and short of why the Chromecast with Google TV has taken the crown of best streaming player. With its new Google TV software, the company has taken a content-first approach that feels more focused and refined than what Amazon and Apple have managed in their own attempts to aggregate popular shows and movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lr5ZDG"&gt;On a Roku or Fire TV, my instinct is always to head right for the app where I want to watch something. But with the Chromecast, I’m equally happy browsing through Google’s rows of recommendations. The Google TV software always clearly shows where content is coming from — you can pick which streaming apps get factored into these recs — and it also provides helpful information (like Rotten Tomatoes ratings) at the surface level when you’re hunting for that night’s entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XINYdJ"&gt;When you actually hit play, you’re punted over to Netflix or Prime Video or HBO Max just like always, but there’s no avoiding that. In terms of app selection, Google’s got all of the main players covered. You can still cast content to the Chromecast from your phone or laptop, and Google Assistant voice searches consistently work well and showcase Google’s accurate voice recognition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="uHgD8b"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google has done the best job figuring out what the software on a streaming device should look like&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IvKXPL"&gt;Everything about Google TV feels tasteful, from the fonts to the way the background color subtly shifts to match the artwork of whatever content is highlighted. And the universal Watchlist, which lets you put together a list of stuff you’re interested in from various streaming services, is super convenient — especially since you can add to it from the web or your phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FUEQwj"&gt;But not everything about the Chromecast with Google TV is perfect. The software can slow down from time to time, and some customers have &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/07/chromecast-google-tv-data-corrupt-android-cant-load-error/"&gt;encountered significant bugs&lt;/a&gt; that Google has tried to iron out with software updates. More annoyingly, despite the hardware supporting both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, there are still very popular apps like Disney Plus — which delivers both on other platforms — that aren’t doing so on the Chromecast. HBO Max says it does Atmos, but that hasn’t been my experience. Why? Who knows, but these inconsistencies are a mark against Google. And as for the Watchlist, some services like Netflix have already started removing their shows from it. Again, that’s something Google has no control over, but it does lessen the feature’s usefulness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="e1vJvx"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An image of the Roku Streaming Stick Plus, the best streaming device for ease of use, plugged into a TV." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GeG7Xng7wS70oeIPS1EBLvuW_9g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9578455/akrales_171031_2100_0010.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;With its easy-to-use software, the Roku Streaming Stick Plus is the best streaming device for people looking for a good, simple option.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="z2csvA"&gt;2. Roku Streaming Stick Plus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hOCseD"&gt;The best streaming device for people who want to keep it simple&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7O9OD"&gt;It’s hard to really complain about a Roku. The company’s streaming devices are about as simple and straightforward as they come. All of your apps are laid out in a big grid, which can make the experience feel a bit siloed — but there’s no beating that ease of use. And Roku has tried to touch up and modernize the home screen a bit with new sections like “Featured Free” to highlight content you can stream without any subscriptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qjIbaE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9736654"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MGj91j"&gt;Despite some occasional spats with content companies, Roku now has pretty much all of the entertainment you could want, including (most recently) HBO Max and Peacock. And the wonderfully neutral universal search remains one of the best aspects of the platform, favoring your existing subscriptions and free-to-stream options over making you pay money to rent or buy. And the company’s Roku Channel has grown into a legitimate streaming app of its own, offering a mix of ad-sponsored movies, TV shows, and live news for those days when you’re burned out on combing through Netflix or Amazon Prime Video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lVnPjT"&gt;The $50 Streaming Stick Plus remains the best overall pick among Roku’s hardware when you weigh price and performance. It gives you HDR, Dolby Atmos, and speedy performance. The main thing you’ll miss out on is Dolby Vision. If that’s a &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt;, you should look at the $100 Roku Ultra set-top box instead, which also includes an Ethernet port for optional wired connectivity and a helpful remote finder feature. Plus, the Ultra’s remote has customizable shortcut buttons and a headphone jack so you can listen privately to whatever’s on-screen if you’re trying to keep quiet at night. (Other Rokus let you do the latter with the company’s mobile app.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m4IoeY"&gt;If there’s one area where Roku falls flat, it’s probably voice search. Your voice queries for specific shows or movies should work well enough, but Roku lags Amazon and Google when it comes to natural language interactions. (And forget about using your voice to control smart home gadgets or look up entertainment-related facts.) Still, the company is adding other perks to offset that weakness. Late last year, it added support for Apple’s AirPlay, letting you easily send content from an iPhone, iPad, or Mac to the TV screen. Speaking of Apple…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Apple TV 4K, the best streaming device user experience, on a table with the Siri remote." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RvuBLV2eYixMw2JxsRp5Rer4NJE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19701522/cwelch_200205_3895_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s more pricey than the competition, but the Apple TV 4K offers a top-notch user experience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JRXodl"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/21/16341876/new-apple-tv-4k-review-2017"&gt;Apple TV 4K&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="CWJwP1"&gt;The best streaming device overall experience (for a steep price)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="M2y4K0"&gt;The Apple TV 4K is laughably overpriced compared to its competitors, but Apple’s set-top box still has its own set of appealing qualities. The interface is fantastic. It supports Dolby Vision and Atmos across a wide variety of services, has all of the important apps checked off, and also gives you add-ons like Apple Arcade and Apple Fitness Plus (if you pay for them) that you won’t find on other streaming devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f0yQqy"&gt;Apps sometimes have a higher level of polish on Apple TV and are generally better about taking advantage of everything it can do. Another benefit of the Apple TV is privacy — to some extent. Apple itself isn’t obsessed with tracking your viewing data in the same way that a company like Roku is, but the streaming apps can still see what you’re doing. I generally think consumers aren’t particularly averse to sharing their streaming habits, but Apple’s privacy practices might matter to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AUc2Xv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10351704"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p7S0fB"&gt;Even with AirPlay now on Roku, the Apple TV still wins out for people deeply invested in Apple’s ecosystem. You can use HomePods as its speakers or connect two sets of AirPods for private listening with audio sharing. You can view the feed from HomeKit security cameras or see who is at the door if you have a HomeKit video doorbell. The Apple TV still makes it easy to tap into content on a Mac in your home, and services like Apple Music and iCloud Photo Library are right there in easy reach on the TV screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JS0nOC"&gt;But there’s no forgiving the infamous remote, which is cumbersome to use and too easy to lose. And it’s more difficult than ever to recommend that you spend $180 on hardware that’s now several years old. Doing so isn’t &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;; you’ve just got to know why the Apple TV 4K is right for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Yh1ylb"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Amazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K, a great streaming stick for $50, pictured attached to a TV’s HDMI port." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MQ6Oml67NEpEL1BJiRk4Z7fw5Iw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13360395/cwelch_181030_3054_0442.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fire TV Stick 4K checks off all the boxes for HDR support and costs just $50, making it the best streaming stick for people in Amazon’s ecosystem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6ajwme"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/31/18044584/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-review"&gt;Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mO4Da0"&gt;The best streaming stick if you’re in Amazon’s ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iAlxyK"&gt;Amazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K is yet another popular pick in that $50 range of streaming gadgets. The latest model added support for Dolby Vision, which made it the only product to offer everything HDR (Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, HDR10+, HDR10) for such little money — until the new Chromecast came along. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HanEXz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10351716"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oDfmk8"&gt;The Fire TV Stick 4K’s software is similar to the Chromecast in that the home screen takes a content-focused approach instead of just throwing a grid of apps at you. Amazon tends to showcase its own Prime Video content more prominently than shows and movies from other services, but the newly revamped software goes a long way in improving the look and feel of the Fire TV. Alexa voice commands with the remote also work reliably, whether you’re saying “open Netflix” or asking to dim the smart lights in your living room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y0rvix"&gt;Amazon offers most major streaming apps, but there are some frustrating omissions: Vudu — a good source of Dolby Vision movies — and Peacock are both still absent from the Fire TV platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="i6E5A2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10351738"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JiAvz9"&gt;There’s also the $120 Fire TV Cube to consider. It essentially doubles as a streaming device and small smart speaker. Rather than make you press and hold a button to speak to Alexa like with the Stick 4K, the Cube takes a hands-free approach and has beamforming mics that respond to “Alexa” prompts just like an Echo speaker would. It also features something Amazon calls Local Voice Control, which allows it to understand more spoken commands without needing help from the cloud. The Fire TV Cube has a more powerful processor than the Fire TV Stick 4K, making it the fastest of the Fire TV bunch, but the difference isn’t very noticeable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pssjk4"&gt;When it comes to their streaming capabilities, the Fire TV Stick 4K and Fire TV Cube are on equal footing. And you could always put the money you save by going with the Stick toward one of those new sphere-shaped Echo Dots, which will sound far better than the Cube’s tinny built-in speaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="zkClUu"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Nvidia’s Shield TV, the best streaming player for home theater experts and gamers, pictured on a table." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dEmAuOHlgj4pGSulYPpS4vSMAlM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19324253/DSCF4370.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nvidia’s Shield TV is a powerful Android TV streaming box that’s popular with home theater enthusiasts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qJ9DFz"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20935215/nvidia-shield-tv-2019-review-streaming-stick-dolby-vision-4k-price-specs-features"&gt;Nvidia Shield TV&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ktAsFL"&gt;Best streaming device for home theater enthusiasts and gamers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="bTK5Wu"&gt;Home theater enthusiasts, gamers, and people who like to tinker with their streaming devices have loyally stuck with Nvidia’s Shield TV and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/NVIDIA-Shield-Android-Streaming-Performance/dp/B07YP9FBMM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Shield TV Pro&lt;/a&gt; for a reason. They can serve as excellent players like any of our other picks, but you can also go more advanced and use them for cloud gaming or set up a Plex media library (in the case of the Pro). GeForce Now and Steam Link probably do more to sell gamers on the Shield lineup versus something like Apple Arcade on the Apple TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="useqbH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9736645"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bmo5EB"&gt;The Nvidia Shields currently run Android TV with Google Assistant built in, but it’s expected they’ll eventually get the same Google TV experience that’s on the Chromecast. Nvidia’s AI-powered upscaling can eke out some extra detail from the shows and movies you stream, and I’d rate the included remote control (with backlit buttons, even) as the most ergonomic of them all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VVfT5g"&gt;But like with the Apple TV, the main hurdle here is the price. The Nvidia Shield TV costs $150, so you’re looking at spending $100 more than devices that offer most of the same functionality. You get Ethernet and a very powerful streaming device for the added premium, and you can push the Shield TV farther and make it do more than just about any of its competitors. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Daft Punk split up after 28 years</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="59th GRAMMY Awards - Show" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VdGqe6fXtokwBUmEMeWS5-7oFZ4=/0x1:4100x2734/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68854903/634986256.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images for NARAS&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uokwiN"&gt;The Paris-born electronic music duo Daft Punk are no more. The group, consisting of French musicians Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter, confirmed the breakup with an eight-minute video titled “Epilogue” excerpted from their 2006 science fiction film &lt;em&gt;Electroma&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/daft-punk-call-it-quits/?utm_brand=p4k&amp;amp;mbid=social_twitter&amp;amp;utm_social-type=owned&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Pitchfork&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which also confirmed the news with Daft Punk’s publicist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EW2SMb"&gt;Daft Punk formed in 1993 in Paris and would go on to have a monumental effect on the emerging house and techno scenes of Europe and later all of pop music around the globe, with landmark albums like 1997’s &lt;em&gt;Homework &lt;/em&gt;and 2001’s &lt;em&gt;Discovery &lt;/em&gt;and singles like “Around the World” and “One More Time.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fjGnFS"&gt;A standout of Daft Punk’s early career included the anime film&lt;em&gt; Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem&lt;/em&gt;. It told a visualized narrative of their album &lt;em&gt;Discovery &lt;/em&gt;in partnership with legendary Japanese studio Toei Animation and manga artist Leiji Matsumoto. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vwlbQA"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FGBhQbmPwH8?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ca07uY"&gt;The duo became increasingly elusive throughout the 2000s as they retreated behind their signature robotic helmets and made sparingly few public appearances and even fewer interviews. Though even as they paused production on follow-up albums after 2005’s &lt;em&gt;Human After All&lt;/em&gt;, Daft Punk stayed relevant through prescient infusions of dance music into mainstream culture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmi6sl"&gt;They licensed “Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger” to rapper Kanye West for his &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsO6ZnUZI0g"&gt;2007 single “Stronger,”&lt;/a&gt; and the duo put the Coachella Music Festival on the map with an &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewKLSeaECAA"&gt;absurd, expensive, and unforgettable performance&lt;/a&gt; the year prior when they debuted their now-iconic pyramid stage. They also produced their first film score with the &lt;em&gt;Tron: Legacy &lt;/em&gt;soundtrack in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xqzFTo"&gt;In 2013, Daft Punk released &lt;em&gt;Random Access Memories&lt;/em&gt;, an album dedicated to live instrumentation and the American roots of funk and disco. It went on to win numerous Grammy Awards and cemented Daft Punk as legends of genre-blending pop music. It would be their final album. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney Plus warns of offensive content featured in some episodes of The Muppet Show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AZBgpzdTnZs2-24Nl5QXBeMDYzY=/0x143:1200x943/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68854574/TMS.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yfo21g"&gt;All five seasons of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238672/muppet-show-disney-plus-seasons-streaming-movies-manhattan-space-sony"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Muppet Show&lt;/em&gt; arrived on Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; this past Friday. And depending on which episode you are streaming, you may receive a content disclaimer warning of potentially offensive material featured in the episode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dShi88"&gt;Disney included a content warning for 18 episodes of the comedy show. The disclaimer, as pictured below, has been added to some episodes, warning viewers that the episode featured may include “negative depictions and/or mistreatment of people or cultures.” Despite the controversial material some episodes contain, Disney decided to leave these episodes to “acknowledge the [offensive content’s] harmful impact, learn from it, and spark conversation to create a more inclusive future together.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n4Rn82P5JpQwL0cLyGL43wjyiiI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22320176/the_muppets_show_disclaimer.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some episodes of The Muppet Show will display an unskippable content warning for 12 seconds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gmVxwW"&gt;One example of this disclaimer is in season 5, episode 14, which singer Johnny Cash hosted. In the episode, Cash sings in front of a Confederate battle flag, which, in modern times, has been associated with white nationalists and white supremacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MeK3Hr"&gt;This is not the first time Disney has issued content warnings before certain content on its service. Some older movies in Disney’s library also include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20963014/disney-plus-racism-cultural-disclaimer-dumbo-song-of-the-south-warner-bros-tom-jerry"&gt;the same content warning&lt;/a&gt; for racist or insensitive stereotypes, including 1941’s &lt;em&gt;Dumbo&lt;/em&gt; and 1953’s &lt;em&gt;Peter Pan&lt;/em&gt;. Those films have also been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253052/disney-racist-films-movies-dumbo-peter-pan-aristocats-jungle-book"&gt;recently removed from Disney Plus “Kids”&lt;/a&gt; profiles for viewers aged seven or younger. &lt;/p&gt;
