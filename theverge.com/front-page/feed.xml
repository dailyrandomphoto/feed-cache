  &lt;p id="GHjRwI"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="En3bnm"&gt;This week, Nilay and Dieter bring in &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; policy editor Russell Brandom and managing editor Alex Cranz to cover the series of unfortunate events for Facebook: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/3/22707860/facebook-whistleblower-leaked-documents-files-regulation"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes &lt;/em&gt;whistleblower interview&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708989/instagram-facebook-outage-messenger-whatsapp-error"&gt;the massive Facebook outage&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710539/facebook-whistleblower-hearing-instagram-child-safety-congress"&gt;whistleblower Senate hearing&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, and the fallout and response the following days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VRkn6B"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Vergecast &lt;/em&gt;crew discusses whistleblower Frances Haugen’s testimony, how these events stood out amongst the various Facebook scandals of the past, and what could happen next with tech regulation. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tar balls, oiled birds, and months of cleanup on California’s beaches </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Major oil spill in Orange County" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MmkqvMYgs8L9135L3L287lCQmPg=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69969189/1235738711.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yreL9W"&gt;Coastal communities are still reeling from a recent oil spill off Southern California that coated &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/10/04/photos-southern-california-coast-oil-spill-show-damage/5986903001/"&gt;shorelines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/22708654/oil-spills-wildlife-huntington-beach-california"&gt;marine life&lt;/a&gt; in black tar. Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency after a pipeline ruptured late last week, unleashing an oil slick spanning 8,320 acres on waters near some of California’s most iconic beaches. Officials are still investigating the cause of the spill but think that a cargo ship’s anchor might have snagged and tore through the pipeline, the &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-10-06/did-shipping-gridlock-and-an-anchor-spark-massive-oil-spill"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eheZeh"&gt;It could take months to assess and clean up some of the mess, and longer for ecosystems to recover. To learn more about what to expect, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke with Steve Murawski, a fisheries biologist and marine ecologist at the University of South Florida who studies the impact humans have on ocean ecosystems. Murawski was also the lead editor of the book &lt;em&gt;Scenarios and Responses to Future Deep Oil Spills&lt;/em&gt; and previously served as chief scientist of the National Marine Fisheries Service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oo8pA6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I was hoping you could give me some context or a sense of scale when it comes to spills. How significant of a spill is the one off the coast of Southern California?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b3ST8E"&gt;To put this in a little perspective, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21228577/offshore-drilling-deepwater-horizon-10-year-anniversary"&gt;Deepwater Horizon&lt;/a&gt;, which was the largest accidental spill in global history, was about 2 million barrels. The Exxon Valdez spill was about 260,000 barrels. This one is about 3,400 barrels (about 144,000 gallons). Just in terms of volume, it’s a small percentage of what we would consider a catastrophic oil spill. That’s one perspective on it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="4AtyXl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s all about location”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gfRz48"&gt;But it’s all about location. This is an oil spill of modest size; it’s in a very sensitive area. It’s only about four miles offshore. So just because it’s small, doesn’t mean it’s not significant. It’s very close to what we call amenity beaches, like Huntington Beach all the way down to Dana Point. Those are fully utilized for all kinds of recreation. That area in Southern California, you have a sort of persistent westward and southwestern wind. And so it only takes a few hours for that oil to be up on the beach. In the case of Deepwater Horizon, it was 50 miles offshore. It took weeks for the oil to actually come onto shore and so people could prepare for it. Here, there was no real preparation that you could do. It was up on the beach before people even knew you had a spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zlltDe"&gt;The other thing that you have to realize is, no two spills are exactly the same. It’s partially the geographic setup of the place, the wind, the tides, and all that. And it’s also the composition of the oil itself. Deepwater was what we would call Louisiana light sweet crude. I mean it was almost like cooking oil, it’s very light. This one, and all of the Southern California oils, are extremely heavy, dark, dense, oils. Heavy crude oils are higher in heavy components like asphaltenes, so they tend to be more toxic than the lighter ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvyf0N"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what risks might that oil pose to wildlife and people?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pdhRJ8"&gt;Oil is a conglomeration of about 40,000 different compounds. But the most problematic ones are the so called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or PAH. These PAH can be both toxic, that is they poison things, and they are also carcinogenic.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Major oil spill in Huntington Beach" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uD7ARclKhx7IWB4wgbIsp5MuaD4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908930/1235679737.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Allen J. Schaben / &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oil lines the beach as a bird runs to avoid the incoming tide while a major oil spill washes ashore on the border of Huntington Beach and Newport Beach at the Santa Ana River Jetties Sunday, October 3rd, 2021 in Huntington Beach, California. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ag0n0p"&gt;There’s two major sets of ecological issues, not only with PAH’s, but other components as well. One is worker health and safety. I noticed most of the workers are wearing PPE; that’s great. In terms of toxicity in wildlife, the most critical early issues are for the air breathers. So this would be the marine mammals and birds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ajb9Hh"&gt;You always see pictures of oiled birds in oil spills. It’s problematic for them because it’s hard for them to regulate their body temperatures when they get oil on their feathers and skin. You often see birds preening. What they’re doing is they’re fluffing out their feathers because that’s their protection. So when they get oiled they start preening. As they’re preening with their beaks they’re ingesting the oil. You see a lot of media showing birds being cleaned with detergents and what not. The prognosis for those birds is generally not very good. It’s partly because they’ve ingested oil as well as getting it on their skin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BBmqr2"&gt;With the air breathers, there’s different ways that oil gets into their bodies and one of them is basically aspirating the oil, which gets into the lungs and the circulatory system. Like dolphins that may be in that water, they don’t do a good job avoiding oil. You know, it’s not something they encounter all the time. That area down there has a number of large whale species. Luckily, some of the major migrations have already happened and return migrations haven’t started, but that’s certainly something to worry about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CCrPn7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In California, authorities are collecting oil on the surface of the water &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/05/us/california-oil-spill-explainer/index.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;using mechanical equipment called skimmers. And they’ve set up barriers called booms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; to try to stop the oil from spreading. What else can be done to clean up the spill, especially after it reaches shore?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G2bVBD"&gt;Of all the habitats where oil can get into, beaches are probably one of the least complex in order to actually mitigate the effects of the spill and pick up the oil. It’s not a very convoluted habitat and you can use machinery to groom those beaches, to get rid of tar balls and all that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ot4cvz"&gt;Particularly with this heavy crude oil, the oil comes in on waves and it gets mixed with beach sand. And so you get these patties that form, and they will persist at what we call the toe of the beach — that’s sort of where the waves break. And so I wouldn’t be surprised that as winter storms come, you’ll see tar balls cast on that beach all winter long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MU6bYB"&gt;The more problematic issue with the California spill is that there are several points of headlands there that enter into estuaries and marshes. Once oil enters the estuary and marsh habit, it cannot be cleaned up. I mean you can skim some oil at the surface, but once it gets entangled in all the wetlands vegetation, there’s no real way to mitigate that without causing more damage than the oil would itself. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="huntington beach oil spill talbert marsh" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HlY0s5xgygxHZKCYEXupHn4nBY0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908945/1235679707.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Myung J. Chun / &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Workers with Patriot Environmental Services clean up oil that flowed into the Talbert Marsh in Huntington Beach on Sunday, October 3rd, 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZqmJdl"&gt;One of the strategies for these habitats is to try to string booms across the mouths of these estuaries to intercept the oil that might be coming in. That can be effective if the weather and wave action cooperate. But if it’s bad weather, oil just hops over these booms which are not particularly high. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jOdkMH"&gt;&lt;q&gt; “It will probably be there for decades.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d7J3dt"&gt;Once it’s in a habitat like this, there’s a lot of sediment that gets transported there until eventually the oil will be sequestered by the sediment. It’s sort of landfilled. Once it’s landfilled deep enough, oxygen will not get to it, and it’s the oxygen exposure and the sunlight that actually weathers oil. So once it’s below the oxygen line, it’ll degrade extremely slowly. It will probably be there for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio review: back to the drawing board</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Microsoft rethinks what a creator-focused laptop should be and is mostly successful&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="exRwHq"&gt;Microsoft’s new Surface Laptop Studio is both familiar and unique at the same time. If you don’t peer too closely, you’ll see what appears to be a standard, clamshell laptop. The similarities to Apple’s MacBook Pro designs are undeniable — the rounded corners, the layout of the keyboard and trackpad on the deck, even the port layouts all scream Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qhQ3YG"&gt;But in typical Surface fashion, there’s something different going on when you look closer. Though you can use the Laptop Studio just like a standard laptop, you can also pull the screen forward to bring it closer to you for touch interaction, or lay it flat to write on it like a tablet. Microsoft is not the first manufacturer to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22688432/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-book-3-specs-step-backwards"&gt;deploy such a design&lt;/a&gt;, but the Surface Laptop Studio is certainly the sleekest laptop yet with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pwsfXT"&gt;The company envisions digital artists using the screen in its various positions to draw on it, or lay it flat when docked to a monitor, mouse, and keyboard for digital note taking. It’s an evolution of what Microsoft did with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21271735/microsoft-surface-book-3-review-15-inch-screen-size-specs-features-price"&gt;Surface Book line&lt;/a&gt;, but without that computer’s compromises in performance and portability. The Laptop Studio works just as well as a standard laptop as it does as a device for making digital art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N4RHq3"&gt;That evolution doesn’t come cheap, though. The Laptop Studio starts at $1,599.99 for a basic model — equip it with a faster processor; more RAM and storage; and a discrete GPU, and you’ll easily add a thousand dollars to that number. And even then, the Laptop Studio doesn’t have access to the most powerful chips or graphics cards available today. With so many excellent creator-focused laptops to choose from, many of which offer more power for considerably less money, you really have to want the Laptop Studio’s pivoting screen or head-turning design to justify its cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="clg59l"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10796711"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TbPTEa8NuHwrcqNlBMn7JAdWxKE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22909922/microsoft_surface_laptop_studio_4795_24.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “tent” position of the Laptop Studio’s screen blocks the keyboard but provides access to the trackpad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="H4LIU6"&gt;The Laptop Studio’s top half is only a little bit thicker than a normal laptop lid, but otherwise is completely normal when using it as a typical laptop. The main hinge is stiff and doesn’t wobble — a common problem with Microsoft’s older Surface Book design — but you can still open it with one finger easily. The magnesium and aluminum chassis is sturdy and well made, with nary a flex to be found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XpJSbs"&gt;The Laptop Studio’s design is also sturdier-feeling and more stable than the typical convertible laptop with a 360-degree hinge. It has options for more powerful components than you typically find in a convertible laptop or Microsoft’s own thin-and-light Surface Pro 8, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kXDeAf"&gt;The screen is a 14.4-inch touch display, with 2400 x 1600 pixels and a 120Hz refresh rate. It’s bright and color accurate, just like other Surface displays, and it’s large enough to comfortably split the screen between multiple windows using &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22710511/windows-11-snap-layouts-how-to"&gt;Windows 11’s new Snap layouts&lt;/a&gt;. The 120Hz refresh rate provides much smoother scrolling with the cursor, better touch interactions, and reduced latency with pen input. The Surface-signature 3:2 aspect ratio makes working with documents and browsing websites more comfortable, but it also gives the Laptop Studio a footprint that’s almost as big as a 15-inch laptop. At over four pounds and 0.7 inches thick, this isn’t exactly an ultra-portable laptop, but it’s not a huge chore to lug around, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TUWiJs"&gt;Pulling the screen forward is a bit awkward — you have to reach up and bend the top half backward until the magnets holding the bottom half in place release, and then you can bring it closer to you. You can then park it halfway across the deck, tenting it above the keyboard, but still providing access to the trackpad. Magnets in the deck grab the edge of the screen to “lock” it in place. I struggled to find a good use case for this mode other than watching movies on an airplane tray table or poking around on the touchscreen, as the angle of the display is still too vertical to comfortably write on it with a pen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EysQPz"&gt;From the “tent” position, you can then lift the screen up and flatten it down entirely, turning the computer into an awkward and heavy tablet. This mode makes sense for drawing or writing — the screen is flat and it’s easy to lean over it and start working with a pen. But you’re not going to want to use it in place of an iPad or other lightweight tablet for watching movies or reading in bed, it’s just too bulky and heavy to practically do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v8ujbysyy_U_Roh4mGPsl1u7kz4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22909923/microsoft_surface_laptop_studio_4795_20.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A side view of the Surface Laptop Studio in tent mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/muSPBB-BE-syVCWEOnCyMkWUbVs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22909938/microsoft_surface_laptop_studio_4795_15.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The flat position of the screen is ideal for note taking or drawing with the Surface Pen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pwOU0g"&gt;Around the screen are relatively large bezels, at least compared to Dell’s XPS computers. The corners of the screen are aggressively rounded — so much so that they sometimes cut into the window of an app that’s docked to the side of the screen. The bezel also houses a 2-megapixel 1080p webcam with Windows Hello facial login. This camera is not as nice as the 5-megapixel sensor in the Surface Pro computers, and it made my face look red in video calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cEBlwL"&gt;The bottom half of the Laptop Studio also has some unique features, but you have to actually lift the machine up to see them. Hidden below the deck is a platform of sorts that raises the laptop up a few millimeters. Though it makes the Laptop Studio noticeably thicker than a Surface Pro, it allows for one of Intel’s more powerful (and hot) processors and a discrete GPU, plus the cooling systems needed to make those parts run efficiently. I thought this platform would make typing on the keyboard awkward, but in actual use it’s nearly invisible and doesn’t require lifting my wrists up any more than normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aNb7oR"&gt;The Laptop Studio’s fan layout is rather strange, though. Unlike most laptops, which have their fans toward the back of the computer to blow air away from you, the Studio’s are in the front half of the bottom deck. They exhaust on each side of the computer — when it’s under load, you can feel quite a bit of warm air shooting out the sides. Most of the time, the fans are quiet and dormant, so unless you’re playing a game or running an intensive application, you won’t even notice them. Even under load, the Laptop Studio’s fans are nowhere near as loud as a typical gaming laptop, either.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lXrKRpe-2D6l13vZi9YgCP1If_A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22909936/microsoft_surface_laptop_studio_4795_10.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Laptop Studio’s keyboard and trackpad are both excellent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2928WF"&gt;Two of the Laptop Studio’s four speakers vent out of the sides of the platform as well, while the other two are under the keyboard. The Studio’s audio is better than average and works well for video calls, but it doesn’t quite have the punch or room-filling ability of a MacBook Pro 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I3kcMw"&gt;That unique platform under the laptop also provides a place for the Surface Slim Pen 2 ($129.99, not included) to be stored and charged. Just under the front lip of the computer are magnets that grab the pen and hold on tightly, so it’s always there and charged when you want to use it. It’s a more stable system than the magnets on the side of the screen used to hold the pens on older Surface computers or the iPad Pro, yet it’s more elegant than the garages that other laptop makers provide to store a stylus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Mv5sc"&gt;An aside on the new Slim Pen 2: it’s got a similar shape and weight to the Slim Pen introduced a couple of years ago, but it has a finer point and a new haptic system that provides subtle vibration feedback as you write or draw on the screen. My colleague Tom Warren &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22710381/microsoft-surface-slim-pen-2-hands-on"&gt;wrote about the pen separately&lt;/a&gt;, but I’ll add that it greatly improves the handwriting experience in apps that support the haptics, giving me more feedback and control than older Surface pens. Unfortunately, the haptics are only available in a handful of apps. Stranger still, popular note-taking apps like Microsoft’s own OneNote, Nebo, or Evernote don’t yet utilize them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjEW5Z"&gt;I am not an artist, so it’s difficult for me to speak to using the Studio and the new pen for creating art. If you are, I suggest checking out &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/thebradcolbow"&gt;Brad Colbow’s videos on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, he’s a cartoonist who tests tablets and styli to see how well they work for making digital art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hn1QAL"&gt;In addition to other design elements, Microsoft appears to also be taking inspiration from Apple with the Laptop Studio’s port selection. Instead of the multiple varieties of ports that were on the Book line, the Studio has just two Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports, a headphone jack, and the Surface connector. It’s great that Microsoft is finally embracing Thunderbolt, which allows me to use my speedy external drive and dock with ease, but it’s frustrating that this computer, aimed at creators, lacks an SD card slot or any other I/O.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KMe0F0"&gt;Like other Surface computers, the Laptop Studio’s keyboard is very good. It’s got 1.3mm of travel, is comfortably spaced, has a backlight, and is generally just very nice to type on. It’s closer to the keyboard in the standard Surface Laptop than the Surface Book’s, but I have zero complaints with it. Similarly, the new trackpad, which has a haptic system similar to what Apple uses on MacBooks, is large and very accurate. Clicking is easy no matter where I press; scrolling and multi-finger gestures are buttery smooth; and palm rejection is excellent. It’s perhaps the best trackpad on any Windows laptop right now.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1pyAgG7wTFkfro9wUxW9B-aLdjs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22910039/microsoft_surface_laptop_studio_4795_9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The underside of the Laptop Studio has a unique platform that provides room for the components and cooling systems.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="b8skE2"&gt;The Laptop Studio is available in a handful of configurations, starting with an Intel 11th Gen Core i5 processor and integrated Intel Xe graphics. Most customers will likely want to upgrade to the discrete Nvidia RTX 3050 Ti graphics option, which starts at $2,099.99 and includes an upgrade to the Core i7-11370H processor. My review unit has the Core i7 chip, the Nvidia GPU, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of SSD storage and costs a staggering $2,699.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="6lIXu3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10796774"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vd9Cbk"&gt;There’s no getting around it: that is a lot of money for what amounts to midrange performance. The processor is a 35W quad-core chip, not the six- or eight-core processors found in competitors like the XPS 15 or gaming-focused laptops that use AMD Ryzen chips. The RTX 3050 Ti is a midrange GPU that can work for casual gaming but isn’t powerful enough to really take advantage of the Laptop Studio’s fast refresh screen in modern titles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WgCYx1"&gt;Microsoft says the Laptop Studio is good for “weekend gamers,” which translates to “gaming is not really what it’s designed for.” I ran a battery of gaming tests on it anyway and the results were exactly what you might expect from this level of hardware. &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider &lt;/em&gt;managed 28 frames per second at the Studio’s native resolution and all the eye candy turned on. &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2&lt;/em&gt; pulled 42fps at native res and details cranked up, thanks to the help of Nvidia’s DLSS tech (set to Auto mode). Even when lowering the resolution to 1920 x 1440, the Laptop Studio only eked out a couple frames more per second in either of those demanding games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nN5g0f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 4&lt;/em&gt; managed just 38fps at native resolution and ultra settings, while &lt;em&gt;Fornite&lt;/em&gt; on epic mode averaged 40fps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RQO4Jv"&gt;Lighter fare, such as &lt;em&gt;Civ VI&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, is able to run at much higher frame rates, but the gist is that you’ll want to utilize DLSS as much as you can and be willing to turn down both resolution and detail settings in your games to get the best experience. When I set &lt;em&gt;Forza&lt;/em&gt; to 1080p resolution and medium graphics, I saw a stable 97fps, which was a great experience (and still looked quite pretty, as well). Running &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; at native resolution with details set to high produced a much more playable 75 frames per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bazEQw"&gt;The Laptop Studio may not be the best choice for gaming, but it does hold its own for creative work. It was able to export a five-minute, 33 second 4K video from Adobe Premiere Pro in five minutes and 35 seconds, about the same as an M1 MacBook Pro, but not as speedy as other laptops with more powerful graphics cards. In the PugetBench test, which runs Premiere Pro through a number of tasks to simulate actual editing work, the Laptop Studio scored 427, a bit lower than Razer’s &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=44616"&gt;Blade 14 that scored 593&lt;/a&gt; or a well-equipped &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=55564"&gt;Dell XPS 15’s score of 665&lt;/a&gt;. Both of those computers are also considerably less expensive than the Laptop Studio when outfitted with similar amounts of RAM and storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5gHRzU"&gt;The Studio’s cooling system did a good job no matter what tasks were thrown at the computer. It kept temps low enough to prevent throttling, and though I could feel warmth under my palms in the deck, it never got uncomfortably hot. The older Surface Books had problems staying charged when playing games for long periods due to underpowered power supplies — Daniel Rubino noted in his &lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/surface-laptop-studio-review"&gt;Surface Laptop Studio review on &lt;em&gt;Windows Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it suffers from a similar problem. If you plan on gaming a lot, you might want to pick up the 127W charger from the Book 3, which Rubino says solved the power drain problem on his Laptop Studio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q6sbgv"&gt;In typical productivity work, the Laptop Studio had no problems juggling many browser tabs, multiple virtual desktops, Slack, Zoom, email, and other daily work apps at the same time. I did initially experience some bad lag when moving windows around while on battery power, but a hard restart (holding the power button down for 15 seconds) appeared to resolve that, and I didn’t see it again during my testing. It’s not quite as snappy as an M1 MacBook Pro for this kind of multitasking, especially when it’s unplugged, but it’s not a frustratingly slow experience either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t0TvTS"&gt;Unplugging the Laptop Studio from power &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; where you’ll see the biggest problem with it, though. Under my normal usage, I averaged less than five hours per charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pwiTzH"&gt;My normal workload is not that intense either. It includes the usual array of many browser tabs in Edge, Slack, email, Spotify, Twitter, Evernote, and a few other apps running across three virtual desktops and the display at 50 percent brightness. Five hours is less than virtually every other productivity-focused laptop you can buy now lasts, and considerably less stamina than the Surface Book 3 showed. Even some gaming laptops are lasting hours longer on a charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BP3onj"&gt;There are a couple reasons for this: the Laptop Studio’s 58 watt-hour battery is much smaller than the 15-inch Book 3’s 80 watt-hour cell, and Windows 11 doesn’t yet support the Dynamic Refresh Rate mode that was part of the original announcement. That means the 120Hz screen is running at 120Hz all the time, which consumes more power. You can dive deep into the display settings to set it to 60Hz, but even when doing that I only managed to eke out another hour of battery life. Dynamic Refresh Rate would allow the screen to automatically change its refresh rate depending on what you’re doing, which should theoretically save battery. Sadly, Microsoft has not said when it will be available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3--zCti2BD8fRC7Iq_lLwsbX6M8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22909934/microsoft_surface_laptop_studio_4795_14.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thunderbolt 4 ports allow the Laptop Studio to work with Thunderbolt docks and accessories.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="MY27d4"&gt;It’s a perennial game among laptop reviewers to try to figure out exactly for whom Microsoft designs its Surface computers. The company’s marketing often shows off the computers in minimally decorated art studios with hip designers painstakingly crafting lines on the screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LZmuV4"&gt;But the reality is that the market for digital artists is actually quite small, and the majority of people who are looking at a Laptop Studio or any of Microsoft’s computers are likely doing so for a different reason. Perhaps they are a video or photo creative pining for a MacBook-like computer that runs Windows and the offerings from Dell and HP just aren’t cutting it. Maybe they’re a Microsoft super fan who wants to buy into the company’s vision of what the future of computing might be, no matter the cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CkSLcr"&gt;Those people have often been let down by the Surface line, either because the Surface Pro or standard Surface Laptop didn’t provide enough performance for their needs or the Surface Book had just too many compromises in the name of drawing to make it practical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="80syrA"&gt;The Laptop Studio is perhaps the most appealing computer for them, then. Its list of compromises is much shorter — really, it’s the high sticker price and poor battery life and not much else — and it’s an enjoyable computer to use, even if you never draw a single digital brushstroke. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="wODcWY"&gt;Still, even if you’re Microsoft’s ideal customer, you need to give up a lot of money and battery life to get this screen with all its flexibility. But if you’re willing to be flexible yourself, and don’t really need a screen that moves in unique ways, the Dell XPS 15 is a lovely computer that costs a bit less while providing a bit more power.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to preorder the Apple Watch Series 7</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OaNqWaV5j4cx0WB5BjSpqEwDxr4=/154x0:1807x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69949627/Apple_watch_series7_availability_stainless_steel_10052021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 features larger screens.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WAQ6pp"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;new Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt; Series 7 was announced alongside the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22672438/ipad-2021-new-price-specs-release-date-apple-a13-chip"&gt;iPad&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review"&gt;iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s the final device of Apple’s new fall products to launch. This newer model sits atop Apple’s current lineup of smartwatches, which still includes the SE and Series 3 rounding out the line. Featuring a slightly revamped design and larger display, the Series 7 comes in either a 41mm (up from 40mm) configuration starting at $399 or a 45mm (up from 44mm) configuration — each with optional cellular radios if you want to pay for service with your carrier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hMTfvS"&gt;After Apple’s initial announcement billed them for release “later this fall,” we now know &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708611/apple-watch-7-release-date-price-preorder"&gt;the new models are set to release on October 15th&lt;/a&gt;, and you can &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch%2Fapple-watch&amp;amp;subid1=vergeapplewatchseries7preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;preorder them now through Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfKhcuwgnDQ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-series-7-gps%2F-%2FA-84736576%3Fpreselect%3D77640209%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergeapplewatchseries7preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lWzYHy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: We will update this post as more retailers open up preorder listings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LuD92a"&gt;What’s New&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="roSEq8"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 prominently features that new, larger display that stretches the screen closer to the edges for a more full-bleed aesthetic and showing more actionable information at once. It has a slight curve at its farthest edges, though Apple says the watch is overall more durable thanks to a 50 percent thicker glass cover and IP6X rating for better dirt and sand resistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9RLkrZ"&gt;New watch faces exclusive to the Series 7 promise to put that extra screen real estate to work, while the watch maintains a physical footprint that is close to its predecessor. Apple has also improved charging speeds, including a new USB-C wireless magnetic fast charger with the watch that it claims will offer up to a 33 percent quicker charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lttaJ7"&gt;On the software side, the Apple Watch Series 7 runs watchOS 8, supports a full swiping keyboard for text input, is compatible with new workouts, and maintains all the health-tracking features found on prior iterations: sleep tracking, heart rate and blood oxygen monitoring, and fall detection that now registers during workouts. There is plenty to take advantage of if you’re in the market for a new Apple Watch and prefer to have Apple’s latest and greatest iteration.&lt;/p&gt;

Let’s break down all that there is to offer here before we dive further into specific configurations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="ixNYqI"&gt;How to preorder the Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="yBbMqA"&gt;You can preorder your preferred configuration directly from Apple right now, with orders shipping on October 15th. The main options for you to decide on, aside from your preferred color, are size and connectivity. The base Apple Watch Series 7 configuration is a 41mm, GPS-only model that retails for $399. The 41mm version with a cellular connection runs $100 more at $499. If you have a larger wrist or prefer bigger screens, the 45mm GPS-only model is $429, while its cellular-equipped counterpart climbs up to $529. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="uoprLg"&gt;How to preorder the Apple Watch Series 7 from phone carriers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3dbtKG"&gt;Most major phone carriers in the USA offer the cellular Apple Watch Series 7 for preorder, which can help if you prefer to purchase the smartwatch on a monthly installment plan that you might already have for your phone. For the cellular models, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-11557999?sid=VergeAppleWatchSeries7100821&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fconnected-smartwatches%2Fapple-watch-series-7%2F%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836598-13761603?sid=VergeAppleWatchSeries7100821&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fwearables%2Fapple-watch-series-7-41mm-green-aluminum-clover-sport.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsmart-watch%2Fapple-watch-series-7-41mm%3Fsku%3D194252566381&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22664661%2Fapple-watch-series-7-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt; all offer the Series 7 in each of its sizes and colors at the same starting price as Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gdxgiN"&gt;Apple has confirmed that when you &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch%2Fapple-watch%2Faluminum-case&amp;amp;subid1=vergeapplewatchseries7preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy a cellular-equipped Apple Watch Series 7 through its own store&lt;/a&gt; and activate it on &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100009682-14498937?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fshop%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22664661%2Fapple-watch-series-7-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sprint / T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, you will get $100 back.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Watch Edition with Hermès strap.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VH7yJz"&gt;More premium case options and custom configurator&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="T46tsH"&gt;Apple has also offered the latest top-end watch in additional case materials for years. This generation is no different, with the Series 7 available in &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch%2Fapple-watch%2Fstainless-steel-case&amp;amp;subid1=vergeapplewatchseries7preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;stainless steel starting at $699&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch%2Fapple-watch%2Ftitanium-case&amp;amp;subid1=vergeapplewatchseries7preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;titanium starting at $799&lt;/a&gt;, as well as band options from luxury fashion boutique Hermès. The easiest way to preorder these is directly from Apple, as it carries the most options and not all retailers sell the more luxurious watches — though &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfKhlKGfOGa" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; does have some stainless steel models available for preorder. Most people opt for aluminum, which offers the same functionality at a lower price, but the premium models have a unique fit and finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NR4t55"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fstudio%2Fapple-watch&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22664661%2Fapple-watch-series-7-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch Studio&lt;/a&gt;, Apple’s own online boutique for creating exact custom Apple Watch configurations, makes a return for the Series 7. If you prefer an Apple Watch in a particular combination of size, finish, color, and band, you can make your selection and pay the configured price directly from Apple. This is the only way to order one of the popular solo loop straps with your Apple Watch, as those fixed-length straps are only sold through Apple.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA: Don’t peel off the protective cover on your OLED Switch’s glass screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z6SVdN8g3pp1mlZOCHy55pnGFGs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69968923/cfaulkner_210921_4751_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9TJsRB"&gt;If you’re the owner of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review"&gt;Nintendo Switch OLED console&lt;/a&gt;, make sure you don’t try to peel off the integrated screen protector on your new device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rCfXfV"&gt;While the OLED Switch’s display is technically made of glass, you won’t actually ever come in contact with it directly. That’s because Nintendo has stuck an “anti-scattering adhesive film” to the front of the display for added protection. Anti-scattering films are typically used to prevent glass from breaking into sharp shards in the event of damage, in addition to helping protect from scratches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="e5VVa4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nintendo Switch OLED review: screentime","url":"https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="XyvXQQ"&gt;The original Switch and Switch Lite didn’t have that concern, given that they both had plastic displays, but it’s a helpful addition to make sure that the glass display doesn’t cause problems if you manage to break it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aFBpvE"&gt;Odds are, you won’t even notice it’s there (as my colleague Andrew Webster &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review"&gt;noted in his review&lt;/a&gt;, it’s nearly impossible to see). But Nintendo very clearly recommends that you don’t remove it: “Do not peel off the anti-scattering adhesive film from the OLED screen of the console,” warns the company in the OLED Switch’s manual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vlN26S"&gt;Non-removable screen covers aren’t a new thing in tech: the Galaxy Fold infamously features a screen layer that &lt;em&gt;looked&lt;/em&gt; like a cover but was actually a critical part of the display, and Samsung has been pre-installing screen protectors on its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/28/18244693/samsung-galaxy-s10-free-screen-protector"&gt;main line of Galaxy S smartphones since 2019&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OLzoLI"&gt;Nintendo has confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the anti-scattering film also won’t cause issues with a screen protector, if you want to add an extra layer of protection on top of the pre-applied film. The company actually sells its &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Carrying-Case-Screen-Protector/dp/B095R5BK6F?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;own first-party screen protector for the OLED Switch for $20&lt;/a&gt;, which also includes a carrying case and a protector for a regular Switch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch defaced with pictures of Jeff Bezos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j6R2Gzf380tglh16xD1psiuaLKg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69968837/acastro_190923_twitch_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I1DqSH"&gt;Hackers have managed to deface Twitch for a few hours this morning, replacing a number of background game images with photos of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. Users reported seeing images of Bezos in the listings for &lt;em&gt;GTA V&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Smite&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;, and many more on the Amazon-owned service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="39EQD1"&gt;It’s not clear how the background images were changed or whether this latest incident was aided by a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712250/twitch-hack-leak-data-streamer-revenue-steam-competitor"&gt;huge security breach at Twitch&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week. Hackers were able to exploit a server misconfiguration and steal hundreds of gigabytes of information. Twitch is still investigating the breach, and so far &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712250/twitch-hack-leak-data-streamer-revenue-steam-competitor"&gt;a wealth of information&lt;/a&gt; pertaining to the website’s source code, unreleased projects, and even how much the top streamers make has been released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fOsliQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;More Twitch shenanigans are afoot. All game directory header pictures on the Web version of Twitch are now showing a closeup picture of Jeff Bezos. It's been like this for the last 2 hours. &lt;a href="https://t.co/LcKP9jGMCC"&gt;pic.twitter.com/LcKP9jGMCC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— AnEternalEnigma (@AnEternalEnigma) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AnEternalEnigma/status/1446421951883489281?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="P4rQWm"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=AnnoyingPlayfulCakeOpieOP-mfEZnNwEfCP3ulPt&amp;amp;parent=www.theverge.com&amp;amp;parent=iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=iframely.com&amp;amp;parent=cdn.iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=if-cdn.com" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LrJGPS"&gt;At least one former Twitch employee &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714160/twitch-hack-security-data-breach-problems"&gt;warned that attackers&lt;/a&gt; can now see the shortcuts and APIs for internal Amazon services thanks to this leak. It’s entirely possible that the leak revealed some code that let people easily alter background images on Twitch, or that this was simply a case of cache poisoning. Twitch relies on different methods to cache images, and those may have experienced issues. Either way, Twitch isn’t having a good week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bDLYqW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/q3tcbx/is_twitch_hacked/"&gt;Reddit users noticed&lt;/a&gt; the defaced images at &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/q3tdj9/gta_5s_banner_replaced_with_jeffrery_bezos_face/"&gt;around 5AM ET&lt;/a&gt; this morning, with several images showing Bezos’ face as a banner behind games listed in the Twitch directory. We’ve reached out to Twitch about this incident, but the company didn’t respond in time for publication.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s 2020 iPad Air is down to its lowest price yet today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The new iPad Air with Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FMfAHQh2K8WDQuNngHf5Tjy41L0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69968651/vpavic_4244_20201020_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Magic Keyboard is, unfortunately, sold separately.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sMOd8h"&gt;Apple’s fourth-generation iPad Air with a refreshed design and USB-C charging instead of Lightning &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J66ZMY7/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is down to its best price yet at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. You can get the 64GB Wi-Fi model in the color of your choosing for $489 — $10 less than the starting price &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review"&gt;for the new iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; that has a similar design. For the price, you’re getting a far bigger tablet. If you’ve been in the market for a high-end iPad but don’t want to put down iPad Pro-levels of cash, this could be exactly what you’re after. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0lw7Hg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546269"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YtW7Pt"&gt;For the first time since launching earlier this year, the navy-colored Apple AirTag Loop is &lt;a href="http://adorama.rfvk.net/0Jjn2V"&gt;selling for $19 instead of its typical $29&lt;/a&gt; at Adorama. The simple, polyurethane loop allows you to add your AirTag — which lacks a lanyard hole — to accessories like your backpack, keychain, and luggage. Although there are often more affordable third-party loops available, this is a rare deal Apple fans may find worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Tj5Kpn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10795285"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3r70zX"&gt;If you’re in the market for a competent laptop, Samsung’s Galaxy Book Pro is currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B091WY8D1C/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon for $849&lt;/a&gt;, a $250 discount. Equipped with 512GB of storage and Intel’s 11th Gen Core i5 processor, the 15.6-inch laptop normally goes for $1,100. In addition to offering an AMOLED display and 20 hours of battery life, the lightweight Windows machine also comes with Wi-Fi 6 compatibility, a Thunderbolt 4 port, and Intel’s Iris Xe integrated graphics. Those deeply embedded in the Samsung ecosystem might also enjoy how you can easily pair the clamshell laptop with Samsung’s line of Galaxy Buds and quickly share files across Galaxy devices with Quick Share. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22405540/samsung-galaxy-book-pro-360-features-price-photos-video-release-date"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our hands-on impressions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GhiBux"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10750960"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QP1QmY"&gt;Apple owners planning on traveling this upcoming holiday season may be interested in this rare discount on the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-11365093?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2FVerge%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2Fvergedailydeals092321%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fapple-magsafe-duo-charger-wireless-qi%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple MagSafe Duo Charger&lt;/a&gt;. Normally $129, Verizon is currently selling the charger — which you can fold to make smaller and thus more portable — for $97, one of its lowest prices to date. With the wireless charging station, you can charge MagSafe-compatible iPhone 12 and 13 models, as well as the Apple Watch, select AirPods models, and various Qi-certified devices. Note, however, that in order to fast-charge your iPhone, you’ll need at least a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-20W-USB-C-Power-Adapter/dp/B08L5M9BTJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;20W power brick&lt;/a&gt;, which will allow for charging speeds of up to 11W.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7S41gC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386180"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="frrWKi"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13527013?url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fgopro-hero9-black-waterproof-action-camera-2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GoPro Hero9&lt;/a&gt;, the “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437419/gopro-hero-9-review"&gt;biggest, baddest action camera out there&lt;/a&gt;,” is $70 cheaper today at Woot. Now until October 30th (or while supplies last), members can &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13527013?url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fgopro-hero9-black-waterproof-action-camera-2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pick up the popular action camera for $380&lt;/a&gt; instead of $450, with free shipping for Prime members. The GoPro Hero9 can capture 5K video at 60fps as well as 23MP stills, and it features a new processor and a removable lens. Just like the newer Hero10, it offers crisp footage along with a great front-facing screen and rugged build quality. As noted in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22675560/gopro-hero10-action-camera-review"&gt;Hero10 review&lt;/a&gt;, the last-gen model is not too dissimilar from the more expensive Hero10 — that is, unless you need smooth, 5.3K 60fps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Ejat2B"&gt;Apple fans, we’ve got another deal you might love. If you’re open to a desktop computer, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Mini-Chip-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5P7TLW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can save $100&lt;/a&gt; on the 512GB version of the 2020 Mac Mini, which comes with Apple’s new M1 chip. Regularly $899, the Mac Mini is on sale at Amazon for $799, its lowest price to date. After testing the Mac Mini, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;we found&lt;/a&gt; the device’s performance to be impressive and praised how well existing apps run on the M1 chip. We did, however, dislike the built-in speaker and the fact that the Mini only offers up to 16GB of unified memory. Note the 256GB configuration is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Mini-Chip-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5PHB83?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$50 cheaper today at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, selling for $659.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook bans developer behind Unfollow Everything tool</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S1GiZY-WJjRrbuVLGrJjJK2JKAQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69968061/acastro_180720_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xBjNqF"&gt;A developer who made a tool that let people automatically unfollow friends and groups on Facebook says he’s been banned permanently from the social networking site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FTvE90"&gt;Louis Barclay was the creator of “Unfollow Everything,” a browser extension that allowed Facebook users to essentially delete their News Feed by unfollowing all their connections at once. Facebook allows users to individually unfollow friends, groups, and pages, which removes their content from the News Feed, the algorithmically-controlled heart of Facebook. Barclay’s tool automated this process, instantly wiping users’ News Feed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QdR9xS"&gt;As Barclay wrote of his experience using the tool in a &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2021/10/facebook-unfollow-everything-cease-desist.html"&gt;recent article for &lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="pMzZ0P"&gt;I still remember the feeling of unfollowing everything for the first time. It was near-miraculous. I had lost nothing, since I could still see my favorite friends and groups by going to them directly. But I had gained a staggering amount of control. I was no longer tempted to scroll down an infinite feed of content. The time I spent on Facebook decreased dramatically. Overnight, my Facebook addiction became manageable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="cd3zMT"&gt;In response, Facebook sent Barclay a &lt;a href="https://louisbarclay.notion.site/Unfollow-Everything-cease-and-desist-letter-from-Facebook-ea219169421b457bb7ce010b7bf9ce1f"&gt;cease-and-desist letter&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, saying he’d violated the site’s terms of service by creating software that automated user interactions. Barclay says the company then “permanently disabled my Facebook and Instagram accounts” and “demanded that I agree to never again create tools that interact with Facebook or its other services.” Barclay notes that in addition to helping users, his “Unfollow Everything” tool was being used by researchers at the Swiss University of Neuchâtel to study the effects of the News Feed on people’s happiness. He says he couldn’t risk tangling in court with a trillion-dollar company like Facebook and so simply removed the tool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="66HVPl"&gt;Barclay’s story has emerged at an inauspicious time for Facebook (though when is it a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; time for the perpetually-embattled firm?). Whistleblower Frances Haugen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712512/facebook-whistleblower-testimony-analysis-congress-instagram-whatsapp"&gt;appeared before Congress&lt;/a&gt; this week to testify about Facebook’s insatiable demand for growth, which Haugen says comes too often at the costs of users’ well-being. “It’s paying for its profits with our safety,” she said in an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/3/22707860/facebook-whistleblower-leaked-documents-files-regulation"&gt;episode of &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Documents leaked by Haugen include internal research conducted by Facebook that shows how using Instagram &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675130/facebook-instagram-teens-mental-health-damage-internal-research"&gt;exacerbates body issues and mental health problems&lt;/a&gt; for some teenagers. Facebook’s primary response to Haugen’s testimony has been to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711182/facebook-whistleblower-smear-pr-response"&gt;smear her&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oJr8HH"&gt;Compared to Haugen’s exposure of Facebook, Barclay’s story is relatively run-of-the-mill. After all, Facebook’s terms of service are very clear on what sort of tools users can build, and Unfollow Everything obviously violated this agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UIAidN"&gt;But the episode still neatly illustrates Facebook’s approach to its user-base, and how it often wants to give people the feeling of control without letting them fully escape its grasp. The company is happy to let users unfollow people individually, but automating the process would make it too easy to opt-out of the News Feed, which is essential for keeping users coming back and lining Facebook’s pockets with advertising revenue. So, of course, tools like Barclay’s — even if they have limited uptake — are forbidden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Zev2R"&gt;We’ve contacted Facebook about this story and will update if we hear back. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok is coming to LG’s recent smart TVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cichmddOWapAc67TELpqQeoWkJE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69967935/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3y8Sbl"&gt;TikTok has launched an app for LG’s 2020 and 2021 smart TVs, the TV manufacturer has announced. The app arrived on these recent webOS 5.0 and webOS 6.0 models with a firmware update that started rolling out on October 7th, but will also be coming to older 2019 TVs “in the coming months.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kFFOtm"&gt;The app is launching in the UK, France, and Germany, a TikTok representative confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. That’s notable since TikTok’s smart TV apps for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174064/tiktok-tv-app-samsung-uk-fire-amazon"&gt;Samsung TVs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264642/tiktok-android-tv-launch-not-working-google"&gt;Android TV&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573707/tiktok-fire-tv-app-uk-france-germany-smart-tv"&gt;Fire TV&lt;/a&gt; have all focused on those same European countries so far. Meanwhile in the US, TikTok released a more limited &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357300/tiktok-amazon-fire-tv-app-launch-free-tv-mobile"&gt;“More on TikTok” app&lt;/a&gt; on Fire TV devices last year. We have followed up with both LG and TikTok to ask which regions the new smart TV app will be available in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tomwXf"&gt;Considering how optimized TikTok is for portrait-orientated mobile viewing, it’s not going to look great on living room televisions. But TikTok is understood to be trying to reach a broader audience with its smart TV apps, as well as to tap into the higher advertising rates associated with TV viewing, &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/sponsored-content/hire-reskill-or-upskill-a-guide-to-smarter-skill-development"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protocol &lt;/em&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1WkHE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 8th, 5:50AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Article updated with confirmed regions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Search adds guitar tuner to its smorgasbord of built-in features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gjRpA6VKypAoobgoYzGOIW4Ifh0=/0x0:661x441/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69967931/xD2C8Qsdpb.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You play a note, and the software tells you whether you’re in tune.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: Google.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9aWmrb"&gt;Google Search now has a handy built-in tuner, letting you use the microphone on your phone or computer to tune a guitar, &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-search-has-an-instrument-tuner/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. To access the feature, which was added this week, just search for “&lt;a href="https://g.co/kgs/qjLuJT"&gt;Google tuner&lt;/a&gt;.” The interface is similar to the dozens of guitar tuning apps that are already available. You play a string on the guitar, and Google will detect the note you’re aiming for, and tell you to “tune up” or “tune down” as required. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJ7QJP"&gt;Like other guitar tuning apps, the effectiveness of Google’s tuner seems to depend a lot on the hardware you’re using it with. My iPhone 12 Pro (via Safari) or Windows desktop with a Blue Snowball USB microphone (via Edge) had no trouble hearing and helping me tune an unamplified electric guitar, but a more affordable Android device I’m currently reviewing (with Chrome) couldn’t pick it up at all. Your mileage may vary, basically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wpKSVFR_7Am1wHRMaTxhXum1OeQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22909685/IMG_1534.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Google.com&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tune up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N8rphDVZZhcvMhXFfaeVr0QOdtk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22909684/IMG_1533.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Google.com&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tune down.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XAWZjX"&gt;Like most other guitar tuner apps, I don’t think Google Search’s feature is going to kill off the market for dedicated hardware tuners from the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.korg.com/uk/products/tuners/ca_1/index.php"&gt;Korg&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.boss.info/uk/products/tu-3/"&gt;Boss&lt;/a&gt;. It’s too reliant on the quality of the mic in your device, and there’s no way to easily plug in an electric guitar to avoid having to worry about background noise. But if you need to tune up in a pinch, Google Search now has you covered. &lt;/p&gt;
