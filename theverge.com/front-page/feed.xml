    <title>Microsoft says controversial Georgia law will ‘unfairly restrict the rights of people to vote’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Microsoft campus stock image" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q40lPInTqiUApZey4YZkPhv2F2Q=/0x1:1100x734/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69055739/Microsoft-_from-Msft_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mdYQvk"&gt;Microsoft is rarely shy about wading into the political conversation these days, and &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/03/31/why-we-are-concerned-about-georgias-new-election-law/"&gt;the latest missive&lt;/a&gt; from president Brad Smith is no exception: in a blog post titled “Why we are concerned about Georgia’s new election law,” he slams the state’s new Election Integrity Act for making it harder for its employees (and others) to vote — making Microsoft the first big tech company to speak out against the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ODHEz"&gt;If it’s not clear why Microsoft would go out on a limb to challenge the state on this particular issue, there are a few things you should probably know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="VIXHUA"&gt;As Smith points out, Microsoft is becoming a big employer in the state — he says Atlanta is “on the path toward becoming one of Microsoft’s largest hubs in the United States in the coming decade, after Puget Sound and Silicon Valley.” He writes that Microsoft’s workers alone will likely have 80 percent fewer drop boxes for their ballots as a direct result of the law, among other restrictions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0VwHKp"&gt;Big employers in Georgia are currently under scrutiny from activists, including some threatening to boycott both Delta Air Lines and Coke for failing to condemn the law. #BoycottDelta and #BoycottCocaCola were trending topics, &lt;a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/business/delta-coke-face-boycott-campaigns-over-new-georgia-voting-law/ZJUGGDO3HBA3BF2J64WVOQ5YE4/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; Monday. Though Delta and Coca-Cola have each now called the bill “unacceptable” &lt;a href="https://news.delta.com/ed-bastian-memo-your-right-vote"&gt;in a new memo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CNBCnow/status/1377325405468823560"&gt;a new interview&lt;/a&gt; respectively, it may be a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davidshepardson/status/1377309103786225667"&gt;little late&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft is now positioning itself favorably compared to these other big companies, largely by being a newcomer that already issued &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BradSmi/status/1374072187263533057"&gt;a tweet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QzSa7J"&gt;Smith, the company’s former chief legal officer, is still toeing the line here. While many critics of the Georgia law are happily calling it a form of voter suppression, Microsoft simply explains how this might be “challenging” for voters rather than tugging on heartstrings. Smith doesn’t get any spicier than “From our perspective, there is no rational basis for the Georgia legislature to authorize secure drop boxes but limit their use so severely” or “Can anyone imagine telling taxpayers that they must stop using a mailbox to send in their tax return four days before taxes are due?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UZbPV2"&gt;There’s no promise of any action from Microsoft, just a hope that “companies will come together and make clear that a healthy business requires a healthy community,” and that “we should work together to press the Georgia legislature to change it.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="Eb6WIV"&gt;It’s nice to see Microsoft — or any company — voice a desire to maintain or improve voting rights and explain why, though.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google union wins dispute over discussing pay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iBLgDy2bj3q87LLPPjOPr7Nh97I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69055725/acastro_191014_1777_google_pixel_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xnVHXJ"&gt;Google is telling workers they are allowed to discuss pay and working conditions as part of a settlement agreement with the Alphabet Workers Union (AWU), &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-31/google-promises-not-to-muzzle-staff-on-pay-settling-labor-case?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The move settles a labor dispute &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-04/alphabet-union-alleges-contract-workers-were-silenced-about-pay?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;brought by AWU in February&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hwhu5L"&gt;The initial complaint alleged managers at Adecco, a Google subcontracting firm, banned workers from talking about wages and bonuses. It also said that Adecco retaliated against contractor Shannon Wait after she posted pro-union messages on Facebook. The complaint said Google was a joint employer and should therefore be held liable for the treatment of contractors. Google did not admit to this classification in the settlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TC4Iju"&gt;Wait, who’d been suspended from her job, was reinstated a week after the complaint was filed. She left the company shortly after, as her contract was only for two years, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QhAgTq"&gt;On Twitter, she credited the union with helping her get her job back. “The external pressure of our #union, which is only 3 months public, held both Google and its subcontractor accountable for violating labor law,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ComradeShannon/status/1377315839389659142"&gt;she wrote&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s 2021 — the year that tech companies like #Amazon and #Google stand face-to-face with workers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YUjQjC"&gt;Google is posting signs at the data center in South Carolina as part of the agreement. “WE WILL NOT tell you that you cannot discuss policies with other employees,” the notice reads, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. “WE WILL NOT discipline you because you exercise your right to discuss wage rates, bonuses, hours and working conditions with other employees.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x53f3E"&gt;It’s a symbolic victory for the Alphabet Workers Union. The organization, which launched in January, is not currently recognized by the National Labor Relations Board. The complaint brought against Google and Adecco, however, shows the union still has teeth. Its status as a solidarity union also allows it to welcome contractors to the group. The treatment of these workers is a primary concern for union organizers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qfY0dJ"&gt;News of the settlement comes as workers at Amazon face off with management in a union fight that could change the fabric of the tech industry. Warehouse workers in Bessemer, Alabama &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/28/22352987/amazon-bessemer-alabama-union-vote-rwdsu"&gt;voted this month on whether to form a union&lt;/a&gt;. The vote count began yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7k9giB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SaDCkD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Among Us getting ‘full art style revamp’ in future update </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rP8rTAIH5W32Ngl7po_IAm9dC_Q=/289x0:2272x1322/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69055717/Screen_Shot_2021_03_31_at_2.28.15_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kvd1IJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; is changing its look. In a&lt;a href="https://innersloth.itch.io/among-us/devlog/237019/lets-go-airship-new-update-out-now"&gt; post&lt;/a&gt; on its site today, developer InnerSloth said that its plans have “completely updated the art style with cleaner lines and an easier animation process.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gSXMvG"&gt;Since becoming the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22196330/among-us-half-billion-players-november"&gt;breakout hit of 2020&lt;/a&gt;, InnerSloth has refocused its efforts on improving and updating the game, even going as far as to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21453499/among-us-2-sequel-popular-canceled-developers-innersloth"&gt;cancel&lt;/a&gt; a planned sequel. Today, InnerSloth said it will also expand its lobby size to include up to 15 players. The developer added that it plans to give players more frequent, transparent updates in an effort teach players more about the game’s behind-the-scenes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dx4Bxz"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/shX9aZH1bjs?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DEyrOK"&gt;The game gets a new map today, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338782/among-us-airship-map-accounts-update-innersloth"&gt;Airship&lt;/a&gt;, on all platforms. The map — the game’s fourth — adds new tasks, including emptying the trash and polishing jewels, as well as additional hats and skins. That includes the so-called “chocolate ice cream” hat that looks suspiciously like poop. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22353088/among-us-airship-update-poop-hat-chocolate-ice-cream"&gt;It’s poop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon insists it will give you up to $1,000 in trade-in credits for your broken phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The rear of the iPhone 12 is glossy and it picks up both fingerprints and micro-scratches fairly easily. Use a case." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CDeVlyf59mC0XzVvG5_q53Qu8Ko=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69055702/vpavic_4243_20201017_0103.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y0ZsK7"&gt;April Fools Day is at hand, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2Fyou-broke-your-phone-so-verizon-breaking-rules&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F3%2F31%2F22360418%2Fverizon-april-fools-day-trade-in-broken-cracked-water-damage-phone-android-iphone-5g" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon has willingly stepped into the fray&lt;/a&gt; with a deal that seems too good to be true — especially for people who have a broken, useless phone. The US carrier insists that starting tomorrow, April 1st, customers can trade in an “old, cracked, or water damaged phone” for up to $1,000 off a new 5G phone, like an &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/vergeVerizonInsists03312021/https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/apple-iphone-12/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/vergeVerizonInsists03312021/https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s21-5g/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy S21&lt;/a&gt;. The promo doesn’t extend to phones with battery damage (for safety concerns).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fSJ3xR"&gt;You’ll get the most out of this deal if you’re on a different carrier and looking to open a new line and port your number into Verizon’s network. But current customers can reap some savings, too. You can find out the value of your phone online or at any of its retail stores, although if you plan to visit in-person, the company encourages you to make an appointment on its &lt;a href="http://vzw.com/stores"&gt;store locator page&lt;/a&gt; or through the My Verizon app. The offer &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fshop%2Fonline%2F5g-cell-phones%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F3%2F31%2F22360418%2Fverizon-april-fools-day-trade-in-broken-cracked-water-damage-phone-android-iphone-5g" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;will go live on this page&lt;/a&gt; starting April 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8KQTct"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Trust us — this offer is #NoJoke”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XuZgYa"&gt;So, here’s the fine print (there’s a lot of it, but it’s worth trudging through if you think you may want to try for the deal):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="RWnyZj"&gt;Eligibility requires upgrading, or adding a new line and porting a number, to one of Verizon’s Unlimited plans with 5G&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0Qa1a0"&gt;For new lines and phone number port-ins &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt;: you can get a $300 Verizon e-gift card for an iPhone trade-in, or a $200 card for an Android phone (sent to you within eight weeks after transaction)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="74npNW"&gt;Stacked on that for new lines and port-ins (and also applicable for current customers): you’ll get up to $700 in monthly credits sent your way for an iPhone trade-in, or up to $800 for a qualified Android phone (sent to you as a credit each month over a 24-month period)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="1qxg1k"&gt;Once all is said and done, you’ll eventually have a $300 Verizon credit sitting on your account, and / or an additional credit coming your way each month, which will lower the cost of your monthly bill. It won’t make the investment of buying a pricey, new 5G phone any less steep upfront, but it’ll soften the blow a little by spreading the credits out over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ndZWHu"&gt;Verizon didn’t share exactly how much trade-in value every phone has, but it offered a list of phones that are in a “higher value” category and others that will fetch a “lower value.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Verizon trade in" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ew0cMFeYfkZ0u5p2VZK_24dWIEA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22410998/verizontrade.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, that’s right — Verizon will take your RED Hydrogen One as if that never happened.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="H8BhBi"&gt;We’ve reached out to Verizon to see how long this promotion will last, as it didn’t share an end date. Also, Verizon didn’t share how many people per account can trade in broken phones for credits, so we’ve asked about that, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram launches its own TikTok Duet feature called Reels Remix</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BRcA2qxLA-CKwGuyJh6PimKqVM4=/297x0:2151x1236/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69055614/Remix_Press.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yMdSbd"&gt;Instagram Reels already mimics TikTok in multiple ways, and now, it’s getting one more feature from the popular video app: duets. On Instagram, users can now &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/instagram/status/1377304845204422661?s=21"&gt;“remix” a reel&lt;/a&gt;, meaning they can upload a video next to another user’s, building on top of the original clip. The feature is already popular on TikTok, often for dance challenges, under the “duet” function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m8mVQc"&gt;To remix a reel, tap the three dot menu on a reel and select “Remix this Reel.” From there, you can record your reel or upload pre-recorded footage. You can also control the volume for the original audio or your recorded audio, and add a voiceover, along with other editing functions. Only new reels will have remixes enabled automatically, but if you already have a reel that you want people to be able to remix, you can manually turn that on by tapping that three dot menu on your own video and selecting “Enable Remixing.” If you want to turn off remixing on all your reels, you can do so via your broader profile settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5HLkeh"&gt;Reels launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21354117/instagram-reels-tiktok-vine-short-videos-stories-explore-music-effects-filters"&gt;in August last year&lt;/a&gt; and initially, Instagram seemed open to having people repurpose their TikToks on the platform. But as the months have gone by, Instagram has added more TikTok-like features while also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274332/instagram-algorithm-tiktok-watermark-recommendation-software-best-practices"&gt;deemphasizing&lt;/a&gt; any content that’s been recycled.   The company is clearly serious about making the short-form video content a mainstay. It added a Reels button to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21561099/instagram-reels-shopping-home-screen-tab-update"&gt;home screen&lt;/a&gt; and even ensured the videos made the cut for its global &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22321394/instagram-relaunch-lite-app-release-update-reels-android"&gt;Lite app&lt;/a&gt;. It’s just getting closer and closer to resembling TikTok exactly.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Discord’s new Clubhouse-like feature, Stage Channels, is available now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/imiwdmSET9OJiQs8gkFexkLB85k=/0x64:2880x1984/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69055520/Audience.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Discord&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zxy7bb"&gt;Discord is the latest company to introduce a Clubhouse-like feature that lets people easily broadcast live audio conversations to a room of virtual listeners. Discord says its take, called Stage Channels, is available now on all platforms where Discord is available, including Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FFVR6q"&gt;If you’ve used Discord before, you might know that the app already offers voice channels, which typically allow everyone in them to talk freely. A Stage Channel, on the other hand, is designed to only let certain people talk at once to a group of listeners, which could make them useful for more structured events like community town halls or AMAs. However, only Community servers, which have some more powerful community management tools than a server you might share with a few of your buddies, can make the new Stage Channels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nf7svx"&gt;The feature’s broad availability makes Discord the first app to offer an easy way to host or listen in on social audio rooms on most platforms. Clubhouse is still only available on iOS, though an Android version &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/clubhouse-says-its-android-launch-will-take-a-couple-of-months/"&gt;is in development&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter’s Spaces feature works on iOS and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309629/twitter-launches-spaces-android-ios-audio-clubhouse"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;, but only some users have the ability to make audio rooms right now. (The company plans to let anyone host a Space &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323767/twitter-spaces-april-release-date-plan"&gt;starting in April&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22359332/linkedin-clubhouse-clone-social-audio-networking-room"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22315866/mark-cuban-fireside-app-podcast-platform-clubhouse"&gt;Mark Cuban&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/slack-wants-to-be-more-than-a-text-based-messaging-platform/"&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356993/spotify-locker-room-clubhouse-launch-acquisition"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt; are also working on live audio features, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276645/facebook-clubhouse-social-audio-app-develop"&gt;Facebook reportedly has one&lt;/a&gt; in the works, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TYiv7n"&gt;At the top of this post, you can see what a Discord Stage Channel looks like on desktop, and here’s what one looks like on mobile:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TpMG23KLKUcOpg_MBwV4-icXsgQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22409295/Default.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Discord&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="G9DQAL"&gt;I got to participate in a Stage Channel to be briefed on the feature, and it was quite similar to using Clubhouse or Twitter Spaces. When I joined the Stage Channel, I was automatically put on mute and listed as an audience member. I could see who was speaking and who else was with me in the virtual crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MEN3aY"&gt;When I wanted to ask questions, I pressed a button to request to speak, and a Stage moderator brought me “on stage” so I could talk. Stage moderators can also mute speakers or even remove them from the room if they are being disruptive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gO1W8G"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cell phone plan fine print, explained</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XX4UYQkK_A81tQh9b_JmRvspGho=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69055394/acastro_210330_4500_phoneData_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unlimited plans from Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T, and T-Mobile all have one thing in common: limitations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class="ql-cursor"&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A guide to the limitations on your unlimited data&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ejBS9S"&gt;Phone plans are notorious for including the worst kinds of jargon — things that seem to tell you what you’re signing up for but actually conceal a long list of conditions and exceptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PfKPDU"&gt;This is the industry that brought us the term “anytime minutes.” Seriously, have you ever really thought about that phrase? &lt;em&gt;Anytime minutes.&lt;/em&gt; Even the 10-year-old &lt;em&gt;Portlandia&lt;/em&gt; sketch where Kumail Nanjiani sells Fred and Carrie a phone plan is still painfully accurate. (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrccTMwoLv8"&gt;Go watch it&lt;/a&gt; for such gems as “After you pay for it, it is free” and “It’s just a one-time fee that you pay annually.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cPW9SB"&gt;So it should come as no surprise that when wireless carriers call a service “Unlimited,” there are, in fact, limitations on it. T-Mobile recently brought attention to one of those practices known as “deprioritization” by introducing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295466/t-mobile-magenta-max-unlimited-data-5g-4k-video-announced"&gt;an unlimited plan without it&lt;/a&gt;. But that’s just one of a handful of fine print provisos that all three of the major US carriers impose on their customers. Here’s a jargon-free guide to the most common limitations on your favorite carrier’s so-called unlimited plans, postpaid and prepaid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qHiyY4"&gt;Premium data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="HnEpNO"&gt;You will likely see the phrase “premium data” or “premium network access” on your plan details; that’s a nice way of describing “deprioritization,” or “throttling” as it’s also called. This is when carriers temporarily slow down data speeds for their heaviest users when network traffic is high. The carriers say this practice is necessary to ensure networks aren’t overwhelmed. In many cases, deprioritization doesn’t kick in until users hit a certain monthly threshold of data usage — often 50GB — but some carriers’ lowest-tier plan subscribers are always subject to slowdowns, regardless of how much data they’ve used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="R5GdxD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some carriers’ lowest-tier plan subscribers are always subject to slowdowns&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UzMdrt"&gt;That’s the case for users on Verizon’s Start Unlimited plan and AT&amp;amp;T’s Unlimited Starter, while those on the carriers’ more expensive unlimited plans aren’t subject to slowdowns until they’ve used 50GB in a month. T-Mobile’s basic Essentials plan includes a 50GB threshold. Its most expensive plan, Magenta Max, is the only one of the major carriers’ plans that doesn’t include a limit on its fastest mobile data speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dBMPZK"&gt;Prepaid unlimited plans from all of the major carriers across the board are subject to slowdowns, regardless of how much data has been used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="N9MpjO"&gt;Video streaming limits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="EherbJ"&gt;With your smartphone connected to home Wi-Fi, you can stream video at whatever resolution you please. Streaming video over mobile data is another story. Just about every phone plan out there limits streaming video to 480p quality, but there are a few exceptions. But even the plans that do support higher-quality streaming usually require you to enable it in your account. If you do have this option and choose to enable it, just keep in mind that streaming video might eat into your monthly “premium data” allotment faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yz9TMC"&gt;For example, Verizon’s more expensive unlimited plans include 720p streaming, but you need to log in to your account online and enable it. For an extra $10 per month, you can raise that to 1080p. And if you’re connected to the company’s fast Ultra Wideband 5G — which is only included on those more expensive unlimited plans — you’ll get streaming up to 4K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="eoqSn2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Even the plans that do support higher-quality streaming usually require you to enable it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8IM7fz"&gt;The other two carriers work in a similar way. AT&amp;amp;T’s basic unlimited plans get 480p, and while the “Elite” plan includes 1080p, you’ll need to turn off a feature called “Stream Saver” in your account settings to enable it. T-Mobile’s most expensive plan, Magenta Max, includes 4K streaming, which customers need to activate. All others are limited to 1.5Mbps, which essentially translates to 480p.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r0ysgF"&gt;With a couple of exceptions, customers on prepaid unlimited plans are restricted to 480p streaming, too. AT&amp;amp;T’s most expensive prepaid unlimited plan allows users to disable Stream Saver and get 1080p streaming if they like. Verizon prepaid customers on the unlimited plan with Ultra Wideband 5G service will also get 4K if they’re connected to that network. Some data-capped prepaid plans from T-Mobile and AT&amp;amp;T allow customers to opt for HD, but not so for basic unlimited plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UnH9SV"&gt;Tethering&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ObhxDk"&gt;Another one for the category of “your unlimited data is not truly unlimited” is mobile tethering. Even though your phone might support tethering (using your mobile device’s data connection as a Wi-Fi hotspot or via a USB cable to your computer), your phone plan has limitations on if and how much you can use this feature. Basic unlimited plans tend to offer slow or no tethering at all, while even the most expensive plans include some limit to how much data you can use this way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="C0Hpfa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Basic unlimited plans tend to offer slow or no tethering at all&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HLcpEf"&gt;There’s no mobile tethering offered on Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T’s most basic unlimited plan. More expensive plans from both carriers offer progressively more generous 15GB and 30GB caps the more you pay. T-Mobile offers 3G tethering (600 Kbps) on its basic plan, which is adequate for web browsing but not ideal for streaming SD or HD video. Up to 5GB of much faster 4G / 5G data is included on its middle tier and a cap of 40GB on Magenta Max — these speeds will feel much closer to what you get with home internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NrsCFv"&gt;Mobile tethering tends to not be included on basic prepaid unlimited plans; AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon offer it as an add-on for an additional monthly fee, while T-Mobile includes it at 3G speeds. The step-up prepaid unlimited plans include high-speed tethering across the board, albeit with a lower 10GB cap in all cases. Verizon does include unlimited Ultra Wideband 5G tethering for its top prepaid plan (again, if you can manage to find an Ultra Wideband signal).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qhruad"&gt;Mexico and Canada&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="vpbF5d"&gt;If there’s one way that your unlimited plan might actually be getting you more than you realized, it’s that your plan likely includes some international data for trips to Canada and Mexico. Most plans include, as a bare minimum, very slow 2G speeds in those countries, but a few include a certain amount of 4G data on either a monthly or daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="FNWFev"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Most plans include, as a bare minimum, very slow 2G speeds&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RGkzUd"&gt;Verizon makes it simple: it includes up to 0.5GB per day for all of its postpaid and prepaid unlimited plans. Once that daily cap is reached, you’ll get 2G speeds after that. AT&amp;amp;T only says that all unlimited plans — postpaid and prepaid — include data in Mexico and Canada but that “2G off-net data speeds may apply.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZeQe49"&gt;T-Mobile’s basic postpaid Essentials plan gets 2G only; the top-tier plans include 5GB of 4G monthly and then 2G after that. The company’s prepaid unlimited plans don’t include even 2G data, and “additional charges apply for international use.” Instead, users can add 5GB of 4G data for use in Canada and Mexico for an additional $5 per month. T-Mobile and Verizon also specify that the majority of a subscriber’s usage must come from within the US; otherwise, the companies are entitled to cut off international service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QDXOKP"&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="n9VNnO"&gt;Those are the major items, but what else will you find if you go peering down the dark alleyways of your phone contract? Some are obvious, like clauses to keep you from turning your phone into your home Wi-Fi hub. Plans with generous tethering data allowances are more likely to include these details, stating, for example, that the majority of use must come from a smartphone or tablet. And of course, your contract prohibits you from certain types of bad behavior and illegal activity. But you knew that already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UzGw8Q"&gt;You might also be pleasantly surprised to find discounted or subsidized streaming video services are included in your plan, too, but you’ll definitely want to read the conditions closely. Often, it’s a promotion for a set time period, like Verizon’s “Disney Plus for six months on us,” after which you’ll be charged on your monthly phone bill unless you cancel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yyTPmo"&gt;Others — usually on the more expensive plans — are included standard, like HBO Max included on AT&amp;amp;T’s Elite plan, and Netflix subscriptions on T-Mobile’s Magenta and Magenta Max. Even in those cases, you’ll want to read the conditions; a certain number of lines are required on T-Mobile to qualify for the Netflix deal, and the subscription offered may be for a more limited version, like SD quality only on one screen per account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="985AFE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s one more agreement in your contract to be aware of: the privacy policy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5TWlaB"&gt;But there’s one more agreement in your contract to be aware of: the privacy policy. Specifically, all three major carriers sell anonymized data about their customers to third-party advertisers in the name of serving more relevant ads. It’s an unwelcome but extremely common practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="3ruipH"&gt;The good news is that you can opt out of these programs. Verizon customers can do so by logging in to My Verizon and following the steps on the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fabout%2Fprivacy%2Ffull-privacy-policy%23acc-item-34&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F31%2F22360228%2Funlimited-plan-verizon-att-t-mobile-premium-data-tethering-limits" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;company’s privacy page&lt;/a&gt;. Likewise, T-Mobile customers can find instructions for opting out on the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fprivacy-center%2Ftake-control-of-your-data&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F31%2F22360228%2Funlimited-plan-verizon-att-t-mobile-premium-data-tethering-limits" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;carrier’s privacy center page&lt;/a&gt;, and AT&amp;amp;T customers can opt out by &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http://www.att.com/cmpchoice&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22321733/t-mobile-privacy-policy-third-party-advertisers&amp;amp;xcust=___vg__p_22085774__t_w__r_google.com__d_D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;logging in to their account’s privacy controls&lt;/a&gt;. That’s not going to stop the dozens upon dozens of other websites and services that you use from selling your information, but it’s at least one less source to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook bans Trump again after he borrows daughter-in-law’s page</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7LwPQqvb9yAucVNQSsUzAwDPM3s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69055386/acastro_180720_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hSiPiG"&gt;Donald Trump has been kicked off of Facebook a second time after &lt;a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/facebook/former-president-donald-trump-set-return-facebook-his-daughter-laws-page"&gt;Media Matters for America&lt;/a&gt; raised questions about his appearances on daughter-in-law Lara’s page. Facebook has removed an interview with the former president that was posted by Lara Trump, who is married to Eric Trump. Lara &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/LaraLTrump/photos/a.529608677244941/1547529432119522/?__cft__%5B0%5D=AZVZ1gTclckEBnQ-G3wcL1hvj9f2RKtJCfZVcFs3cABAx-ZV9zMhHpwseGzDh4up8uRGX4dKmpThn_FGt2i20qIZmy5XpFjbMQAmRMPSt1vDUrZqVyWh2r6eBBhTGr75d0Bs6ImOO_bI-nXmRqA_lI_O&amp;amp;__tn__=%2CO*F"&gt;posted screenshots&lt;/a&gt; of emails that appear to be from Facebook (complete with an obligatory &lt;em&gt;1984&lt;/em&gt; reference), saying that a video of the interview was removed because it featured “the voice of Donald Trump,” along with a warning that posting further content would result in account limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U0QxdF"&gt;The full text of the purported email from Facebook is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Rw356Q"&gt;Hi folks,&lt;br&gt;We are reaching out to let you know that we removed content from Lara Trump’s Facebook Page that featured President Trump speaking. In line with the block we placed on Donald Trump’s Facebook and Instagram accounts, further content posted in the voice of Donald Trump will be removed and result in additional limitations on the accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wc6Qum"&gt;Donald Trump has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;banned from Facebook since the January 6th attack on the capitol&lt;/a&gt;. The company’s oversight board is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256821/facebook-trump-ban-oversight-board-public-feedback"&gt;currently deliberating&lt;/a&gt; on whether the platform should have banned the then-president, and its ruling is expected soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SgJmaN"&gt;Following the capitol attacks most platforms banned Trump, and this isn’t the first time we’ve seen him try to get around the bans and get his voice out onto social media: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221683/trump-tried-to-evade-his-ban-with-potus-but-those-tweets-were-instantly-deleted"&gt;Twitter banned multiple Trump-affiliated accounts&lt;/a&gt; that posted his statements. It’s generally noted in platform’s terms of service that trying to evade a ban will result in further banning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1mpMcR"&gt;Facebook confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it did remove the interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ZzoKV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 31st, 2:27PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated with confirmation from Facebook.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="sZUrJR"&gt;Apple will remove the female voice as the default for its Siri assistant, according to &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/apple-adds-two-siri-voices/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The change is effective as of today’s release of the sixth iOS 14.5 beta. Once this latest update is publicly released to all customers, iPhone and iPad users will be prompted to choose their preferred Siri voice during device setup. Previously, Siri defaulted to a female voice, and users could pick between other voices in settings after the fact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y8oNgg"&gt;Alongside this change, Apple is also introducing two completely new voices for Siri that, according to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;, “use source talent recordings that are then run through Apple’s Neural text to speech engine, making the voices flow more organically through phrases that are actually being generated on the fly.” Those new voices are available to English speakers globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bRO49l"&gt;The news is the latest example of big tech companies trying to remove any gender associations from their digital voice assistants. Studies have found that when assistants use a female-sounding voice by default, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18634322/amazon-alexa-apple-siri-female-voice-assistants-harmful-gender-stereotypes-new-study"&gt;it can reinforce bias and negative stereotypes&lt;/a&gt;. Some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/19/15998668/samsung-adds-removes-sexist-bixby-descriptor-tags"&gt;embarrassing mistakes&lt;/a&gt; have been made along the way as these technologies develop, but Apple’s latest step is one of the most significant yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NvXw3H"&gt;“We’re excited to introduce two new Siri voices for English speakers and the option for Siri users to select the voice they want when they set up their device,” Apple told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a statement. “This is a continuation of Apple’s long-standing commitment to diversity and inclusion, and products and services that are designed to better reflect the diversity of the world we live in.” Siri takes on over 25 billion requests monthly across 500 million devices, according to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
