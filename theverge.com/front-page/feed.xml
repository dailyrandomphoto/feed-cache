    <title>Instagram says its algorithm won’t promote Reels that have a TikTok watermark</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Instagram Reels" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dhovKHTD0CnxTVsp8dBcXPWWYdg=/79x0:3127x2032/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68793688/Reels_IOSX_3.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OdGOvy"&gt;Instagram’s newest guidance for creators makes one thing clear: the platform wants people to stop posting recycled TikToks to Reels. Today, Instagram says it’s making changes to its algorithm and how it recommends Reels to users. Along with that, it’s issuing new best practices on its &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/creators/"&gt;@creators account&lt;/a&gt; to give Instagram users tips on how to make content that’s likely to be seen and promoted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VaH2Qc"&gt;The team now recommends that Reels users post vertical videos that use music found in Instagram’s library or sounds that they find on Reels. They also suggest “starting a trend” that others can participate in, like dance crazes, as well as “entertaining” and “fun” content. Reels that are mostly covered by text, are blurry, have a watermark or logo, or have a border around it won’t be recommended as frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="37g2BC"&gt;“We’re building on what we’ve learned from Explore to recommend fun and entertaining videos in places like the Reels tab, and personalize the experience,” says spokesperson Devi Narasimhan in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; “We are getting better at using ranking signals that help us predict whether people will find a reel entertaining and whether we should recommend it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C0Nfsd"&gt;Narasimhan says Instagram user surveys demonstrated that people have a “less satisfying” Reels experience when content is recycled from other apps or is blurry, so it’ll start deemphasizing that content in its recommendation software. This makes it less likely to be discovered by people who aren’t following the person who posted it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GMhe15"&gt;It’s no surprise these recommendations are coming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21354117/instagram-reels-tiktok-vine-short-videos-stories-explore-music-effects-filters"&gt;six months after Reels&lt;/a&gt; launched in the US. The platform might have been okay with people initially bringing their TikToks over to Instagram, but as it looks to become a popular destination on its own, Instagram needs to make sure Reels isn’t just an advertisement for TikTok, or worse, a place where people just dump whatever content they’ve already made. This might mean more work for creators, however, who will possibly have to shift some of their effort to Reels, rather than focusing  on one platform and then distributing the content everywhere else. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei asks court to overturn FCC ban</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U5bWsMf-AeSdpW3lo3rWgidiOcs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68793668/acastro_190521_1777_huawei_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RqvwRO"&gt;Huawei has &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22292499/huawei_review_request.pdf"&gt;asked a court to overturn&lt;/a&gt; the Federal Communications Commission’s designation of it as a national security threat. The Chinese telecom argues that the FCC overstepped its authority in December 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-affirms-designation-huawei-national-security-threat"&gt;finalizing a ban&lt;/a&gt; supported by former President Donald Trump. “The order on review potentially impacts the financial interests of the telecommunications industry as a whole,” Huawei’s request says, including network operators the FCC locked out of buying Huawei components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JtnzdR"&gt;The Biden administration’s FCC reiterated its support for the decision, however. “Last year the FCC issued a final designation identifying Huawei as a national security threat based on a substantial body of evidence developed by the FCC and numerous US national security agencies. We will continue to defend that decision,” a spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="umcWp3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Biden’s Commerce nominee has tentatively supported keeping Huawei banned&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Re3iTO"&gt;Huawei was deemed a threat under Trump, whose administration used a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18634046/huawei-donald-trump-us-trade-war-china-android-google-ban-5g-future/archives"&gt;variety of methods&lt;/a&gt; to sever its ties to US businesses. Federal agencies argued that Huawei equipment posed an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/17/18264283/huawei-security-threat-experts-china-spying-5g"&gt;inexcusable security risk&lt;/a&gt;, citing possible backdoors that would let the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133631/huawei-china-spying-claims-us-officials-blacklist-5g"&gt;spy on Americans&lt;/a&gt;. Huawei has denied the allegations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QJMjyi"&gt; In 2019, the FCC voted to bar &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/22/20977703/fcc-vote-huawei-zte-china-funding-federal-aid"&gt;using federal funds to buy&lt;/a&gt; its products, preventing American companies from rolling out wireless networks with Huawei (or fellow Chinese company ZTE) equipment. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308477/fcc-huawei-zte-ban-universal-service-fund-national-security-threat-risk"&gt;That order took effect&lt;/a&gt; in June of last year, despite &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/technology/huawei-fcc-lawsuit.html"&gt;a legal challenge&lt;/a&gt; from Huawei. The FCC went further in December, voting to make companies &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/fcc-huawei-zte-telecoms-equipment-184645636.html"&gt;replace existing Huawei equipment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8b32Re"&gt;Trump’s Huawei feud was part of a larger trade war with China, and it was followed by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22174704/2020-tiktok-ban-trump-administration"&gt;unprecedented attempts to ban&lt;/a&gt; popular mobile apps TikTok and WeChat. President Joe Biden has not renewed the war on TikTok, but his administration has indicated that it will continue cracking down on Huawei — despite the wishes of Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22273729/huawei-ceo-ren-zhengfei-biden-trump-us-sanctions"&gt;who said he would “welcome”&lt;/a&gt; a call from Biden. Gina Raimondo, Biden’s nominee for Commerce Department secretary, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-04/biden-commerce-pick-sees-no-reason-to-pull-huawei-from-blacklist"&gt;said she saw&lt;/a&gt; “no reason” to remove it from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/17/21371850/trump-huawei-restrictions-china-android-updates"&gt;department’s banned Entity List&lt;/a&gt; last week.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Toyota teams up with Aurora and Denso on robotaxi development</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oZpUe6uxmXIj5c3D1t3_2H-RYoQ=/0x0:3937x2625/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68793640/Aurora_Sienna_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FeaCzA"&gt;It’s 2021 and we’re still finding unique ways to pair up to develop self-driving cars. The latest is between Toyota, AV startup Aurora, and auto part supplier Denso. The three companies will join forces to develop a fleet of robotaxis, with the first hitting the road by the end of this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EcH2Md"&gt;It’s a big get for Aurora, the scrappy AV startup founded by Chris Urmson, the former head engineer of Google’s self-driving car project, among others. Toyota, which &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/toyota-unseats-vw-to-become-the-world-s-top-selling-automaker?sref=P6Q0mxvj"&gt;outsold Volkswagen in 2020&lt;/a&gt; to reclaim its status as the biggest automaker in the world, is one of the few car companies that has yet to pair up with an autonomous vehicle startup. Denso, which spun out of Toyota in the mid-20th century, is one of the largest auto suppliers on the planet. So Aurora is now officially rolling with the big dogs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="04FzGs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Aurora is now officially rolling with the big dogs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GBXvQ7"&gt;The companies plan to develop and test driverless vehicles equipped with Aurora’s self-driving hardware and software stack, starting with the Toyota Sienna minivan. “By the end of 2021, we expect to have designed, built, and begun testing an initial fleet of these Siennas near our areas of development,” the companies said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o4ct7m"&gt;Once they finish testing, the companies will begin mass producing autonomous vehicles for a full-scale ride-hailing operation. According to Aurora:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="CtzDLH"&gt;It brings our companies together to lay the groundwork for the mass-production, launch, and support of these vehicles with Toyota on ride-hailing networks, including Uber’s, over the next few years. As part of this long-term effort, we’ll be exploring mass production of key autonomous driving components with Denso and a comprehensive services solution with Toyota for when these vehicles are deployed at scale, including financing, insurance, maintenance, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="g3q5ZG"&gt;Aurora recently grew its ranks of engineers after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22158745/uber-selling-autonomous-vehicle-business-aurora-innovation"&gt;acquiring Uber’s self-driving car division&lt;/a&gt; late last year. The startup sent offer letters to about three-fourths of the ride-hailing company’s Advanced Technologies Group, which is based in Pittsburgh and Toronto, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/aurora-sends-offers-to-majority-uber-atg-employees-but-not-the-rd-lab/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qUrYXc"&gt;Toyota has largely kept its self-driving car tinkering quiet. The Japanese company has released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/3/18166854/toyota-self-driving-car-test-vehicle-ces-2019"&gt;some information about its test vehicles&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16849422/toyota-self-driving-car-platform-3-lexus-lidar"&gt;types of sensors&lt;/a&gt; it’s using, but we’ve seen very little of the cars in operation. Toyota was planning to offer a limited ride-hailing pilot in downtown Tokyo during the 2020 Summer Olympics, but that was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The automaker also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21152817/toyota-pony-ai-self-driving-car-investment-valuation-china-silicon-valley"&gt;recently invested $400 million in Pony.ai&lt;/a&gt;, a self-driving startup based in the US and China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nk44VQ"&gt;Toyota has developed a self-driving software called “Chauffeur,” which ironically was also the codename for Google’s self-driving project under Urmson. Toyota’s software is “focused on full autonomy, where the human is essentially removed&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;from the driving equation, either completely in all environments, or within a restricted driving domain.” Toyota has a second product called “Guardian,” which is essentially an advanced driver-assist system akin to Tesla’s Autopilot. Neither is being offered in any production car today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3UZj2d"&gt;Toyota Research Institute, the automaker’s Silicon Valley-based division, has been conducting tests at its Ottawa Lake, Michigan, closed-course facility for a number of years. In 2018, Toyota agreed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/27/17787878/toyota-uber-investment-self-driving-car-research"&gt;invest $500 million in a joint self-driving project with Uber&lt;/a&gt;, but that investment is now moot as Aurora owns what’s left of Uber’s AV division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VOReqp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t2tikg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fMS3l3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="obcIjS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to stream the second Trump impeachment trial</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Senate Democratic Leadership Speaks To Media Ahead Of Impeachment Trial" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V1kBU89RDrh7UUUkhcYsxlBfpWY=/0x0:5678x3785/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68793523/1231062522.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SI9Qqx"&gt;The second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump begins today. Trump was charged with incitement of insurrection by the House after the attack on the Capitol last month. House impeachment managers and Trump’s legal team will debate the constitutionality of the case today. After a Senate vote, which will likely pass, both sides will begin opening arguments on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xpF9Za"&gt;What time does the impeachment start?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="tzbN7R"&gt;The first day of the trial begins at 1PM ET. There will be four hours for both sides to present arguments. The House has already voted to bring an article of impeachment against Trump, so the Senate arguments will be over whether the misconduct is sufficient to justify penalties, including potentially barring Trump from holding federal office in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="u9QsML"&gt;How long will the trial last?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="TLCk9w"&gt;After the Senate vote passes, both sides will have 16 hours over two days to make their case, per &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/537876-schumer-mcconnell-reach-deal-on-trump-impeachment-trial"&gt;a deal reached by the Senate&lt;/a&gt; on Monday. If neither side calls witnesses, the trial could be over by early next week. However, there is significant pressure on Democrats to call witnesses in order to heighten the political impact of the proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="leyKZU"&gt;Where can you watch the impeachment proceedings?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NHIdDo"&gt;There will be a &lt;a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?508293-1/impeachment-trial"&gt;C-SPAN stream&lt;/a&gt; starting at 12:55PM ET. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WeZdTU"&gt;Live coverage will also be streamed by networks including &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live/"&gt;CBS News&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.msnbc.com/live"&gt;MSNBC&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-live-trumps-second-impeachment-trial-begins-in-senate"&gt;PBS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Fi VPN is coming to iPhones this spring</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JHjyVR3QpFeLXCVfxxRXgTYC8qQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68793453/vpavic_4243_20201018_0154.0.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TUjLLc"&gt;Google launched a VPN for its Google Fi cell service in beta &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/13/18089834/project-fi-enhanced-network-vpn-privacy-google-announcement"&gt;back in November 2018&lt;/a&gt;, allowing Fi subscribers to route their phone’s internet traffic through an encrypted connection to help protect security and privacy. Until now, though, it has only been available for Android users, but that will change soon. Google plans to roll out the Fi VPN to Fi subscribers on iPhones beginning this spring, the company &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/google-fi/google-fi-vpn-updates-help-you-connect-safely/"&gt;announced on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bTUrSs"&gt;Google also announced that the VPN is officially exiting beta on Android. “After listening to your feedback and making performance improvements, we’re taking the Fi VPN out of beta for Android phone users,” Google said. The VPN is included with all Google Fi plans, so you should be able to try it out now if you’re a Fi subscriber on Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x45ass"&gt;In addition, Google says it’s starting to roll out a new privacy and security hub for Fi users on Android. “The hub makes it easy for you to learn more about privacy and security features on Fi, and manage them with just one tap,” according to Google. “This includes the Fi VPN and other tools that protect your personal information and put you in control of who can reach you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IiaKoA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Super Bowl 2021 was the most-streamed NFL game ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="NFL: FEB 07 Super Bowl LV - Chiefs v Buccaneers" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RbawKI6_dHlDqKTQzLSgyuwwO-0=/0x0:4800x3200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68793416/1231051872.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SkSEp5"&gt;Super Bowl 2021 will go down in history for a few things, including being the most-streamed NFL game ever, but it had the lowest numbers in over a decade in terms of viewership. CBS Sports reports that this year’s NFL championship drew in a total audience of 96.5 million viewers, with streaming in particular up by 65 percent compared to last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WUTrfS"&gt;Yet, despite a global pandemic and a ton of ways to stream the game, the numbers were still low. As &lt;a href="https://www.thewrap.com/super-bowl-liii-100-7-million-viewers-ratings-down/"&gt;noted by &lt;em&gt;The Wrap&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, last year’s Super Bowl drew 102 million viewers, meaning that this year’s marquee matchup was down by 5 percent compared to last year. Compared to other recent Super Bowls, viewership was the lowest since Super Bowl 2007, which had a little over 93 million people tuning in to watch the big game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kDHVTI"&gt;This year’s Super Bowl was also faced with several technical issues; most notably, CBS All Access subscribers trying to watch the game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/7/22271648/cbs-all-access-app-problems-super-bowl"&gt;experienced technical issues&lt;/a&gt;. A lower viewer turnout may have contributed to the matchup itself, as it was a particularly large blowout with the game's outcome quite clear before the start of the fourth quarter. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aoX8xz"&gt;Over the past couple of months, I’ve been playing a lot of games on my Xbox Series X, and following the release of the iOS 14.5 beta, which added support for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260671/ios-14-5-ps5-dualsense-xbox-series-x-controller-support"&gt;Xbox Series X controller&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve been itching to stream my games from my console to my iPhone. However, I dreaded having to pair my controller with my phone — I figured that it might be a hassle, and I wasn’t sure how easy it would be to sync my controller between the two devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Og0eBt"&gt;Turns out, it’s a smooth process to sync the controller to my iPhone. Better yet, it’s easy to swap the controller’s connection back and forth between my iPhone and my Xbox Series X. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7FVnY5"&gt;Here’s how you set everything up: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="CnwFpW"&gt;First, you have to pair your Xbox Series X controller with your phone or PC. Activate sync mode on your controller by pressing and holding the sync button on the back, which is just above the USB-C port. After a couple seconds, the Xbox logo on the controller will flash rapidly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IdKrIv"&gt;Then, on the device you’re trying to sync the controller with, look for the controller in the Bluetooth settings menu. Select the controller to pair it. (Using iOS 14.5 beta, my Xbox Series X controller first appeared with the name “Accessory,” but once I tapped it, it autofilled to “Xbox Wireless Controller” followed by a combination of letters and numbers.) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pG1JT0wUkOxAx4e8EEGOwF-B9-w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21904644/twarren_xboxseriesxcontroller_VLS_3632_2_11.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Press and hold the sync button on the back of your controller to pair it with your phone or PC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="7icoZM"&gt;Once the controller is connected to your new device, have fun playing some games!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gYalMC"&gt;To use your controller with your Xbox Series X again, double-tap the sync button. The Xbox logo will flash slowly, and then the controller should reconnect with your console.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EI8wwM"&gt;To switch the controller back to the other device, hold the sync button. The Xbox logo should flash rapidly for a few seconds, and then it should connect to your device. Double tap the sync button to switch it back to your console. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="lCqfb0"&gt;That’s it! I’ve been really pleased with how easy it is to switch between my console and my iPhone, and I suspect I’ll be playing even more Xbox games away from my console than I originally imagined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BLIAsK"&gt;One thing you should be aware of: this quick-swap functionality only works with the last mobile device or PC that the controller connected with, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OmitFlow/status/1358695588838199297"&gt;according to Microsoft’s Timo Wolf&lt;/a&gt;. So if you want to quickly swap between your Xbox Series X and a different device, you’ll need to manually set up your controller with that new device first. And, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OmitFlow/status/1358821215650131976"&gt;Wolf says&lt;/a&gt;, this method apparently only works for jumping between your Xbox and another device over Bluetooth — it won’t let you swap between an Xbox and the Xbox Wireless Adapter.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Motorola Moto G Power (2021) review: power over perks</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The G Power’s massive battery lasts for days, but other features have suffered to make way for it&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="N2DVeg"&gt;The Motorola Moto G Power is a $200 phone that does exactly what it claims — powers you through multiple days of use — but don’t expect any other bells or whistles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WilRjv"&gt;Battery is this phone’s whole deal. Its 5,000mAh battery is about as big as they come right now; it’s the same capacity you’ll find in top-of-the-line devices like the Galaxy S21 Ultra. Rather than making a more well-rounded phone, Motorola has pared back features here and there — a low-res screen, a slower processor — and gone all-in on its headline feature. Cheaper components allow Motorola to sell a $200 version of this phone, and they’re also less power-hungry, making the absolute most of that massive battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="27KtjE"&gt;This device bears the same name as its predecessor from last year, but it differs in a few key ways. Rather than offering one model, this year the G Power is offered in the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Battery-Unlocked-Motorola-Camera-Silver/dp/B08NWDMR9N?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;aforementioned $200 variant&lt;/a&gt; with 3GB of RAM and a paltry 32GB of storage. There is also a 4GB RAM / 64GB storage option available for $250 (I tested the 32GB version). This year’s models drop the ultrawide camera and gain a slightly larger screen — 6.6-inch compared to 6.4-inch — with a lower 720p resolution than last year’s 1080p. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y6TH6s"&gt;If you choose to buy the Moto G Power, it will hold up its end of the bargain. The question is whether you can live with the significant sacrifices Motorola has made to get the biggest possible battery into the most affordable phone it could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qQXgVP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10333144"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-brPctpoFkMIqYPDnfvL1B3Wmck=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22290841/ajohnson_210205_4399_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 6.6-inch display offers a relatively low resolution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TNamvm"&gt;Moto G Power screen and performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="PChwmX"&gt;The Moto G Power has a 6.6-inch LCD with 720p resolution. That’s not much resolution to stretch across a fairly large screen, and it shows. Images aren’t quite as sharp as they could be, and the screen overall looks a little dim and washed out to me. The phone itself is on the big side, though I find it a bit more comfortable to use one-handed than the slightly larger &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22255202/motorola-one-5g-ace-review"&gt;6.7-inch Motorola One 5G Ace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="9ku8bj"&gt;The G Power uses a Snapdragon 662 processor, and I felt the difference between this and the performance from a 700-series step-up chipset. It’s an extra beat slower jumping between apps and opening the camera. It requires more time to capture and process images in Portrait and Night Vision modes than the Ace does with the same main camera sensor. And heavier tasks like jumping in and out of Google Maps navigation shows noticeable stuttering. That said, you’ll be hard-pressed to find substantially better performance at the $200 price point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RKyNWiILXnlRn8Rg89S4p3h9bfc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22290843/ajohnson_210205_4399_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto G Power offers biometric unlocking by way of a fingerprint sensor on the power button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rlQMbm"&gt;Bottom line, the Power handles day-to-day tasks, plays videos, and navigates adequately. I just felt myself noticing the delays as I was using the phone, which over the course of a day added up to a less than satisfying experience. But for a $200 phone, it gets the job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G6ESar"&gt;The G Power offers expandable storage by way of a microSD card slot, which feels necessary here. On the 32GB version I tested, 14GB of that storage is already occupied by Android 10 files. That’s simply not enough in 2021. You can pay $50 more for the 64GB model, but that also feels like spending too much to get too little. If you buy this phone, budget for a microSD card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IUGhmK"&gt;Motorola will offer an upgrade to Android 11 and says it will provide security updates for the G Power until January 2023. By then, years of updates will probably be slowing the phone down even more anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="14HxdS"&gt;Moto G Power battery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="oFQ9yX"&gt;The Moto G Power delivers on its headline feature. I started on Monday with a fully charged battery. I watched an episode of &lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt;, you know, for testing. I navigated across town and back. I scrolled through Instagram... a lot. Email, web browsing, rinse and repeat; by day three of moderate use, I was only down to 40 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hnXkSG"&gt;Even after a trip outside of the house with a lot of picture-taking, I’m going on day four with a battery at 26 percent with just under six hours of screen-on time. I have charged my personal phone at least three times during this time span. We’ve been through roughly 12 news cycles. I myself have aged at least two years. But the Moto G Power carries on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ESF7d9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I have charged my personal phone at least three times during this time span&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lYzJ1P"&gt;No doubt the slightly slower processor and low-powered screen help boost those numbers. I left the screen at its default brightness while I tested it, which is just a little dimmer than I’d prefer. It certainly doesn’t look &lt;em&gt;overly &lt;/em&gt;bright at its maximum setting, so an additional hit on battery life is something to take into account if you like a bright screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8NJsxN"&gt;Bear in mind that I spent a good chunk of that time at home on Wi-Fi, which is easier on the battery. During non-pandemic times, I would have spent more time out of the house on cell data. And six hours of screentime doesn’t exactly make me a power user. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nia2QJ"&gt;If you do spend more time on data and do more power-hungry tasks like watch a lot of videos, you’d probably be looking at more like two full days. In any case, Motorola’s claim of up to three days of battery life is entirely reasonable, and you might do even better than that if you spend the bulk of your time on Wi-Fi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wmtbxb979it3GBV4NpdMOLpuSkw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22290839/ajohnson_210205_4399_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cameras on the Moto G Power include a standard wide, ultrawide, and a depth sensor for portrait mode photos.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eIrKqL"&gt;Moto G Power Camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="gk9Doj"&gt;The G Power offers a 48-megapixel main camera that produces 12-megapixel images, a 2-megapixel macro camera, and a depth sensor to help create portrait mode photos. There’s also an 8-megapixel selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vXgBlW"&gt;The G Power uses the same main camera as the One 5G Ace, and similarly it takes nice photos in good light. It judges exposure well and captures plenty of detail, especially with close subjects. When its AI recognizes a scene like a landscape, colors look appropriately vibrant, but otherwise it tends toward flat, washed-out colors. In less good lighting conditions, things get a little messier where noise reduction smears a lot of detail. In high-contrast scenes where the camera has brightened shadows, there’s a fair amount of noise and / or noise reduction visible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Zw3ol7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10322645"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gYLMCB"&gt;As with the Ace, Night Vision tends to produce a washed-out looking image and in this case, it requires both you and your subject to hold still for several seconds. There’s some noticeable shutter lag in all photo modes — enough to make you wonder for a split second if you actually tapped the shutter button — and the display is laggy when panning around in portrait mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pnOGxD"&gt;This camera is just okay, and that’s fine for a $200 phone. The Moto G Power doesn’t have the processing power to pull off more sophisticated HDR or low light photography — for that you’d need to step up to the $350 Pixel 4A. It also won’t be able to keep up with fast subjects, or even slow-moving subjects in low light, but that’s often a struggle for phones priced well above $200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6hqir7WeU1PEDah-vnyS6jq-17w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22290838/ajohnson_210205_4399_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The G Power makes good on its promise of multiday battery life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="PL6gw6"&gt;If you’re on a strict budget and long battery life is a necessity, then look no further than the Moto G Power. However, I hesitate to recommend it to someone who doesn’t meet that description. You will be making sacrifices in order to get that $200 price and multiday battery life. The base storage is way too anemic and the speed is noticeably pokey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C5KJid"&gt;If you have some flexibility in your budget, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;$300 OnePlus N10 5G&lt;/a&gt; is a great upgrade pick with a better processor and camera. A bit more than that would get you a Pixel 4A with an excellent camera and a well-supported device with better longevity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="GD1Vfm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Be aware of its limitations and pack a little patience&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="sdfsHk"&gt;If $200 is the limit of your budget, the G Power is a fine pick — more so because there are few other options at this price. In addition to its dayslong battery life, it has a better processor than the $100-150 competition and you’re unlikely to find a substantially better screen or camera at this price. Just be aware of its limitations and pack a little patience.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony is trying to patent its Back Button Attachment for the PlayStation 4</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uzM22SQ_MAw0VDHGFW04XanmXh0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68793082/bking_200113_3868_0001.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Brennan King / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Aty8Qj"&gt;Sony has applied for a patent for its Back Button Attachment, the add-on accessory for the DualShock 4 announced back in 2019 that adds programmable buttons to the underside of the controller. The filing, &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-may-be-working-on-a-back-button-attachment-for-ps5s-dualsense-controller?sf137897364=1"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, doesn’t call the device by its existing name, but rather describes the product as an add-on with buttons that “may be mapped to controller buttons using customized button mapping pre-sets” and features a number of diagrams showing off how it works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eylkhh"&gt;It’s not immediately clear what the patent application means for Sony. The application, which has not yet been granted, was first filed in the US in the summer of 2019, before Sony filed it internationally in June of last year. It offers no indication this device could be coming to the PlayStation 5’s DualSense controller, as the diagrams depict what looks to be an older DualShock 4 device and do not describe any corresponding functions with the new console’s gamepad or any of its unique features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XP3qwm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There is no indication Sony is planning a Back Button Attachment for the PS5’s DualSense controller&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fMSFpQ"&gt;What is worth pointing out is that there are increasing litigation pressures surrounding the market for pro controllers containing programmable back paddles. Just last week, Valve was &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/3/22264213/valve-steam-controller-lawsuit-scuf-4-million"&gt;fined $4 million over its Steam Controller design&lt;/a&gt; in a lawsuit brought by Scuf and Ironburg Inventions, both subsidiaries of gaming peripheral maker Corsair. Scuf also &lt;a href="https://scufgaming.com/gaming/news/scuf-gaming-licenses-its-technology-to-microsoft-and-becomes-official-and-exclusive-xbox-3rd-party"&gt;licenses its technology&lt;/a&gt;, which includes its intellectual property and patents, to Microsoft as of 2015 for the Xbox maker’s Elite controller line, which features programmable rear paddles similar to the devices Scuf sells. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zrn3aM"&gt;There is no indication Sony’s actions, which again date back to June 2019 at the earlier in the case of the &lt;a href="https://www.pat2pdf.org/patents/pat20210031101.pdf"&gt;US version of this patent application&lt;/a&gt;, have any connection to any ongoing or past lawsuits or licensing deals. But it is a smart idea for a company to patent its intellectual property in a competitive space, especially if they want to protect their product line and any future releases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmuCrc"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21064320/sony-ps4-dualshock-4-back-button-attachment-review-gaming-pro-controller"&gt;Back Button Attachment&lt;/a&gt;, announced in late 2019, is Sony’s low-cost alternative to a proper pro controller. It costs just $30 and adds programmable buttons to the underside of the DualShock 4 that let you remap crucial functions reserved for, say, the X or O buttons. In turn, this lets you trigger the associated in-game actions without removing your thumbs on the joystick. In a smart move, Sony opted for smooth grip-like buttons that don’t float off the controller unlike the more popular floating paddle design, which meant they’re less prone to snapping off. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xs-ZXzfOFyFkLbHuB1eNDWZNjU0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22292190/LXAffSFxfgF4GUgDplAft2i42e_dFI0ja8wG_pHjj_F3vN6dsZhlxfCJdfnzGJT7JKH4gTUnugLQyrDKnQ9_skNu4y8ZE4IHIyo0jOe5NTBYPhQUmN2_LI5nsGBVXQfNER_03U95FydJ0Rl3SmW7GlNLZqGJvqftwbzWNp3pyoc__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LBNtYk"&gt;Extra programmable buttons can provide a noticeable advantage when playing high-stakes competitive games. Prior to the Back Button Attachment, PlayStation fans had to rely on third-party manufacturers for programmable back paddles and other pro controller features like customizable thumbsticks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oNSHB8"&gt;Although some fans may have wanted PlayStation 5’s DualSense controller to ship with removable back paddles, Sony didn’t end up doing that when the gamepad was unveiled last year and eventually launched with the new console in November. And due to the shape of the device, the existing Back Button Attachment does not work on it. Whether we see an upgraded version of the accessory for the DualSense is anybody’s guess, but it sure would be nice to have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QRVIhQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; An earlier version of this story said the patent application might suggest Sony is working on a version of the Back Button Attachment for the PS5’s DualSense controller. There is no indication that’s true, and we’ve updated the story and its headline to reflect that and to include new information regarding a lawsuit won by Corsair against Valve. We regret the error. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer Hammerhead True Wireless Pro review: good sound at the wrong price</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Razer’s second set of true wireless earbuds nail fit and audio but fall flat elsewhere&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="epf36V"&gt;Razer’s Hammerhead True Wireless Pro earbuds are a major improvement over the company’s first pair of true wireless earbuds. They’ve switched from an open-air design to a sealed fit; have better sound, thanks to that decision (and a partnership with THX); and they offer adequate active noise cancellation. Razer has thrown in a generous heap of ear tips (including Comply foam), and there’s also a low-latency gaming mode to keep the earbuds in sync with your mobile gaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sx3tZE"&gt;But the main stumbling block with Razer’s new earbuds is price. At $200, the Hammerhead True Wireless Pros face a tough mix of competition — and we’ve reached a point where many of those alternatives have moved beyond the core basics of fit, sound quality, and ANC to offer more unique features. In Apple’s case, that’s Spatial Audio. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review"&gt;For Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, it’s the clever new speech detection feature that enables ambient sound as soon as you start talking. Jabra’s earbuds can pair with two devices at once. Razer doesn’t really have anything to match these perks (unless you’re &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; enthused about that gaming mode), and the result is earbuds that are perfectly satisfactory but fail to stand out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uMcCsm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10332736"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EMtiGl"&gt;From a design standpoint, the Hammerhead True Wireless Pros are your typical stem-style earbuds. They’re a good deal larger than the AirPods Pro and less curvy, but the matte black finish ups the sleek factor. No, the Razer logo on the outside doesn’t light up. That’s the area where you’ll tap (or hold) to access the various gesture controls, which proved responsive in my tests, can be customized to your liking, and cover all functionality except for volume. Below this on each stem is a mic used for active noise cancellation; the mics that work for calls are positioned at the bottom of the stems for optimal voice pickup. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lTlkOcJiv5OFvHMVSYg0qrHLzy4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22289627/DSCF2722_Edited.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to a plethora of included ear tips, it’s easy to find a good, comfortable fit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vEPhA6"&gt;Razer packages &lt;em&gt;seven&lt;/em&gt; sets of ear tips in the box: there’s standard silicone (S, M, L) and a grippier version (S, M, L) that’s meant for active use cases like running. You’ll also find a medium set of Comply foam tips that, in my case, made for a terrific seal. I ended up keeping those on all the time. Razer definitely gets props for doing everything it can to help customers find the right fit, when many other earbud makers continue to phone it in with just three sets of tips. The Hammerhead True Wireless Pros are IPX4-rated for sweat resistance, making them suitable for general workouts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RZYGKe"&gt;Razer has packed 10mm drivers into these earbuds, and they’ve gone through THX certification to “present a rich, balanced sound stage for all your movies, music, and gaming.” I can’t speak to the rigors of THX’s process, but the Hammerhead True Wireless Pros do sound articulate, well-balanced, and have some extra bass to spare if you want to dial up that part of the audio. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xPxcINgDnDXDbsG7eQsKHo9Xxsg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22292099/razerapp.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Razer’s mobile app lets you adjust EQ and customize the controls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HS1lAd"&gt;Speaking of which, Razer’s mobile app lets you fully customize the EQ to your preference or choose from presets. The default “THX” mode is where I stayed, but it’s nice that you’ve got full control over the whole EQ range. The Hammerhead True Wireless Pros can deftly hop between genres without ever meeting something they can’t handle. Codec support covers the standard AAC and SBC, with no Apt-X on the Android side. Like many other earbuds, these will automatically pause music if you remove one from your ear and resume when it’s put back in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2GOv0ldB_GTQuuwoIukmzwJldjM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22290351/DSCF3038_Edited.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The case is compact but lacks wireless charging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BI_KrtzLU2MkdJwL9bTRuCyiVpA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22292035/DSCF3036_Edited.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The buds sit securely in the case whether you’re using silicone or Comply foam tips.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eP5c5U"&gt;Unfortunately, the active noise cancellation doesn’t live up to that impressive sound quality. The Hammerhead True Wireless Pros approach ANC in the same way as other premium earbuds, producing anti-noise to counter the ambient sounds around you. But Razer’s ANC is very average: it’s efficient at hushing the constant, low-level hums and whirring you get in many rooms or office spaces, but it doesn’t live up to other earbuds at this price level. The Jabra Elite 85t and Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Pro best Razer here, and they’re soundly defeated by more expensive options like the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds and AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dbcSmf"&gt;If anything, it feels like the passive isolation I get, thanks to the Comply tips, does the most work at blocking outside noise. Razer’s transparency / ambient mode also sounds digitized compared to the best of what’s out there, and the voice microphones are passable but nothing to write home about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SSDaXRyCgwOpGPmTn-2tT9KvSs0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22289619/DSCF2719_Edited.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hammerhead True Wireless Pro earbuds use a familiar elongated stem design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TnbfBNqC69DBqRpqEAssFsuLK5k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22289655/DSCF2711.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Razer offers a TPU case for your case with an optional carabiner. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cMbbgu"&gt;So then we’re left with that special gaming mode feature, which Razer says reduces Bluetooth latency to 60 milliseconds. That should help keep up with the action in fast-moving mobile game titles, and it seemed to do the trick just fine in my experience. But the company also notes that gaming mode will drain the battery faster, and that’s an area where these earbuds already struggle. The Hammerhead True Wireless Pros advertise up to four hours of continuous listening, which is definitely on the low end and below competitors like Jabra (5.5 hours), Samsung (five hours), and Sony (six hours). The well-built carrying case has enough juice for you to reach 20 hours of total playback, but it lacks wireless charging. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/slf2-HM5YX4bhwJGOuY8aEgbdN8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22289666/DSCF2716_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hammerhead True Wireless Pros are rated IPX4 for sweat resistance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="dJ8hGf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10334033"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RhXAFv"&gt;Gaming mode might be a boon if you spend hours playing &lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty Mobile&lt;/em&gt;, but I didn’t find any obvious sync issues with more casual games when the earbuds were on their normal setting. It just doesn’t go far enough in helping justify the $200 cost of Razer’s Hammerhead True Wireless Pros — especially when competitors offer more advantageous tricks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gh_-EiPhpR1DFvtTm2UPhM3SeJ8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22292064/DSCF3032_Edited.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;These earbuds would be much more compelling at a lower price.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="AoQIBh"&gt;Razer’s Hammerhead True Wireless Pros would be among my top recommendations at $150 or below. They sound quite good across all sorts of music, Razer goes above and beyond with ear tips, and I didn’t mention other bonuses like a two-year warranty. They’re a big improvement over the original Hammerhead True Wireless buds. But they’re outshined in the $200 category that they live in right now. Middle-of-the-road ANC and battery life on the short side drag them down to a point where it’s hard to reconcile performance and cost. A price cut would put Razer’s second-generation true wireless earbuds in a much better place and help them shine for the qualities they &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; deliver. &lt;/p&gt;
