    <title>The best Chromebook for 2021</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best Chromebooks for every user&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="GGbxNY"&gt;The best Chromebooks aren’t just laptops that run a few Google apps anymore. Chromebooks can cover a wide variety of computing needs now, and a good Chrome OS laptop or two-in-one can be more useful than a mediocre &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21231636/windows-10-pc-user-guide-how-to-microsoft"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21281530/macos-mac-imac-user-guide-how-to-os-tips"&gt;MacOS&lt;/a&gt; laptop. That’s why our pick for the best Chromebook of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;, which does just about everything right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnwyna"&gt;The best Chromebooks are known to deliver good value. The message that many people actually want &lt;em&gt;good &lt;/em&gt;Chromebooks — rather than just cheap ones — has gotten through to manufacturers. Many are around $500 or $600, though there are good options in the higher and lower ranges as well. The extra money goes a long way toward getting something you’ll be happy with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUTNYw"&gt;For the first time, the quality of the best Chromebooks in this range has been consistent. There are so many similarities between the offerings from Asus, Lenovo, Google, HP, Dell, and Samsung that a conspiracy-minded person might suggest they’re all sourcing their components from the same factory. That’s great news if you’re comparison shopping; the majority of this list would be good buys if you can find them at a discount. They can even rival some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptops&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21528540/budget-windows-10-chromebook-systems-acer-lenovo-cheap"&gt;best budget laptops&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21369381/best-student-laptops-school-high-college"&gt;best student laptops&lt;/a&gt; on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMCGia"&gt;Our pick for the best Chromebook is the Acer Chromebook Spin 713, and we’ve selected the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt; for shoppers on a budget. Other picks for the best Chromebooks of 2021 include the Asus Chromebook Flip C434, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931476/google-pixelbook-go-review-the-price-of-simplicity"&gt;Google Pixelbook Go&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16550908/google-pixelbook-review-chromebook-android-laptop"&gt;Google Pixelbook&lt;/a&gt;, and the HP Chromebook x360. Samsung is soon releasing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22217002/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-price-release-date-hands-on-chrome-os-photos-video"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2&lt;/a&gt;; we’re excited to publish a full review of that shortly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ch4TuU"&gt;What most buyers want in the best Chromebook are likely the same things they want in any laptop: a good keyboard, solid build quality, long battery life, a nice screen, and enough power to do the things you want. More Chromebooks can meet those qualifications than ever before, but these are the ones that rise above the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 is the best Chromebook of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KQRVus"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="BfZy92"&gt;Best Chromebook of 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LpXHDz"&gt;Acer’s Chromebook Spin 713 is, hands-down, the best Chromebook you can buy. With a gorgeous 3:2 screen that rivals some more expensive competitors, you’ll have a ton of extra vertical space for your work and multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zarhIJ"&gt;The keyboard is excellent with a comfortable, quiet feel, and nice backlighting. There’s even an HDMI port, which you don’t see on a thin Chromebook every day. And (most importantly) the 10th-Gen Intel processors can handle a heavy load of tabs with no problem. The Spin’s speakers aren’t great, and there’s no biometric login, but those are reasonable sacrifices to make for a laptop of this quality at this low of a price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GX2USx"&gt;In a market where the main differences between Chromebooks in this price range boil down to their screens and maybe an included stylus, Acer sets itself apart by making an affordable laptop that’s excellent in almost every way.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For students or anyone looking for a small secondary device, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet is a great affordable pick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QjxyUU"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="P8MGAD"&gt;Best Chromebook on a budget&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="xJq778"&gt;If you’re looking for an affordable device for on-the-go work, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet delivers excellent value for its low price. It’s an ultra-portable 10.1-inch 2-in-1 device with a detachable keyboard and kickstand cover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfnBmb"&gt;The Duet contains a MediaTek Helio P60T processor, 4GB of RAM, and up to 128GB of storage, and it performs well if you’re just browsing and don’t plan on using a super heavy load. It also uses a version of Chrome OS that’s made for its convertible form factor, including the first version of Chrome that’s optimized for tablet use. When detached from its keyboard, the Duet supports an Android-esque gesture navigation system that makes switching between apps a breeze. But the most impressive feature is battery life; I got close to 11.5 hours of fairly heavy use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93jX9I"&gt;Of course, there are drawbacks. The touchpad and keyboard are quite small, there’s no headphone jack (and only one USB-C port), and the 16:10 screen is a bit dim. But those are reasonable trade-offs to make for such an affordable price. It makes a great secondary device for schoolwork or on-the-go browsing.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus Chromebook Flip C434 is the best Chromebook of 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KoNNR1"&gt;3. Asus Chromebook Flip C434&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="d76D4s"&gt;Best 14-inch Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="nprrDB"&gt;Asus has a strong history of making good Chromebooks, but the C434 is something special. It’s nearly unique among this class of laptops in offering a big 14-inch screen in a laptop body that’s much closer in size to a 13-inch model. It pulls off that trick by minimizing the bezels around the screen, which is the same thing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/4/15961740/best-laptop-microsoft-windows-apple-macbook-hp-dell-lenovo"&gt;best Windows laptops&lt;/a&gt; have been doing lately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WMlKx4"&gt;Asus nailed the basics, too. The keyboard is great to type on, though it does have the annoying problem of being hard to see in dim lighting because the backlight is the same color as the keycaps. The trackpad is accurate, and I appreciate that there’s not only a USB-A port but that the two USB-C ports are on opposite sides of the laptop so you can plug in on the side you prefer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VTxl8W"&gt;There’s even a microSD card slot for expanded storage — and you might need it, as it only comes with 64GB. The processor isn’t the most powerful one you can get in a Chromebook in this price range, but it should be enough for most tasks, especially if you follow our recommendation to get the model with 8GB of RAM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vaH8VJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508129"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re looking for a larger device with more power, one of the best Chromebooks you can buy is the HP Chromebook x360 14.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="C2SoIE"&gt;4. HP Chromebook x360 14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rtrWbQ"&gt;Powerful Chromebook with a sleek design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E2rGvI"&gt;If you’re looking to get more power and you don’t mind getting a slightly larger laptop, the HP Chromebook x360 14 is a great choice. HP has several configurations that fall under this name, but we suggest the model we tested with 8GB of RAM and 64GB of storage to go along with the i3 processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="alUDxQ"&gt;While we picked the Asus because of its elegant design, there isn’t much to complain about on the slightly larger HP. It has the same ports, RAM, and storage. The keyboard is great, and it also sounds slightly better because the speakers are up on the keyboard deck instead of on the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="epP0CZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508136"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Pixelbook Go has a stylish and portable design with a standout keyboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SStRnG"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931476/google-pixelbook-go-review-the-price-of-simplicity"&gt;Google Pixelbook Go&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="s4tmgA"&gt;Best Google Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="WMItcT"&gt;The Google Pixelbook Go is a handsome, no-nonsense 13.3-inch laptop that weighs just 2.3 pounds. It has a sturdy magnesium chassis, and a ridged grip on the bottom to keep itself from slipping on slanted surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M72CDq"&gt;Not only is the Pixelbook Go portable and stylish, but it delivers solid performance, and supports fast charging through either of its USB-C ports. Battery life is also impressive. The Go lasted over eight hours in our testing, and it should get you through a full workday with no problem. But its standout feature is the keyboard, which is quiet with good travel and a springy feel. &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;editor Dieter Bohn found it to be his “favorite thing to type on by a long shot.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCvQ3C"&gt;The Go is an expensive product, as Chromebooks go, and it doesn’t top our list because the Chromebook Flip C434 offers similar specs and features for a slightly lower price. But we think plenty of shoppers who value long battery life and lightweight build might prefer to spend a bit more on this device instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lZOrDL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508145"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re looking for a premium design, the Google Pixelbook is a good Chromebook for you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oKAVKP"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16550908/google-pixelbook-review-chromebook-android-laptop"&gt;Google Pixelbook&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="UgIG1H"&gt;Thin Chromebook with beautiful hardware&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ptwU2G"&gt;Google hasn’t updated the Pixelbook since its 2017 release, but if you’re looking for a convertible premium Chromebook, it’s still competitive. It has a beautiful design, combining aluminum and Gorilla Glass with silicone palm rests, and sports a bright touchscreen with 2400 x 1600 resolution. The 3:2 aspect ratio offers extra space compared to 16:9 panels and makes it more comfortable to work in multiple apps and windows without having to zoom out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rv26rE"&gt;The Pixelbook doesn’t have the latest Intel processors since it’s an older product. Still, its Core i5 and 8GB of RAM should be able to handle everyday browsing and multitasking just fine. We also got around eight hours of battery life under a fairly heavy load. The keyboard and touchpad are both fun and comfortable to use — and as a neat bonus, the speakers fire up through the hinge, so audio sounds clearer than it does on many convertible laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SvzNEI"&gt;Note: Google appears to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21449640/google-pixelbook-discontinue-chromebook-laptop"&gt;discontinuing the Pixelbook&lt;/a&gt;, but some models are still available through Google’s store and other retailers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="wNILY1"&gt;7. Dell Inspiron 14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sajnTX"&gt;Premium 2-in-1 with a built-in stylus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6nUXhF"&gt;It’s a bit heavy as Chromebooks go, but the 3.99-pound Inspiron 14 is still a sturdy convertible device with brushed aluminum chassis that gives it a premium look. It has a spacious backlit keyboard and a nice 1920 x 1080 display with accurate colors. With an 8th Gen Core i3 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage, it delivers snappy performance for streaming, browsing, multitasking, and even more demanding artistic tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kX7aDx"&gt;Speaking of artists, the Inspiron 14 comes with a stylus, which lives in a dedicated socket inside the chassis so you don’t have to worry about losing it. Thanks to electromagnetic resonance technology (EMR), it doesn’t need batteries or any kind of charge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="X6cCFz"&gt;8. Samsung Chromebook Plus v2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YGLlQl"&gt;Best Samsung Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E0uFW7"&gt;The convertible Samsung Chromebook Plus V2 is far from a budget purchase. But it does offer a lot for its price, including a built-in battery-free stylus and an extra front-facing camera for quick photos of blackboards or job sites. (The camera above the keyboard is also surprisingly high-resolution — it’s a 13-megapixel sensor with autofocus.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BKmhZX"&gt;The V2 also has a nice design on par with that of other premium Chromebooks, including an aluminum lid and a sturdy hinge. It’s fairly portable at 2.9 pounds, and it has a microSD slot in addition to its two USB-C ports and headphone jack. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re able to spend a bit extra for some serious power, the Asus Chromebook Flip C436 is a good Chromebook for you, offering great battery life and a super light build.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="URploe"&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/8/21206912/asus-chromebook-flip-c436-review-chromeos-android"&gt;Asus Chromebook Flip C436&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WREbTq"&gt;A pricey, premium Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="DSD92E"&gt;Disappointing battery life (just over five hours of multitasking and seven hours of looping video) and a hefty price tag keep the Chromebook Flip C436 from topping this list, especially considering the lower price but similar offerings of its predecessor, the Chromebook Flip C434. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4Kg8L"&gt;Still, if money isn’t an object for you, there’s a lot to like about the 2-in-1 C436. It has a nice, compact, convertible chassis — unlike many convertible devices, it’s actually light enough (2.4 pounds) to feasibly be used as a tablet for an extended period of time. Inside, it has a comfortable and snappy keyboard and a fingerprint reader in the top corner of the deck. The audio is good: there are two Harman Kardon-certified speakers in the hinge, as well as one on each side of the cover. And it’s powered by a 10th Gen Intel Core i3 that performs quite well under a heavy browsing load. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lqzqH2"&gt;The C436 is a pricey Chromebook, but it certainly looks and feels premium. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EA cancels Anthem’s big revamp but will keep the game running</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZfuqheielTGuGP002x34jFA4nhw=/106x0:1240x756/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68868897/anthem.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: BioWare&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qsTUnC"&gt;After putting a pin in short-term updates and expansions to focus on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/10/21131662/bioware-anthem-longer-term-redesign-updates-paused-game-relaunch"&gt;“longer-term redesign”&lt;/a&gt; of the game, EA announced today that it will be &lt;a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2021/02/24/anthem-update/"&gt;canceling its planned revamp&lt;/a&gt; of the game &lt;em&gt;Anthem Next.&lt;/em&gt; But the company plans to keep &lt;em&gt;Anthem&lt;/em&gt;’s live service running “as it exists today.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wL2u4j"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;In the spirit of transparency and closure we wanted to share that we’ve made the difficult decision to stop our new development work on &lt;em&gt;Anthem&lt;/em&gt; (aka &lt;em&gt;Anthem NEXT&lt;/em&gt;),” BioWare executive producer Christian Dailey said in a recent blog post. “We will, however, continue to keep the Anthem live service running as it exists today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rtOPqR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anthem&lt;/em&gt; launched nearly two years ago and was met with poor reviews, with the main criticism stemming from a lack of content, subpar story, and repetitive gameplay. A year following its release, BioWare said it was invested in improving the game with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/24/18194445/bioware-anthem-storytelling-interview-ps4-xbox-pc"&gt;seasonal updates&lt;/a&gt;. But last year, then-general manager Casey Hudson said that it would pause short-term updates to reinvent the entire game. It was reported last May that &lt;a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2020/05/15/may-anthem-update/"&gt;an incubation team of about 30 people&lt;/a&gt; was tasked with reworking &lt;em&gt;Anthem. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="85KsaH"&gt;With support for &lt;em&gt;Anthem&lt;/em&gt; ending, BioWare’s open-world shooter will not receive a second chance. It's quite common for games to struggle at launch, but several have turned things around thanks to frequent updates, which was the case for &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;No Man’s Sky&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pJXBxF"&gt;Despite this, BioWare does have other projects in the works, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22167450/dragon-age-4-bioware-trailer-ea-game-awards-reveal"&gt;sequels to &lt;em&gt;Dragon Age&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/7/21554092/bioware-new-mass-effect-game-announced-n7-day"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22256806/mass-effect-legendary-edition-pc-ps4-xbox-one-mac-walters-release-date"&gt;a remaster for the original &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect &lt;/em&gt;trilogy&lt;/a&gt;, which is slated to launch on May 14th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Left out of boil water orders, some Texans may need to test wells</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A technician repairs a sink with brown tap water" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/psM4P5K9OKkrVilwPu6EWmZr3zA=/0x3:6016x4014/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68868861/1231351769.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;An unprecedented winter storm swept across Texas and left many of its residents without power and water for multiple days in Houston, Texas in February, 2021. Many residents are still unable to drink their water until a plumber can address the cracks in their pipes, which were caused by freezing temperatures. | Photo by Callaghan OHare for The Washington Post via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MQIz2l"&gt;Unlike millions of Texans who received boil water notices from utility companies, families who rely on private wells have been left to figure out for themselves whether their water is safe to drink in the wake of last week’s deep freeze. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="uDU9D5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s no warning put out there.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ktv1Z2"&gt;“There’s no warning put out there in the press for what these homeowners who have their own water supply, what they should be doing in these scenarios to protect themselves and their family,” says Jackie Young-Medcalf, executive director of the nonprofit Texas Health and Environment Alliance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gO8HzW"&gt;Bacteria and contaminants can find their way into cracks in pipes that burst after freezing. As a result, millions of people on public water systems were told by utilities to boil their tap water after frigid temperatures wreaked havoc on Texas’ infrastructure last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OCugD6"&gt;But more than 1.3 million Texans aren’t connected to public water utilities, and instead depend on their own wells for their drinking water, according to the state’s &lt;a href="https://tgpc.texas.gov/water-wells/#2"&gt;Groundwater Protection Committee&lt;/a&gt;. Even those official numbers can easily underestimate how many wells there really are and who relies on them, according to Young-Medcalf, because people don’t always register wells that they dig. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fidLxC"&gt;Wells that might have been most at risk recently in Texas are older wells with shallow piping. These would have been more exposed to the cold than deeper wells and probably don’t have as much protective casing. Within a private water system, pipes are most likely to have sustained damage, compared to other pieces of equipment, experts say. Any pipes that ruptured above ground should be repaired but aren’t as likely to let in contaminants. Breaks that happen underground are less likely but potentially more dangerous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w5fUwH"&gt;“If you’ve had pipes that are broken and they’re in the ground — or worse, were flooded or underwater — then you’d want to repair that and test your water first before you drink it,” says Steven Wilson, a groundwater hydrologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He developed a free &lt;a href="http://privatewellclass.org/"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; on well maintenance that’s available online. Texas A&amp;amp;M University’s &lt;a href="https://twon.tamu.edu/"&gt;Texas Well Owners Network&lt;/a&gt; offers similar resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QrblAk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Their water is varying shades of yellow and brown.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7xnFwt"&gt;Young-Medcalf is especially concerned about people who rely on well water and live in places where there’s a history of toxins polluting soil and groundwater. She says she’s heard from several people this week who are concerned about their well water and live &lt;a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/EPA-wells-dry-cleaning-Superfund-sites-15027503.php"&gt;near a Superfund site&lt;/a&gt; called the Jones Road Groundwater Plume just outside Houston. Superfund sites are places that have been so polluted that the federal government placed it on a “National Priorities List” for cleanup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gzXQH1"&gt;“Folks have been reporting to [us] that their water has particles in it and that their water is varying shades of yellow and brown,” says Young-Medcalf. “When multiple groundwater well owners are reporting these observations in their water you have to think, ‘What’s in the environment that made their way into their water system?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vzMVQA"&gt;How your water looks and smells isn’t necessarily the best indicator of whether it’s safe to drink. Naturally occurring tannins and silica in groundwater can give it a slight color, even if it is safe. On the other hand, some dangerous contaminants are colorless, tasteless, and odorless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zey7Rh"&gt;“Now if your water’s always been perfectly clear and all of a sudden it has a color, then you probably want to get it tested, but it doesn’t mean you should panic,” says Wilson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zJOgnO"&gt;Luckily, last week’s snowfall and resulting runoff after it melted weren’t likely to cause as much damage to local Superfund sites &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/29/16385568/hurricane-harvey-superfund-site-houston-dioxin-cancer-chemicals"&gt;as Hurricane Harvey did in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, Young-Medcalf says. But she’s still concerned about toxins that already surrounded existing groundwater wells and just needed a break to find their way into people’s home water systems — especially near Jones Road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U48s9J"&gt;The Environmental Protection Agency tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it is assessing Superfund sites that might have been affected by severe weather last week to make sure they aren’t a danger to anyone. Of 16 assessed so far (there are &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/tx/cleanups-texas#sites"&gt;68 in Texas&lt;/a&gt;), “None of these sites report any offsite release or impacts to water systems,” a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email on February 22nd. The EPA hasn’t responded to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s query about the Jones Road site specifically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="wtsdGK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Test annually to give you that confidence that your well is still performing.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dzV0lu"&gt;The best way for any well owner to keep their drinking water safe is to learn more about their well and test it annually, regardless of whether there’s been severe weather or their proximity to a polluted area. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality has a list of &lt;a href="https://www.tceq.texas.gov/assets/public/compliance/compliance_support/qa/txnelap_lab_list.pdf"&gt;accredited laboratories&lt;/a&gt; that provide well testing. The commission also has resources to help households find &lt;a href="https://www.tceq.texas.gov/drinkingwater/SWAP/wells.html"&gt;well reports&lt;/a&gt; for their property. A well report or “&lt;a href="http://privatewellclass.org/blog/PostId/1228/faq-well-logs"&gt;well log&lt;/a&gt;” can give an owner more information about the well, like how deep it is, how and when it was built, and what materials surround it — all information that might be able to point to any vulnerabilities a well has. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ta8zSR"&gt;“There’s a list of things that can cause a well not to be properly sealed anymore,” Wilson says. “So it’s good to just test annually to give you that confidence that your well is still performing the way it’s supposed to.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lyft reinvents calling a cab </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hKri5g4iz-PAQokT2A9CH3WIbE4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68868578/acastro_180927_1777_lyft_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mIQHbL"&gt;Lyft is admitting that some part of traditional taxi services are worth emulating today by letting people in select Florida cities &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lyft.com%2Frider%2Fcall-a-lyft-ride&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F24%2F22299349%2Flyft-phone-call-feature-book-without-app" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;book Lyft rides with just a phone call&lt;/a&gt;. The new “Call A Lyft” feature should be “perfect for seniors and folks without access to the Lyft app,” says Lyft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VZXHjI"&gt;Calling 631-201-LYFT (631-201-5938) between 8AM-8PM ET on Monday through Friday will let a potential rider book a ride. Lyft says that it will tell riders the full price before confirming and send texts to track the ride once it’s paid for and booked. It should be familiar to anyone who’s ever called a cab, though Lyft notes drivers are not expected to offer assistance getting into a car and wheelchair accessible rides aren’t available at launch. Call A Lyft also requires a phone with support for SMS messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nkIEzj"&gt;Lyft isn’t the only ride-sharing company to fall back on phone calls. Uber experimented with a similar feature in 2020, allowing customers in Arizona &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21136090/uber-1800-phone-number-no-apps-smartphone"&gt;to dial 1-833-USE-UBER&lt;/a&gt; to book a ride. Prior to both companies falling back on taxi service tactics, companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21136090/uber-1800-phone-number-no-apps-smartphone"&gt;GoGoGrandparent&lt;/a&gt; stepped in as an intermediary for ride-sharing and food delivery companies, allowing older folks to dial a phone number and have someone else handle the apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UILBwV"&gt;Lyft and Uber pushed out traditional taxi and cab services with a theoretically easy-to-use service and a large pool of drivers, but Call A Lyft illustrates that sometimes the old methods were that way for a reason — because they worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wNHwrM"&gt;Call A Lyft is available now and Lyft has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lyft.com%2Frider%2Fcall-a-lyft-ride&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F24%2F22299349%2Flyft-phone-call-feature-book-without-app" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a full list of supported cities&lt;/a&gt; on its site.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>One Medical gave COVID-19 vaccines to ineligible people, NPR report says</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="One Medical" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/820RdLegwx1KtwhehY6vJOql0XA=/0x209:5000x3542/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68868422/1175073468.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pX5Z1L"&gt;Health care company One Medical gave COVID-19 vaccines to people who were ineligible under local guidelines, including friends and family of company leadership, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/24/970176532/high-end-medical-provider-let-ineligible-people-skip-covid-19-vaccine-line"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. Health departments in Washington state and California said they stopped distributing doses to One Medical after finding out that the company was not sticking to eligibility rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jXaE4p"&gt;The company was given vaccine doses in a few states, including Washington and California. Internal messages obtained by &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt; show that doctors raised concerns about patients jumping the line for vaccinations ahead of people who where higher priority for the shots. Now, Alameda County, California and the Washington State Department of Health have refused to give the company more doses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zs3Ucf"&gt;In many states, people who are older or who have underlying health conditions can get vaccinated now; younger, healthy people still have to wait. One Medical did not check to see if people who signed up for vaccine appointments through its systems were actually eligible, staffers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ae4nH1"&gt;&lt;q&gt; One Medical did not check to see if people who signed up for vaccine appointments through its systems were actually eligible&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ozTE2B"&gt;“Why are young patients without health problems, on a trial membership ... allowed to book and receive a covid vaccine while healthcare workers are being waitlisted?” one medical professional asked in January in &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/24/970176532/high-end-medical-provider-let-ineligible-people-skip-covid-19-vaccine-line"&gt;messages obtained&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BrnEBz"&gt;One Medical, which was backed by &lt;a href="https://www.gv.com/portfolio/"&gt;Alphabet’s GV&lt;/a&gt;, offers primary care to members in around a dozen cities across the United States for a $199 annual fee. The company went public in January 2020; as of today, its market capitalization is $7 billion. The company told &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt; that it doesn’t knowingly let people skip the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cD6BNw"&gt;The company’s vaccine scheduling system did not ask people to confirm if they were eligible under local guidelines until January 14th, two weeks after One Medical started offering vaccines. Once it &lt;em&gt;did ask&lt;/em&gt;, people who said they were not eligible could still book appointments. Blocking people from signing up would be too technologically difficult, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6aqri2"&gt;“Scanning schedules and cancelling appointments [for ineligible patients] is not recommended,” said Spencer Blackman, the director of clinical education at the company, in a message to staff obtained by &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt;. Andrew Diamond, chief medical officer of One Medical, initially denied to &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt; that staff were directed not to verify eligibility. Later, he said One Medical has communicated more clearly since then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aorbb0"&gt;After receiving complaints, the Washington State Department of Health stopped distributing COVID-19 vaccines to One Medical. Los Angeles County’s Department of Public Health warned One Medical that it would stop giving the company doses if it did not confirm patients’ vaccine eligibility. Alameda County, California said it did not give additional doses to One Medical after the company said it wanted to vaccinate people who were ineligible. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iRobot says it’ll be a few weeks until it can clean up its latest Roomba software update mess</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FwfarOXSaYMRQUZXvOqCnk4TtQ8=/0x0:1514x1009/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68868377/roomba.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: iRobot&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="veuX78"&gt;iRobot, maker of the robotic Roomba vacuums, has confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that a software update has been causing issues for some users of its i7 and s9 robots and that it’s working on another one to prevent future issues. The catch? It might be a bit before things get sorted out, with iRobot expecting the update to roll out “over the next several weeks.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SVXRuT"&gt;According to users on Reddit and Twitter, the recent 3.12.8 firmware update has been causing navigation issues. One user described their robot cleaner as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AnthonyVirtuoso/status/1363549503907840008"&gt;acting “drunk” after the update&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roomba/comments/lprthq/roomba_s9_weird_behaviour_on_version_3108/"&gt;spinning itself around and bumping into furniture&lt;/a&gt;, cleaning in strange patterns, getting stuck in an empty area, and not being able to make it home to the dock. What’s more, some other users are reporting that the environment maps their Roombas made were wiped out by the update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BqQzLP"&gt;The severity of the issues ranges from Roombas now taking longer to clean the house to not being able to make it back to its charging station and thus barely working at all. And while iRobot has been working with affected customers to roll back the update, some are &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roomba/comments/lprthq/roomba_s9_weird_behaviour_on_version_3108/god45ep?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;reporting that they’re still experiencing issues&lt;/a&gt;. It’s possible they’ll have to wait until the new software update rolls out for the vacuums to start working properly again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TJCqmU"&gt;One Reddit user &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roomba/comments/l3mdad/time_lapse_video_of_i7_attempting_to_return_to/?utm_content=title&amp;amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;amp;utm_name=38581dc349ec4744af0ae8bc36434bc2&amp;amp;utm_source=embedly&amp;amp;utm_term=l3mdad"&gt;took a time-lapse&lt;/a&gt; of their Roomba with the update, as it struggled and finally failed to make it home to its base station. The video shows the behavior &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roomba/comments/lq4mn3/irobot_app_software_and_s9_are_hot_garbage/"&gt;described by many&lt;/a&gt; other posters on the Roomba Reddit and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AnthonyVirtuoso/status/1363549503907840008"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/moodwrench/status/1363928861453525001"&gt;as well&lt;/a&gt;. One poster &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roomba/comments/lq4o3g/irobot_is_garbage_now/"&gt;detailed their support experience&lt;/a&gt;, saying they had waited two and a half weeks for the software update rolled back on their Roomba, and it still hadn’t happened. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The next Spider-Man movie will be titled Spider-Man: No Way Home</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vwdoeT5oG9jnNT2AeQwvFDxAc9s=/120x0:3210x2060/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68868229/Screen_Shot_2021_02_24_at_12.44.10_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HxdgEZ"&gt;The next &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; movie starring Tom Holland will be titled &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/em&gt;. The movie will be out only in theaters on December 17th, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LkR6Ts"&gt;The announcement was revealed on Twitter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/spidermanmovie/status/1364631273226919937?s=21"&gt;on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yFpf4y"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This, we can confirm. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SpiderManNoWayHome?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#SpiderManNoWayHome&lt;/a&gt; only in movie theaters this Christmas. &lt;a href="https://t.co/kCeI8Vgkdm"&gt;pic.twitter.com/kCeI8Vgkdm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Spider-Man: No Way Home (@SpiderManMovie) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpiderManMovie/status/1364631273226919937?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4UZInp"&gt;Holland and co-stars Zendaya and Jacob Batalon teased fans on Tuesday by posting separate joke titles for the movie on Instagram: &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CLpwqkqFaiS/"&gt;Holland’s: &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Phone Home&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CLp7M-SL6UQ/"&gt;Zendaya’s: &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Home Slice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CLpxI_oFrp2/"&gt;Batalon’s: &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Home-Wrecker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. While the jokes may have been frustrating, the differing titles may also be hinting at the rumors that the movie will take place in some kind of &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; live-action film multiverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2lAAl"&gt;There have even been reports that a few fan-favorite characters from past movies are coming back, lending further credence to the multiverse rumors. &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2020/12/alfred-molina-doctor-octopus-spider-man-3-1234652377/"&gt;Alfred Molina will reprise his role as Doctor Octopus&lt;/a&gt; (from the Tobey Maguire &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; movies), for example, and &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/spider-man-3-jolt-jamie-foxx-returning-as-electro-exclusive"&gt;Jamie Foxx will be back Electro&lt;/a&gt; (from the Andrew Garfield &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; movies). And Benedict Cumberbatch, who plays the time-bending and multiverse-seeing superhero Doctor Strange, &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/benedict-cumberbatch-joins-spider-man-3-as-doctor-strange-exclusive"&gt;is set to appear in the movie as well&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fcK34h"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a35401608/tom-holland-spider-man-3-cherry-cover-story/"&gt;recently published &lt;em&gt;Esquire&lt;/em&gt; interview&lt;/a&gt;, Holland denied that Maguire and Garfield would be appearing in the new movie — but we just don’t know if that’s a clever ruse to hide what would be two mind-melting cameos.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook will match Google’s $1 billion news investment after Australia showdown</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mHo09DKZBQZKKO5MM6xiH9I43-Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68868185/mdoying_180411_2400_0130still.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michele Doying / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eAjQQQ"&gt;Facebook said it plans to invest an additional $1 billion in the news industry over the next three years as a sign of commitment to journalism, following the company’s unprecedented showdown with the government of Australia that involved briefly disabling the ability to read and share news for Australian Facebook users and publishers. The announcement was made as part of a &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/the-real-story-of-what-happened-with-news-on-facebook-in-australia/"&gt;blog post from global policy chief Nick Clegg&lt;/a&gt; published on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wa0Ym4"&gt;“Facebook is more than willing to partner with news publishers. We absolutely recognize quality journalism is at the heart of how open societies function — informing and empowering citizens and holding the powerful to account,” Clegg writes. “That’s why we’ve invested $600 million since 2018 to support the news industry, and plan at least $1 billion more over the next three years.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0yibvQ"&gt;The commitment matches the one Google &lt;a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/google-news-initiative/google-news-showcase/"&gt;made in October of last year&lt;/a&gt;, when the search giant announced it would start paying publishers to create specialized versions of stories and other forms of news content for its Google News Showcase platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sGD8b0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We absolutely recognize quality journalism is at the heart of how open societies function.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ES15xZ"&gt;Notable in this scenario, however, is the way both Facebook and Google reacted to the impending Australian media bargaining legislation that prompted such visceral reactions from the Silicon Valley titans. The law would have forced both companies to the negotiating table with news publishers to hammer out deals for paying for news content to be shared on both the main Facebook app and Google search. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kUNcaV"&gt;While Google initially threatened to shut off its services in the country, it eventually blinked in the negotiating stage and began &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/17/google-and-news-corp-strike-deal-as-australia-pushes-platforms-to-pay-for-news.html"&gt;cutting deals with media partners like Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook, on the other hand, did in fact shut off a portion of its service in Australia, in the form of disabling the sharing and reading of news links from both users and publishers for a brief few days starting last week. Facebook then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296778/facebook-ends-australian-news-ban-bargaining-code-google"&gt;reached an agreement&lt;/a&gt; with the Australian government earlier this week and restored the country’s access to news on its platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AcnwoO"&gt;According to Clegg, the company feels the proposed media bargaining law as it was designed prior to the recent compromise was unfair, mainly because it would put too much power in the hands of media conglomerates like Murdoch’s to extract ever-higher payments through a forced negotiation process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j3S97G"&gt;“At the heart of it, in Facebook’s view, is a fundamental misunderstanding of the relationship between Facebook and news publishers. It’s the publishers themselves who choose to share their stories on social media, or make them available to be shared by others, because they get value from doing so,” Clegg argues. “Facebook would have been forced to pay potentially unlimited amounts of money to multi-national media conglomerates under an arbitration system that deliberately misdescribes the relationship between publishers and Facebook — without even so much as a guarantee that it is used to pay for journalism, let alone support smaller publishers.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5PGxlu"&gt;Facebook is now free to negotiate deals with news publishers for its Facebook News platform without the fear of forced arbitration, and Clegg says it plans to do that in Australia as it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248814/facebook-news-uk-launch-articles-tab-curated"&gt;currently doing in the UK, the US, and other markets&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook also retains the right to restrict news content for Australian publishers and users as it did last week, but the company has signaled it has no intent to do so if future negotiations remain in good faith. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Marvel’s Loki series will premiere on Disney Plus on June 11th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Ypc_eCnIPgq4I808iauhcRayoE=/533x0:2336x1202/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68868164/Screen_Shot_2021_02_24_at_12.21.03_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ar2Gng"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;, the Tom Hiddleston-starring series about Asgard’s god of mischief, will land on &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/994499/9358?subId1=VergeDisneyPlusHitGoal021221&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; on June 11th, Marvel Studios announced today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RU0kvx"&gt;The series was described by Marvel Studios as a “crime thriller” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22168459/loki-trailer-marvel-studios-disney-plus-tom-hiddleston-release-date"&gt;in December&lt;/a&gt; during Disney’s big streaming investor day. It follows Loki as he faces off against the Time Variance Authority, otherwise known as as the TVA, following the events of &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt;. The first trailer for the series was also released in December, and it saw Loki enter a bunch of different worlds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DQZeKz"&gt;Marvel Studios is in a position where there are new shows all the time. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22267989/wandavision-5th-episode-recap-sitcom-horror-disney-plus-streaming-crossover-multiverse"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Marvel Studios’ first big Disney Plus show, is nearing its end. The show has seen an incredible amount of success, trending weekly on Twitter and bringing in millions of subscribers every week within the US alone, according to Nielsen ratings. It will be followed by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/21591343/falcon-winter-soldier-premiere-date-disney-plus-sebastian-stan-anthony-mackie-august"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, reuniting Anthony Mackie’s and Sebastian Stan’s characters in the events after &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt;. That show will debut on March 19th. Then, &lt;em&gt;Loki &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jgKNx5"&gt;With the new release date, it also firmly plants &lt;em&gt;Loki &lt;/em&gt;months after &lt;em&gt;Black Widow &lt;/em&gt;is slated to hit theaters. More Marvel Studios content is slated for Disney Plus throughout the year, too, including &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Ms. Marvel&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="QzekXG"&gt;
