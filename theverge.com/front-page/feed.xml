    <title>TikTok is thinking about letting its creators charge subscription fees</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kcQ1ZV"&gt;TikTok confirmed Thursday that it is testing support for paid subscriptions, paving the way for creators on the short form video platform to charge for their content. First reported by &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/tiktok-is-testing-paid-subscriptions?irclickid=zbUwjW3d9xyIWX6XC8ydcwL-UkG3-OWhIz0czs0&amp;amp;irgwc=1&amp;amp;utm_source=affiliate&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpa&amp;amp;utm_campaign=2334778-Linkbux&amp;amp;utm_term="&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the company didn’t share details about when it might roll out to creators, how many creators are currently testing it, or what the pay structure might look like. Company spokesman Zachary Kizer said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the subscriptions were a “concept that’s been in testing,” and that it was “always thinking about new ways to bring value to our community and enrich the TikTok experience,” (whatever that means). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P5cNx6"&gt;If adopted, it would be the latest move by TikTok to help its creators monetize their content; it introduced its &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/creator-next"&gt;Creator Next hub&lt;/a&gt; with monetization tools, and rolled out its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22811973/tiktok-creator-next-monetization-tips-video-gifts"&gt;tipping feature to eligible creators in December&lt;/a&gt;, after testing it with a smaller group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="w4ZwA9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;if creators are holding their best content for subscribers, will it fuel the algorithm?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ujiTKA"&gt;How TikTok will add direct-to-creator payments to its highly successful business model is bit of a head-scratcher. The app’s major advantage over competitors is its uncanny algorithm that surfaces content to users’ For You pages. It’s a way for creators to reach users and ideally turn them into subscribers. But if creators are holding their best content for subscribers, that content is probably not available to fuel the algorithm, which in turn could reduce engagement, since in theory, it’s not being surfaced to non-subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NHMz3m"&gt;This is not a problem unique to TikTok, of course; all digital &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22606291/youtube-shorts-fund-launches-100-million"&gt;platforms&lt;/a&gt; trying to help content &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22323398/facebook-stories-ads-stickers-creator-monetize-update"&gt;creators&lt;/a&gt; and influencers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423583/twitter-tip-jar-feature-sending-money-venmo-cashapp"&gt;monetize&lt;/a&gt; their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822042/discord-premium-memberships-creators-monetize-servers-feature"&gt;content&lt;/a&gt; are trying to balance engagement vs. letting creators monetize directly. And the creators themselves have to be able to predict what content subscribers will be willing to pay for, and what content will help them best promote their own work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DTOrfZ"&gt;TikTok’s test of paid subscribers follows Instagram’s announcement that it, too, &lt;a href="https://business.instagram.com/blog/subscriptions-creators-instagram-recurring-monthly-income/"&gt;is launching a test of paid subscriptions&lt;/a&gt; with a small number of creators and influencers. Subscribers will pay a monthly fee to access exclusive content from creators they follow, including Stories and Live videos. The different tiers will range in price from $0.99 to $99.99 per month depending what the creator decides to charge, and a purple badge will denote a subscriber’s status to the creator/influencer in the comments section. Meta-owned Instagram says it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891722/instagram-paid-subscriptions-test"&gt;doesn’t plan to take a cut&lt;/a&gt; of creators’ subscription revenue until next year at the earliest. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix co-CEO says there will ‘absolutely’ be a second season of Squid Game </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/60epGcAzUh3ymfwW8OYXHm_tDpM=/0x200:3860x2773/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70414392/SquidGame_Unit_101_1792.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e9iUjq"&gt;Hold on to your jumpsuits — Netflix’s wildly popular &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt; series has been confirmed by the company for a second season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RNODlK"&gt;During its fourth-quarter earnings call Thursday, Netflix’s co-CEO and chief content officer Ted Sarandos confirmed that the Korean miniseries is returning. Asked by Nidhi Gupta of Fidelity Management and Research whether the viewers would get a second season of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723452/netflix-squid-game-biggest-ever-show-at-launch"&gt;Netflix’s most popular series&lt;/a&gt; ever, Sarados said there’s more grisly action to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="endAPG"&gt;“Absolutely,” he responded. “The &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt; universe has just begun.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JGohEz"&gt;Previously, Hwang Dong-hyuk confirmed that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772170/squid-game-season-two-netflix-director-confirms"&gt;series would return&lt;/a&gt;, adding that he was in the “planning process.” Sarandos didn’t elaborate on &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; the series will return, or what an expanded &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt; universe would look like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zc4ihl"&gt;But if the series gets the full &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; treatment, that could potentially expand to gaming and more. (Netflix has repeatedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22772589/netflix-video-games-app-news-updates"&gt;hammered home&lt;/a&gt; that gaming is core to its business strategy moving forward.) &lt;em&gt;Squid Game &lt;/em&gt;already has its &lt;a href="https://www.netflix.shop/collections/shop-squid-game-merchandise"&gt;own merch line&lt;/a&gt; and Funko Pop collectibles in the Netflix Shop. A new Bape collaboration is slated to drop Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RhfX2j"&gt;Bring on the games.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Godzilla and the Titans will reunite in new Apple TV Plus Monsterverse series</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Legendary Pictures&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5Y5a1d"&gt;Though Legendary’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/24/22246258/new-trailers-godzilla-kong-comrades-son-south-hbo-max-theaters"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Godzilla vs. Kong&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;made waves last summer by debuting on HBO Max and quickly becoming one of the platform’s &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/box-office/godzilla-vs-kong-opening-weekend-analysis-1234943958/"&gt;top performing features&lt;/a&gt;, the next time we see the titanic monster and his fellow kaiju, they’ll be calling new streamer home: Apple Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ucS26"&gt;On Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2022/01/apple-tv-lands-epic-godzilla-and-titans-original-television-series-based-on-legendarys-monsterverse/"&gt;Apple Plus announced&lt;/a&gt; that it has greenlit a new live-action series set in Legendary’s Monsterverse from co-creators Chris Black (&lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Enterprise&lt;/em&gt;) and Matt Fraction, writer of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/22/22849870/hawkeye-season-1-review-disney-plus"&gt;Marvel’s &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;run that the recent Disney Plus series heavily draws from. Along with Black and Fraction, Toho’s Hiro Matsuoka and Takemasa Arita and Safe House Pictures’ Joby Harold and Tory Tunnell are set to executive produce. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="d6RF7z"&gt;Set after the events of &lt;em&gt;Godzilla vs. Kong&lt;/em&gt;, the new untitled series is said to feature Godzilla, a number of the Titans, and yet another human family whose interpersonal dramas audiences are &lt;em&gt;meant &lt;/em&gt;to care about even though the literal monsters are what everyone’s really interested in. According to Apple, the new human family at the center of this show will have  deep, mysterious connections to Monarch, the villainous organization responsible for driving Godzilla and Kong to brawl with one another when last we saw them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l3eVgs"&gt;Considering how humans have pretty consistently dragged the Monsterverse’s features down in the past, the series is going to have to find a way to legitimately make their plots here feel like more than distractions from the good stuff (read: monster fights). But depending on which monsters show up and how they fight, it might be worth slogging  through a little bit of ground level human humdrum when the show debuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lTJdsV"&gt;Currently, there’s been no word on when the new Monsterverse series will begin production.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Congress weighs cleaning up cryptocurrency mining in the US </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-CRYPTOCURRENCY-CLIMATE-EMPLOYMENT-CHINA" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2LhKT-KlnznCqfUYiAOZrIb0mIY=/0x3:7360x4910/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70414184/1235927048.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&amp;nbsp;The “Sandow Switch” that once was used by the Alcoa coal power plant now provides electricity for the Whinstone US Bitcoin mining facility in Rockdale, Texas, on October 9, 2021.&amp;nbsp; | Photo by MARK FELIX/AFP /AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vWIVIW"&gt;On Thursday, members of Congress debated how to make cryptocurrencies greener, as energy-intensive bitcoin mining booms in the US. One of the biggest questions was whether to use renewables to power the energy-hungry mining at the heart of bitcoin’s blockchain, or turn to other blockchains that don’t need as much energy in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YpU3hW"&gt;The debate took place during an oversight &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWg731-3id8"&gt;hearing&lt;/a&gt; on the “energy impacts of cryptocurrency” held by the House Energy &amp;amp; Commerce Committee. The US became the de facto epicenter for bitcoin mining last year, after China clamped down on mining within its borders — in part because of how much energy bitcoin uses. That transition could have big implications for the already strained power grid in the US, as well as the Biden administration’s ability to meet its ambitious climate change goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9aWfXy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Cryptocurrency presence in every day life will likely continue to expand”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="siu2jj"&gt;“Cryptocurrency presence in every day life will likely continue to expand,” Representative Diana Degette (D-CO) said in her opening comments at the hearing. “As the industry moves forward, it’s crucial for cryptocurrency networks to identify ways to reduce the need for constant high volume energy use and minimize effects on the environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YolrQk"&gt;The bitcoin network gobbles up more electricity than the countries of Ukraine or Norway use in a year. If bitcoin was a country, that would make it the &lt;a href="https://ccaf.io/cbeci/index/comparisons"&gt;27th&lt;/a&gt; most electricity-hungry nation in the world. That also makes bitcoin the most polluting cryptocurrency, since bitcoin mining is often powered by fossil fuel energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ME9iEH"&gt;Part of the reason for bitcoin’s outsized energy use is that it’s the biggest crypto network by far. But bitcoin also needs more electricity than some other cryptocurrencies because it uses a process called “proof of stake” that works as a sort of security system to keep its ledger of transactions, the blockchain, secure and accurate. Miners verify transactions by racing to solve complex puzzles using specialized computers. They get bitcoins as a reward. Meanwhile, all that computing power burns through electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8Xz5NH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There are some worrying signs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZkXrFv"&gt;When bitcoin mining was concentrated in China, miners tended to use clean hydropower during the wet season and coal when that resource dried up. In the US, what the energy mix for crypto mining looks like is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702543/bitcoin-carbon-footprint-emissions-china"&gt;still taking shape&lt;/a&gt;. But there are some worrying signs. Miners have already &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/09/old-coal-plant-is-now-mining-bitcoin-for-a-utility-company/"&gt;extended the lives&lt;/a&gt; of aging power plants that burn coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q7LJEr"&gt;“Given our current climate objectives, examples like this are deeply concerning. Our focus now needs to be reducing carbon emissions overall, and increasing the share of green energy on the grid,” Representative Degette said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ErJ4oR"&gt;Industry experts who gave testimony during today’s hearing argued that there’s an opportunity for crypto mining to embrace renewable energy and by doing so, help clean energy flourish in the US. A challenge with solar and wind is that they’re intermittent sources of energy — depending on the weather, sometimes there’s not enough and sometimes there’s too much. Miners can use up excess renewable energy that might otherwise go to waste because there’s not enough battery storage yet for renewable energy on the grid, proponents argued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZwtDQU"&gt;“Computing is a &lt;em&gt;better &lt;/em&gt;battery,” John Belizaire, founder and Chief Executive Officer of Soluna Computing, said during the hearing. His company develops data centers for cryptocurrency mining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bJdwwc"&gt;Other experts are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434617/renewable-energy-bitcoin-pollution-tesla-elon-musk"&gt;skeptical&lt;/a&gt; that renewables will be a silver bullet for bitcoin’s energy problems. To cut greenhouse gas emissions, electricity from renewables will eventually need to power everything from vehicles to home heating. So bitcoin mining would be competing with those needs. And when demand for power outpaces supply, it can lead to power outages — or to burning more fossil fuels to supplement clean energy sources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Fzs8N"&gt;There’s another solution that some experts see. Instead of using proof-of-work, some cryptocurrencies use different methods to keep their blockchains accurate. The most popular alternative is called proof of stake, which doesn’t require huge amounts of computing power because there are no puzzles to solve. The Ethereum network, the largest after bitcoin, has plans to eventually move from proof of work to proof of stake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EP3x9j"&gt;Bitcoin has no such plans. There’s no expectation of the network ever reaching a consensus on making that switch, especially since miners have already invested in the machines they use to crack puzzles. For now, it seems that as long as bitcoin’s the biggest player in the game, cryptocurrencies will continue to eat up more and more energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vakBGB"&gt;“The bitcoin community deserves our deep gratitude for introducing blockchains to the world, but we have far more energy efficient alternatives than proof of stake for the sake of the environment and our energy infrastructure in the United States,” Ari Juels, a professor at Cornell University, and a co-author of a paper that coined the term “proof of work” in 1999 , said in his testimony. “I believe that we need to embrace these newer options.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="deR2ri"&gt;It’s still not clear how congress members plan to follow up on the hearing; DeGette concluded by saying the discussion of cryptocurrency’s energy usage is going to be “an increasing issue” for the committee. At this point “we don’t have any answers,” she said.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tfYm7o"&gt;Whatever happens next, the stakes are huge for the planet. The US is the second biggest climate polluter after China. The Biden administration has set a goal of nearly eliminating all greenhouse gas pollution over the next few decades, and that will be difficult to achieve  with or without bitcoin mining playing a role.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The IRS will soon make you use facial recognition to access your taxes online</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QlpXD63Hu6s20jIktpuzwCjNMHA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70414175/acastro_180730_1777_facial_recognition_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The IRS will use a third party facial recognition company to verify online taxpayers | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ssvGhX"&gt;The Internal Revenue Service will require people who access and pay their taxes online to enroll in a third-party facial recognition company starting this summer (h/t &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/01/irs-will-soon-require-selfies-for-online-access/"&gt;Krebs on Security&lt;/a&gt;). Even those who have already registered on &lt;a href="http://IRS.gov"&gt;IRS.gov&lt;/a&gt; with a username and password will have to provide a government ID, a copy of a utility bill, and a selfie to ID.me, the Virginia-based identity verification company. You’ll take a video selfie with whatever webcam or mobile device you’re using to sign up, which seems likely to cause problems for people with older hardware or who don’t have access to one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ecZqj7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/new-identity-verification-process-to-access-certain-irs-online-tools-and-services"&gt;According to the IRS&lt;/a&gt;, ID.me is a “trusted technology provider” of identity verification services. Anyone who already has an ID.me account from another government agency can sign in with those credentials. Brian Krebs created a new ID.me account and wrote in his post that the sign-up process was time-consuming and glitchy. He got stuck about halfway through the process and had to start again from the beginning, then was prompted to join a video call with an ID.me representative — with a wait time of nearly three and a half hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="gzu23w"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Most US government agencies are using facial recognition","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22641216/facial-recognition-gao-report-agency-dhs-cbp-fbi"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="4EFNKA"&gt;In its “&lt;a href="https://insights.id.me/privacy-bill-of-rights/"&gt;privacy bill of rights&lt;/a&gt;,” ID.me says it doesn’t “sell, lead, or trade biometric data to any third parties or derive any profit from the sale, lease or trade of biometric data.” It can share information with its partners with users’ explicit permission, &lt;a href="https://help.id.me/hc/en-us/articles/202211630-How-does-ID-me-use-my-information-"&gt;according to its website&lt;/a&gt;, and when you register for an ID.me account, you have to accept the company’s biometric consent policy. The company collects facial and voice biometrics to verify identity and protect against fraudulent behavior and to “comply with a request from law enforcement or government entities where not prohibited by law.” And even if you delete your ID.me account, the company may retain your biometric data for several years, depending on “the nature of the data and relevant legal or operational retention needs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ELem1S"&gt;You may remember ID.me from earlier in the pandemic; more than two dozen states use the company to verify people applying for unemployment benefits. &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dbywn/facial-recognition-failures-are-locking-people-out-of-unemployment-systems"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard &lt;/em&gt;reported in June 2021&lt;/a&gt; that ID.me failed to identify some applicants and that they had difficulty reaching anyone at the company to remedy their problem. ID.me CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/19/22541427/facial-recognition-software-verify-unemployment-benefits-id-me"&gt;Blake Hall told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at the time that it uses a system similar to Apple’s FaceID or the way a TSA agent would compare a passenger’s face to their ID at an airport. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix stock plunges as company misses growth forecast </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y_9aSP_MaufedXna42FOB1LF20Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70414173/acastro_211025_1777_netflix_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9dzhdG"&gt;Netflix investors have been worried that the company isn’t adding subscribers fast enough — and today, they started to panic. After Netflix reported lower than projected subscriber additions for the final quarter of 2021, its stock plummeted nearly 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2AOdtb"&gt;The plunge was the lowest the stock had dropped since June of 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/20/netflix-nflx-earnings-q4-2021.html"&gt;CNBC noted&lt;/a&gt;. Last quarter, Netflix had forecasted that it would report 222.06 million paid subscriptions by the end of last year. Instead, the company reported Thursday that it ended the fourth quarter with 221.84 paid memberships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="z9xozF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Acquisition growth has not yet re-accelerated to pre-Covid levels”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6P7knc"&gt;It’s a small difference, but investors have been worried about Netflix — already one of the biggest streaming companies out there — being able to find new ways to keep growing. And by Netflix’s own estimates, subscriber growth is going to be low next quarter as well. The company estimated that it would add 2.5 million subscribers in the first quarter of 2022, down from 4 million during the same period last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IHqgS5"&gt;That all said, plenty of people are still coming to and paying for Netflix. Revenue grew 16 percent year over year, and paid memberships rose 9 percent year over year. But while Netflix is still growing, it’s doing so incrementally. Both subscriber and revenue growth &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22893419/netflix-price-increase-q1-2022-earnings"&gt;have been pain points&lt;/a&gt; for anxious investors, particularly in the US, the company’s biggest market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SB502d"&gt;“While retention and engagement remain healthy, acquisition growth has not yet re-accelerated to pre-Covid levels,” the company said. “We think this may be due to several factors including the ongoing Covid overhang and macro-economic hardship in several parts of the world like [Latin America].”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wr74OE"&gt;Somewhat curiously, Netflix had very little to say about its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22893419/netflix-price-increase-q1-2022-earnings"&gt;recent price hike&lt;/a&gt; in the US. Instead, it pointed to its recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407467/netflix-play-something-shuffle-feature-launch-tv-movie"&gt;Play Something feature&lt;/a&gt; as one example of the way the company adds value for its users. Ahead of its call, the company also appeared to preemptively waft away any investor concerns about its increased competition during the last two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9MZgYF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Netflix has tremendous room for growth if we can continue to improve our service.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ujFtZ8"&gt;“While this added competition may be affecting our marginal growth some, we continue to grow in every country and region in which these new streaming alternatives have launched,” the company wrote. “This reinforces our view that the greatest opportunity in entertainment is the transition from linear to streaming and that with under 10% of total TV screen time in the US, our biggest market, Netflix has tremendous room for growth if we can continue to improve our service.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3REqYs"&gt;Perhaps Netflix’s bigger concern should be this: its growth and signups are slowing even during a quarter in which Netflix premiered two of its most-viewed films ever, &lt;em&gt;Red Notice&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Don’t Look Up&lt;/em&gt;. To keep investors’ nerves calm, Netflix will need to start accounting for its sluggish growth, or at least spin up some creative ways to justify it moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung confirms February Unpacked, hints at the end of the Note line</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Note 20" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7f1_k7i0r25GLZ3oVXQxTON1BUY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70414137/dbohn_201004_4226_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Note 20 will likely be the last of its kind.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PoO0Kw"&gt;Samsung will host an Unpacked event next month, the company has confirmed in a press release authored by president TM Roh, and the writing is on the wall for the Galaxy Note series. &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/editorial-setting-a-new-standard-for-smartphones-in-our-changing-world"&gt;The release&lt;/a&gt; hints that more Note features will be coming to the Galaxy S series — specifically the next Ultra phone in the lineup, which looks poised to take on the Note’s built-in stylus and related productivity features. This all but seals the Note series’ fate, which Samsung left in ambiguous territory last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9EloU0"&gt;Things looked doubtful for a renewal of the Note series when 2021 came and went without a new Note device. Roh’s post acknowledges the disappointment from Note fans and that this feedback has been taken into account in designing “the most noteworthy S series device we’ve ever created.” To drive home the point, the post ends with a rallying cry to “help Samsung rewrite the future of smartphones once again” and an invitation to “[g]et ready for the ultimate Ultra experience.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="I2bP6K"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W_kk-AfcbNI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DCbb7W"&gt;This doesn’t come as much of a surprise. Last year’s S21 series took a half step toward absorbing the Note series &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22226594/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-s-pen-stylus-support-price-unpacked-event"&gt;when it incorporated S-pen support&lt;/a&gt;. When the S22 leaks started to roll in, it began to look more obvious that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22860479/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-leak-official-image-note-design"&gt;the S-series Ultra, in particular, would more or less become the new Note&lt;/a&gt;, complete with a built-in stylus silo. We expect to get all of the details at Samsung’s February Unpacked event, though the exact date and time are still unknown. Until then, Note fans can hold out some hope that the stylus features they love haven’t been forgotten. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nwwFyhC7ZPVVKpAaM-7gBbzqu-g=/15x0:1065x700/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70414132/s22U.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1476660792527306754" target="_blank"&gt;evleaks (Twitter)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WA4EOF"&gt;For the launch of Samsung’s next flagship smartphones — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/6/22870027/samsung-s22-series-unofficial-dummy-leak-design-camera-specs"&gt;the Galaxy S22, S22 Plus, and S22 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;, we think — the Korean electronics giant will once again let you signal your intent to buy its phones &lt;em&gt;before they’re even announced&lt;/em&gt;, much less go on sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iq7k0V"&gt;So if you’re the kind of person who absolutely &lt;em&gt;needs&lt;/em&gt; the new Samsung handset before anyone else (except influencers, journalists, and the like), you’ll want to check out &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/http://Samsung.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung.com&lt;/a&gt; tomorrow morning at 7AM PT / 10AM ET when the unannounced phones will be up for reservation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mdVcCO"&gt;If it’s anything like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22202683/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-plus-s-pen-preorder-reserve"&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335591/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-preorder-reserve"&gt;occasions&lt;/a&gt;, you won’t need to plunk down a virtual wad of cash just yet — you’re simply reserving a slot to order the phone later, typically after the company’s actual smartphone keynote (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22893640/samsung-unpacked-february-2022-galaxy-s22-ultra"&gt;coming February, the company just confirmed&lt;/a&gt;) ends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="C1x8wX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung confirms February Unpacked, hints at the end of the Note line","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22893640/samsung-unpacked-february-2022-galaxy-s22-ultra"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="vZ4vx5"&gt;Like before, you’ll also get $50 of credit towards other Samsung Galaxy products when you preorder, so maybe there’s a free case or charger in your future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3LEQb1"&gt;While we don’t have official details on what the new phones are quite yet, they have leaked fairly extensively as usual, and the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra, in particular, is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22860479/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-leak-official-image-note-design"&gt;expected to effectively be the new Galaxy Note, stylus and all&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung mobile president TM Roh threw some gas on that fire &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/editorial-setting-a-new-standard-for-smartphones-in-our-changing-world"&gt;in a blog post today,&lt;/a&gt; too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="N8T6m4"&gt;We know many of you were surprised when Samsung didn’t release a new Galaxy Note last year. You loved the unparalleled creativity and efficiency of the  Galaxy Note series, which enabled you to switch from gaming nirvana to high-octane productivity in the blink of an eye. You raved about the lifelike S Pen, which many say rivals putting ink to paper. And we haven’t forgotten about these experiences you love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xjUcBQ"&gt;“At Unpacked in February 2022, we’ll introduce you to the most noteworthy S series device we’ve ever created,” he adds later — clearly a play on the word noteworthy — and says that “you will help Samsung rewrite the future of smartphones once again.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VDq6oK"&gt;If you’re still not convinced the Note is merging, there’s this video too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AatdJO"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W_kk-AfcbNI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Oj20J3"&gt;Otherwise, Samsung’s hinting the new phone will have a brighter camera for better night photos, claiming it will offer “game-changing Nightography,” and earlier this month, the company announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/17/22888966/samsung-exynos-2200-soc-chip-announced-amd-gpu-rdna-2"&gt;a new Exynos processor with AMD RDNA 2 graphics&lt;/a&gt; that might feature in the S22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3DNQ7e"&gt;For a better sense, I’d suggest looking at the many leaks we’ve covered, which go over a variety of likely specs, including a wide array of cameras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="AbhmFh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung’s Galaxy S22 lineup takes shape in unofficial leaks","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/6/22870027/samsung-s22-series-unofficial-dummy-leak-design-camera-specs"},{"title":"Samsung’s leaked Galaxy S22 Ultra is just straight up a Galaxy Note now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22860479/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-leak-official-image-note-design"},{"title":"Samsung’s next tablet lineup could include a 14.6-inch ‘Ultra’ model with a notch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/16/22886595/samsung-tablet-lineup-ultra-notch-rumor"},{"title":"Samsung leaks new notched tablet on its own website","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22890937/samsung-galaxy-tab-s8-ultra-tablet-android-leak"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="mjkMUb"&gt;And then, as always, I would suggest waiting for the reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rDBTys"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8WtLbz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer wants to ‘keep Call of Duty on PlayStation’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1kr9-4iv4Aod-nGxsmsCZ8fw3I4=/0x0:2500x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70413996/vpavic_070616_1091_0165.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like with Minecraft, Microsoft might keep Call of Duty multiplatform.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L9YBIg"&gt;The gaming industry is reeling from the potential ramifications of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889258/microsoft-activision-blizzard-xbox-acquisition-call-of-duty-overwatch"&gt;Microsoft’s massive deal to acquire Activision&lt;/a&gt;, and some of the biggest questions have been about the future of the &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; franchise, which is a big hit on both PlayStation and Xbox consoles. While we still don’t know for sure where you’ll be able to play the newest &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; games if the acquisition goes through, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer suggests the series does have a future on Sony platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PRUIIt"&gt;“Had good calls this week with leaders at Sony,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/XboxP3/status/1484273335139651585"&gt;Spencer said Thursday evening&lt;/a&gt;. “I confirmed our intent to honor all existing agreements upon acquisition of Activision Blizzard and our desire to keep &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; on PlayStation. Sony is an important part of our industry, and we value our relationship.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="51h2SB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Had good calls this week with leaders at Sony. I confirmed our intent to honor all existing agreements upon acquisition of Activision Blizzard and our desire to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation. Sony is an important part of our industry, and we value our relationship.&lt;/p&gt;— Phil Spencer (@XboxP3) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/XboxP3/status/1484273335139651585?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 20, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fx3Xdu"&gt;That statement leaves some wiggle room that &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; could still become an Xbox exclusive franchise. Microsoft has shown a willingness to turn its acquisitions into exclusives: it’s planning to release Bethesda Softworks’ upcoming game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22531868/starfield-bethesda-game-xbox-pc-november-11-2022-release"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Starfield&lt;/em&gt; only on Xbox and PC&lt;/a&gt;, and Spencer has hinted that will be the case for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22783314/elder-scrolls-6-xbox-exclusive-pc-phil-spencer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Elder Scrolls VI&lt;/em&gt; as well&lt;/a&gt;. That approach would make sense, especially as a way to help beef up its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22890553/microsoft-activision-xbox-game-pass-competition-subscription"&gt;Game Pass subscription service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RNG6gV"&gt;But it seems that might not be what Spencer wants to do with &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;. It wouldn’t be the first time he’s been willing to keep Microsoft-owned franchises multiplatform; &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;, for example, remains available on many different platforms years after it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/11/6/7167283/Minecraft-now-officially-belongs-to-microsoft-what-you-should-know"&gt;acquired Mojang&lt;/a&gt;. And Microsoft has even released a new &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; game, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21270311/minecraft-dungeons-reviews-xbox-pc-switch-ps4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minecraft Dungeons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;on PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC.&lt;/p&gt;

Spencer and Sony’s statements also align with information from an FAQ Activision sent to employees this week. “We will honor all existing commitments post close,” &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000718877/000110465922005526/tm223212d10_defa14a.htm"&gt;according to the FAQ, which appeared in an SEC filing&lt;/a&gt;. “As with Microsoft’s acquisition of Minecraft, we have no intent to remove any content from platforms where it exists today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RhIHos"&gt;The acquisition is still a long way off from being a done deal, however; it’s not expected to close until the end of Microsoft’s 2023 fiscal year, which ends in June 2023. But assuming Activision eventually does join Microsoft, if you’re a PlayStation gamer, it now seems somewhat more likely that new &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; games will still come to your Sony console.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GameStop will have PlayStation 5 bundles in stock tomorrow at 11AM ET</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jMvt6H"&gt;If you’re one of the many still on the hunt for a PlayStation 5, you’re about to have another shot at GameStop, as the retailer will have the coveted next-gen console online starting tomorrow, January 21st, at 11AM ET / 8AM PT. The retailer will offer the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=TheVergePS5Restock12621&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fplaystation-5%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fplaystation-5%2F229025.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;standard, disc-based PS5&lt;/a&gt; as part of a bundle that includes a copy of &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Vanguard, &lt;/em&gt;an extra DualSense controller in red, a $50 Gamestop gift card, and a 12-month subscription to PlayStation Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmseUW"&gt;GameStop did not supply specifics on exactly how much the bundle will cost — nor did it mention whether the restock will take place online or in-person — but the total of everything being offered is roughly $750. Another small catch is that the restock will only be available to Powerup Pro members. Becoming a Pro member only costs $14.99 a month, however, and nets you an annual membership to the program.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kg5CYw"&gt;As always, we advise that you log in to your GameStop account as quickly as possible, fill in your payment details, and ensure your billing and shipping information are correct. It’ll reduce the time it takes to check out, so you have a better chance at finally landing a PS5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZiGThO"&gt;However, if you don’t manage to pick up one tomorrow, don’t fret! We will continue posting stock updates as they happen.&lt;/p&gt;
