    <title>Mastercard will drop Pornhub after finding unlawful videos</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hdmTNd"&gt;Mastercard says it will stop processing payments on Pornhub after confirming unlawful content on the site. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/pornhub-mastercard/mastercard-to-stop-processing-payments-on-pornhub-cites-unlawful-content-idUSKBN28K30C"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; the news, which comes as Pornhub is making substantial changes to how it moderates content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KeN7s1"&gt;“Today, the use of our cards at Pornhub is being terminated. Our investigation over the past several days has confirmed violations of our standards prohibiting unlawful content on their site,” Mastercard spokesperson Seth Eisen tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “As a result, and in accordance with our policies, we instructed the financial institutions that connect the site to our network to terminate acceptance. In addition, we continue to investigate potential illegal content on other websites to take the appropriate action.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gZFXTG"&gt;Pornhub came under fire after &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/04/opinion/sunday/pornhub-rape-trafficking.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; finding nonconsensual pornography, recordings of assault, and videos of underage girls on the site. The company called claims that it allows child sexual abuse material “irresponsible and flagrantly untrue.” Soon after, however, Pornhub &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22164031/pornhub-upload-limit-blocked-download-nyt-kristof-child-abuse"&gt;banned uploads&lt;/a&gt; by unidentified users and blocked downloading videos from the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IlLsb3"&gt;Payment processing giants Visa and Mastercard confirmed earlier this week that they were conducting independent investigations of Pornhub content. “When we identify illegal activity, our policy is to ask the acquirer to terminate the relationship, unless an effective compliance plan is put in place,” Mastercard &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/07/business/visa-mastercard-pornhub.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Visa said that it was “actively engaging with the relevant financial institutions,” as well as Pornhub’s parent company MindGeek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s3I33G"&gt;So far, Visa has not announced the results of its investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cydia sues Apple alleging its App Store has a monopoly</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JLXcNOYkab9yhLKyNXchk1tCBCY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68492814/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aUF9BT"&gt;A new lawsuit from the creator of jailbroken iOS app store Cydia claims Apple used anti-competitive tactics that froze out Cydia and other would-be rivals when it created its App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SM9vdW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22160777/cydia_sues_apple.pdf"&gt;Apple, the lawsuit states&lt;/a&gt;, “began coercing users to utilize no other iOS app distribution service but the App Store, coupling it closer and closer to the iPhone itself in order to crowd out all competition.” The company is seeking a jury trial and unspecified monetary damages: “This lawsuit seeks to open the markets for iOS app distribution and iOS app payment processing to those who wish to compete fairly with Apple, and to recover the enormous damages Apple caused.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1jjFL8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/saurik"&gt;Software developer Jay Freeman&lt;/a&gt; launched Cydia in 2007, before Apple had established the App Store. After the launch of the App Store, Cydia became a way for users to install apps, tweaks, and software that hadn’t been approved by Apple. The lawsuit alleges that the early iPhones were limited in functionality and came with “only a handful of Apple apps,” and they were not able to install third-party software or additional apps. Over the years, Apple made it more difficult to jailbreak iPhones and, the lawsuit alleges, discouraged developers from using non-Apple app stores. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/16/18143422/cydia-disables-in-app-purchases-ios-jailbreak-store-apple-iphone"&gt;Cydia shut down new purchases&lt;/a&gt; in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Vsg5T"&gt;Cydia’s lawsuit, first &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/10/cydia-apple-lawsuit/"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, claims that Apple now has a monopoly over iOS software distribution. “Were it not for Apple’s anticompetitive acquisition and maintenance of an illegal monopoly over iOS app distribution, users today would actually be able to choose how and where to locate and obtain iOS apps, and developers would be able to use the iOS app distributor of their choice,” according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wofQOR"&gt;Apple says it plans to review the lawsuit and continues to discourage people from jailbreaking iPhones for security reasons. A &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.norton.com%2Finternetsecurity-mobile-android-vs-ios-which-is-more-secure.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F10%2F22167964%2Fcydia-sues-apple-monopoly-anticompetitive-iphone#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2019 study from antivirus company Norton&lt;/a&gt; found that Apple’s stringent controls over what apps are allowed into the App Store made iOS devices somewhat more secure than those running the more popular &lt;a href="https://source.android.com/"&gt;open-source Android&lt;/a&gt; operating system. However, the US Copyright Office has established that iPhone &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/pages/jailbreaking-not-crime-tell-copyright-office-free-your-devices"&gt;jailbreaking is not illegal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X5mD8q"&gt;Cydia is the latest company to allege Apple has engaged in anti-competitive behavior. In August, Epic Games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366259/epic-fortnite-vbucks-mega-drop-discount-iphone-android"&gt;introduced a new direct payment system&lt;/a&gt; in its popular &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;game&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;to bypass Apple’s 30 percent fee. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;Apple kicked &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; off&lt;/a&gt; the App Store for violating its rules, and Epic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367963/epic-fortnite-legal-complaint-apple-ios-app-store-removal-injunctive-relief"&gt;responded with a civil lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against Apple, alleging that the iPhone maker was violating antitrust law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WHsLb9"&gt;A judge &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21492334/epic-fortnite-apple-lawsuit-restraining-order-unreal-engine"&gt;granted an injunction&lt;/a&gt; to prevent Apple from retaliating against Epic’s Unreal Engine platform, but refused to grant an injunction that would have restored &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; in Apple’s App Store. Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427779/apple-epic-games-breach-of-contract-lawsuit-fortnite-app-store"&gt;said it would seek damages&lt;/a&gt; against Epic for allegedly breaching its contract with the iOS App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BHSB18"&gt;In September, several companies that have criticized Apple — including Epic, Spotify, Basecamp, Match Group, Tile, Blix, and Deezer — created the &lt;a href="https://appfairness.org/"&gt;Coalition for App Fairness&lt;/a&gt; to “create a level playing field for app businesses and give people freedom of choice on their devices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BFASqY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MBQQF3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OY5zML"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is fixing SMS issues that knocked out texting for some Android users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G_ByZy1tCtlO6YRLOGLQnxX4LZY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68492692/wjoel_180413_1777_android_003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wtn7iX"&gt;SMS messages have stopped working for some Android users, and it appears Google is rolling back some changes to help fix the issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YSgvjG"&gt;The issue seems to be due to a recent update to the Carrier Services app, which “enables the latest communication services from mobile carriers, including battery-optimizations and support for enhanced features in the Android Messages app,” according to the app’s description &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.ims&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;gl=US"&gt;on the Play Store&lt;/a&gt;. The app has more than a billion installs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dVMpxj"&gt;Version 50 of the app started rolling out on December 2nd, and reports of issues with SMS started hitting around then, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/12/10/carrier-services-sms-android-issue/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. OnePlus, LG, Motorola, Samsung, and TCL phones have reportedly been affected. If you’re seeing issues, uninstalling the app fixes the problem, &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v5kgh5"&gt;As of Thursday, though, Google has reverted the recent update and is downgrading people back to version 48 of the Carrier Services app, reports &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/12/10/google-is-rolling-back-a-carrier-services-update-to-fix-sms-issues-on-some-phones/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and a &lt;em&gt;9to5Google &lt;/em&gt;writer saw that their Carrier Services app was reverted as well. And the Play Store listing for the app now lists version 48 as the most current version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="65EwVj"&gt;Google didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix is making a 3D animated Sonic the Hedgehog TV show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GWs6cWZN1wMUs5NEzTbuhaKneWg=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68492540/netflix_sonic.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: NX on Netflix (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/NXOnNetflix/status/1337079639508967425" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XycOQf"&gt;Netflix is making a 3D animated &lt;em&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog&lt;/em&gt; TV show, the company announced in a (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NXOnNetflix/status/1337079639508967425"&gt;since-deleted&lt;/a&gt;) tweet from its NX Twitter account. The series, set to debut in 2022, will be based on the character from the long-running Sega games, although there are no specific details yet as to what the show will entail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3y3VF2"&gt;The series is being produced in partnership with Sega, along with &lt;a href="https://www.wildbrain.com/"&gt;WildBrain&lt;/a&gt; (a production company behind numerous popular children’s TV shows) and Man of Action Entertainment (best known for &lt;em&gt;Ben 10 &lt;/em&gt;and Disney’s&lt;em&gt; Big Hero 6 &lt;/em&gt;TV series&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pR8vkw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Gotta go fast&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gRBpl4"&gt;While there’s not much information about the series itself, Netflix’s teaser image shows a silhouette of the modern 3D Sonic design (as opposed to the chubbier and stubbier “classic Sonic” that’s featured in games like &lt;em&gt;Sonic Mania&lt;/em&gt;.) Assuming that teaser image is representative of the show, it also appears to be ditching the more recent character designs from the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Boom_(TV_series)"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sonic Boom&lt;/em&gt; spin-off games and TV show&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5L0guz"&gt;The new Sonic series would mark the latest video game-based TV show for Netflix, which also has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536079/netflix-assassins-creed-live-action-series"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348468/netflix-splinter-cell-animated-series-adaptation-witcher-castlevania-john-wick"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Splinter Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21403849/netflix-resident-evil-tv-series-original-live-action-announcement"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;series in the works. The streamer also already offers several seasons of an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/7/15938192/netflix-castlevania-review-animated-video-game-adaptation"&gt;animated &lt;em&gt;Castlevania&lt;/em&gt; show&lt;/a&gt; (albeit one that targets a more mature audience than the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog&lt;/em&gt; show.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile introduces its first 5G hotspot and a 100GB standalone plan for $50 </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Inseego 5G MiFi M2000" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Eii8RH05Dwh2GCU0S5eWBi21LWY=/0x1:1832x1222/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68492516/Moretti_generic_top_006.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;T-Mobile will start selling the Inseego 5G MiFi M2000 today. | Image: Inseego&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i3nfzJ"&gt;T-Mobile might look as thought it’s late to the game by &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fnetwork%2F5g-just-got-better&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F10%2F22167745%2Ftmobile-5g-hotspot-100gb-standalone-plan#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;unveiling its first 5G hotspot today&lt;/a&gt;, along with a variety of 5G standalone hotspot plans. After all, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/18/20699111/verizon-5g-mifi-m1000-hotspot-650-expensive-data"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/9/18303494/att-5g-service-19-cities-verizon-samsung-s10-exclusivity-tmobile-hot-spot"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; have offered 5G hotspots for a while now (although they began with significantly limited coverage). But T-Mobile’s particular blend of wide 5G coverage and better-than-LTE speeds means the device should be more accessible to more people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JaXk2X"&gt;Plus, the carrier’s standalone 5G hotspot plan is priced to compete, starting at $30 for 10GB and $40 for 30GB, and topping out at 100GB for $50. In comparison, AT&amp;amp;T’s standalone hotspot plans start at $60 per month for 15GB; Verizon’s offerings start at $80 for 15GB of 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SGbE23"&gt;&lt;q&gt;T-Mobile’s standalone 5G hotspot plan is priced to compete&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rgcgrj"&gt;T-Mobile’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Ftablet%2Finseego-5g-mifi-m2000&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F10%2F22167745%2Ftmobile-5g-hotspot-100gb-standalone-plan#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Inseego 5G MiFi M2000&lt;/a&gt; hotspot is available now through T-Mobile and costs $336 to purchase outright. For now, the carrier is offering to knock that down to $168 if you add a new line and spread the payment across 24 months. The M2000 has more than 24 hours of battery life and is capable of connecting up to 30 devices at once, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g1UE9h"&gt;A reminder: 5G comes in several flavors, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21284203/5g-need-to-know-health-safety-radiowave-spectrum-verizon-att-tmobile-cellular-data"&gt;not all are created equal&lt;/a&gt;. T-Mobile has taken a multi-layered approach with an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538604/t-mobile-5g-network-midband-coverage-expanded-cities"&gt;aggressive expansion schedule&lt;/a&gt;, working to grow overall coverage quickly as well as bolstering its midband offerings, thanks to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21202726/tmobile-sprint-acquisition-ceo-finished-john-legere-steps-down"&gt;acquisition of Sprint’s network&lt;/a&gt; last spring. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h5INn4"&gt;In 2016, Apple launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/20/10797250/apple-music-memo-app-announced-iphone-ipad-free"&gt;a new iPhone app called Music Memos&lt;/a&gt;. It was meant to expand on the built-in Voice Memos app’s ease of use while adding some features for musicians. You could record something with an acoustic guitar or piano in uncompressed audio, and Music Memos would detect the chords you played and could also add in drum and bass backing tracks that kept with your tempo. You could name those tracks and give them star ratings, or tag certain parts of a recording like the bridge or chorus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A0LQUK"&gt;But considering how infrequently Apple updated Music Memos after its release, it’s fair to assume that the app never took off like the company might’ve hoped. It was an awkward middle child between the wonderfully simple Voice Memos and more capable GarageBand. And today, as noted by &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/10/apple-music-memos-voice-memos-integration/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Apple has confirmed that Music Memos won’t be getting any further updates. The one released today, version 1.0.7 — we never even made it to 1.1, folks — allows users to export their Music Memos recordings to Voice Memos. You can still export tracks to GarageBand just like before, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gvmWZx"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Apple Music Memos makes mobile recording easy|6279" data-volume-uuid="774e98a08" data-volume-id="6279" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-681" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let’s all take a trip back in time and rewatch our 2016 video about Music Memos.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dyiE5Y"&gt;You’ll now see a “Recording is moving to Voice Memos” prompt when you open Music Memos. Tapping “export” will send all of your stuff over to Voice Memos in a folder labeled Music Memos. You can also just tap “OK” to dismiss the export reminder for another week. If you create new recordings with Music Memos after exporting, just remember to copy those over as well. &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211824"&gt;Here’s an FAQ&lt;/a&gt; on the transition process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0lq9KL"&gt;Apple says that Music Memos will be unavailable to download after March 1st, 2021 for new users; if you’ve already installed it previously, it’ll remain available in your App Store library. But it won’t be getting any further development — not that it had received much attention in years anyway. Apple made a few bare minimum updates to the app in the past, adding support for new iPhone display resolutions and so on, but that’s pretty much it. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fmusic-memos%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F10%2F22168102%2Fapple-music-memos-app-discontinued-export#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Here’s the website for the app&lt;/a&gt;, but it might not be around for much longer. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ubisoft will give you $10 to play its free battle royale</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XAdXNuH6E_-R_hYyB_Kg75_FErE=/875x0:5951x3384/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68492381/hyper_scape_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ubisoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FauyR9"&gt;Ubisoft is &lt;a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/4XXLnxKNoAiRLMwbsa7TA5/play-hyper-scape-now-and-get-a-coupon-for-the-ubisoft-store?isSso=true&amp;amp;refreshStatus=noLoginData"&gt;willing to give you a $10 coupon&lt;/a&gt; if you play &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/2/21309355/ubisoft-hyper-scape-battle-royale-launch-announced-pc"&gt;its battle royale game&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Hyper Scape &lt;/em&gt;on PC anytime between now and December 17th at 11AM ET. It’s a great deal if you’ve been eyeing some of Ubisoft’s new games like &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Immortals Fenyx Rising&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pl2COR"&gt;The real kicker is that because &lt;em&gt;Hyper Scape&lt;/em&gt; is free to play, Ubisoft is basically giving players free money (albeit, money you can only spend on Ubisoft games).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot of the offer page in Ubisoft’s Connect program" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/30a2u0fpyIJdZJmGvb4lnHe_KZ8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22160501/Screen_Shot_2020_12_10_at_10.42.42.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ubisoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ubisoft’s Connect has more information in the store page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="M0idB3"&gt;There are just a few catches: you have to use the coupon by January 31st 2021, the game you buy has to cost at least $14.99, and the code can’t be applied to future preorders. Apart from that, there’s not a whole lot else to it. You play &lt;em&gt;Hyper Scape&lt;/em&gt; (it doesn’t matter if you’ve played it before), click a button saying that you’ve played it, and get a coupon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3NWC9R"&gt;The offer is open to customers in the US and Canada (Canadians get a $14 CAD coupon to go toward a game that’s at least $20.99 CAD). If you live in either of those countries and are looking to buy a Ubisoft game soon, you might as well give it a shot!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How governors are fighting for clean energy jobs </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3utOM5AfaIxsdQszzunB4InxZdI=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68492330/1152711973.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Colorado Gov. Jared Polis speaking about his renewable energy roadmap at a community solar garden in Arvada, Colorado, in 2019.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Joe Amon / MediaNews Group / The Denver Post / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0pufJF"&gt;A coalition of 25 governors today renewed calls for a green recovery to the economic downturn caused by COVID-19. They also called on Congress to pass a stimulus package that bolsters clean energy job growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="Uu15Rk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is a crisis”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MTdaiz"&gt;It’s an investment that’s also needed to tackle the severe effects climate change is already having on states. “This is a crisis, and that’s why we really made it a goal from the very start to lead the way in renewable energy,” Colorado Gov. Jared Polis tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cE8Pl3"&gt;The governors, including Polis, are part of the US Climate Alliance, formed in 2017 as a response to President Donald Trump’s decision to pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement. They pledged to keep states on track to meet the goals of the agreement, even as federal efforts dissipated. Those climate ambitions led to the creation of 133,100 jobs in clean energy in their states between 2016 and 2019, a &lt;a href="https://www.usclimatealliance.org/jobsreport"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; released by the alliance today shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HXIcgf"&gt;But the pandemic wiped out those job gains. Renewable energy and energy efficiency projects languished amid stay-at-home orders throughout the year. More than 301,000 people working in clean energy lost their jobs in the first half of 2020, according to the Climate Alliance report. The pain wasn’t limited to states that joined the alliance. Across the US, the solar workforce dropped to its lowest numbers since 2014, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AEnwLJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The need for swift, bipartisan congressional action&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YAXhkx"&gt;“These massive job losses underscore the need for swift, bipartisan Congressional action on a stimulus package that will help address the immediate needs of states and get these Americans back to work, while ensuring climate commitments are met,” the alliance wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.usclimatealliance.org/publications/2020/12/10/us-climate-alliance-states-outpace-nation-in-clean-energy-job-creation-while-pushing-to-achieve-goals-of-paris-agreement"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; today. They’ve called on Congress to pass a stimulus package that includes $500 billion for states and territories, plus additional flexible spending for efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1OXbwC"&gt;While states are struggling to get the pandemic under control, climate change is still posing threats to their residents. That makes climate change and clean energy a priority in Colorado, says Polis. Last year, he unveiled a roadmap to get the state’s electricity generation to come completely from renewables by 2040. Colorado suffered the three &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21537195/colorado-wildfires-beetle-infestations-forests-east-troublesome"&gt;biggest wildfires&lt;/a&gt; in its history this year, another sign that climate change is making fire seasons more devastating than ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mty0fK"&gt;Out of all the members of the alliance, Colorado saw one of the biggest growths in clean energy jobs between 2016 and 2019 — 13.9 percent. “Colorado’s double digit clean energy job growth is a testament to the economic benefit of leading on bold climate action and pollution reduction,” Polis says. “This sector will be a critical driver in the stabilization and growth of our economy moving forward.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="905Mu4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Biden expects to create 10 million new jobs in clean energy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VXpvza"&gt;Polis and others have a lot of faith in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21243011/clean-energy-renewables-coronavirus-recession-stimulus-unemployment"&gt;clean energy as a job maker&lt;/a&gt;, because it already has a good track record across the US. Wind turbine service technician is still the &lt;a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/fastest-growing.htm"&gt;fastest growing&lt;/a&gt; occupation in the US, while solar panel system installer is the third fastest. Prior to the pandemic, both occupations were expected to grow by 57 and 63 percent, respectively, through 2028, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HBdKjy"&gt;President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/3/21548147/united-states-paris-agreement-climate-change-presidential-election"&gt;recommit the US to the Paris climate agreement&lt;/a&gt; and has laid out a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21324575/joe-biden-jobs-climate-change-plan-energy-elections"&gt;sweeping plan&lt;/a&gt; to decarbonize the US economy. That includes transitioning the power sector to 100 percent carbon pollution-free energy by 2035. To keep those promises, he’ll need a lot of boots on the ground to modernize power grids and build up the country’s renewable energy capacity. Biden expects to create &lt;a href="https://joebiden.com/climate-labor-fact-sheet/"&gt;10 million new jobs&lt;/a&gt; in clean energy, more than tripling the number of American workers currently employed in the sector. Biden will still need help from Congress, though, to pass legislation that will help him meet all his climate and jobs goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NbzpUh"&gt;Polis is hopeful that Colorado and other states will no longer be on their own when it comes to remaking energy infrastructure. “It’ll be great to have a partner in our federal government rather than an adversary,” Polis says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DM96x7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3sIF9B"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now add tweets to your snaps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B0pNjIRRZYqM2q4oBx9KDOxnypY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68491764/acastro_170726_1777_0010.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="13RGce"&gt;Twitter is making it even easier to spread your tweets far and wide to every social media platform imaginable. Starting today on iOS (support is coming “soon” for Android), you’ll be able to add tweets into a snap as a sticker. Before, if you wanted to share a tweet on Snapchat, you would have to take a screenshot of it and share that, without having access to any of Snapchat’s camera or editing features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JVS3Rs"&gt;If you want to share a tweet to Snapchat, press the share button on a public tweet (private tweets aren’t supported, for obvious reasons) and select the Snapchat icon from the share carousel. You can then create a snap as usual, except you’ll have your selected tweet as a sticker that you can manipulate. You can then share the snap as you would any other — sending it to people, or adding it to your story, and whoever sees it can go to the tweet by swiping up. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Shows the process of sharing a tweet to Snapchat" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LosgzVI-mjpOf4uia5YI6a3QiM8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158880/JN9n1a0kXdN4WiHcn1HmXwjLGtQj9ym64p9Ee3Fe8PqM1khSpD4thVG9HhoqF4qx1hI_Am5Avqq1pSpNNXoFFHvcIw5OS1r9gol9REwmrtiIwa4CgkUDYwaIF5SHRQPjc9rE_ppC.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The process of adding a tweet to a snap.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="S2Qran"&gt;I have to say, the example snap looks way better than the (often crunchy) screenshots of tweets do, and it’s nice that it’s a format that lets you easily find the source. If you’ve abandoned Snapchat for Instagram Stories, don’t worry: Twitter also says that a small group of iOS users will be able to test sharing tweets to Instagram Stories soon.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Image of a tweet that has been embedded into an Instagram story" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iufAMqocrBgKzSDoTgweuRgYKX8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158926/xF6OtSQCTyfV0kcCl671ctkWapXjNOUfKWmpU_k7IUbuAz5pm9FNLCSh40zILd_rS1HoyS05nwCfwPweq23Tw4PZRqgPUMCfXtP_FoMGk62mzEeSi8RHJsCVnJBCtjESyAQL9zGy.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Graphic: Twitter&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soon, Twitter will be testing sharing to Instagram Stories as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Wq9xZk"&gt;This is a feature built for social media apps as they are today: places to repost tweets. As I’m writing this, two out of the top 10 posts on Reddit are tweets. Instagram is filled with pages that post screenshots of tweets, and Facebook, I’m told, is mostly people posting tweets (Twitter, of course, is full of old Tumblr posts). Now, Snapchat can also be Twitter, and Instagram Stories’ time is coming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YgGOER"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber asks governors to give drivers early access to COVID-19 vaccines</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Uber logo against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uHVzCFT9K25KigFPb9R8LkWWImg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68491286/acastro_180927_1777_uber_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LC6xMC"&gt;Uber sent letters today to every US governor asking that their drivers and delivery people be classified as essential workers and given prioritized access to COVID-19 vaccines. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended the first batch of vaccines go to health care workers and residents of long-term care facilities, with essential workers — including those in transportation — following in a second phase. But it’s up to each state to decide the specifics of their vaccine distribution plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QuRDkp"&gt;“After nine months on the frontlines keeping their communities running, we are asking governors in all 50 states to prioritize drivers and delivery people for early vaccine access,” said Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8lvnKu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If classified as essential, Uber drivers would be part of the planned second phase for vaccination&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vgcSFn"&gt;Uber made &lt;a href="https://beta.regulations.gov/comment/CDC-2020-0121-0238"&gt;a similar appeal&lt;/a&gt; to the CDC earlier this week, saying in a letter that early access to a COVID-19 vaccine “would help drivers and delivery people continue to play their essential role while also reducing the risk that they may inadvertently contract, or possibly transmit, the virus.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzpOXN"&gt;In the letter to state governors, Khosrowshahi argues that Uber can use their services “to remove transportation barriers faced by individuals who will need to travel to their vaccination appointments.” Both letters point to the use of Uber by health care workers, restaurants, and people relying on delivery to stay at home during the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y531DG"&gt;While Uber is asking for its workers to be considered essential, the company has long been criticized for repeatedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21546037/prop-22-california-uber-lyft-ballot-measure-result"&gt;fighting to classify those same drivers as contractors rather than employees&lt;/a&gt;. Uber has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/11/20861362/uber-ab5-tony-west-drivers-core-ride-share-business-california"&gt;gone so far as to say&lt;/a&gt; that “drivers’ work is outside the usual course of Uber’s business.” Part of its business or not, more drivers and delivery people could continue working through the pandemic with early access to vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MCg5ki"&gt;The FDA advisory committee is meeting on Thursday to discuss emergency authorization of the Pfizer / BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, and it will be doing the same next week for the Moderna vaccine. States have already begun their preparations for vaccine distribution, but with limited supply, there &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21779433/covid-vaccine-priority-health-care-workers-long-term-care"&gt;may not be enough doses&lt;/a&gt; available to vaccinate all health care workers by the end of the year. As more doses become available in 2021, it will take careful consideration from state officials to determine which populations of people should be prioritized.&lt;/p&gt;
