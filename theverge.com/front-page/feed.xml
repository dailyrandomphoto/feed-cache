    <title>Apple selling new AirPods Pro coinciding with the Year of the Tiger in certain markets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3OiCFczPA_I9r0afqJmI7VaxiOk=/0x334:2000x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70342687/MN6U3_AV1.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b6AkUG"&gt;Apple is now selling a new set of special edition AirPod Pros (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/01/apple-launches-special-edition-tiger-airpods-pro-for-chinese-new-year/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;via 9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) in time for the Chinese New Year, which begins on February 1st, 2022. Just as the previous &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218360/apple-lunar-new-year-ox-airpods-pro-asia"&gt;Year of the Ox&lt;/a&gt;, Apple is engraving a special emoji on the AirPods Pro case — this time, themed for the Year of the Tiger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H6XzHM"&gt;At first glance, it seems like only the standard tiger emoji is featured on the case — but turns out, it’s just a bit more snazzy with sparkles and fireworks surrounding the tiger face topped off with a cute tiger growly-face hood. Other than that, the only other difference is the retail box has the same emoji in red on the sides.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/haCVc645ugqdcPA2D9vYCFQrI8M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142021/airpods_tiger.001.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Images from Apple Store website&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New special edition Year of the Tiger AirPods on the left comparing to AirPods Pro with a regular tiger emoji on the right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Tprz5U"&gt;The new Special Edition AirPods Pro - Tiger (the official name) is available to order now in several Asian markets, including Hong Kong (with a heavy backorder until May 1st as of writing), where it retails for HK$1,999 ($256.38 USD). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FCXc4c"&gt;Apple also is &lt;a href="https://m.weibo.cn/status/4720927805801613"&gt;giving away&lt;/a&gt; free red envelopes with a golden embossing of different Chinese zodiac emojis — all wearing the same tiger hood. It’s a cute addition for those traditionally gifting money for the celebration of the new year but is only available if purchased in an Apple Store that sells the special edition AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0pyp3H"&gt;While people in markets like the US might feel left out — you could just order regular AirPods Pro and get a free tiger emoji engraving... it’s really not that different. The existence of these yearly special editions is perhaps a literal product of courting the Chinese market — a country in which Apple historically has had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/4/21423347/apple-freedom-speech-expression-information-china-censorship-policy"&gt;bend&lt;/a&gt; to stay competitive.&lt;/p&gt;

The stripes continue onto the actual buds themselves, unlike the standard-fare buds the special edition AirPods Pro come with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gI7PtC"&gt;

    <title>The secret weapons in Arlo’s new security system are the all-in-one sensors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mPiFT-nC_W2ebJsJQNTaindaDfg=/199x0:5302x3402/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70342629/Keypad_sensors_final_V3.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arlo has announced a new smart home security system.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Arlo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JA3T9P"&gt;Arlo announced the impending arrival of its long-awaited home security system at CES 2022 this week, and the product even got a nod as a 2022 CES Innovation Award honoree. The company, known for its top-quality smart security cameras, also announced its support for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22787729/matter-smart-home-standard-apple-amazon-google"&gt;Matter&lt;/a&gt;, a possible indication that a Matter specification for security cameras isn’t too far away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WHm3yj"&gt;The DIY security monitoring solution is a natural expansion for the company that has a full suite of home security cameras. So natural that it actually &lt;a href="https://blog.bestbuy.ca/smart-home/new-arlo-security-system-announced-at-2019-ces"&gt;announced one at CES 2019&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JFXVp5"&gt;While that product never saw the light of day, the latest Arlo Security System is a complete redesign. The signature feature are the new, all-in-one multi-sensors with eight different functions, plus NFC integrated into the hub so users can tap their phone to disarm the system. Arlo says the system will be available to buy in the first half of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D1s4yT"&gt;The all-in-one sensors are capable of recognizing motion, door / window openings and tilt, water leaks, light / temperature changes, and they can listen for smoke and CO alarms, says Arlo. Small and lightweight, the multi-sensor is 1.1 inches wide and runs on a battery.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/APGH5m2-dnS2OxvFtuw6-XzSkyI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142188/sensor_V2__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Arlo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arlo’s new security system uses these single multi-sensors to monitor your home.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eapCCH"&gt;The sensors go with the Arlo Security System’s “modular hub,” which serves as a central controller and has a built-in siren, smoke / CO alarm sensor, and integrated backlit keypad. It also has NFC technology to enable the tap to arm / disarm feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vpFFak"&gt;“We engineered the Arlo Security System to not only complete Arlo’s ecosystem but to address pain points common with other solutions on the market,” says Tim Johnston, SVP of product at Arlo. Additionally, Arlo says the system integrates with existing Arlo security cameras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R9CbL8"&gt;However, details on exactly what those integrations will entail were not made available. We also don’t know the price of the system or if you will need to subscribe to Arlo Secure — Arlo’s monthly subscription plan for its cameras that starts at $3 a month. My guess is there will be a fee to use the system, although currently it doesn’t appear there is any professional monitoring option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jyqGn6"&gt;There’s also no word on smart home integrations, but Arlo traditionally has been a very open system, working with SmartThings, Google Home, Amazon Alexa, and Apple HomeKit. I reached out to Arlo with these questions and was told that more information will be available at launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VnPgf3"&gt;While the multi-sensors are an innovative idea and similar to Google's excellent Nest Detect sensors for its now-defunct &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/20/16337562/nest-secure-guard-detect-tag-alarm-home-security-system"&gt;Nest Secure security system&lt;/a&gt;, the downside is likely to be cost. These multi-sensors are often significantly more expensive than the motion and contact sensors used in security systems from competitors such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/9/21215231/ring-alarm-second-generation-update-preorder-features-emergency"&gt;Ring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2018/9/7/17828782/security-system-self-installed-easy-installation-set-up"&gt;SimpliSafe&lt;/a&gt;. This means outfitting a typical three-bedroom home with an Arlo Security System could get expensive quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RaqcEA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this NYT investigation on the inaccuracy of prenatal blood tests </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Florida, Miami Beach, blood testing center, blood test tubes" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JYJYQs_qOctYECSf8BtihGAftEM=/0x0:2533x1689/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70342532/1347423670.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by: Jeffrey Greenberg/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SuCvvN"&gt;Blood tests on pregnant people that look for rare and devastating developmental conditions in fetuses are often wrong, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/01/upshot/pregnancy-birth-genetic-testing.html"&gt;an investigation from &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZqv1z"&gt;The blood testing technology, called noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), works very well for more common disorders like Down syndrome. But &lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;reported that a review of data from multiple studies showed that when NIPT is used to test for uncommon things like Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (which is found in one in 20,000 births) or Cri-du-chat syndrome (which is found in one in 15,000 births), positive results are wrong 80 percent of the time or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1RhwaG"&gt;These tests, made by companies like Natera and Sequenom, have become more popular in recent years. Estimates of the size of the market approach billions of dollars. Positive results on the tests are supposed to trigger more extensive (and accurate) follow-up testing, but those tests are expensive, invasive, and often can’t be done until it would be too late for a legal abortion. Many patients don’t end up getting those follow-up tests, and some terminate pregnancies based on the initial information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V49HBo"&gt;The investigation highlights the statistical challenge of testing for things that are extremely rare. Even a test that’s highly accurate would still find lots of false positives if it was used on thousands of people to try to find a condition that’s only &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; there .005 percent of the time (like Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome). It’s very difficult to create tests for rare conditions that are so good that they won’t have a high number of false positives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CZnAor"&gt;But, as &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reporting found, that issue wasn’t adequately explained to patients who were sold the tests. Companies developing NIPTs used language like “highly accurate” and “total confidence.” Many companies didn’t publish data on their tests’ performance overall, or only stressed data from tests that are more accurate. “I think the information they provide is misleading,” Alberto Gutierrez, the former director of a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) office overseeing medical tests, told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JLJVmV"&gt;Many NIPTs don’t have to be cleared or reviewed by the FDA before they’re used for patients — they fall under a category called lab-developed tests, which are able to skirt some regulatory oversight. Despite the lack of scrutiny, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22816112/theranos-lab-developed-test-fda-regulation-everlywell"&gt;they’re able to advertise&lt;/a&gt; to patients and tout the limited data they have in marketing materials, even if it’s misleading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zFAGsD"&gt;Read the full investigation &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/01/upshot/pregnancy-birth-genetic-testing.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer’s new Chromebook Spin has a bigger screen but shorter battery life</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/83kMravH0lxBIlDsJgmzfFrrqx4=/0x200:3000x2200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70342391/acer_chromebook_spin_513.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Acer Chromebook Spin 513 has a battery life of up to 10 hours. | Image by Acer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yugWs3"&gt;Acer announced that it’s updating its existing lineup of Chromebooks with three new devices at CES 2022, each of which comes with slight changes when compared to its predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hZUsD29nerW9JYeWOkk6iD27BMA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142112/acer_spin_new_513.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image by Acer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Spin 513 has a larger 13.5-inch display compared to its predecessor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7aDviU"&gt;The new Spin 513 comes with a 13.5-inch display, an upgrade from the 13-inch screen that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22412759/acer-chromebook-spin-513-review-specs-price"&gt;previously released Spin 513 had&lt;/a&gt;. It swaps the Snapdragon 7c Compute SC7180 in for the MediaTek Kompanio 1380, a new processor that also comes with eight cores. And like all Spin models, you can bend back the screen to use the Chromebook as a tablet or stand it up on a flat surface in a tent-like position when watching videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="37JWQy"&gt;However, there is a bit of a tradeoff with this new model — instead of the 13.5 hours of battery life that the previous Spin 513 got, the new 513 will last just 10 hours on a full charge, a pretty significant downgrade. The Spin 513 will go on sale for $599.99.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LyKrpNCDd0hvkBvGMWz4ParHMl8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142110/acer_new_315.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image by Acer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Acer 315 has a large 15.6-inch display.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RvKr7m"&gt;The new Chromebook 315, which was &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.acer.com%2Fac%2Fen%2FUS%2Fpress%2F2019%2F479116&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F3%2F22864952%2Facer-chromebook-spin-chrome-os-ces-2022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first released in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, came with an AMD A-series processor and an impressive 15.6-inch display. The device was touted as one of the first Chromebooks to come with AMD silicon, but that changes with this newly announced Intel-based 315. It can either come with the Intel Celeron dual-core N4500, Celeron quad-core N5100, or the Pentium Silver N600. The device also sports an OceanGlass touchpad, which Acer says is made with recycled plastic to achieve a “glass-like texture,” in addition to a wide-field-of-view HDR webcam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4jIVX0"&gt;That’s about the extent of major changes that comes with this new model, as it has a large 15.6-inch anti-glare display and 10 hours of battery life, just like its predecessor. The Chromebook 315 will cost $299.99 upon release.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k7DkuWdfbDQmZkkac-Y5Mladx_E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142106/acer_new_314.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image by Acer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Acer 314 Chromebook comes with a 14-inch touchscreen display.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cp9DFz"&gt;Acer’s new 314 Chromebook comes with the same $299.99 price tag as the 315 but has a 14-inch anti-glare touchscreen display. It also comes with the same options for Intel-based processors, OceanGlass touchpad, and has 10 hours of battery life. Additionally, it has two built-in microphones with noise-reduction technology, along with a webcam that’s supposed to help reduce distracting lighting issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hXSuDK"&gt;While Acer’s new Chromebooks will arrive in North America in June of this year, they’ll become available in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa in April.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>L’Oreal’s newest gadget takes the mess out of coloring your hair</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The ColorSonic resting on a bathroom counter" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vsr1BKm9Fcmfl_qOYc-Y-Er1P9o=/0x0:6240x4160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70342356/DSCF1306.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The L’Oreal ColorSonic is meant to make at-home hair coloring more convenient.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: L’Oreal&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vQHFaa"&gt;While you might not expect it, L’Oreal has been a regular at CES these past few years, launching everything from wearable &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/1/7/16861722/loreal-uv-sensor-nail-sticker-nfc-announced-ces-2018"&gt;UV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/6/18168205/loreal-my-skin-track-ph-sensor-measure-wearable-skincare-ces-2019"&gt;pH&lt;/a&gt; sensors to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/5/21051109/loreal-perso-ces-2020-gadget-lipstick-foundation-skincare-makeup-beauty-influencers"&gt;an AI-powered skin care gadget&lt;/a&gt;. This year, the company is back with yet another invention, the Colorsonic — a device meant to make dying your hair at home a hell of a lot more convenient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="05wEvP"&gt;The Colorsonic doesn’t look too far off from other hair styling gadgets. The top half has a nozzle with bristles, while the bottom half stores a cartridge containing a “precise mix of developer and formula.” The device works by dispensing the correct amount of hair color and then the bristles oscillate over 300 times a minute at a specific angle to evenly apply the color. Basically, the idea behind the device is you could simply turn it on, brush it through your hair, and get perfect color. (Though L’Oreal says those with darker hair colors will still need to bleach beforehand; the Colorsonic only handles the coloration process.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W1wa1g"&gt;If you’ve never given into the urge to dye your own hair, let’s just say there’s a reason colorists exist. Speaking from experience, it’s a messy process that can leave you with patchy hair color and stubborn stains all over your bathroom. Meanwhile, getting it done at the salon can easily end up costing hundreds of dollars. If the Colorsonic can deliver on the promise of easy at-home hair dying, that’s a big step forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rmj2lM"&gt;“It’s almost been the same for over a century,” says Guive Balooch, global vice president of L’Oreal’s Technology Incubator, referring to the history of hair dye. While L’Oreal is currently the largest cosmetics company in the world, it got its start when the founder developed the first commercial chemical hair dye. However, the process hasn’t changed a whole lot since then.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A breakdown of the Colorsonic’s different components, including the cartridge." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zHh2Tb29hJldbkrZzHXfZNyKM-k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23123321/DSCF1385.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Colorsonic comprises specialized bristles and a replaceable hair color cartridge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iKsPFV"&gt;According to Balooch, the Colorsonic has been several years in the making — with four to five of those spent on making the oxidative formula compatible with the device itself. Balooch says the Colorsonic was tested on over 400 people in the US and internationally, all with different hair types and lengths. The device also won’t be limited in color choices and the plan is to include “daring” colors as well, with more being added over time. As an added bonus, L’Oreal says each cartridge uses 54 percent less plastic than typical at-home dye kits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-eIC0nUmzZ10olo0ku5wUxV4yuY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23135091/Coloright_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: L’Oreal&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Coloright system is already in some salons in France.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yJpXGO"&gt;While that’s the consumer side of things, L’Oreal is also planning on adding a new Coloright system to salons. The Coloright system looks like a high-tech booth and includes a virtual try-on for 1,500 shades, as well as a hair assessment where you can measure the color of your hair and its porosity. Salon-goers would then be able to create a profile within the Coloright system so they can then get the right hair color at any participating salon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H7anrC"&gt;“The salon is about not having to be afraid when I move to the U.S. from France and I want my hair color to be the right mix,” Balooch says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VYH1Qj"&gt;As for when the Colorsonic and Coloright will be available, L’Oreal typically announces its products a year in advance. Coloright is already in some salons in France and is planned to have a full-scale launch toward the end of 2022 or early 2023. Meanwhile, Colorsonic will launch under the L’Oreal Paris brand. Pricing is still in the works, and cartridges will be sold separately. However, Balooch says it will be an “accessible product, something you could buy at a Target.” It’ll first launch in smaller test batches at the end of 2022, with a large-scale launch in early 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eajCEJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Comcast’s new router includes Wi-Fi 6E, Zigbee, and Matter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cwyXvp-xTCvsds7Jxfr70D4ktio=/0x0:2109x1406/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70342348/comcast_wifi_6e_gateway_press.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Comcast&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dUKkZo"&gt;Comcast has announced that its xFi Advanced Gateway Wi-Fi router is getting an upgrade — the new version will support the Wi-Fi 6E standard and have support for the Zigbee and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22832127/matter-smart-home-products-thread-wifi-explainer"&gt;Matter&lt;/a&gt; IoT standards built in. Comcast says that the addition of a third, 6GHz band alongside the 2.4 and 5GHz bands found on its old gateway (and most modern, decent routers) should make the router ready for homes with dozens of wireless devices, including ones that use lots of bandwidth like VR headsets and gaming consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="krne1A"&gt;The selling point of the new (in terms of wireless standards, anyway) Wi-Fi 6E is that it can provide more bandwidth to power more devices, all with less potential for interference from other networks. Support for this standard should, according to Comcast, make its new xFi Advanced Gateway faster and more reliable than the older version that was available to its customers who subscribe to its higher-speed plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="7ofsxg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Wi-Fi 6E Explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231623/6ghz-wifi-6e-explained-speed-availability-fcc-approval"},{"title":"What matters about Matter, the new smart home standard","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22832127/matter-smart-home-products-thread-wifi-explainer"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="7gxmOa"&gt;Comcast also says that its updated router will be able to handle faster internet speeds like the ones it offers with its Gigabit Pro plan (which can, somewhat confusingly, get &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/cable-tech/comcasts-gigabit-pro-service-accelerates-to-3-gig/d/d-id/773169"&gt;up to 3 gigabits per second in some locations&lt;/a&gt;). While Wi-Fi 6E doesn’t have a higher max speed than Wi-Fi 6, older routers with slower processors can struggle to handle the data throughput of newer plans — Comcast says that shouldn’t happen with its new Advanced Gateway, as it can “deliver multigigabit upload and download speeds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hLBZAL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Renting a router from your ISP has often been a bad deal&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cDD7iR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://clark.com/internet/buying-renting-modem-internet-bill/"&gt;Traditional wisdom&lt;/a&gt; says that renting equipment from your ISP is a bad deal — usually you’ll end up paying more after a year or two than you would’ve had you bought your own modem and router. But if you’re looking to get into Wi-Fi 6E right now, the router alone may &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22203382/netgear-nighthawk-raxe500-wifi-6e-5g-moden-wireless-router-price-release-date"&gt;cost you hundreds&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22716979/netgear-orbi-quad-band-wi-fi-6e-mesh-router-release-date-specs-price"&gt;even thousands&lt;/a&gt;) of dollars, compared to the two or three hundred dollars required to get a great Wi-Fi 5 setup. With that kind of outlay required, the leasing model may be more attractive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FMo2Xm"&gt;Comcast says that customers will start getting the new routers “over the coming months,” with people who pay for Gigabit internet or its xFi complete package getting it first. The company says the monthly cost to lease the new Advanced Gateway will continue to be $14 a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7LmKND"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Comcast is an investor in Vox Media, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; parent company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mercedes-Benz unveils sporty, ultra-long-range Vision EQXX electric concept car</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_On93hC2neOim-7ktYWA43U1gD8=/388x0:4575x2791/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70342350/2021_12_07_Image_22C0001_150.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The German automaker claims improved aerodynamics and battery efficiency allows for 1,000 km of range&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="XzlZBQ"&gt;Mercedes-Benz is the latest automaker to make a grab for the title of the longest-range electric vehicle with the reveal of the Vision EQXX, a solar-powered concept car capable of exceeding 1,000 kilometers (648 miles) on a single charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z6H9cu"&gt;That’s enough to get the Vision EQXX from New York City to Cincinnati, or Berlin to Paris, or Bejing to Nanjing, on a single charge. And it’s impressive in contrast to other long-range EVs currently on the road today, like the Lucid Air (520 miles) and Tesla Model S Long Range Plus (402 miles). But unlike those vehicles, the Vision EQXX is just a concept with no concrete production plans. (For now.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="OCL3mq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;sporty intentions and a sleek, futuristic design&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tHC7Az"&gt;Mercedes, which has been teasing the vehicle for several weeks, finally unveiled it (virtually) at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. (Like most of the major companies, Mercedes canceled its plans to attend CES in person amid a rise in COVID-19 cases.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D2RlCB"&gt;With its sporty intentions and sleek, futuristic design, the Vision EQXX will likely serve as the basis for a production car that could end up rivaling other luxury EVs like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/27/20983836/porsche-taycan-turbo-electric-car-first-drive-hands-on-photos-video-range"&gt;Porsche Taycan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22798695/audi-rs-etron-gt-review-ev-specs-price"&gt;Audi E-tron GT&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/17/16669024/tesla-roadster-2017-fastest-car-world"&gt;Tesla Roadster&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A0OYYYxySkkzlCV5pKHnR5Hhx1o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23141853/2021_12_07_Image_22C0001_151.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8bymLJGMGIgHJJVmHnKaDQ9Oa54=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23141854/2021_12_07_Image_22C0001_154.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jvEyVd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21054257/mercedes-benz-avatar-avtr-concept-ces-2020"&gt;Unlike other Mercedes concepts&lt;/a&gt;, the Vision EQXX is supposed to be more grounded in reality. The company says it based its range estimates on a simulation of real-life traffic conditions, fueling claims that it will consume energy at a rate of 10kWh per 100 kilometers, or more than 6 miles per kWh. Translated into fossil-fuel consumption terms, this is around the “golden figure” of 235 miles-per-gallon in the US, or 1 liter of gasoline per 100 kilometers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eBV65f"&gt;To put this into perspective, Mercedes notes that 10kWh is the equivalent of using a tumble dryer or an air conditioning unit for three hours or watching 50 hours of television on a 50-inch LED screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iZEJZ1"&gt;But despite these simulations and estimates, Mercedes says the Vision EQXX’s superior range is “completely realistic” and that many of its technological advancements will be integrated into future production vehicles through the Mercedes-Benz Modular Architecture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="QI6Yfj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The result is an efficiency masterpiece”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6G6S9T"&gt;Mercedes says it achieved this energy efficiency not by cramming an oversized battery under the floor of the vehicle but by “pull[ing] out all the stops in drivetrain efficiency, energy density, aerodynamics, and lightweight design... The result is an efficiency masterpiece.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bGA5ec"&gt;Lightweight is certainly one way to describe a vehicle with a gross weight of 1,750 kg (3,858 lbs), putting it more in the category of compact SUVs than sports cars. Most of that weight is probably in the battery pack, which holds nearly 100 kWh of energy but also registers 50 percent less volume and 30 percent less mass than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/11/22375877/mercedes-benz-eqs-ev-s-class-specs-hands-on"&gt;Mercedes-Benz EQS sedan&lt;/a&gt;. The slippery teardrop shape is meant to reduce aerodynamic drag, with Mercedes claiming a “benchmark” coefficient of 0.17 based on a 140km/h wind tunnel test — an improvement over the EQS’ record-setting 0.20 drag coefficient. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eLyFpi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10959025"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NF689z"&gt;Of course, a range estimate is just that: an estimate. It will be up to the Environmental Protection Agency in the US, as well as Europe’s Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP), to certify any EV range independently. Most electric vehicles on the market today have a range that falls between 200-300 miles, while some earlier models have less than that. The latest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20857217/volkswagen-vw-id3-electric-price-specs-mile-range-frankfurt-motor-show-2019"&gt;crop&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357717/cadillac-lyriq-gm-ev-suv-touchscreen-size-specs-release-date"&gt;of EVs&lt;/a&gt; has ranges of 250-300 miles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jwfdvh"&gt;Of course, EV range is highly subjective. Even the EPA’s rating system is only meant to present a snapshot under the specific conditions of the agency’s testing process. It typically excludes factors such as steep hill climbing and the effects of cold weather, which can wear down a vehicle’s battery much faster than when driving on flat surfaces or in warmer weather. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="autbd4"&gt;The Vision EQXX will get some help from the 117 solar cells installed in the vehicle’s roof. Developed in collaboration with &lt;a href="https://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/en.html"&gt;Europe’s largest solar energy research institute&lt;/a&gt;, the solar roof is meant to offset the energy drain on the high-voltage system while also increasing the range. According to Mercedes, the solar cells can add up to 25 km of range on long-distance journeys under ideal conditions in a single day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iwDsbOsw-efko-9Wy3DZiQnLtV8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23141771/2021_12_21_Image_22C0001_061.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g9OaE7"&gt;For now, we’ll have to take their word. Using solar cells to power an electric vehicle is no small feat. There’s a huge disparity between the amount of solar energy that the best cells can capture and what’s needed to make a two-ton vehicle move at speed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TtaaW6"&gt;But Mercedes isn’t the only company trying to make it happen. Aptera — a California startup that crashed in the aftermath of the Great Recession — was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22358355/aptera-ev-three-wheeled-doe-atvm-loan-program"&gt;recently resurrected&lt;/a&gt;. German startup Sono Motors is also working on &lt;a href="https://sonomotors.com/en/sion/"&gt;a solar-powered electric car&lt;/a&gt;. And Dutch startup Lightyear &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585483/lightyear-one-valmet-automotive-production-date-solar-car"&gt;recently found a manufacturing partner&lt;/a&gt; to build its solar-powered electric car, the Lightyear One.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="2a0khz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The interior of the Vision EQXX features a massive 47.5-inch screen&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IuJZRN"&gt;The interior of the Vision EQXX features a massive 47.5-inch screen that stretches the full width of the vehicle, a nod to the company’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22217267/mercedes-benz-hyperscreen-size-specs-eqs-ces-2021"&gt;Hyperscreen infotainment display&lt;/a&gt;. But unlike the Hyperscreen, which is an amalgam of three separate screens set inside one solid, 56-inch piece of glass, the Vision EQXX’s screen is a one-piece display that will also feature 8K resolution and cutting edge graphics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rT9LKE"&gt;Mercedes says it’s working with a company called NAVIS Automotive Systems to develop “the first realtime 3D navigation system” on a screen of this size. This novel navigation system will enable “seamless zoom and scroll functions from satellite view down to a height of 10 meters in the 3D city representation,” the company says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7CmzE1"&gt;Like most of its competitors, Mercedes is barreling toward an all-electric future at full speed. The company says it will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588587/mercedes-benz-electric-ev-2030-caveat"&gt;commit €40 billion ($47 billion) to the electrification of its lineup by 2030&lt;/a&gt;, including electric versions of Mercedes-Benz’s G-class wagons and AMG high-performance vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="InZhn6"&gt;These announcements come as most major countries push to restrict the sale of internal combustion engine vehicles in the coming decades. The European Union, China, and California have all said they would ban the sale of internal combustion engine vehicles by 2035.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UGMYQs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 11:55AM ET, January 3rd:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; GameStop has sold out of this Xbox Series X bundle for now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LfYRnO"&gt;We’re off and running in the year 2022 with new console restocks. While we’re all hoping that availability of the popular PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles opens up so anyone can buy a console at retail price whenever they choose, for now we have to keep our eyes peeled, remain vigilant, and keep our F5 keys ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QfRm83"&gt;While GameStop finished off 2021 with a series of scheduled in-store selling events for new consoles — giving us a throwback to the old days of lining up outside of stores in person — the video game retailer now has Xbox Series X consoles available on its site to order. You can pick up an &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergeconsolerestock010321&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fxbox-series-x%257Cs%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fxbox-series-x-ultimate-games-and-system-bundle-with-50-gamestop-gift-card%2FB224745Q.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X bundle&lt;/a&gt;, complete with &lt;em&gt;Far Cry 6&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;NBA 2K22&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty Vanguard&lt;/em&gt;, and a $50 GameStop gift card for $669.96.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MNfqvK"&gt;GameStop’s new console bundles are usually limited to &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergeconsolerestock010321&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fpoweruprewards%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop Pro subscribers&lt;/a&gt;, though this one is open to everyone. Remember that patience and persistence are often key with these console restocks. Don’t stop trying until it shows sold out. Though if luck is not on your side for this one, or if you don’t prefer a bundle, we’ll be sure to keep you updated on future console restocks at GameStop and other retailers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ring Fit Adventure for Nintendo Switch is back down to its lowest price</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k2v1-e1krbsyoHH_Gmhk0RK4egk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70341795/akrales_191008_3706_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GPw13g"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ring Fit Adventure&lt;/em&gt;, the box set for the Nintendo Switch that includes the fitness adventure game along with a pilates ring that a Joy-Con slides into, is selling for just $54.99 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cglfOk2zqUH" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XV4NHHN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, matching the best price we’ve seen. It’s normally $85. Actually, it’s been selling for this price since Black Friday, but if your New Year’s resolutions include getting in shape, this game is a fun, effective way to stay moving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TPP9DP"&gt;The single-player campaign is actually a turn-based RPG where you fight against enemies by doing exercise reps. It tracks your form, making sure you don’t go too easy on yourself, though you can set the difficulty. Considering it’s a workout, it’s actually pretty fun. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/17/20917908/nintendo-switch-ring-fit-adventure-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A3coVY"&gt;This game was in short supply and high demand earlier in the pandemic, and remarkably, prices soared over $250 — almost as much as the Nintendo Switch itself. But now, you can purchase it at a very reasonable price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="t0D262"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10273326"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Amazon Music" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0YzNhqizOU8PmJ_TzMFZpDmCJuw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23141652/amazonmusic.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dtPdAX"&gt;Listeners who haven’t used Amazon Music Free before can get $5 of Amazon credit added to their accounts just by listening to one full track. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b/ref=hva_amf_gw_DeskGWcard_US_E_V2_1222?node=23681795011" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;That’s the deal&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon says you will be emailed your code within one week of your first stream, and it can be redeemed for up to 30 days on an Amazon purchase of $20 or more. Here’s &lt;a href="https://music.amazon.com/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;ref_=sv_dmusic_8" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a link to the web player&lt;/a&gt;, so you can stream a song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kW6NlI"&gt;Clearly, Amazon wants people to try out the free tier of its music streaming service, but whether you have an alliance with Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, or some other service, it can’t hurt to give this a try.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ilkcKU"&gt;If you’ve considered picking up an M.2 SSD that meets Sony’s PS5 requirements (it needs to support PCIe 4.0 and have a sequential read speed of 5,500MB/s or faster), this 1TB Western Digital WD_Black SN850 model makes the grade — and for a great price. Normally $269.99, it’s &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cglgdnZIRZ8" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$189.99 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. This WD_Black drive gets the nod over most other models because it already comes with a heatsink installed, which is another requirement for putting an M.2 SSD in your PS5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X74T8V"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cglf9t8c6r9" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;For another $10 (totaling $199.99)&lt;/a&gt;, you can get Samsung’s 1TB 980 Pro with a heatsink installed at Best Buy. It offers similarly fast performance (both drives claim up to 7,000MB/s sequential read speeds), though the WD_Black actually claims to be able to write a &lt;em&gt;little &lt;/em&gt;faster at up to 5,300MB/s compared to the 980 Pro’s 5,000MB/s write speed. Though, most people probably won’t notice a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;

Or maybe you have something you know you can’t live without. Either way, Apple’s AirTag tracker might be one of the best ways to keep tabs on your tech, bags, wallets, what have you. Best Buy is offering a rare deal on a single AirTag for today only. Usually deals are offered on multipacks, not just one, so this could be good for people who want to dip a toe into AirTags. Normally $29, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cglgivFu4uQ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can grab one for $24&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="fExKJh"&gt;Apple’s HomePod mini smart speaker (usually $99) includes a three-pack of Nanoleaf A19 smart bulbs that support Thread and Bluetooth &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cglgqpPv0sI" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $139.98&lt;/a&gt;. They’re also Apple HomeKit-compatible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="O8hequ"&gt;LG’s A1 OLED TV may not offer the same set of gaming-centric features or perform at the same level as LG’s C1 model, but if you’re looking for a budget-friendly OLED with deep black levels and great color accuracy, you can pick up the A1 in the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F164937252697&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F1%2F3%2F22864758%2Fring-fit-adventure-nintendo-switch-apple-airtag-amazon-music-ps5-ssd-samsung-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;48-inch configuration at eBay right now for $719.94&lt;/a&gt; with coupon code &lt;strong&gt;NY15OFF&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="umAaEN"&gt;Google’s second-gen Nest Hub smart display that makes for an excellent digital photo frame (and can also track your sleep via its Soli radar sensor) &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cglgqV6ZQnw" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is just $59.99 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. It normally costs $99.99. We’ve seen this discount a handful of times, but now might be the perfect time for you to invest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3GhUCU"&gt;A three-pack of Philips Hue A19 bulbs is currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08D9N7RJ4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon for $80.99&lt;/a&gt;, nearly matching the best price we’ve seen on the colored smart bulbs to date. The bundle doesn’t include a Hue Bridge — which allows you to connect up to 50 lights and make use of routines, among other features — but it’s a great way to expand your existing Philips Hue setup. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="H8OVLy"&gt;If you want a kooky laptop that’s in the keyboard-in-the-front club, forgoing wrist rests to make room for a &lt;em&gt;second display&lt;/em&gt;, check out Amazon’s deal on the Asus ZenBook Duo 14. Normally $1,299.99 for the model with a 14-inch FHD main screen, Intel’s 11th Gen Core i7-1195G7 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-i7-1195G7-ScreenPad-Celestial-UX482EAR-DB71T/dp/B09F2S96XX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can grab it for $1,169.99&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Eve adds a smart floodlight cam and smart shades to its HomeKit portfolio</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VdBWPEv0fU-g8rTL3LqGnOj0CLc=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70341672/Eve_Outdoorcam_Motiv_Lifestyle_1_RGB.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Eve Outdoor Cam is a smart floodlight camera that works with HomeKit Secure Video.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Eve&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jxvEZW"&gt;Smart home company Eve Systems has announced its first outdoor camera and the availability of its Thread-powered smart shades at CES 2022 this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oF23Mv"&gt;A floodlight camera designed for Apple HomeKit Secure Video, the $250 Eve Outdoor Cam, launches April 5th, 2022 and features 1080p video, a 157-degree field of view, infrared night vision, and infrared motion detection covering 100 degrees at distances of up to 30 feet. The Wi-Fi powered camera joins the &lt;a href="https://www.evehome.com/en-us/eve-cam"&gt;Eve Cam&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s indoor camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="elSas4"&gt;This is just the second HomeKit Secure Video-compatible &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22811985/best-smart-floodlight-security-camera"&gt;smart floodlight camera&lt;/a&gt; to launch; a floodlight camera is an outdoor security camera with motion-activated floodlights attached. The &lt;a href="https://www.netatmo.com/blog/en/security/camera-homekit-video-support/"&gt;Netatmo Outdoor Camera&lt;/a&gt; is the other currently available option (Arlo has a HomeKit floodlight camera, but it doesn’t work with HKSV). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOEYMh"&gt;There are a couple key hardware differences between these two HKSV cameras: The Eve version doesn’t have a siren, which is an option on the Netatmo one. But Eve does offer two-way communication with a built-in microphone and speaker, which the Netatmo does not. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/STxdY6ERZgZdtTCxswbn2ZeGTeU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23132609/Eve_Outdoor_Cam_Solutionshot_wo_Badges.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Eve&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Eve Outdoor Cam is compatible with the Apple Home app and the Eve app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oqg8CH"&gt;The Eve camera is also very small — just 6.7 inches high, 2.6 inches wide, and 6.3 inches deep. That’s smaller than the Netatmo, although they both share a similar aesthetic, ditching the traditional “googly” eyed look of floodlight cams (where the two lights are separate from the camera) in favor of a sleeker, more streamlined design with one built-in, high-powered light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Av94pG"&gt;The disadvantage of this is you have less flexibility with positioning the floodlights. But Eve’s CEO Jerome Gackel tells The Verge the lights are “super bright,” although the exact lumens haven’t been disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="QVIlFG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"THE BEST FLOODLIGHT CAMERA TO BUY RIGHT NOW ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22811985/best-smart-floodlight-security-camera"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="uutItZ"&gt;The Eve Outdoor Cam must be hardwired to your home’s electrical system, which is pretty standard for most floodlight cameras, and it works over 2.4GHz Wi-Fi. It also requires a connection to a HomeKit home hub (such as an Apple TV or HomePod Mini) to process and store video recordings. The camera uses HomeKit Secure Video to store videos and processes all data locally. Live video isn’t transmitted to the cloud and recordings are encrypted and stored in your iCloud Plus account.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9rEXCl"&gt;With an iCloud Plus account, users get 10 days of video history and the option of smart alerts for people, vehicles, pets, and packages. As a HomeKit camera, the Eve Cam can be accessed through the Home app as well as Eve’s own app. 			&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V7W6J1a6YOWijLfXyhiTHPaqBOc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23132614/EVE_MOTIONBLINDS_Richmond_0100.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Eve&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eve MotionBlinds are smart motors inside Coulisse shades. They work with Apple HomeKit at launch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YVNi6N"&gt;Eve launches first Thread-enabled smart shades&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HcgeTx"&gt;Announced earlier this year, the eagerly anticipated Eve smart MotionBlinds go on sale today, January 3rd, 2022. Pricing varies based on fabric and size but starts at just under $400 per shade. They can be ordered through any Coulisse reseller, including &lt;a href="https://www.selectblinds.com/eve-motionblinds"&gt;selectblinds.com&lt;/a&gt;, and you can install them yourself. Coulisse is a Netherlands-based manufacturer of window coverings, and a complete list of sellers can be found at &lt;a href="http://motionblinds.com/eve"&gt;motionblinds.com/eve&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JQSljo"&gt;The first Thread-powered smart shades (they also use Bluetooth), the Eve MotionBlinds are HomeKit compatible and “Matter-ready,” according to Gackel. As a refresher, Thread is a low-power mesh networking protocol that provides better speed and reliability than many of the current smart home protocols. It’s also a key part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22787729/matter-smart-home-standard-apple-amazon-google"&gt;Matter, the new smart home standard coming in mid-2022&lt;/a&gt;, which aims to unify the smart home under one standard and help remove the confusion around which products work with which smart home platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YOMGsU"&gt;Eve’s MotionBlinds will be available first as smart roller shades, with other styles coming soon. They’re compatible with HomeKit and Siri, Apple’s voice assistant, at launch, but aren’t the only HomeKit smart shades: Lutron, Hunter Douglas, and Ikea all offer HomeKit options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rohROD"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Eve smart MotionBlinds|105402" data-volume-uuid="e4085e58c" data-volume-id="105402" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-503" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This video provided by Eve gives you a good, if glossy, look at what the MotionBlinds should look like in action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jim9pp"&gt;The shades are powered by a rechargeable USB-C battery-powered motor, and uniquely for smart shades, have the option of manual control with a pull cord. There are also on-device schedules, so the shades can work independently of a smartphone app or smart home network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ilMvd8"&gt;As Eve MotionBlinds work through HomeKit, they don’t require a separate bridge or gateway — which most smart window coverings do. However, they will need a HomeKit hub such as a HomePod Mini if you want to set up HomeKit automations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JSXdhb"&gt;Smart shades are some of the most useful additions to a smart home, providing light and climate control plus an undeniable wow factor. But they are also very expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CbDAJO"&gt;Eve’s entry into the space isn’t a game-changer when it comes to price — it looks like the shades will be on par cost-wise with Lutron’s Serena line. However, because they work over the non-proprietary Thread protocol and will be compatible with Matter, these should be easier to integrate into your smart home than most of the existing offerings, which are largely locked into their own ecosystems. That is, once the standard arrives later this year. In the meantime, they are HomeKit only.&lt;/p&gt;
