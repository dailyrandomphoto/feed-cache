    <title>Lyft and Uber to cover legal fees of drivers sued under Texas anti-abortion law</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UU76Ay"&gt;Lyft and Uber are committing to pay legal fees for any driver on their respective platforms who get sued under Texas’ controversial anti-abortion law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Of0sDi"&gt;The new law, which was signed this week by Texas governor Greg Abbott, bans abortions of fetuses after six weeks (which is before many women even know they are pregnant) and offers no exceptions for rape or incest. The law also empowers private citizens across the country to sue anyone for “aiding and abetting” abortions past the six-week mark, including clinics, anyone who pays for the abortion, or even people who drive someone to the procedure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="S26NVA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the law allows people to sue those “aiding and abetting” abortions past six weeks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MPzQts"&gt;“This is an attack on women’s access to healthcare and on their right to choose,” Lyft co-founder and CEO Logan Green tweeted Friday afternoon. Green said Lyft is creating a “driver legal defense fund” to cover 100 percent of legal fees if drivers on its platform get sued under the new law. He said Lyft is also donating $1 million to Planned Parenthood to “ensure that transportation is never a barrier to healthcare access.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UXgI9B"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Right on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/logangreen?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@logangreen&lt;/a&gt; - drivers shouldn’t be put at risk for getting people where they want to go.  Team &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Uber?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Uber&lt;/a&gt; is in too and will cover legal fees in the same way. Thanks for the push. &lt;a href="https://t.co/85LhOUctSc"&gt;https://t.co/85LhOUctSc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— dara khosrowshahi (@dkhos) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dkhos/status/1433894081487273987?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wdaEiI"&gt;Shortly after, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi announced in a tweet that his company would follow suit. “[D]rivers shouldn’t be put at risk for getting people to where they want to go,” he wrote. Uber “will cover legal fees in the same way,” he said, quoting Green’s tweet. “Thanks for the push.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yjdKlO"&gt;The announcements from Uber and Lyft came after Bumble and Match Group (which owns Tinder) announced the creation of &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/bumble-and-match-have-created-a-relief-fund-to-help-cov-1847613072"&gt;a relief fund for women seeking abortions&lt;/a&gt;. Match Group CEO Shar Dubey said in an internal memo obtained by &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/match-ceo-bumble-create-funds-texas-staff-after-strict-abortion-law-2021-09-02/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that the company “generally does not take political stands unless it is relevant to our business. But in this instance, I personally, as a woman in Texas, could not keep silent.” Both companies are headquartered in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H22pfp"&gt;Pressure &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/corporate-americas-response-to-texas-abortion-law-silence"&gt;ramped up on companies that do business in Texas&lt;/a&gt; to act late this week after the Supreme Court’s conservative majority (minus Chief Justice John Roberts) &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/02/us/supreme-court-texas-abortion-law.html"&gt;declined to step in and halt the restrictive law&lt;/a&gt;. But so far corporations have only announced reactive measures like defense funds, despite calls to move their business elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X8dkxG"&gt;It’s also possible that the law could &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/the-texas-abortion-ban-could-force-tech-to-snitch-on-users"&gt;spur an explosion of requests&lt;/a&gt; to tech companies for information on users who may have helped someone get an abortion, Evan Greer, director of the digital rights group Fight for the Future, told &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; this week. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo is reportedly set to bring Game Boy and Game Boy Color games to Switch Online</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Game Boy" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/flaMilZMle2H2DgKDC849kX3e5g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69815271/vpavic_190327_3333_0023.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6zVUOe"&gt;Nintendo may be finally ready to bring its storied handheld gaming library to the Nintendo Switch — Game Boy and Game Boy Color titles will soon join &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443321/nintendo-switch-online-may-2021-retro-games-total-library"&gt;the 100-plus NES and SNES games&lt;/a&gt; that it offers via its Switch Online subscription service, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/yFRi2jd0xMg"&gt;according to rumors&lt;/a&gt; from the “Nate the Hate” podcast, corroborated &lt;a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/09/rumour_nintendo_will_expand_its_switch_online_service_with_game_boy_and_game_boy_color_titles"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;Nintendo Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday and now again on Friday &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-09-03-game-boy-and-game-boy-color-titles-headed-to-nintendo-switch-online"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not every day we see a Nintendo rumor that strong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IxxxZr"&gt;There’s no word on which titles might arrive, and I wouldn’t necessarily expect your favorites to be among them, particularly to start. Nintendo has curated its NES and SNES libraries for Switch very slowly, some of them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22275714/nintendo-switch-online-games-february-2021"&gt;are pretty deep cuts&lt;/a&gt;, and many titles like &lt;em&gt;Earthbound&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Chrono Trigger&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Super Mario RPG&lt;/em&gt; are still MIA &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/4/20848125/super-nintendo-games-snes-switch-online-service-mario-zelda-tomorrow"&gt;two years later&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zUoulh"&gt;But it makes a lot of sense that Nintendo would ramp up more classic content, particularly now that the Switch is well into its life and Nintendo is watching its competitors capitalize on remakes, remasters and next-gen patches that make older games look better and give their new consoles some extra life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CSA4mj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Does this mean a Game Boy Classic Edition isn’t happening?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nvj6bl"&gt;For a while, we were wondering if Nintendo would continue going down the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/3/13507516/nintendo-nes-classic-edition-hands-on-first-impression-how-to"&gt;NES Classic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/9/27/16363696/super-nintendo-snes-classic-edition-review"&gt;SNES Classic&lt;/a&gt; route, releasing cute limited-edition miniature USB versions of its Game Boy or Nintendo 64 with preloaded games on board, too. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/17/18311479/nintendo-game-boy-30th-anniversary-switch-gaming"&gt;the Game Boy’s 30th anniversary&lt;/a&gt; came and went without a miniature Game Boy, and now we’re in the midst of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648372/willy-shih-chip-shortage-tsmc-samsung-ps5-decoder-interview"&gt;a global chip shortage&lt;/a&gt;. I’d love to see more opportunities to let new gamers in on old classics, and not just in terms of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20871958/legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-review-nintendo-switch-updates-graphics"&gt;remakes like &lt;em&gt;Link’s Awakening&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(originally on Game Boy, Game Boy Color). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RdkJRo"&gt;Here’s hoping for Game Boy Advance, too, because folks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22466240/nintendo-metroid-dread-side-scroller-e3-2021-switch"&gt;playing the new &lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; deserve to play its amazing prequel &lt;em&gt;Metroid Fusion&lt;/em&gt;, and some of the best &lt;em&gt;Fire Emblem&lt;/em&gt; games ever made came out there. Oh, and &lt;em&gt;Golden Sun&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt; does say other consoles  beyond Game Boy and Game Boy Color may be “on the cards.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjoss8"&gt;Amusingly, Nintendo offered this official statement: “We have nothing to announce on this topic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ze9Tq"&gt;Which Game Boy and Game Boy Color games are on your shortlist? I’m going with &lt;em&gt;Wario Land&lt;/em&gt; and&lt;em&gt; Pokemon Pinball.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DfZ77e"&gt;Switch Online costs $4 a month, $20 a year, or $35 a year for a family membership.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GoDaddy is cutting off Texas Right to Life’s abortion ‘whistleblowing’ website </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-MEXICO-BORDER" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mzsrsS8Dh7ma-8JqW0CDO3pJ3xQ=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69814931/1233640838.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PUy8f0"&gt;In case you haven’t heard, Texas now has a law that makes it illegal for anyone to help women get an abortion after six weeks of pregnancy — and to take advantage of that, the anti-abortion group Texas Right to Life is encouraging citizens to report those people at a dedicated “whistleblower” website, promising to “ensure that these lawbreakers are held accountable for their actions.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FLQOwQ"&gt;However, it now looks like Texas Right to Life may have trouble keeping a home on the web,  because hosting provider GoDaddy has given the group 24 hours to find a different place to park its website. “We have informed prolifewhistleblower.com they have 24 hours to move to another provider for violating our terms of service,” &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/03/technology/texas-abortion-law-website-tiktok.html"&gt;a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ssajkq"&gt;GoDaddy didn’t answer a question about whether that applies to the group’s other domains, but tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it violated “multiple provisions” of the site’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.godaddy.com%2Flegal%2Fagreements%2Funiversal-terms-of-service-agreement&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F3%2F22656196%2Fgodaddy-texas-right-for-life-abortion-whistleblowing-site" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Terms of Service&lt;/a&gt; including Section 5.2, which reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="uQcvnG"&gt;You will not collect or harvest (or permit anyone else to collect or harvest) any User Content (as defined below) or any non-public or personally identifiable information about another User or any other person or entity without their express prior written consent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="5zw3kD"&gt;The anti-abortion group’s website has been under siege for days now, with angry protesters flooding it with fake tips — including at least one fake claim that Texas governor Greg Abbott himself had violated the law, according to &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;. One activist on TikTok even created a script that can automatically feed fake reports into the website’s tipbox, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3x9ba/tiktok-texas-abortion-law-bot-site-ios-shortcut"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Motherboard &lt;/em&gt;reported yesterday&lt;/a&gt;. He told&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; that the automated tools he’d created had received over 15,000 clicks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Qc5bIa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@black_madness21/video/7000057713975725318" data-video-id="7000057713975725318" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@black_madness21" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@black_madness21"&gt;@black_madness21&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reply to @black_madness21 &lt;a title="texas" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/texas"&gt;#texas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="abortion" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/abortion"&gt;#abortion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="gregabbott" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/gregabbott"&gt;#gregabbott&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Sean Black" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7000057554395007750"&gt;♬ original sound - Sean Black&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zQ1vqM"&gt;But on Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/here-s-how-you-can-help-shut-down-the-vile-website-for-1847557293"&gt;Gizmodo’s Shoshana Wodinsky suggested another way for activists to protest&lt;/a&gt;: blowing the whistle on Texas Right to Life itself, by complaining to GoDaddy about what it was doing. That’s what appears to have happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6bxPLM"&gt;It’s not the first time web hosting providers or even GoDaddy specifically have played this role: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/28/18036520/gab-down-godaddy-domain-blocked"&gt;Gab.com had to find a new home in October 2018&lt;/a&gt;, and GoDaddy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/4/17320086/godaddy-domain-registrar-richard-spencer-altright-com-offline"&gt;took down white nationalist Richard Spencer’s Altright.com&lt;/a&gt; that May. Neo-nazi news site the Daily Stormer was similarly given 24 hours by GoDaddy to find a new home &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/14/16142384/daily-stormer-site-go-daddy-hosting-providers-hackers-anonymous"&gt;in August 2017&lt;/a&gt;, and wound up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/15/16150668/daily-stormer-alt-right-dark-web-site-godaddy-google-ban"&gt;moving to the dark web&lt;/a&gt; instead. Gab was able to return, though, and it’s possible Texas Right to Life will find a solution as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="mUtk1j"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why the alt-right can’t build an alt-internet","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/21/16180614/charlottesville-daily-stormer-alt-right-internet-domain"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="tkF776"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 4:36PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added additional context from GoDaddy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AI computers can’t patent their own inventions — yet — a US judge rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xoNtwwJIp7t8hXD3pG0gLq2x8sM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69814568/jbareham_170215_1460_0001_v2_5_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CeKVWH"&gt;Should an artificially intelligent machine be able to patent its own inventions? For a US federal judge, the larger implications of that question were irrelevant. In April 2020, the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21241251/artificial-intelligence-inventor-united-states-patent-trademark-office-intellectual-property"&gt;ruled that only “natural persons” could be credited as the inventor of a patent&lt;/a&gt;, and a US court decided Thursday that yes, that’s what the law technically says (via &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-03/only-humans-not-ai-machines-can-get-a-u-s-patent-judge-rules?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0vKG9L"&gt;Not every country agrees with that direction. &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-08-01/historic-decision-allows-ai-to-be-recognised-as-an-inventor/100339264"&gt;South Africa and Australia decided to go the other direction&lt;/a&gt;, granting one patent and reinstating a second patent application filed by AI researcher Steven Thaler, whose AI system DABUS reportedly came up with a flashing light and a new type of food container. Thaler is the one who sued the US in this case as well — he’s part of a group called &lt;a href="https://artificialinventor.com/"&gt;The Artificial Inventor Project&lt;/a&gt; that’s lobbying for AI recognition around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4DS52N"&gt;You can read the US’s whole decision against Thaler for yourself at the bottom of this post, but it’s pretty simple when you boil it down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="anH6Tz"&gt;The US Patent Act says inventors an inventor must be an “individual” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2puwAz"&gt;Previous legal decisions have clarified that “individuals” have to be people (not, say, companies)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IP55o0"&gt;It’s also pretty clear from context that the Patent Act was referring to people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1wBUNo"&gt;AI systems are not people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="IxEMyP"&gt;Oh, and the court says it can only overrule a US agency’s decision if it’s arbitrary, capricious, or obviously illegal — but in this case, the USPTO already laid out its entire reasoning why it plans to stick to the status quo last April. It also asked for public comment in 2019, before it made its ruling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KUW9H5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The USPTO wants to know if artificial intelligence can own the content it creates","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20961788/us-government-ai-copyright-patent-trademark-office-notice-artificial-intelligence"},{"title":"We’ve been warned about AI and music for over 50 years, but no one’s prepared","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/17/18299563/ai-algorithm-music-law-copyright-human"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="QVnR3i"&gt;As to the bigger question, US District Judge Leonie Brinkema had this to say:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New study will show misinformation on Facebook gets way more engagement than news</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y8CUZT2nMOceo5lEkm6Wg98zug8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69814562/jbareham_180405_1777_facebook_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hNgJ4N"&gt;A new peer-reviewed study from researchers at New York University and the Université Grenoble Alpes in France will show that misinformation got six times as much engagement on Facebook as real news, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/09/03/facebook-misinformation-nyu-study/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ngaUW"&gt;The study looked at posts from the Facebook pages of more than 2,500 news publishers between August 2020 and January 2021. Researchers found that the pages that post more misinformation regularly got more likes, shares, and comments. This increased engagement was seen across the political spectrum, but the study found that “publishers on the right have a much higher propensity to share misleading information than publishers in other political categories,” according to &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0baJBv"&gt;The researchers will share the study as part of the 2021 Internet Measurement Conference in November. But it could be released prior to that, researcher Laura Edelson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bEK1qx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook maintains that only looking at engagement doesn’t tell the whole story&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iS21ga"&gt;A Facebook spokesperson pointed out to the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; that the study only looks at engagement, and not “reach” — which is the term the company uses to describe how many people see a piece of content on Facebook, regardless of whether they interact with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6gKYvI"&gt;Facebook does not make reach data available to researchers, though. Instead, they and others who want to understand and quantify the social media platform’s misinformation problem — including these researchers — have often turned to a tool called CrowdTangle, which is owned by Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u9uaK2"&gt;But in August, Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609020/facebook-bans-academic-researchers-ad-transparency-misinformation-nyu-ad-observatory-plug-in"&gt;cut off this group of researchers’ access to this data&lt;/a&gt; (as well as to the library of political ads on the platform). Facebook said that continuing to give third-party researchers access to the data could violate a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission that it entered into following the Cambridge Analytica scandal — a claim &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612545/facebook-banned-third-party-researchers-inaccurate-says-ftc"&gt;the FTC said was “inaccurate.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YrpdiQ"&gt;CrowdTangle is the tool that &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;tech columnist Kevin Roose used to make regular lists of posts that got the most engagement on Facebook — a practice that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/7/22/21332774/facebook-crowdtangle-kevin-roose-nyt-tweets-interactions-reach-engagement"&gt;reportedly riled up top employees inside the company&lt;/a&gt;, because the lists were regularly dominated by right-wing pages that post a lot of misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wPDC6U"&gt;In an effort to bat down claims that misinformation is a problem on Facebook, the company released a “transparency report” in August that laid out the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630813/facebook-report-most-viewed-content-links-news-feed-transparancy"&gt;most-viewed posts on the platform during the second quarter of the year&lt;/a&gt;, from April to June. Just days later, though, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; revealed that Facebook had first scrapped plans to release a report about the first quarter because the most-viewed post between January and March was an article that wrongly linked the coronavirus vaccine to a Florida doctor’s death — a post that was used by many right-wing pages to sow doubt about the efficacy of the vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>BMW’s new CE 02 mini-bike concept is electric</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T6iUDTLMhoEyeD5hBfZw6OOT6vs=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69814322/P90434022_highRes_bmw_motorrad_concept.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: BMW Motorrad&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nuveHZ"&gt;BMW’s Motorrad division has been pumping out some &lt;a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0320189EN/bmw-motorrad-definition-ce-04-the-new-style-of-urban-two-wheel-mobility"&gt;wild&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/26/18759611/bmw-electric-motorcycle-concept-motorrad-vision-roadster"&gt;concepts&lt;/a&gt; over the last few years as the larger company turns its attention towards electric vehicles. It’s latest is also the to date, but still looks extremely cool: the &lt;a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0341092EN/bmw-motorrad-concept-ce-02"&gt;CE 02 mini-bike&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3yQFG4"&gt;Debuted this week ahead of the IAA Mobility conference in Germany, the CE 02 is a tiny two-wheeler that borrows some of the futuristic vibes BMW has been honing for its larger concept bikes — including the CE 04, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22566683/bmw-ce-04-electric-city-scooter-futuristic-design-motorrad"&gt;which is actually going into production&lt;/a&gt;. Clad in silver and black and “technoid typography,” the minimalist design looks like it came right off the set of a sci-fi movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aE2QhO"&gt;The CE 02 has an 11kW belt-drive motor, which can help the bike reach a top speed of around 90 kilometers per hour (about 56 miles per hour). BMW isn’t sharing the battery capacity, but claims the CE 02 can go about 90 kilometers on a full charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="svsquo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10733772"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0h5okZ"&gt;There are no pedals, but BMW says there will be footrests — though in the photos, the only footrest that anyone is using is a skateboard clipped to the underside of the bike. (Hey, it’s a concept!) A circular LED headlight lights the way, while a small display between the handlebars serves up the basic information like speed and battery status. “Otherwise, the technology is deliberately restrained,” BMW says. The whole package weighs 120 kilograms (about 265 pounds). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MghXlU"&gt;There’s no shortage of slick-looking electric mopeds and mini-bikes these days — Super73 has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22278760/super73-ebike-moped-minibike-investment-amount"&gt;raised millions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; on the idea alone — but BMW’s CE 02 could probably find some success if the company decides to make it. It’s got the looks, and it sounds plenty capable enough for cruising through a city. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BbBA1I"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best webcam to buy right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AnqSrYL5kIHHyJCAETZFnJ5jFWM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69814175/akrales_210831_4734_0040.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Some standout options for multiple budgets&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Y2YM1c"&gt;If you don’t already have a laptop with a built-in webcam — or the one on your laptop isn’t very good — you might need a standalone webcam. Maybe it’s to be able to show your face during work or school. Maybe it’s for chatting with friends, or for side projects, like live streaming or recording yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jrBM2l"&gt;If you don’t want to actually purchase a webcam, there are several routes to take. You can get crafty with your phone (and spend hardly anything or nothing at all) by using &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21281765/webcam-phone-tablet-android-ios-pc-mac-how-to"&gt;an app that’ll fool your computer into thinking it’s a webcam&lt;/a&gt;. Or you can go in the total opposite direction and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21523161/phone-camera-webcam-how-to-iphone-android-dslr"&gt;connect a pricey DSLR or mirrorless camera to your computer&lt;/a&gt; to use as a webcam — a very good one, at that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="599LPF"&gt;But assuming you simply want to purchase a webcam, our goal is to make it easier for you to find the one that matches your needs and your budget. Here, I aim to decipher which USB webcams are worth your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PBTZqs"&gt;We tested popular models from brands like Logitech, Microsoft, Dell, Razer, Elgato, and more. Once the dust settled, we landed on a semi-affordable webcam that we think is the best option for most people. That’s the Logitech C920S Pro HD, which usually costs about $60. It supports 1080p resolution capture at 30 frames per second, and the visual quality is satisfactory in most lighting conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UX8PIq"&gt;If you have some extra cash along with a desire for better video quality and more features, check out Logitech’s StreamCam. It also supports 1080p resolution, but with a faster 60 frames per second capture. This model is loaded with clever features, like an optional mode that can automatically follow your face around the frame. It also ships with versatile mounts, one for your monitor, and another for a tripod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KjCOUJ"&gt;Each camera’s video quality was judged by using it with Zoom (where footage is prone to compression, as it is with other web-based video calling apps), as well as with OBS Studio or VLC to see how it compares with a locally-stored recording. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Logitech C920S Pro HD" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oq6w_fn8r2h5nt8UsnLMp8XGhe0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22820369/akrales_210831_4734_0071.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0UZo0O"&gt;Logitech C920S Pro HD&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="HMMN3w"&gt;The best webcam for most people &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Ta46G2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Works with: Windows, Mac, Linux, Chromebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EamdYO"&gt;Usually priced around $60, Logitech’s C920S Pro HD provides better video and mic quality than others that I tested in this price range. This model can record in 1080p resolution at up to 30 frames per second, and while you won’t have an issue finding other similarly-priced webcams with those specs, the C920S Pro’s out-of-box color balance, exposure, and relatively fast auto-focus made it stand out from others I tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="06NWy7"&gt;The picture quality has sufficient detail, and even in my relatively dark apartment, the C920S Pro had no trouble making my facial features look sharp. But it wasn’t a flawless presentation overall, as is to be expected for the price. In less-than-ideal lighting scenarios, the C920S Pro made my skin look over-saturated, with red spots where the webcam couldn’t compensate for the lack of lighting. Though in a work or play environment flush with natural light, this was noticeably less of an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AQpq4s"&gt;Picture quality aside, the C920S Pro has several welcome features, like a generous 78-degree field of view, status lights that activate when the webcam is being used by an application, and an included privacy shutter that can give you assurance that you’re not broadcasting unless you want to be. Some other nice features at this price include its strong articulating stand, which can sit atop your monitor or just as easily screw into a tripod. It’s just a great value for the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ai4Ksm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10730538"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="M8JI8o"&gt;Other webcam options you might like for under $100&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Microsoft Modern Webcam" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vbDixIE4MNptXeWGqq88TlPL1zs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22820368/akrales_210831_4734_0069.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1XjelV"&gt;Microsoft Modern Webcam&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1XE3Yk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Works with: Windows 10, and in a more limited fashion, macOS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jdNNIx"&gt;Like the Logitech C920S Pro, the Modern Webcam promises 1080p resolution recording at up to 30 frames per second. Compared directly to the Logitech, Microsoft’s webcam didn’t produce as sharp of an image. It was, however, able to produce a more true-to-life look for my lighting scenario thanks to its HDR setting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xajEUQ"&gt;HDR has some benefits, but it might also come with a few cons depending on your lighting. While the Modern Webcam did an admirable job of taming the pretty intense backlight that I have behind me during the day, it didn’t seem to have many tricks to make me look my best in other ways (at least without tweaking the picture with the Microsoft Accessory Center app). Through the lens of the Modern Webcam, I looked like I work in a dimly-lit basement apartment — which I do, but I’d rather not be reminded of that fact. As with the C920S Pro, this should be less of a problem for people who have no shortage of natural light in their room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="owpuJl"&gt;I appreciate that the Modern Webcam’s stand lets you hang it over a monitor, or screw it into a tripod. And it gets bonus points for having a physical privacy slider. This webcam also has a built-in microphone, but it strangely isn’t enabled by default. If you’re using Windows 10, you’ll need to download and enable that setting within the aforementioned Accessory Center app. If you’re using a macOS computer, well, you’re stuck with a webcam that lacks a microphone. Considering that this webcam costs $69.99, I think you’re better off with Logitech’s C920S Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PJKItV"&gt;
&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10730545"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Logitech C270 HD" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w-y1NE1SxqTFm7HCPEo8x-3mj1E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22820367/akrales_210831_4734_0062.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="h6Ocsh"&gt;Logitech C270 HD&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="a0ZCZM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Works with: Windows 10, macOS, Android, Chrome OS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nsz1XC"&gt;If you’re really in a pinch, and your main requirements in a webcam are simply that it’s reliable, very affordable, and it has a microphone, you might want to check out the Logitech C270 HD. It’s by no means a stunner when it comes to video quality — it’s only capable of 720p resolution at 30 frames per second — so you’ll get a fairly fuzzy image no matter what your lighting situation is. You’ll get the best picture if you have it connected in a well-lit environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FLaENJ"&gt;The C270 HD’s bulkier design will likely overlap your monitor’s screen, unlike the options above. It’s a minor consolation that its monitor mount doubles as a stand of sorts, so it can hold itself up on your desk or a table. Being an affordable webcam doesn’t mandate that it shouldn’t have good design, though, so hopefully Logitech improves this aspect in particular for the next iteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="piS4zR"&gt;This isn’t the most glowing recommendation, but I understand that spending more isn’t something that some people may want to do. Most people should spend $60 on our top pick, but if you just want something that gets the job done without making a large investment, the C270 HD will do just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tJMDzD"&gt;
&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10730561"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Logitech StreamCam" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nh1GFyxuwOqYABKQWVCaktQzGYQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22820366/akrales_210831_4734_0060.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9eDY3g"&gt;Logitech Streamcam&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="fmc0AB"&gt;The best webcam for people who need better picture quality&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="BffJel"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Works with: Windows 10 and macOS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GpcJPD"&gt;If you’re comfortable spending somewhere in the $150-$200 price range, your webcam selection will open up to devices that have sharper picture quality and other features that may make them worth the extra cost. Logitech’s Streamcam isn’t the newest webcam to be released, but it stands out as being a great value overall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yEyIJ0"&gt;For one, it’s compact, and its picture fidelity can reach 1080p resolution at 60 frames per second. To my eyes, the Streamcam had only slightly improved clarity, exposure, and color reproduction over the cheaper C920S Pro mentioned above. But it easily takes the win with its much more fluid capture at 60fps. The Streamcam also has a built-in dual omnidirectional mic and a fast auto-focus feature. For people who’d rather have a fixed focus webcam that isn’t constantly searching for objects in motion, Logitech’s Capture software lets you switch off the auto-focus, in addition to several other picture-tweaking settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8I6mT"&gt;These are all great to have (and what you should expect in a $100+ webcam), but it’s the extra features that put this one at the top. The Streamcam can record in landscape or portrait mode, which may save you a step when you edit clips that are made for mobile viewing. It includes two stands, one that can mount it to a tripod and another, more flexible one that rests on your monitor. The latter stand supports a generous amount of vertical tilt, as well as panning from left to right. Lastly, the Capture software allows you to activate an AI feature that can follow your face as it moves within the frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="djm8fC"&gt;If you have an older laptop, one aspect of the Streamcam that might cause trouble is that it plugs in via USB-C. So, if your computer doesn’t have a USB-C port, you’ll need to purchase a USB-C to USB-A adapter. Also, there are other higher-end webcams that offer wider fields of view than the Streamcam’s 78 degrees, so you may want to look elsewhere if you want to capture an image that encompasses more of your room or desk setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MrH5U6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10730585"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NlGSTH"&gt;Other options you might like in the $100-$200 range&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Elgato Facecam" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n-DPVsE7UXl4CXq1faIpRT8hGmA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22820364/akrales_210831_4734_0054.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5BtEmd"&gt;Elgato Facecam&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="gC1SzH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Works with: Windows 10 and macOS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7MYdPD"&gt;The Streamcam is a tough webcam to beat, yet Elgato’s Facecam comes close. It has a great balance of performance and features — offering slightly better-looking video quality than Logitech’s webcam — but its lack of a microphone combined with its higher, $199 price tag makes it tough to recommend to most people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xYt6rS"&gt;The Facecam has similar specs to the Streamcam. It can record at 1080p with up to 60 frames per second, and you can customize how you look in its companion software. After some tweaking to the many settings in Elgato’s Camera Hub app, I preferred how the Facecam made me look with my lighting setup (though its default settings out of the box weren’t great).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dXdHAX"&gt;There are a few problems, though, minor as they might seem to some people. As I’ve already mentioned, the Facecam costs a little more, and for the price, its lack of a microphone surprised me, even if it may not be an issue for people who already use a standalone mic or a headset. And the Facecam’s boxy design won’t exactly blend in with every setup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0CtsdR"&gt;Despite its flaws, there is a lot to like here. The Facecam supports an 82-degree field of view that’s a little wider than the Streamcam’s, and the fixed focus means that the lens won’t be constantly going in and out of focus as you move around. The Facecam also produces footage that looks noticeably less grainy than any other webcam that I tested for this guide. Some other things I like about this model are that it includes a privacy cap and the webcam itself has a tripod thread on its bottom, so you can easily mount it to a tripod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WX61Qw"&gt;Whether you’re willing to forgive the Facecam for its lack of a mic, or if it wasn’t a problem for you in the first place, I’d still recommend waiting until this one drops a bit in price.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Dell UltraSharp webcam" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ETDO0EbRLO_teCpl8gQY18XtOd4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22820363/akrales_210831_4734_0051.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Op5sXu"&gt;Dell UltraSharp webcam&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Pkwn4q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Works with: Windows 10 and macOS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZMV9Vn"&gt;Dell’s new, cylindrical-shaped Ultrasharp webcam is another option with no microphone and a high price. But judging on looks alone, Dell’s seems worth the $199. The Ultrasharp is well-constructed, and includes two stands (one monitor mount, one tripod mount) that can magnetically snap into its bottom, making the setup very simple. It also ships with a privacy cap that snaps on magnetically. It looks and feels like a $200 webcam should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SSMXeW"&gt;Surprisingly, though, the Ultrasharp presented the worst out-of-the-box performance of the webcams that I tried. Making adjustments using the Dell Peripheral companion app definitely helped to bring the quality more into the territory that I expected, considering the high price. This model is capable of 4K resolution capture at up to 30 frames per second, and if you want more frames per second, it gives you the option to bump it down to 1080p resolution to get 60 frames per second. Despite having similar specs to some of the devices above, the Ultrasharp yields footage that’s a little blurry and grainy, and bumping down the resolution to 1080p didn’t seem to yield the advertised 60fps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5cRiPg"&gt;That said, it does have some features that you may be seeking out. Like the Streamcam, there’s an AI-driven feature that can keep you in the frame as you move around. It also supports Windows Hello facial recognition for logging into your machine securely. If you want a wide field of view, the Ultrasharp supports up to 90 degrees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VpzTA0"&gt;All in all, while the Ultrasharp might appeal to people who want a fancy-looking webcam with some interesting features, unfortunately, the overall performance doesn’t match the fit and finish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="84Foww"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="b84tbO"&gt;Razer Kiyo Pro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hAbxOa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Works with: Windows 10&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wRVqwt"&gt;The differentiating feature of the lens-shaped $199 Kiyo Pro, compared to other higher-end webcams, is its super-wide 103-degree field of view. It allows you to see more of your work or play space, as well as more of you. It can also be set to 80 degrees or 90 degrees, if you want to tweak the look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ur5tIT"&gt;Otherwise, its specs will look familiar if you’ve made it this far down the guide. It supports 1080p capture at 60 frames per second, and there’s an HDR mode that knocks the framerate down to 30fps in exchange for a more balanced-looking image. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295235/razer-kiyo-pro-webcam-review-adjustable-field-of-view-streaming-zoom-video-calls-price-features"&gt;During my testing earlier in 2021&lt;/a&gt;, I thought it did a better job than the webcam that I’ve used the most during the pandemic: the one built into my 2019 MacBook Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qzxHbZ"&gt;That’s underselling it a bit, though. It’s basically on par with the Logitech Streamcam in its ability to produce a satisfying picture with good exposure, although the image was fuzzier than I would have liked for the price. Picture quality aside, the build quality is excellent, and its stand lets you easily mount it on your monitor, or attach it to a tripod. But, this might be a more attractive option if it’s discounted.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Feds to close unit that monitored Americans’ social media for Census disinformation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vzardJk9R3qbR_BD0lLDnJkPmVE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69814105/acastro_190204_1777_privacy_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A rogue Commerce Dept. unit will be shut down, the agency said | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6A1oOW"&gt;The US Commerce Department &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2021/09/us-department-commerce-accepts-findings-and-recommendations"&gt;said Friday&lt;/a&gt; that it will eliminate an internal security division after an investigation found it had overstepped its authority when it launched criminal investigations into Commerce employees and US citizens. The Investigations and Threat Management Service division had no “adequate legal authority” to conduct criminal investigations, according to an internal investigation by the Commerce Department’s Office of General Counsel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FnCPXA"&gt;The investigators recommended that the ITMS unit be eliminated within 90 days, and that its security duties be folded into other Commerce divisions. The Commerce Department said in a statement it would accept the report’s recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FLvQRn"&gt;“Our most important priority is creating an environment at the Department of Commerce where employees feel safe and respected,” Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in the statement. “We are committed to maintaining our security, but also equally committed to protecting the privacy and civil liberties of our employees and the public.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rL6Sye"&gt;The internal review found that ITMS was managed poorly, but said in the report it had “not found any firsthand or documentary evidence that racial, ethnic, or national origin bias motivated any specific cases,” as had been alleged. The investigation was able to confirm that “ITMS engaged in broad searches of Department of Commerce servers for particular phrases and words in Mandarin as part of talent recruitment investigations.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cdXXDY"&gt;In addition to eliminating ITMS, the investigators recommended Commerce “discontinue the criminal law enforcement function that was part of ITMS’s mission, clarify that the Department does not possess the authority to conduct counterintelligence activities, and redistribute other remaining functions of ITMS to other offices.” The report also recommended closing and archiving ITMS cases, and destroying the information ITMS collected —  “to ensure that no information developed by ITMS records inform future decisions without a prior legal review and independent factual corroboration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="hYvrGN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"‘Rogue’ Commerce unit scanned social media for Census disinformation","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451494/commerce-unit-surveillance-privacy-social-media-twitter-senate"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="CSmKWm"&gt;ITMS was the subject of a Congressional investigation earlier this year. In May, Sen. Roger Wicker, (R-Mississippi), the ranking Republican on the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, released a &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22536492/ITMS_Fact_Sheet_05_18_2021_FINAL.pdf"&gt;fact sheet detailing a Congressional investigation into the ITMS&lt;/a&gt; that began in February. Wicker’s memo claimed that ITMS “surveilled social media activity on Twitter to monitor accounts that posted commentary critical of processes used to conduct the US Census.” &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;was &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2021/05/24/commerce-department-monitoring-itms/"&gt;first to report&lt;/a&gt; on ITMS’ activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FNFZND"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451494/commerce-unit-surveillance-privacy-social-media-twitter-senate"&gt;According to the Wicker memo&lt;/a&gt;, ITMS conducted the social media probes in an effort to demonstrate its “intelligence-gathering capabilities by linking those accountholders— members of the general public — to disinformation campaigns orchestrated by foreign governments.” There was no evidence that an effort to discredit the Census existed, however. The improper activity at ITMS dated back to the mid 2000s, according to Wicker’s memo, and only two of ITMS’ investigations resulted in criminal charges, according to Friday’s Commerce report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1wV4h6"&gt;The Commerce Department’s statement said it had “taken personnel actions in connection with findings of misconduct regarding ITMS” which it could not disclose. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Apple Watch Series 6 is $140 off at Amazon today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="There’s a new “artist” watch face" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4HJwQcNVPdT4K7LU0RJ5AAO2O8I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69814012/vpavic_200929_4216_0121.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The LTE-ready Apple Watch Series 6 is available at Amazon for its lowest price to date. | Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dIRNgQ"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654621/apple-watch-series-7-new-watchfaces-bigger-screens"&gt;may arrive as soon as this month&lt;/a&gt;, but if you’re looking for a sizable discount on what is currently the latest model, you’ll love today’s deal. The red &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5FXJN6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;40mm, cellular Apple Watch Series 6&lt;/a&gt; is filled with slick features and is on sale at Amazon today for $359 instead of $499, an all-time low for this particular model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MSGDbp"&gt;Apple’s newest wearable boasts built-in sleep tracking and an always-on display, as well as sensors that can quickly measure blood oxygen levels. There is also an abundance of third-party apps designed to attract a variety of activities — even biking. The Series 6 is powered by Apple’s new in-house A13 chip and S6 processor; it also charges faster than other models — gaining a full charge takes about 1.5 hours — while battery life remains at 18 hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oBiUXq"&gt;The red model offers the steepest discount, but the blue and gold versions are also on sale for $380 and $387, respectively. There are also deals available for the larger 44mm sizes. The red model watch is currently out of stock, but you can still place an order at the discounted price, with shipments set to arrive later this month. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="g5rdm5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sVDZQV"&gt;If you want one of the best pairs of Jabra earbuds on the market but don’t want to pay for the Elite 85t, this is the deal for you. An older version of the aforementioned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549587/jabra-elite-85t-review-features-specs-price"&gt;Elite 85t&lt;/a&gt;, the Elite 75t aren’t actually too dissimilar from their successor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1CM1W7"&gt;True, the Elite 85t boasts slightly better noise cancellation and are more comfortable to wear for long periods of time. Yet there isn’t a huge difference in sound quality between the two, and both are capable of connecting to two devices simultaneously. In fact, the 75t’s battery life is actually slightly longer (7.5 hours) with ANC off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="esrzps"&gt;That’s why &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfvqQ5dC0d6#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy’s &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fjabra-elite-75t-true-wireless-active-noise-cancelling-in-ear-headphones-black%2F6376030.p%3FskuId%3D6376030&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;deal&lt;/a&gt; shaving $50 off the normally $150 earbuds is a great one. Instead of forking out $230 on the Elite 85t (which, we should add, are also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Wireless-Bluetooth-Earbuds-Titanium/dp/B08HR78C46?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently on sale for $180&lt;/a&gt;), you can buy a similar pair for more than half off at $100. Jabra intends to phase out the 75t by the end of the year with the introduction of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22649800/jabra-elite-7-pro-active-3-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;latest true wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; — Elite 7 Pro, Elite 7 Active, and Elite 3 — so this may be your last chance to pick them up before they become unavailable. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21066947/jabra-elite-75t-review-wireless-earbuds-airpods-alternative" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YaPBfg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386608"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uTRBQH"&gt;Normally $180, Microsoft’s Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 is currently available in black at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SFKTLZM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon for $158&lt;/a&gt;, its lowest price ever. The Series 2 makes it easy to customize buttons, and the new built-in, rechargeable battery should last for up to 40 hours on a single charge. Praiseworthy design improvements like wrap-around grips also make the controller easier to hold, while adjustable-tension thumbsticks, the option to use shorter hair-trigger locks, and support for both USB-C and Bluetooth round out the controller’s hallmarks. It’s even compatible with the Xbox Series X, as well as the Xbox One and Windows 10. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20926499/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7FaNWf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10732463"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RtAYLv"&gt;Need a way to store your login details securely? Well, for a limited time, readers of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; can enjoy 50 percent off their first year of 1Password when they sign up for either an individual subscription or a family plan. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22619846/1password-8-macos-early-access-password-manager-app" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;newly-redesigned password manager&lt;/a&gt; ensures that you’ll never have to worry about forgetting your sign-in details, especially since it works on unlimited devices. Security features like authenticated encryption and notifications also alert you to compromised sites and vulnerable passwords, keeping your data is safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k8nnNz"&gt;Individual subscribers normally pay $2.99 a month or around $36 per year, but with our exclusive deal, you can pay only $1.50 a month for up to a year. Those who opt for the family plan will pay $30 a year instead of the usual $60, or $2.50 a month.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Labor Day 2021 TV deals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NhDrIiKtRgjE6OJmLVzuo_MMsyQ=/0x20:1440x980/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69810478/samsung_tv.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TajWIq"&gt;Labor Day in the US is a great opportunity to get deals on many types of tech products. Of course, we’re covering all of the best discounts across categories in our detailed guide to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/22652876/best-labor-day-sales-2021-tech-deals-tvs-laptops-headphones"&gt;best Labor Day sales&lt;/a&gt;, but we’ve made this post just to focus on the many 4K TV deals happening this weekend. There are deals on value-focused models that make it easy to get started right away with streaming TV and movie content, as well as TVs that have high-end features and a higher cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Iv1ies"&gt;The best Labor Day deals on affordable 4K TVs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="9AtFjV"&gt;TCL is usually known for TVs that come with Roku TV hardware built-in, but has started more recently to put out models that run on Android TV. Not to be confused with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22616941/tcl-6-5-series-google-tv-price-specs"&gt;the even newer Google TV-equipped models&lt;/a&gt; that have a microphone built into the TV, you can get the 55-inch version of its midrange 4-Series for $400 at Best Buy (normally $500). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Vmprby"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10732342"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LYcP37"&gt;For an even bigger TV, Hisense’s A6G 4K model sells for a similar price to the TCL above, and also runs on Android TV software. This model has a 60Hz refresh rate display, but it features an auto low-latency mode for gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mYBfFR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10265690"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="YQEkOu"&gt;The best Labor Day deals on high-end 4K TVs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eIwSX6"&gt;Sony’s 55-inch Bravia XR LED 4K TV — which has full-array backlighting for more accurate lighting, particularly when handling darker scenes — is $1,200 at Best Buy, a cool $100 off its normal list price. This TV has a 120Hz refresh rate and one of its four HDMI ports is HDMI 2.1, supporting 4K resolution at up to 120 frames per second. And it ships with Google TV software built-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vo0aYj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10732366"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P2CHSa"&gt;For a TV that doesn’t actually look like a conventional display, check out Samsung’s Frame TV. It’s designed to look like, well, you’ve probably already guessed it. The Frame is a competent TV, though, with a 120Hz refresh rate, but its more noteworthy feature is that it can display art while in ambient mode to become more of a conversation piece than a conversation killer. Right now, the 55-inch model is available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Class-Frame-Built/dp/B08VWPBBTF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749927639433300823#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for just shy of $1,300, its second-best price to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lVVLmD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10711541"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iLqhEk"&gt;If you want an OLED without an obscenely high price tag, a good place to start is with LG’s A1. The 55-inch version is $300 off its usual $1,600 price at Best Buy, and, unlike the pricier C1, the A1 has a 60Hz refresh rate display. That’s not a flaw if you primarily plan to watch movies or TV on your new TV, but gamers may want the 120Hz refresh rate screen in the C1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="H2PdLO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10596459"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0eBk5v"&gt;That said, if you have an extra $200 or so to spend, you should upgrade to the C1 for that 120Hz refresh rate. Normally $1,800, it’s currently $1,497 at Amazon and just a few dollars more at Best Buy.
