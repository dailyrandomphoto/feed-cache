    <title>LG had few smartphone hits, but it’ll still be missed</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The US smartphone market just got more boring&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Y5UJKG"&gt;If you’re reading this on a phone, chances are, LG didn’t make it. The Korean tech giant has been losing money and market share with its smartphone division for years, so it wasn’t a surprise when it finally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22346084/lg-exits-smartphone-business"&gt;announced plans to pull the plug&lt;/a&gt; today. You could be forgiven for shrugging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmkhG2"&gt;But LG deserves to be remembered as more than just an also-ran. Its phones were rarely big hits, much less often the kind of polished product we’d ever recommend to most over its competitors. Despite this, LG did introduce several features and innovations that the phone world would be worse off without. The company was the first to put ultrawide cameras on its phones, for example, and it pioneered the kind of all-screen, no-button smartphone designs that dominate the market today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2q0XAn"&gt;And particularly in the US, where Android competition is extremely low, the loss of LG will only further entrench the Apple-Samsung duopoly at the high end. LG is the third-biggest phone vendor in the US, with roughly 10 percent of market share, although much of that was midrange prepaid devices sold through carrier stores. LG might not have been at the top of your smartphone shopping list, but if you live in the US, that list just got a lot more boring.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="EM9ZNj"&gt;LG did have some claim to being a tastemaker in the pre-smartphone world. Its Chocolate and enV phones were stylish devices that helped LG expand its brand recognition around the world. But after the iPhone and Android changed everything, LG struggled to adapt. I’m duty-bound here to mention the original LG Prada, which had a capacitive touchscreen and was technically announced just before the iPhone, but its true legacy is mostly people pointing that out in online comments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hYXO5w"&gt;LG’s early Android phones weren’t impressive. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/12/7/2613319/lg-nitro-hd-review"&gt;2011 Nitro HD&lt;/a&gt;, for example, was its first splashy flagship device in a long time, but it was saddled with outdated, clunky software and poor battery life. Its successor, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/15/3506326/lg-optimus-g-review-att-sprint"&gt;Optimus G&lt;/a&gt;, represented a degree of refinement, and by the time the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/19/4749116/lg-g2-review"&gt;G2&lt;/a&gt; came along in 2012, LG’s new G-series was a fairly credible alternative to the likes of Samsung or HTC. The G2 was one of the first flagship smartphones to attempt to cut down on bezel size, for example, and LG made on-screen buttons a core part of its design long before most others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a1SuOX"&gt;It was also around this time that LG found a new partner in Google, releasing two Nexus phones in a row. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/2/3589280/google-nexus-4-review"&gt;2012 Nexus 4&lt;/a&gt; was built around the guts of the Optimus G, and it had its fans despite its crippling lack of LTE, weak battery life, and unimpressive camera. The next year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/4/5062724/google-nexus-5-review"&gt;Nexus 5&lt;/a&gt; found an even stronger cult following despite it too having a poor camera and bad battery life. (The red version did look great, and the $349 price didn’t hurt.)&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The modular LG G5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="qnZFVc"&gt;LG’s mobile division kept on ticking on, turning out respectable phones like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/4/5778556/lg-g3-review"&gt;G3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/6/8559275/lg-g4-review"&gt;G4&lt;/a&gt; without ever really challenging Samsung. The software was still a heavy-handed customization of Android, and LG continued to lag behind peers with its pace of updates, but the hardware was solid. It was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/8/11391826/lg-g5-review-friend-modules-android"&gt;2016 G5&lt;/a&gt; where things really started to fall apart. Designed around a series of swappable modular accessories called “Friends,” the phone flopped, and LG quickly pretended it never happened. Suffice it to say that if you bought a camera grip or a DAC Hi-Fi audio accessory for your G5, it wouldn’t be able to make Friends with 2017’s G6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x8fON0"&gt;It’s unfortunate that LG focused on gimmicks with the G5 because that phone did introduce one new feature that would become ubiquitous in the smartphone market years later: the ultrawide camera. Ultrawides on smartphones let people capture pictures that were previously restricted to camera gearheads, and it’s hard to imagine buying a new phone without one today. But it took a long time for other phone makers to figure out the utility; Apple introduced its first in 2019, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Woc3q"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/31/13462608/lg-v20-review-price-specs-android"&gt;V20&lt;/a&gt;, released the same year as the G5, had another unique feature that would become a hallmark of the company’s phones for years: an honest-to-God headphone jack in the year that Apple decided to ditch it. And not just any headphone jack — one that worked with a built-in quad DAC designed to boost sound quality and appeal to audiophiles. Did this sell many phones? Well, no. But it became a hallmark of LG’s high-end devices ever since, providing an option for wired headphone enthusiasts who despaired as other phone makers followed Apple’s lead one by one. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LG G6.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="VLvRLb"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/5/15188830/lg-g6-2017-review-phone-specs"&gt;2017 G6&lt;/a&gt; got the G-series back on track. It was the first major smartphone released with a now-familiar taller aspect ratio, with an even stronger focus on eliminating bezels than ever before. Of course, not many people noticed as Samsung followed immediately with the similar but sleeker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15328968/samsung-galaxy-s8-review-s8-plus"&gt;Galaxy S8&lt;/a&gt; and its “Infinity Display.” Later that year, LG released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/16/16457544/lg-v30-review-design"&gt;V30&lt;/a&gt;, which had a completely new (and very nice) design, but it’s always going to be a hard sell when your most differentiated feature is your (also very nice) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/3/29/17175466/android-haptic-feedback-is-bad-why"&gt;haptics system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c6m3Wv"&gt;From here on out, LG’s flagship phones mostly blurred into one. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/22/17363182/lg-g7-thinq-review-android-phone-price-specs"&gt;G7&lt;/a&gt; was a pretty good facsimile of an iPhone X, even winning an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/20/17591130/editors-choice-lg-g7-thinq-phone-review"&gt;Editor’s Choice designation&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; editor Dan Seifert. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/3/17933558/lg-v40-thinq-review-cameras-5-features-battery-screen-photo-quality"&gt;V40&lt;/a&gt; pioneered the now-common triple-camera setup. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/30/20939655/lg-g8x-thinq-dual-screen-review"&gt;G8X&lt;/a&gt; came with a dual-screen case that, in hindsight, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21428763/microsoft-surface-duo-review"&gt;Microsoft’s Surface Duo&lt;/a&gt; really didn’t improve much upon a year later. But all of these phones looked basically identical to each other, and none of their key features were viewed as much more than gimmicks at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U3a22s"&gt;For every good idea LG had, there’d be something pointless like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/9/18301982/lg-g8-thinq-review-android-phone-snapdragon-855-6-gb-ram-z-camera-sensor"&gt;G8&lt;/a&gt;’s vein-sensing “Hand ID” unlock. Despite the company making a big &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/4/12/17228306/lg-android-software-upgrade-center-research-development"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; about a new Software Upgrade Center to increase the pace of Android updates, nothing changed. And in the face of Samsung’s unstoppable marketing machine, LG’s best attempt at a brand identity was to add “ThinQ” to the name of each flagship phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LG Wing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="9esvuM"&gt;In its final year, LG’s mobile division did move to address its problems. The Explorer Project was intended to produce more innovative designs, like the beautiful but underpowered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21304097/lg-velvet-phone-review-price-us-specs-camera"&gt;Velvet&lt;/a&gt; and the oddball dual-screen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536659/lg-wing-review-dual-screen-price-specs-features"&gt;Wing&lt;/a&gt;. At CES this year, the company announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226532/lgs-rollable-phone-launch-release-date-ces-2021"&gt;Rollable&lt;/a&gt; concept phone that it said it planned to take to market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ky42vU"&gt;That’ll never happen now, and it’s hard to say it’s a huge loss with companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/23/22296817/oppo-mid-air-wireless-charging-x-2021-concept-phone-xiaomi-motorola"&gt;Oppo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225446/tcl-rollable-phone-extendable-display-concepts-ces2021"&gt;TCL&lt;/a&gt; likely to pick up the slack with their own versions. But in the context of the US phone market, there’s going to be fewer choices, and whoever ends up accounting for LG’s lost market share is unlikely to be as creative a replacement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="AZzaNR"&gt;LG’s phones were rarely, if ever, the best available, but the company did make a significant impact on the smartphone world at large. With its mobile division’s demise, the US market becomes even more homogenous.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>8BitDo now makes the best Switch pro controller</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The Pro 2 gives you more features for less money&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="PtFdTk"&gt;Nintendo’s official Pro Controller for the Switch is generally a pretty useful accessory, but it has its problems: the D-pad is unreliable, and it doesn’t really offer any “pro-level” functionality. 8BitDo’s latest controller improves on both of those issues while coming in at a lower price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MJvfV2"&gt;The 8BitDo Pro 2 is an upgraded version of the SN30Pro Plus, already a well-regarded Switch controller. It uses Bluetooth and also works with PCs and mobile devices; there’s a physical control for flipping between Switch, X-input, D-input, and Mac. You can use it as a wired controller with a USB-C cable, too. I did try using it with my PC, but I feel like it makes more sense on the Switch due to the Japanese-style button layout with B on the bottom and A on the right. Or maybe I’m just too used to using Xbox controllers on the PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Uo7CEd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10426176"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YpmtFL"&gt;Aesthetically, it looks kind of like a cross between a SNES pad and a PlayStation controller, with a lozenge-shaped body, two handles, and symmetrically aligned analog sticks. The unit I have is decked out in a PlayStation-inspired gray colorway, though there’s also an all-black option and a beige model that evokes the original Game Boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1dVAX4"&gt;It’s not a huge controller, but it feels comfortable in my large hands, with easy access to all of the buttons and triggers. Just as importantly for me, the D-pad is good. It feels more or less like a SNES pad, and its placement above the left analog stick makes it more appropriate for games where it’s a primary input option. I’d much rather use the Pro 2 than Nintendo’s Pro Controller for just about any 2D game on the Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DJo6CloJtJrnXDtsyayLpcWHz6Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22415567/09_l.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iisDXP"&gt;The Pro 2’s key feature over its predecessor is the customizable back buttons that you can press with your middle finger. These are a common element of enthusiast-focused controllers today, from Microsoft’s Elite controllers to third-party offerings like the Astro C40 for the PS4. Sony also released an attachment that brings similar functionality to the DualShock 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tc2hiH"&gt;These buttons are useful because they allow you to enter commands without taking your thumbs off the sticks. Most first-person shooters, for example, assign jumping to a face button, which means it can be awkward to activate while aiming at the same time. With controllers like the Pro 2, you can set a back button to work the same way as a given face button, freeing you up to design more flexible control schemes. The Pro 2 makes it much easier to manipulate the camera in the middle of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22352085/monster-hunter-rise-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; battle, which might be worth the asking price alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Foy7HA"&gt;The back buttons on the Pro 2 are responsive and clicky, activating with a slight squeeze. You can assign them through 8BitDo’s Ultimate Software app, which is now available for the Pro 2 on iOS and Android as well as PCs. It’s not quite as simple as some pro controller setups that let you remap the buttons directly on the controller itself, but it does support multiple profiles and works well enough. Beside button assignments, the app can also be used to modify the controller’s vibration strength and stick sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PFwEbAZkw-2k0rYzhWc_gAL5088=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22415579/DSCF7699.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mEpGK8"&gt;You do miss out on some of the Switch Pro Controller’s features with the 8BitDo Pro 2. While the rumble is solid, it doesn’t feel as precise as Nintendo’s HD Rumble in supported games. The Pro 2 also lacks an NFC reader, so it won’t work with Amiibo figurines. And it can’t be used to power the Switch on, which is common to most third-party controllers across various platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uh7XJw"&gt;For $49.99, though, those omissions are understandable. That’s $20 less than Nintendo’s equivalent option, let alone the pro controllers you’d find for the Xbox or PlayStation in the $180–$200 range. And all things considered, I’d take the 8BitDo Pro 2 over the official Nintendo controller most days of the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m0ODBh"&gt;&lt;small&gt;The 8BitDo Pro 2 will start shipping on April 12th.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The latest Loki trailer teases a buddy-cop duo with Owen Wilson across time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SfF7-b7ad7W0fER5ZneD_wXGJas=/467x0:2081x1076/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69077304/Screen_Shot_2021_04_05_at_9.57.48_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Disney / Marvel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kdJpqI"&gt;Marvel’s next spinoff series after &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; and the ongoing &lt;em&gt;Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt; will be &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;, a show dedicated to the trickster god of Asgard and the brother of Thor. And now we have another trailer, showing off longtime Marvel mainstay Tom Hiddleston in the title role and now a little more information on what exactly he’s been tasked with. The show will premiere on &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1018587/9358?subId1=VergeLokiTrailer040521&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; on June 11th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hrvkrb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; is another dramatic tonal departure for Marvel, which has set up its spinoff series as experimental dives into various genres. This one feels more in line with the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s love of alternative universe capers, though it’s channeling some serious &lt;em&gt;Umbrella Academy&lt;/em&gt; vibes as Loki is asked by Mobius (Owen Wilson) to help correct the timeline he disturbed when using the Tesseract throughout &lt;em&gt;The Infinity Saga. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AWQiQ6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Loki’s time has come. ⌛ Watch the brand-new trailer for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LOKI?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#LOKI&lt;/a&gt;, and start streaming the Marvel Studios Original Series June 11 on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/disneyplus?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@DisneyPlus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/6bnfo5C2R1"&gt;pic.twitter.com/6bnfo5C2R1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Marvel Studios (@MarvelStudios) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelStudios/status/1379056236910366728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g3nUOB"&gt;The series will introduce the Time Variance Authority, the organization responsible for overseeing the multiverse, and surely much more of the mind-bending time travel shenanigans we got during &lt;em&gt;Endgame&lt;/em&gt;. Wilson also pulls off a charmingly devilish Mobius — and Hiddleston is his excellent self, as usual — in a way that has me rather excited to see where Disney and Marvel take this particular storyline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YtXvkM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Supreme Court sides with Google in Oracle’s API copyright case</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Supreme Court 1 (Verge Stock)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l3KCKmHP4W2wH53eZg47uytvBUQ=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69077168/Supreme_Court_1.1419968930.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Supreme Court 1 (Verge Stock)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ywKdbq"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/18-956_d18f.pdf"&gt;a ruling on Monday&lt;/a&gt;, the Supreme Court found that Google could legally use elements of Oracle’s Java application programming interface (API) code when building Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2D00Dr"&gt;“Google’s copying of the API to reimplement a user interface, taking only what was needed to allow users to put their accrued talents to work in a new and transformative program, constituted a fair use of that material,” the Supreme Court ruled in a 6-2 opinion, with one justice (Amy Coney Barrett) not taking part in the ruling. It overturned an earlier federal decision, which found that Google’s use of the API had constituted infringement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Quezou"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Google’s copying of the API...constituted a fair use of that material”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Uqpz9o"&gt;The court’s opinion concludes that APIs — which let programmers access other code — are significantly different from other kinds of computer programs. “As part of an interface, the copied lines are inherently bound together with uncopyrightable ideas ... and the creation of new creative expression,” Justice Stephen Breyer writes in his opinion. Unlike many other computer programs, Breyer wrote, much of the copied lines’ value came from developers being invested in the ecosystem, rather than the actual operations of the program. Google used the API to let Java programmers build Android apps, which the court declared is a fundamentally transformative use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Es5t1p"&gt;“Google copied only what was needed to allow programmers to work in a different computing environment without discarding a portion of a familiar programming language. Google’s purpose was to create a different task-related system for a different computing environment (smartphones) and to create a platform — the Android platform — that would help achieve and popularize that objective.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="klhM8u"&gt;The decision is meant to be specifically focused on APIs as a category. “We do not overturn or modify our earlier cases involving fair use — cases, for example, that involve “knockoff” products, journalistic writings, and parodies,” writes Breyer. The ruling hinges largely on the ways that API code enables new creative expression, something fair use doctrine is supposed to promote. “The upshot, in our view, is that fair use can play an important role in determining the lawful scope of a computer program copyright.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lff1RM"&gt;In the dissent, Justice Clarence Thomas argued the court was creating an untenable distinction between implementing code (which was established as subject to copyright in a previous ruling) and declaring it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L6bfuw"&gt;“Congress rejected categorical distinctions between declaring and implementing code,” Thomas wrote. “But the majority creates just such a distinction. The result of this distorting analysis is an opinion that makes it difficult to imagine any circumstance in which declaring code will remain protected by copyright.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pdOiZs"&gt;Google and Oracle have been fighting over Android’s Java interoperability &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/22/2967626/oracle-vs-google-trial-java-android"&gt;for more than 10 years now&lt;/a&gt;, spanning three trials and two separate appeals. The current incarnation of the case turns on whether Oracle can enforce its copyright over roughly 11,500 lines in Android’s codebase, representing 37 separate APIs. Google developed the APIs independently, but they’re clearly based on equivalent APIs in the Java code, designed to mimic and interoperate with the separate language. Oracle claims the “structure, sequence, and organization” of the Android APIs is so similar as to violate Oracle’s copyright on the Java code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VY4K0j"&gt;In 2014, &lt;a href="http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4431835/13-1021.Opinion.5-7-2014.1.pdf"&gt;a federal appeals court ruled&lt;/a&gt; that the APIs could be subject to copyright in a controversial decision overturning a ruling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/19/16503076/oracle-vs-google-judge-william-alsup-interview-waymo-uber"&gt;by Judge William Alsup&lt;/a&gt;. (The Supreme Court declined to hear Google’s appeal the following year, letting the appellate ruling stand.) But that decision left open the question of whether Google’s implementation had violated the Java copyright, and Google launched a second phase of the case arguing that the Android APIs constituted fair use. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-27/oracle-wins-revival-of-billion-dollar-case-against-google"&gt;In 2018&lt;/a&gt;, the same appellate court ruled that Google’s implementation was not fair use, putting the company at risk of up to $8.8 billion in damages. Today’s decision overturns that ruling, allowing Google to continue its use of the Android code without threat of a copyright claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C7quTj"&gt;Notably, then-President Trump’s solicitor general had formally petitioned the Supreme Court to leave the appellate ruling in place, effectively &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/483750-trump-administration-backs-oracle-in-supreme-court-battle-against-google"&gt;siding with Oracle&lt;/a&gt; in the fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kwAkA6"&gt;Oral arguments for the Supreme Court case &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21506172/oracle-google-java-supreme-court-hearings-oral-arguments-metaphors-qwerty"&gt;were held in October&lt;/a&gt;, turning on a variety of florid metaphors for what the APIs represented. In one exchange, Breyer compared Oracle’s API claims to holding a copyright on the QWERTY keyboard. “If you let somebody have a copyright on that now, they would control all typewriters,” Breyer noted, “which really has nothing to do with copyright.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="24Ntg1"&gt;Google global affairs SVP Kent Walker praised the decision. “The Supreme Court’s clear ruling is a victory for consumers, interoperability, and computer science. The decision gives legal certainty to the next generation of developers whose new products and services will benefit consumers,” said Walker. “We are very grateful for the support from a wide range of organizations, from the National Consumers League to the American Library Association, as well as from established companies, start-ups, and the country’s leading software engineers and copyright scholars.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PjrPA5"&gt;An Oracle representative did not immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s QHD gaming monitor is a great upgrade for $300</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bwckG3njvcDm6SRBhmQszwbOPUE=/0x0:1155x770/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69076946/lgultragearlede.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zBMeOs"&gt;If you ask me, $300 for a QHD gaming monitor that has Nvidia’s G-Sync compatibility and a fantastic IPS panel is a great price. That’s how much LG’s UltraGear 27-inch QHD model costs — down $100 from its usual price at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1621994-REG%2Flg_27gn800_b_27_qhd_ips_hdr10.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F4%2F5%2F22367713%2Flg-ultragear-qhd-1440p-nvidia-gsync-gaming-monitor-ips-iottie-airfly-pro" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LLD2QXJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. This monitor has a subtle design and slim bezels, and in terms of features, it has a 144Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and covers 99 percent of the sRGB color spectrum. In terms of ports, it has two HDMI ports, one DisplayPort, and a 3.5mm output for desktop speakers or headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2UFzn5"&gt;For those lucky enough to have gotten a new Nvidia RTX 30-series graphics card, or a powerful AMD GPU for their PC, or who have an Xbox Series X, a 1440p gaming monitor like this is a must-own piece of tech. Games will look better, and everything else will look sharper than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="PLVngq"&gt;If you have a car trip coming up and no easy way to keep your phone charged, check out iOttie’s deals at Amazon on Qi wireless charging phone mounts. These are simple dashboard mounts to keep your phone within view, but they pack in a wireless charging coil that seems much easier than fidgeting for a cable while your eyes should be on the road. These normally sell for $55, but they’re $20 off right now. You can either get a dashboard mount &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X4YDKTF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;that sticks on via a suction cup&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X52DJ66?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;mount that hangs on to your car’s CD slot&lt;/a&gt; or air vent.&lt;/p&gt;

Unlike some others, it features USB-C recharging and long battery life. In addition, its 3.5mm cord is integrated, so you won’t fear losing it. I know most of us still aren’t flying around right now, but this could be a good gadget investment for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to check if you’re part of the Facebook data breach</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J3-r8N_92l9QQADIYqkgUciFza8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69076936/acastro_180806_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ElKllT"&gt;By now, you have probably heard of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22366822/facebook-personal-data-533-million-leaks-online-email-phone-numbers"&gt;the huge Facebook data breach&lt;/a&gt;, in which upwards of 533 million Facebook users from 106 countries had personal data leaked online, including phone numbers, Facebook IDs, birthdates — you name it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KxRycs"&gt;Your first question will be, of course, how to check whether you are part of that breach. There are a couple of places out there where you can find out whether your data has been compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AkMEo3"&gt;One well-known site that tracks data breaches is &lt;a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/"&gt;Have I Been Pwned&lt;/a&gt;. Just follow the link to the site and put in your email address. You will find out not only if you’ve been part of the Facebook breach, but also any other breaches in which your data may have been compromised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tkw7yg"&gt;While as of this writing, you could only do a search using your email address, Troy Hunt, creator of Have I Been Pwned, was considering whether to include a phone number search as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zqQUbx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Should the FB phone numbers be searchable in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/haveibeenpwned?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@haveibeenpwned&lt;/a&gt;? I’m thinking through the pros and cons in terms of the value it adds to impacted people versus the risk presented if it’s used to help resolve numbers to identities (you’d still need the source data to do that).&lt;/p&gt;— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1378503918284460035?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kYiCcI"&gt;If you want to check your phone number against the leaked Facebook database, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/how-to-check-if-your-phone-number-is-in-the-huge-facebo-1846617849"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has suggested a tool created by a site called &lt;a href="https://www.thenewseachday.com/facebook-phone-numbers-us"&gt;The News Each Day&lt;/a&gt;, in which you input your phone number to find out whether it’s part of the breach. However, that site is not as well-known, so until more is known about it, you may want to stick with the more trusted site listed above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C8Ngp9"&gt;And if you do find out that your data has been compromised? Some of the steps you can take are to change the passwords of compromised sites, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311182/best-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password"&gt;use a password manager&lt;/a&gt; so that you can create and track unique passwords for each site (so that if one is compromised, it won’t affect any others), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22215571/factor-authentication-2fa-apple-microsoft-google-how-to"&gt;use two-factor authentication&lt;/a&gt; for additional security, and stay alert for news of any other breaches.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tim Cook says Apple wants to use AR to make conversations better</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XyXtioEn6PU0aevifVg7fblDyMs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69076836/dbohn_170912_1993_2091.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wsz98c"&gt;Apple CEO Tim Cook rarely provides details on unannounced products, but he offered some hints about Apple’s thinking on augmented reality and cars in an interview &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/opinion/is-apples-privacy-push-facebooks-existential-threat.html?"&gt;with Kara Swisher for &lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;this morning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UtLk2O"&gt;When it comes to augmented reality, he agreed with Swisher’s framing that the tech is “critically important” to Apple’s future and said it could be used to enhance conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aob5ZT"&gt;“You and I are having a great conversation right now. Arguably, it could even be better if we were able to augment our discussion with charts or other things to appear,” Cook said. He imagines AR being used in health, education, retail, and gaming. “I’m already seeing AR take off in some of these areas with use of the phone. And I think the promise is even greater in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0sM9yy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You know, I’ve never spoken to Elon.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jVcUXn"&gt;Apple has been rumored for years to be working on an augmented reality headset, and the latest leaks suggested &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346564/apple-mixed-vr-virtual-augmented-reality-headset-light-ming-chi-kuo"&gt;a mixed reality device&lt;/a&gt; could launch next year. Augmented reality features are already available on the iPhone and iPad, but outside of some fun Snapchat filters, augmented reality hasn’t become all that widely used yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HlxGHp"&gt;Cook also talked broadly about Apple’s approach to products during a question about cars. Leaks from Apple have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22194032/apple-car-self-driving-battery-tech"&gt;made it unclear&lt;/a&gt; if the company is developing self-driving tech that it could license to other companies or if Apple plans to develop an entire car by itself. Cook’s latest comments suggest the latter, assuming the project comes to fruition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R4ruuF"&gt;“We love to integrate hardware, software, and services, and find the intersection points of those because we think that’s where the magic occurs,” Cook said. “And so that’s what we love to do. And we love to own the primary technology that’s around that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmCy6m"&gt;Cook referred to “autonomy” as a “core technology” and said there are “lots of things you can do” with it in connection with robots. But he warned that not every Apple project eventually ships. “We investigate so many things internally. Many of them never see the light of day,” Cook said. “I’m not saying that one will not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vtEzfH"&gt;Swisher also asked Cook about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195959/elon-musk-tesla-tim-cook-apple-sale-meeting-acquisition-refused"&gt;Elon Musk’s comments&lt;/a&gt; about a failed attempt to discuss selling Tesla to Apple around 2017. “You know, I’ve never spoken to Elon,” Cook said, “although I have great admiration and respect for the company he’s built.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon retaliated against climate organizers, labor board finds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4UFBGG1a8VOAgs3rOvj-28_N294=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69076740/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0001.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YBIyMl"&gt;The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has determined that Amazon retaliated against two activist employees when it fired them in April of last year, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/technology/amazon-nlrb-activist-workers.html"&gt;as first reported by &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z42Kk2"&gt;The determination is part of the board’s ongoing response to a labor complaint against Amazon, although it’s not a legal ruling in itself. Still, the determination indicates the NLRB is prepared to accuse Amazon of unfair labor practices in connection with the case, and that puts the company under significant pressure to settle the case with the fired employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ESOssk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are on the right side of history and the right side of the law”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IMDXee"&gt;The two employees at the heart of the case, Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa, organized the Amazon Employees for Climate Justice group in 2020 to protest the company’s partnerships with the oil and gas industry. The group went public with &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@amazonemployeesclimatejustice/amazon-employees-share-our-views-on-company-business-f5abcdea849"&gt;an open letter&lt;/a&gt; that January, undersigned by more than 350 employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6IPtH2"&gt;Amazon fired Cunningham and Costa &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/04/13/amazon-workers-fired/"&gt;three months later&lt;/a&gt;, after they used the same Medium account to &lt;a href="https://amazonemployees4climatejustice.medium.com/coronavirus-amazon-log-cfdc9a6f4437"&gt;raise concerns&lt;/a&gt; about coronavirus protections at Amazon warehouses. At the time, Amazon said the women had been fired for “violating internal policies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HJChcM"&gt;It is unclear how the Seattle case will be resolved, but both women are being encouraged to settle with the company by the NLRB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9aBXm9"&gt;“It’s a moral victory,” Cunningham told the &lt;em&gt;Times,&lt;/em&gt; “and really shows that we are on the right side of history and the right side of the law.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TIPsVc"&gt;The new determination is part of a growing pattern of labor violations at Amazon, which has been accused of violating workers’ rights to protest labor conditions in a growing number of cases. In March, the NLRB made a similar determination about retaliation against organizers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22345094/amazon-queens-warehouse-workers-labor-law-covid-19"&gt;at a warehouse in Queens&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a separate retaliation case connected to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22335739/amazon-chicago-nlrb-worker-retaliation-safety-complaint-merit-settlement"&gt;a warehouse in Chicago&lt;/a&gt;. Six Pennsylvania warehouse workers are also &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/amazon-worker-retaliation-coronavirus"&gt;pursuing a retaliation case&lt;/a&gt; against the company in federal court. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/fired-interrogated-disciplined-amazon-warehouse-organizers-allege-year-retaliation-n1262367"&gt;An &lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt; analysis&lt;/a&gt; counted 37 separate labor rights cases against Amazon filed with the NLRB since February 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eCLh69"&gt;Amazon has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356321/amazon-inequality-bezos-democrats-union-sanders-fulfillment"&gt;exacerbated the issue&lt;/a&gt; by publicly feuding with a number of prominent progressive lawmakers, including Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). On Friday, the company &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/policy-news-views/our-recent-response-to-representative-pocan"&gt;publicly apologized&lt;/a&gt; for a series of tweets denying that Amazon drivers are sometimes forced to pee in bottles, a phenomenon subsequently confirmed by &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7amyn/amazon-denies-workers-pee-in-bottles-here-are-the-pee-bottles"&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/akd54e/she-wees-and-plastic-bags-amazons-pee-scandal-is-much-worse-for-women"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x58bRw"&gt;“This was an own-goal,” Amazon said in its apology. “We know that drivers can and do have trouble finding restrooms because of traffic or sometimes rural routes.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG is quitting the smartphone business</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wxQw9UvVgTlqt6MyuZMD5HGOn7E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69075601/cgartenberg_201022_4254_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6TTSk0"&gt;LG is exiting the smartphone business, the company confirmed today. The decision will “enable the company to focus resources in growth areas such as electric vehicle components, connected devices, smart homes, robotics, artificial intelligence and business-to-business solutions, as well as platforms and services,” LG said in a &lt;a href="http://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/04/lg-to-close-mobile-phone-business-worldwide/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Xy9US"&gt;Existing phones will remain on sale, and LG says it’ll continue to support its products “for a period of time which will vary by region.” The company hasn’t said anything about possible layoffs except that “details related to employment will be determined at the local level.” LG says it expects to have completed the business’ closure by the end of July this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ueOwC"&gt;The move has been rumored for several months, following the division’s huge losses over the past five years. Once considered a rival to fellow South Korean manufacturer Samsung, LG’s recent high-end smartphones have struggled to compete, while its more affordable handsets have faced stiff competition from Chinese rivals. The company had previously said it hoped to make its smartphone division &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/9/21058238/lg-smartphone-profitable-2021-apple-samsung-ces-mwc"&gt;profitable in 2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="moPpjV"&gt;Today’s news means LG’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436954/lg-extendable-sliding-phone-teaser-explorer-project-wing-mobile"&gt;long-teased rollable phone&lt;/a&gt; is unlikely to ever see the light of day. The last time the company showed off the device was back at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224591/lg-rollable-phone-extending-display-teaser-ces-2021"&gt;this year’s virtual CES&lt;/a&gt; when the company insisted that the device was real and would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226532/lgs-rollable-phone-launch-release-date-ces-2021"&gt;launching later this year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UbwMax"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An attempt to sell the division reportedly failed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bt7zVh"&gt;Reports that LG has been considering exiting smartphones have been around since at least &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22240282/lg-smartphone-business-exit-2021-internal-memo"&gt;the beginning of this year&lt;/a&gt;. Although a company spokesperson branded an earlier report about the company’s potential exit from the smartphone business “&lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/01/15/no-lg-isnt-exiting-the-smartphone-business/"&gt;completely false and without merit,&lt;/a&gt;” an LG official later &lt;a href="http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20210120000992"&gt;confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Korea Herald&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that the&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;company had to make “a cold judgment” about the division. Potential measures could include “sale, withdrawal and downsizing of the smartphone business,” the official said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z7TzZp"&gt;In March, reports emerged that the company had tried to find a buyer for its smartphone business, but that talks had stalled and it could instead shut down the division. &lt;a href="https://www.donga.com/news/article/all/20210321/106003359/1"&gt;Korean outlet &lt;em&gt;DongA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said the company had ceased development of its upcoming phones with rollable displays, and that it had shelved its planned smartphones for the first half of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jdnmaa"&gt;As it lost share to rivals, LG released a series of eye-catching devices with unusual form-factors. There was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536659/lg-wing-review-dual-screen-price-specs-features"&gt;LG Wing&lt;/a&gt;, whose main display rotated to reveal a smaller secondary screen beneath it, or its recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/30/20939655/lg-g8x-thinq-dual-screen-review"&gt;dual screen&lt;/a&gt; devices. LG also tried its hand at a modular smartphone with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/8/11391826/lg-g5-review-friend-modules-android"&gt;LG G5&lt;/a&gt;, only to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/8/11391826/lg-g5-review-friend-modules-android"&gt;abandon the initiative a year later&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VG07jS"&gt;Unfortunately for LG, none of these features were useful enough to turn the phones into mainstream hits, and meanwhile the company’s more traditional handsets fell behind their rivals in core areas like camera performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SEkq67"&gt;LG joins a long list of high-profile device makers to give up on smartphones over the years, although many of the brand names have stuck around on devices made by third-party manufacturers. Nokia’s consumer-facing brand lives on atop handsets made by HMD, while Blackberry’s branding was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/3/21120107/tcl-blackberry-ends-phone-global-rights-date-2020"&gt;initially used by TCL&lt;/a&gt; and is set to return this year on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21375026/5g-blackberry-phone-android-physical-keyboard-2021-release-date"&gt;device made by OnwardMobility&lt;/a&gt;. There’s also HTC, which still sells a few oddball handsets but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/20/16340108/google-htc-smartphone-team-acquisition-announced"&gt;sold most of its IP to Google in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. Who’s next?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Genesis drone show used a record-breaking 3,281 drones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/434xFRBnr7cyme9pdj0DQ49etek=/211x0:2490x1519/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69075245/image1.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Genesis&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="J3hpGc"&gt;Hyundai’s luxury vehicle brand Genesis used 3,281 drones to create its logo over Shanghai’s skyline on March 29th in celebration of the brand’s arrival in China. That number of drones sets a new Guinness World Record for “The Most Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) airborne simultaneously,” &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/genesis-celebrates-launch-in-china-with-dazzling-world-record-breaking-drone-show-over-shanghais-iconic-skyline-301261643.html"&gt;according to a Genesis press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ugoT6E"&gt;You can see a picture of the Genesis logo formation at the top of this post. Genesis also made a video that &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/ead2Efblvxk"&gt;showed off some additional drone formations&lt;/a&gt;, including a hand, two of the company’s cars, and... a double helix? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OCV7cW"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ead2Efblvxk?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KbhfZV"&gt;Genesis’ record edges out the previous one held by Shenzhen Damoda Intelligent Control Technology, which used 3,051 drones in a display on September 20th. &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/44KvHwRHb3A"&gt;Here’s a video of that display&lt;/a&gt;, which I personally think is even more impressive than Genesis’:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nW1IpZ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/44KvHwRHb3A?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M9bKps"&gt;Intel held the record at one point as well, using &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/9/16994638/winter-olympics-2018-intel-drone-show-world-record"&gt;1,218 Shooting Star drones&lt;/a&gt; to create the Olympic rings over Pyeongchang for the 2018 Winter Olympics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="04Z2qi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data="{&amp;quot;stories&amp;quot;:[{&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Intel’s Winter Olympics light show featured a record-breaking 1,218 drones&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/9/16994638/winter-olympics-2018-intel-drone-show-world-record&amp;quot;},{&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;The Super Bowl halftime show drones weren't flying live&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/5/14517954/super-bowl-2017-drones-halftime-show-lady-gaga&amp;quot;}]}"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
