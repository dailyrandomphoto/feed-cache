    <title>Nintendo is shutting down its Dr. Mario mobile game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XlRH_T9_vcNazpoXBJPNxEi-wm8=/0x0:1820x1213/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69642606/Untitled.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jrIlew"&gt;Nintendo has &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/support/information/2021/0728.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Dr. Mario World&lt;/em&gt;, a mobile take on the puzzle game series, will go out of service on November 1st, with sales of its in-app “diamond” currency ending today. The game was launched a little over two years ago, and is the first of Nintendo’s mobile games to be shut down, unless you count the Mii-themed social network &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/24/16930822/nintendo-miitomo-closing-down-date"&gt;Miitomo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mtL2NP"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/nintendo-revenue-one-billion"&gt;data from SensorTower&lt;/a&gt; collected around six months after its launch, &lt;em&gt;Dr. Mario World&lt;/em&gt; was by far the worst performing Nintendo smartphone game in terms of revenue performance. That includes &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Run&lt;/em&gt;, whose disappointing sales prompted Nintendo to pursue freemium models in the first place. &lt;em&gt;Fire Emblem Heroes&lt;/em&gt; remains the company’s biggest mobile hit by a huge distance, generating more revenue than its other games combined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iCgtS1"&gt;Nintendo did go out of its way to make &lt;em&gt;Dr. Mario World&lt;/em&gt; a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/8/20685938/dr-mario-world-candy-crush-puzzle-game-mobile-free-to-play-loot-box"&gt;potential monetization machine&lt;/a&gt; rather than a direct translation of the NES-era gameplay, but ultimately it seems like not enough players got hooked for it to be worth continually operating. Mobile games still account for a tiny portion of Nintendo’s overall earnings; last year the company attributed just 3.24 percent of its revenue to “mobile and IP related income,” which includes licensing deals. Almost everything else comes from the Switch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Read Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick’s letter addressing the harassment allegations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Activision Blizzard CEO Robert Kotick" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IudgEoxxhvwI8sQgxgEwSvhoDCQ=/0x0:4200x2800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69642330/532417098.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by J. Emilio Flores/Corbis via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9hwZvr"&gt;The evening before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595922/activision-blizzard-employees-walk-out-sexual-harassment"&gt;a proposed employee walkout at Activision Blizzard&lt;/a&gt;, one that at least part of the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596957/blizzard-pto-sexual-harassment-walkout"&gt;is now actively encouraging by providing paid time off&lt;/a&gt;, company CEO Bobby Kotick has issued a letter to all employees — &lt;a href="https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/letter-ceo-bobby-kotick-all-employees"&gt;and investors&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210727006194/en/A-Letter-From-CEO-Bobby-Kotick-to-All-Employees"&gt;the public&lt;/a&gt; — who are watching the company struggle with allegations of sexual harassment and workplace discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VckUfx"&gt;At last count, nearly one-third of the company’s employees signed an open letter condemning Activision Blizzard’s initial response to those allegations, and Kotick’s letter addresses that head-on: “Our initial responses to the issues we face together, and to your concerns, were, quite frankly, tone deaf,” he writes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="orgpea"&gt;Kotick says a law firm, WilmerHale, will immediately review the company’s policies “to promote a respectful and inclusive workplace,” that Activision Blizzard “will continue to investigate each and every claim and will not hesitate to take decisive action,” that it will fire anyone “found to have impeded the integrity of our processes for evaluating claims,” and that it will ensure hiring managers are considering diverse slates of candidates for open jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OLgt2X"&gt;Also, the company plans to change its games. “We have heard the input from employee and player communities that some of our in-game content is inappropriate. We are removing that content,” writes Kotick. Blizzard announced earlier today &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22597006/blizzard-world-of-warcraft-activision-remove-references-harassment-lawsuit"&gt;that &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; would remove “references that are not appropriate for our world,”&lt;/a&gt; without specifying any particular ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R5ks15"&gt;The whole situation strongly reminds of Ubisoft, whose CEO Yves Guillemot &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/2/21312022/ubisoft-internal-changes-allegations-employee-misconduct-ceo"&gt;also announced the company would be cleaning house&lt;/a&gt; after an insufficient response to the initial allegations of sexual misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="19KkKq"&gt;You can read the full letter below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="mvLVKr"&gt;July 27, 2021&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YaK2JZ"&gt;This has been a difficult and upsetting week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6oaIei"&gt;I want to recognize and thank all those who have come forward in the past and in recent days. I so appreciate your courage. Every voice matters - and we will do a better job of listening now, and in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CK68Wy"&gt;Our initial responses to the issues we face together, and to your concerns, were, quite frankly, tone deaf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pxMzMp"&gt;It is imperative that we acknowledge all perspectives and experiences and respect the feelings of those who have been mistreated in any way. I am sorry that we did not provide the right empathy and understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8OgWtH"&gt;Many of you have told us that active outreach comes from caring so deeply for the Company. That so many people have reached out and shared thoughts, suggestions, and highlighted opportunities for improvement is a powerful reflection of how you care for our communities of colleagues and players – and for each other. Ensuring that we have a safe and welcoming work environment is my highest priority. The leadership team has heard you loud and clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5riRaj"&gt;We are taking swift action to be the compassionate, caring company you came to work for and to ensure a safe environment. There is no place anywhere at our Company for discrimination, harassment, or unequal treatment of any kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJtjXv"&gt;We will do everything possible to make sure that together, we improve and build the kind of inclusive workplace that is essential to foster creativity and inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="leqFbh"&gt;I have asked the law firm WilmerHale to conduct a review of our policies and procedures to ensure that we have and maintain best practices to promote a respectful and inclusive workplace. This work will begin immediately. The WilmerHale team will be led by Stephanie Avakian, who is a member of the management team at WilmerHale and was most recently the Director of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s Division of Enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uj9iPI"&gt;We encourage anyone with an experience you believe violates our policies or in any way made you uncomfortable in the workplace to use any of our many existing channels for reporting or to reach out to Stephanie. She and her team at WilmerHale will be available to speak with you on a confidential basis and can be reached at &lt;a href="mailto:ATVI@wilmerhale.com"&gt;ATVI@wilmerhale.com&lt;/a&gt; or 202-247-2725. Your outreach will be kept confidential. Of course, NO retaliation will be tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2tEwp"&gt;We are committed to long-lasting change. Effective immediately, we will be taking the following actions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uF3J1v"&gt;Employee Support. We will continue to investigate each and every claim and will not hesitate to take decisive action. To strengthen our capabilities in this area we are adding additional senior staff and other resources to both the Compliance team and the Employee Relations team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PdHA9V"&gt;Listening Sessions. We know many of you have inspired ideas on how to improve our culture. We will be creating safe spaces, moderated by third parties, for you to speak out and share areas for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fXB2Wv"&gt;Personnel Changes. We are immediately evaluating managers and leaders across the Company. Anyone found to have impeded the integrity of our processes for evaluating claims and imposing appropriate consequences will be terminated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2OFWjD"&gt;Hiring Practices. Earlier this year I sent an email requiring all hiring managers to ensure they have diverse candidate slates for all open positions. We will be adding compliance resources to ensure that our hiring managers are in fact adhering to this directive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aZZfmg"&gt;In-game Changes. We have heard the input from employee and player communities that some of our in-game content is inappropriate. We are removing that content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qffhVt"&gt;Your well-being remains my priority and I will spare no company resource ensuring that our company has the most welcoming, comfortable, and safe culture possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="seqN68"&gt;You have my unwavering commitment that we will improve our company together, and we will be the most inspiring, inclusive entertainment company in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mhnujs"&gt;Yours sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YZezpG"&gt;Bobby&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Workers at a repair facility used by Apple compare conditions to sweatshops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MxZMxUAwaJR3jbZv8zkeTr2yIc0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69642266/acastro_170731_1777_0004_v5.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eKwK9I"&gt;Workers at a Houston, Texas facility that processes repairs for Apple, Dell, and Lenovo reportedly say they are working in “sweatshop” conditions, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-repair-workers-sweatshop-csat-solutions-2021-7"&gt;according to a story from &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Workers’ toilets are reportedly unsanitary and insufficient, they say they lack air conditioning, and they claim their pay is low at CSAT Solutions, a company that acts as a repair partner for tech companies like Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TlrWzk"&gt;In the report, which is &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-repair-workers-sweatshop-csat-solutions-2021-7"&gt;worth reading in its entirety&lt;/a&gt;, employees also reportedly say there aren’t enough bathrooms or parking spots for the number of workers, and that they’re not allowed to use their phones while working, even in the case of family or personal emergencies. One employee told &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; that she got off work to discover that her son had been taken to the hospital after being burned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Su658a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some employees expected an environment that reflected the prestige of the Apple brand&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V4E92a"&gt;The working conditions alleged at CSAT took some employees by surprise, according to &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;, as they expected an environment reflective of the prestige that comes with the Apple brand. Instead, they reportedly faced quotas that were difficult to meet, and pay that ranged from $12 to $14 an hour, with little hope for raises or promotions. Some employees told &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; that they had to work 60 hours a week just to make ends meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uUWPKl"&gt;CSAT Solutions did not immediately comment in response to an emailed inquiry from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. CSAT representatives told &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; that the company has high standards for its workplace, and that it investigates employee complaints. In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, which can be read in full below, Apple said that it will be investigating the allegations, and that its focus is “making sure that everyone in [its] supply chain is protected and treated with dignity and respect.” Dell and Lenovo didn’t immediately respond to request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="73XQaj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Employees reportedly felt like their requests and concerns were unaddressed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kKaZ4E"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;, employees felt as if their previous concerns and reports to management had been ignored. Apple told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that it has assessed CSAT’s Houston location multiple times in recent years, but didn’t discuss its findings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="veJanZ"&gt;The practice of Apple visiting and inspecting suppliers’ facilities, however, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fsupplier-responsibility%2Fpdf%2FApple-Supplier-Code-of-Conduct-and-Supplier-Responsibility-Standards.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F27%2F22596784%2Fcsat-solutions-repair-facility-texas-apple-macbook-dell-lenovo-working-conditions-employees" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;seems to be routine&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) to the point that suppliers may be able to paint themselves in a more positive light. &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;’s report includes stories from multiple employees about being asked to carry out work in a more by-the-book fashion when Apple’s auditors were around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ypoowl"&gt;Apple told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it has the highest standards in the industry, and it has a page on its website &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fsupplier-responsibility%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F27%2F22596784%2Fcsat-solutions-repair-facility-texas-apple-macbook-dell-lenovo-working-conditions-employees" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;dedicated to talking about supplier responsibility&lt;/a&gt;. Still, the company’s suppliers have faced accusations of poor factory working conditions, with three stories about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/29/22204920/lens-technology-uighur-forced-labor-xinjiang-amazon-apple-tesla"&gt;forced labor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166286/apple-china-labor-violations-temporary-workers"&gt;labor law violations&lt;/a&gt; (where Apple allegedly turned a blind eye), and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/13/22172383/workers-protest-wistron-iphone-se-plant-india-pay"&gt;protests of pay reduction&lt;/a&gt; coming out in December 2020 alone. There’s also recently been the issue of Apple’s own employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453302/apple-culture-secrecy-leak-antonio-garcia-martinez-letter"&gt;fighting for the ability to work remotely&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WVeMCI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;CSAT also does work for Dell and Lenovo&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VFy9NR"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; report also raises concerns about CSAT’s usage of temp agencies to hire workers. According to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fsupplier-responsibility%2Fpdf%2FApple-Supplier-Code-of-Conduct-and-Supplier-Responsibility-Standards.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F27%2F22596784%2Fcsat-solutions-repair-facility-texas-apple-macbook-dell-lenovo-working-conditions-employees" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s Supplier Code of Conduct and Responsibility Standards&lt;/a&gt; (PDF), its standards also apply to subcontractors, and Apple’s suppliers are responsible for ensuring that the companies they hire are also in compliance. The responsibility, however, is not Apple’s alone — according to &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;, CSAT also does work for Dell and Lenovo. In particular, Dell’s logo shows up frequently &lt;a href="https://www.csat.com/about/"&gt;in the promotional video atop CSAT’s website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7d0adt"&gt;Employee reviews for CSAT Solutions on sites like &lt;a href="https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Csat-Solutions/reviews"&gt;Indeed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/CSAT-Solutions-Reviews-E483310.htm"&gt;Glassdoor&lt;/a&gt; echo some of the concerns brought up by &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;, with many &lt;a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-CSAT-Solutions-RVW38166423.htm"&gt;comparing working conditions to sweatshops&lt;/a&gt;, warning prospective employees about &lt;a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-CSAT-Solutions-RVW47647065.htm"&gt;low pay&lt;/a&gt;, and expressing dissatisfaction with &lt;a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-CSAT-Solutions-RVW46375146.htm"&gt;working hours&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-CSAT-Solutions-RVW45963998.htm"&gt;quotas&lt;/a&gt;. A few reviews also back up the claims about the cleanliness and availability of the bathrooms, the heat, and broken air conditioners, as well as the strict no-cellphone rules. There are a fair number of positive reviews as well, but many of them are from non-repair employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="odHgic"&gt;&lt;q&gt;60-hour workweeks are often mentioned in CSAT employee reviews&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="As7HOc"&gt;A job listing for a computer repair technician position at CSAT, found on the company’s website, says that candidates must be willing to work overtime, without saying how much. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fsupplier-responsibility%2Fpdf%2FApple-Supplier-Code-of-Conduct-and-Supplier-Responsibility-Standards.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F27%2F22596784%2Fcsat-solutions-repair-facility-texas-apple-macbook-dell-lenovo-working-conditions-employees" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s standards&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) state that workweeks have to be restricted to 60 hours, including overtime.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The job listing includes the line “This position will require the candidate to have some knowledge of computer components and be willing to work overtime.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Gn2i89r01_cYZNsp7M7tIaMmO8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22744454/Screen_Shot_2021_07_27_at_2.10.30_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A job listing from CSAT’s website.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="C22ptY"&gt;Here’s Apple’s full statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="NcrptJ"&gt;We uphold the highest standards in the industry and regularly assess our suppliers to ensure they comply. We have undertaken three assessments at CSAT in Houston in recent years, and Apple members regularly visit the site. We take all allegations seriously and will investigate. As always, our focus is on making sure that everyone in our supply chain is protected and treated with dignity and respect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fHwoDE"&gt;Apple is expanding which devices can use one of its previously M1-chip exclusive features in the fourth macOS Monterey beta. Live Text, the company’s new image scanning and text identifying feature, now runs on “all Mac computers that support macOS Monterey,” &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-12-beta-release-notes"&gt;according to new documentation&lt;/a&gt; Apple released. As tech video creator &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reneritchie/status/1420075589617209349?s=20"&gt;Rene Ritchie notes&lt;/a&gt;, that should mean Intel-based Macs. One user &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/khronokernel/status/1420085999376363522"&gt;claims to have gotten it to work&lt;/a&gt; on a Mac Pro from 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lpQPUO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522859/apple-live-text-photos-notes-ios-15-wwdc"&gt;Live Text&lt;/a&gt; digitizes the text found in photos, allowing for smart features like making information like phone numbers and addresses searchable and interactive in Apple Photos and the Camera app. The new feature was one of several macOS Monterey highlights &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22526224/macos-monterey-best-features-macs-intel-m1-exclusive"&gt;that Apple limited to its newer MacBook Airs, Pros, and iMacs&lt;/a&gt;, marking the company’s first real break in functionality between Macs running its custom-designed chips and those with Intel processors. Now that might no longer be the case.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Live Text is no longe exclusive to M1-devices in Apple’s fourth beta.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wDqeqp"&gt;Support for all devices that officially run Monterey should include Macs from as far back 2013, based off &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/monterey-preview/"&gt;Apple’s preview page&lt;/a&gt;. One thing that might have made it easier to bring Live Text to Intel: the Mac and iPhone use the feature in different ways. As Ritchie notes, the iPhone can process text live in-camera, a more demanding task than just analyzing a still photo. Since Macs don’t have an elaborate camera array to scan photos on the fly, they theoretically have a simpler time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tY5dKC"&gt;MacOS Monterey will be released this fall, but if you’re interested in trying out Apple’s beta software (ideally not on your main device), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22558991/macos-monterey-how-to-install-public-beta"&gt;you can follow our guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blizzard is removing unspecified inappropriate references from World of Warcraft</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GT_NRIkWw35_nyzZELnCMhgqkOo=/94x0:1107x675/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69642164/992UUQ8203471623805725796.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Activision Blizzard&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2tJDOP"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; team &lt;a href="https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/23703199/a-message-from-the-world-of-warcraft-team"&gt;has vowed to remove&lt;/a&gt; “references that are not appropriate for our world” in “the coming days” following California’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;major sexual harassment and workplace discrimination lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; filed against &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; developer Activision Blizzard last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7cTZb8"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; team’s statement Tuesday didn’t specify what “references” they would remove. But it seems possible that NPCs and items named for former &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; senior creative director Alex Afrasiabi may be taken out of the game — although Afrasiabi seemingly left Blizzard in June 2020, his stamp on the game remains, &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/blizzard-harasser-from-lawsuit-is-still-all-over-world-1847345457"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; reported Thursday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jWIjgQ"&gt;Afrasiabi was singled out in the lawsuit for his horrible behavior, which the Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) says included “blatant sexual harassment with little to no repercussions.” The complaint provides more detail, which I am prefacing with a &lt;strong&gt;content warning for descriptions of sexual harassment&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="EAbpuw"&gt;In a blatant example of Defendants’ refusal to deal with a harasser because of his seniority/position, Alex Afrasiabi, the former Senior Creative Director of World of Warcraft at Blizzard Entertainment, was permitted to engage in blatant sexual harassment with little to no repercussions. During a company event (an annual convention called Blizz Con) Afrasiabi would hit on female employees, telling him he wanted to marry them, attempting to kiss them, and putting, his arms around them. This was in plain view of other male employees, including supervisors, who had to intervene and pull him off female employees. Afrasiabi was so known to engage in harassment of females that his suite was nicknamed the “Crosby Suite” after alleged rapist Bill Crosby. Afrasiabi would also call females derogatory names at company events. Afrasiabi’s conduct was known to Blizzard Entertainment’s executives, who took no effective remedial measures. J. Allen Brack, President of Blizzard Entertainment, allegedly had multiple conversations with Afrasiabi about his drinking and that he had been “too friendly” towards female employees at company events but gave Afrasiabi a slap on the wrist (i.e. verbal counseling) in response to these incidents. Subsequently, Afrasiabi continued to make unwanted advances towards female employees, including grabbing a female employee’s hand and inviting her to his hotel room and groping another woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xM4KFj"&gt;The lawsuit also alleges that the &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; team allowed and encouraged extremely troubling behavior toward women. “Female employees working for the &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; team noted that male employees and supervisors would hit on them, make derogatory comments about rape, and otherwise engage in demeaning behavior,” according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0M34Sp"&gt;Here is the full statement published by the &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; team, which was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Warcraft/status/1420129038912278529"&gt;also posted on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Nt2i54"&gt;&lt;em&gt;It was clear from our team conversations that we wanted to put forth a statement that was representative of the World of Warcraft team’s sentiments. We asked all members of our team to send us their suggestions and feedback on how best to address the community and this is the result.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iToAYl"&gt;The past days have been a time of reflection for the World of Warcraft team, spent in conversation and contemplation, full of sadness, pain, and anger, but also hope and resolve. As we heed the brave women who have come forward to share their experiences, we stand committed to taking the actions necessary to ensure we are providing an inclusive, welcoming, and safe environment both for our team and for our players in Azeroth. Those of us in leadership understand that it is not our place to judge when we have achieved our goals, but rather for our team and our community to let us know when we still have more to do.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aoHde3"&gt;While we turn to our team for guidance in our internal work to protect marginalized groups and hold accountable those who threaten them, we also want to take immediate action in Azeroth to remove references that are not appropriate for our world. This work has been underway, and you will be seeing several such changes to both Shadowlands and WoW Classic in the coming days.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nQrqEf"&gt;We know that in order to rebuild trust, we must earn it with our actions in the weeks and months to come. But we go forward knowing that we share the same vision as our community about creating a place where people of all genders, ethnicities, sexual orientations, and backgrounds can thrive and proudly call home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fr92e4"&gt;—The World of Warcraft Team&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blizzard is encouraging its own employees to attend Wednesday’s walkout with paid time off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LIc5dUlfHqyK8Ir7rx7y_L77yFM=/8x0:1091x722/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69641809/TFEVVVUBSZIU1515612314418.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Blizzard&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wApCHQ"&gt;On Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595922/activision-blizzard-employees-walk-out-sexual-harassment"&gt;Activision Blizzard employees will walk out of work&lt;/a&gt; to protest the company’s response to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;a giant sexual harassment and workplace discrimination lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; filed by the state of California. Now Blizzard, the studio at the center of many of those specific allegations, is giving the protest its blessing. Blizzard leadership emailed studio employees today to let them know they won’t face repercussions for attending — and in fact, that they can have paid time off for the duration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWQ0Fq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; obtained a copy of the email, which we aren’t sharing here to avoid potentially identifying sources. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/8/18075936/google-walkout-protest-movement-sexual-harassmesnt-policy-change"&gt;After over 20 percent of Google employees walked out of work in 2018&lt;/a&gt; to protest that company’s mishandling of sexual harassment revelations (among other grievances), several Google Walkout organizers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18536996/google-walkout-organizers-hr-retaliation"&gt;said they faced retaliation&lt;/a&gt; despite the company’s supposed support of their cause. They &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/16/20695964/google-protest-leader-meredith-whittaker-leaves-company"&gt;left&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/19/21030681/google-claire-stapleton-walkout-organizer-retaliation-essay-go-read-this"&gt;got pushed out of the company&lt;/a&gt;. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) found earlier this year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421969/google-illegally-firing-three-workers-nlrb-president-biden"&gt;that Google “arguably violated” labor law&lt;/a&gt; by firing several other organizers as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="nWwgkF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"California sues Activision Blizzard over a culture of ‘constant sexual harassment’","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"},{"title":"Activision Blizzard employees to walk out following sexual harassment lawsuit","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595922/activision-blizzard-employees-walk-out-sexual-harassment"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="uu9JCE"&gt;Over 2,600 Activision Blizzard employees have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594882/activision-blizzard-employees-open-letter-management-california-sexual-harrassment-lawsuit"&gt;signed an letter&lt;/a&gt; condemning the company’s response to the state of California’s lawsuit. That’s nearly a third of the company, assuming it hasn’t grown or shrunken significantly since Activision Blizzard’s official tally of 9,500 employees in December 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok’s live video push continues with new features for creators and viewers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nu8Cvlu_t-dLsyPcJemDmXB3k08=/0x70:1656x1174/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69641209/Screen_Shot_2021_07_27_at_4.55.00_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bYKw3v"&gt;TikTok has announced a &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-live-features-2021"&gt;slew of new live video features&lt;/a&gt; coming to the popular video app platform for both creators and viewers, including scheduled “events,” picture-in-picture support for iOS and Android, and group livestreams with two users. It’s part of the company’s increased efforts to push users to create and &lt;a href="https://www.tiktokliveforcreators.com/#live-features"&gt;watch live videos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0QVZoO"&gt;A lot of the new features bring TikTok’s live platform up to par with other live video services, adding the ability for creators to schedule a stream in advance (which TikTok calls a “Live Event”) that viewers can register and receive notifications for. Creators will also be able to add countdown timers to regular TikTok videos in the form of a sticker to help promote their upcoming streams, too. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iA_K3ez5gug8ggT6UH0iGm8mrgs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22744170/Screen_Shot_2021_07_27_at_4.54.36_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YbnxBG"&gt;Also new is the ability to co-host a livestream with a second person (although &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/tiktok-expands-live-platform-with-new-features-for-creators-and-fans/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that TikTok is testing larger shared streams for the future, too). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Pacs9"&gt;TikTok is also expanding the rollout of its already announced Q&amp;amp;A feature for live videos to make it easier for hosts to engage with viewers in the middle of a stream. In a similar vein, though, TikTok is adding new comment filtering options to ban specific keywords from live chats, and the ability to designate moderators who can ban and mute misbehaving viewers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8JmF-lnf_YG7JZEbUaSgKrBVtpo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22744172/Screen_Shot_2021_07_27_at_4.53.58_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kzRJWn"&gt;Lastly, the company is making it easier to find and browse livesteams with a dedicated “Live” button that’s already started rolling out to viewers’ feeds. TikTok also supports iOS and Android’s picture-in-picture modes, allowing you to continue to watch TikTok livestreams even when not in the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XVA6cR"&gt;TikTok’s livestreaming features are still relatively new, especially compared to industry mainstays like YouTube or Instagram, but the new features that are rolling out today should help the social video platform better compete going forward. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The iPhone 12’s strong momentum helps Apple to another huge quarter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/clqtS7ecySzoTeZgPvBdsNcjy6Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69641031/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y7kEjW"&gt;Apple’s string of record-breaking earnings reports continued on Tuesday, with the company posting a strong fiscal third quarter that saw &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F07%2Fapple-reports-third-quarter-results%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F27%2F22596120%2Fapple-q3-2021-earnings-iphone-ipad-mac" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$81.43 billion in revenue&lt;/a&gt;. That’s a year-over-year increase of 36 percent and a new all-time record for the June quarter. It also crushes the $73 billion figure that analysts were expecting. Apple recorded a net quarterly profit of $21.7 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zWldca"&gt;This quarter is traditionally one of the slower periods for iPhone sales, as consumer interest begins shifting toward the next lineup of devices that Apple is expected to announce in September. But sales were still impressively up — by nearly 50 percent — compared to this time a year ago, reflecting continued momentum for Apple’s first 5G smartphones. Mobile carriers have also continued to aggressively push the iPhone 12 lineup with various promotional discounts and offers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tJp909"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576703/iphone-13-rumors-sizes-notch-camera-processor"&gt;Rumors strongly indicate&lt;/a&gt; that the iPhone 13, 13 Mini, 13 Pro, and 13 Pro Max will be iterative upgrades over last year’s phones. The upper-end models could gain a 120Hz display, with the rest of the lineup set for processor enhancements and larger, improved cameras. Apple is also expected to slightly shrink the notch cutout on this year’s iPhones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vgOZRg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;iPhone sales up nearly 50 percent&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EGS7dG"&gt;Mac and iPad sales were both up year over year, by 16.3 percent and 11.9 percent, respectively; CEO Tim Cook said that the Mac had its best June quarter ever, and the iPad’s was its best in “nearly a decade.” In recent months, Apple has shipped a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review"&gt;redesigned 24-inch iMac&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;updated iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;. These devices are the latest to use Apple’s in-house M1 chip, and they rank among some of the most powerful hardware the company has released to date. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro features a Mini LED display, a technology that is rumored to appear in a revamped MacBook Pro later this year. The 16-inch MacBook Pro, Mac Pro, and larger-sized iMac have yet to make the transition to Apple’s own silicon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nnCArT"&gt;Apple continues to focus heavily on its services, which hit an all-time revenue high in the June quarter. In an effort to continue fueling Apple Music’s growth, Apple rolled out a new lossless streaming tier and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"&gt;Dolby Atmos spatial audio&lt;/a&gt; for its premium music service in June. &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;, one of Apple TV Plus’ marquee originals, just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22590155/ted-lasso-apple-tv-plus-season-2-review"&gt;returned for its second season&lt;/a&gt;. And Apple launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22534960/apple-podcasts-subscriptions-channels-shows-app"&gt;podcast subscriptions and channels last month, as well&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gb2SyK"&gt;Beta testing is underway for the next wave of Apple’s major software updates, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"&gt;iOS 15, iPadOS 15&lt;/a&gt;, tvOS 15, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22557880/apple-macos-public-beta-facetime-safari-updates"&gt;macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt;, and watchOS 8. They’ll all be officially released this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HX0b6J"&gt;Even as business keeps soaring, Apple continues to face significant regulatory scrutiny over antitrust concerns and the company’s commanding influence over the iPhone’s App Store. It’s barely removed from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22546286/apple-tim-cook-nancy-pelosi-google-amazon-facebook-antitrust-lobbying"&gt;an acrimonious trial with Epic Games&lt;/a&gt;. And with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22527709/lina-khan-ftc-commissioner-competition-facebook-amazon-google-apple"&gt;FTC now led by an antitrust pioneer&lt;/a&gt; and lawmakers in the United States considering a range of antitrust legislation, CEO Tim Cook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22546286/apple-tim-cook-nancy-pelosi-google-amazon-facebook-antitrust-lobbying"&gt;reportedly called Speaker Nancy Pelosi&lt;/a&gt; to warn against pushing through rushed policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WZKgwt"&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk took an opportunity to criticize Apple for its “walled garden” during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594778/tesla-q2-2021-earnings-revenue-profit-credits-emissions-bitcoin"&gt;his company’s quarterly earnings&lt;/a&gt; call on Monday. “I think we do want to emphasize that our goal is to support the advent of sustainable energy,” he said. “It is not to create a walled garden and use that to bludgeon our competitors which is used by some companies.” Musk then faked a cough and said “Apple.” Apple is believed to still be at work on its own electric vehicle, among other projects like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22367715/tim-cook-augmented-reality-apple-car-hints-interview"&gt;augmented reality glasses&lt;/a&gt; that are likely to launch much earlier than the car. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>eBay cyberstalking conspirator sentenced to 18 months in prison</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="eBay new logo STOCK" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cJXHR48i0T_nBQHk_zxXT5P5x-s=/0x1:1020x681/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69640971/ebay-logo-stock_1020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NXrbZM"&gt;Former eBay security manager Philip Cooke has been sentenced to 18 months in prison for his role in an intense stalking campaign against a pair of eBay critics. A Massachusetts judge &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.223153/gov.uscourts.mad.223153.23.0.pdf"&gt;issued the sentence&lt;/a&gt; nine months after Cooke &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/pr/former-ebay-employee-pleads-guilty-aggressive-cyberstalking-campaign"&gt;pleaded guilty&lt;/a&gt; to conspiracy to commit cyberstalking and conspiracy to tamper with witnesses. He’s the first of seven former eBay employees to be sentenced after the Justice Department &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21291666/ebay-employees-arrested-journalist-harassment"&gt;revealed the scheme&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pBupbZ"&gt;In comments &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-27/ex-ebay-security-manager-gets-18-months-in-cyberstalking-case"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, US District Judge Allison Burroughs called the case — which saw eBay employees harassing husband-and-wife publishing team Ina and David Steiner with a funeral wreath, live cockroaches, and a bloody-faced pig mask — “just nuts.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0LFt7b"&gt;Cooke, a former police officer, admitted to attending a 2019 meeting where eBay employees plotted a Twitter harassment campaign against the Steiners and their publication &lt;em&gt;EcommerceBytes&lt;/em&gt;. He was involved in later discussions about more serious offenses, including mailing the threatening items and traveling to the couple’s home to conduct surveillance, and he helped sabotage a police investigation into the crime. “The idea of all these grown people sitting around coming up with this plan is unfathomable to me,” Burroughs said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pQ6uMf"&gt;In addition to his prison sentence, Cooke will face three years of supervised release and a $15,000 fine, both of which were requested by federal prosecutors. Four of Cooke’s fellow conspirators also &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/pr/two-former-ebay-employees-plead-guilty-aggressive-cyberstalking-campaign-targeting-nati-0"&gt;pleaded guilty&lt;/a&gt; last year, and the Steiners have &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/07/lawsuit-ebay-tried-to-terrorize-stalk-and-silence-couple-that-ran-news-site/"&gt;filed a civil lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rsAuee"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The idea of all these grown people sitting around coming up with this plan is unfathomable to me”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uMcvb7"&gt;Prosecutors had &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.223153/gov.uscourts.mad.223153.21.0.pdf"&gt;asked the court&lt;/a&gt; for a prison sentence of two and a half years for Cooke, describing his actions as part of a “three-week nightmare” for the journalists. “Cooke ignored the better part of his professional life to protect himself and his friends. Worse, Cooke used his insider’s knowledge of how police departments investigate crime to help obstruct the NPD investigation,” reads a sentencing memorandum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rtm7tU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.223153/gov.uscourts.mad.223153.20.0.pdf"&gt;Cooke claimed&lt;/a&gt; he advised against the stalking campaign and believed many of its activities were never carried out. He said the plan’s alleged architect — former eBay senior director of safety and security James Baugh, who has not pleaded guilty — had a pattern of “messing with him” through inappropriate and “incredible” messages. And he blamed his behavior partly on a drinking problem exacerbated by eBay’s culture, saying &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.223153/gov.uscourts.mad.223153.20.0.pdf"&gt;in a sentencing memorandum&lt;/a&gt; that “drinking was part of the culture, with alcohol present throughout the office space where it was typical to take morning shots of alcohol with coworkers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aEttpJ"&gt;Prosecutors claimed that high-level executives — including former CEO Devin Wenig — bore a bitter grudge against the Steiners for their critical coverage of eBay. Baugh allegedly began his harassment campaign after a text conversation with Wenig and communications chief Steve Wymer, with Wenig saying it was time to “take her down.” But neither man was charged as part of the scheme. eBay, which was also not charged, &lt;a href="https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/ebay-inc-issues-statement-regarding-indictments-of-previously-terminated-employees/"&gt;issued an apology&lt;/a&gt; but said it found “no evidence” that Wenig had known of the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google sets all-time records as search and YouTube profits soar</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PKKPUQGaljeA6tZdeYSHOGVgYXk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69640969/acastro_180130_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TGbFd8"&gt;Last quarter, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22404046/google-alphabet-q1-2021-earnings"&gt;Google roared out of the post-pandemic-peak period&lt;/a&gt; with a record $17.9 billion in profit, finally joining other tech giants &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348652/pandemic-earnings-antitrust-google-facebook-apple-amazon"&gt;that had been raking it in&lt;/a&gt; despite (or perhaps because of) the rise of COVID-19. But Alphabet’s Q2 2021 earnings do it one better — the company just set an all-time record revenue of $61.9 billion this quarter, and record profits for the fourth quarter in a row at $18.5 billion. Some of the numbers the company’s posting today (&lt;a href="https://abc.xyz/investor/static/pdf/2021Q2_alphabet_earnings_release.pdf?cache=4db52a1"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) are nearly double those it reported a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmeOYZ"&gt;Google search appears to be the big driver, shooting up over $14 billion since this time last year to $35.8 billion total (that’s nearly $4 billion higher than it did last quarter as well). YouTube advertising revenue grew tremendously as well, nearly doubling to $7 billion, compared to $3.8 billion last year. That’s $1 billion more than YouTube pulled in last quarter, too. The company also says its YouTube Shorts have been a huge success, hitting 15 billion global daily views (up from 6.5 billion in March).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGJvXr"&gt;As you can see from Jon Erlichman’s tweet below, we don’t see this kind of growth every year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2smyHb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="fr" dir="ltr"&gt;Google’s second quarter revenue:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2021: $61.9 billion&lt;br&gt;2020: $38.3 billion&lt;br&gt;2019: $38.9 billion&lt;br&gt;2018: $32.7 billion&lt;br&gt;2017: $26.0 billion&lt;br&gt;2016: $21.5 billion&lt;br&gt;2015: $17.7 billion&lt;br&gt;2014: $15.9 billion&lt;br&gt;2013: $13.1 billion&lt;br&gt;2012: $11.8 billion&lt;br&gt;2011:   $9.0 billion&lt;br&gt;2010:  $6.8 billion&lt;/p&gt;— Jon Erlichman (@JonErlichman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JonErlichman/status/1420115801990909956?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4DCPrc"&gt;One big question was whether this would be the quarter Alphabet’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22263048/google-cloud-loss-alphabet-q4-2020-earnings"&gt;fast-growing Google Cloud business&lt;/a&gt; would stop hemorrhaging cash, after the bleeding slowed to just under a billion &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22404046/google-alphabet-q1-2021-earnings"&gt;in Q1&lt;/a&gt;. While the division still isn’t profitable, Q2 shows it only lost $591 million, as it grew revenue from $4 billion last quarter to $4.6 billion this one. (Cloud did $3 billion last year.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EZe9Dt"&gt;Wondering how Google’s hardware business is doing ahead of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446078/google-pixel-6-pro-leak-specs-camera-screen"&gt;a possible new Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; and maybe &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588440/google-wear-os-3-update-smartwatch-samsung-2022"&gt;a new stab at smartwatches&lt;/a&gt; later this year? Unfortunately, Google doesn’t break out hardware numbers yet, but there is a “Google other” category which includes other items as well. It’s now pulling in $6.6 billion in revenue, up from $5.1 billion a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KG4ywk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The iPhone 12’s strong momentum helps Apple to another huge quarter","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596120/apple-q3-2021-earnings-iphone-ipad-mac"},{"title":"Microsoft reports weaker Surface and Windows revenue amid global chip shortage","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596578/microsoft-q4-2021-earnings-revenue-xbox-cloud-services-surface-gaming"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="XURvEj"&gt;On the Q2 earnings call, Google CBO Philipp Schindler suggested the high numbers were due to consumer spending — as has been the story for a while now, the pandemic has contributed to a huge surge in shopping, and as a giant advertiser with both search and YouTube, Google’s poised to benefit.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jC9VvL"&gt;CFO Ruth Porat did suggest the company will have more sales and marketing expenses later this year to support some holiday product launches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DbOzDT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q2 was the fourth straight quarter of record profit for Alphabet, not the third. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
