    <title>Google’s answer to the problems of open plan offices? Inflatable walls</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HC2pcJ"&gt;Google is redesigning its offices for the post-pandemic world, and &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; has &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/30/technology/google-back-to-office-workers.html"&gt;a big report full of pictures and videos&lt;/a&gt; outlining the company’s plans. But if I had to sum up the tech giant’s approach in two words I would choose “over” and “engineered.” Google has ambitious plans to shake up its offices, but some of them seem needlessly complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cFdFxl"&gt;As the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; notes, the standard for Silicon Valley offices has long been open plan, with designers and developers working by cheek by jowl in the name of “spontaneous collaboration.” (Though this is often a pretext to cut costs by cramming as many workers into pricey real estate as possible.) But, in a cautious COVID-conscious culture neither cramming nor cubicles can cut it: people want space, man. At least six feet of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g0ahdO"&gt;Here’s the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, paraphrasing concerns from Google’s VP for real estate and workplace services, David Radcliffe:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="qeE1Ct"&gt;&lt;em&gt;In its current office configurations, Google said it would be able to use only one out of every three desks in order to keep people six feet apart. Mr. Radcliffe said six feet would remain an important threshold in case of the next pandemic or even the annual flu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fAHRJh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Psychologically, he said, employees will not want to sit in a long row of desks, and also Google may need to “de-densify” offices with white space such as furniture or plants. The company is essentially unwinding years of open-office plan theory popularized by Silicon Valley — that cramming more workers into smaller spaces and taking away their privacy leads to better collaboration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OFAOwb"&gt;This makes sense! But Google’s approach to implementing these changes in its Mountain View offices are a mixed bag. Here are some of the methods mentioned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="YRxhNN"&gt;Instead of rows of desks and meeting rooms, Google will use “Team Pods” containing “[c]hairs, desks, whiteboards and storage units on casters” that can be “wheeled into various arrangements, and in some cases rearranged in a matter of hours”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IxOUM8"&gt;To create temporary divides between open plan desks, the company is testing inflatable robot walls that can be wheeled around and blown up like a bounce house.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9WowNm"&gt;“[A] fabric-based overhead air duct system that attaches with zippers and can be moved over a weekend for different seating arrangements.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MDBLpQ"&gt;To accommodate remote workers in meetings, a new semi-circular “campfire” meeting room alternates seats for those physically present with screens for those calling in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="A7i8gZ"&gt;More outdoor work and meeting spaces, with tables and chairs in open-air tents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QXMAXY"&gt;To make hot-desking easier, Google is testing a workstation that remembers users’ settings, adjusting the local temperature and height and tilt of the monitor based on a worker’s card swipe. It even “brings up family photos on a display” for that cubicle feeling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kjMVKD"&gt;Optional “leaf-shaped partitions” called “petals” can be attached to desks to “to eliminate glare” and office chairs with built-in speakers in the headrest will play white noise “to muffle nearby audio.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dL83HMLH5DgJaonQ8EBOIvUtIuQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22480829/inflatable_robot_wall_small.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/30/technology/google-back-to-office-workers.html" target="_blank"&gt;Cayce Clifford for &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The inflatable robot wall in action&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dAS1e6"&gt;Again, some of these sound great. Who wouldn’t want more outdoor space in their office or meeting rooms that are more welcoming for remote workers? But the focus on &lt;em&gt;modularity&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;adaptiveness&lt;/em&gt; seems like a recipe for disaster. The mix of inflatable privacy shields, fabric air ducts, dynamic hot-desks, clip-on desk partitions, and rearrangeable desks and storage make it sound like employees will have to build their office from scratch each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vxElEQ"&gt;Indeed, some of these solutions are trying to solve problems that only exist in the first place &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; of open plan offices. You don’t need speakers blasting white noise at your head or removable partitions to reduce glare if you’ve got a room of your own to work in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DRts16"&gt;I’m sure the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; is playing up some of these more bizarre elements, and it’s not like Google employees are known for the hardships they face. (Play a tune on an appropriately-sized violin for the closure of the company’s complimentary massage rooms.) But it does baffle me somewhat that such complicated solutions need to be created in the first place. Maybe old-fashioned offices (with appropriate ventilation) could be the answer? Specially if you don’t have to fit in as many employees because more are working from home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fBVIT6"&gt;I may be alone in this, but I’ve always quite fancied a genuine, honest-to-goodness, walls-and-a-door office of my own. That was true pre-pandemic and it’ll be true post-pandemic, too. Ironically, it’s only being forced to work remotely that’s meant I’ve created a decent working space in my own home for the first time. If only I could get the same at the office.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is cracking down on scammy Play Store app listings</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mAV1xOaeinCYnUeOYCWP2UVvNuc=/0x0:801x534/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69210776/BadExample_Emoticons.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of the kind of listing that will be prohibited under the new policy.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pEyPiC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/04/updated-guidance-to-improve-your-app.html"&gt;Google has announced&lt;/a&gt; new Play Store policies and guidelines designed to make app listings more succinct, accurate, and less of an eyesore. New guidelines affecting the screenshots and videos meant to demonstrate an app’s features and functionality will come into force in the second half of 2021, while specific details about the enforcement of new policies for app titles, icons, and descriptions are coming “later this year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aK3ByR"&gt;The new app metadata policies will ban a variety of tricks that app developers use to make their app listings excessively eye-catching. Writing words in all-caps will no longer be allowed unless it’s the name of a brand, and neither will including emoji in app names. App titles will be limited to 30 characters, and they can’t “incentivize installs” by including a phrase like “download now.” Trying to promote deals by including a “Sale” banner in an app icon is also being banned.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P1ILMy6pCoxQxUsWNTbgLEZTE-w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22480745/BadExample_PlayPrograms_Categories.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Incentivizing installs via an app’s title is being banned.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nnjBA5jdkby30rP7EeVuCcXQXPM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22480744/BadExample_StorePerformance.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;As is implying an app is top-ranked.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JHlU2b"&gt;Google calls this week’s blog post a “pre-announcement” designed to help developers plan for the upcoming changes. However, when the policies governing app title, icon, and developer name come into effect, Google says that apps that violate the policies “will not be allowed on Google Play.” It says that more details on the changes will arrive later in the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EK77KL"&gt;Separately, the new guidelines about app preview assets will come into effect in the second half of the year. These guidelines ask that graphics, videos, and short descriptions “accurately represent” apps and games, “provide enough information” to users, don’t use buzzwords like “free” or “best,” and are localized correctly. “Assets that don’t meet our guidelines may be ineligible for promotion and recommendation on major Google Play surfaces like Apps and Games home,” Google says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JAKPPF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wnSBV7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EU accuses Apple of App Store antitrust violations after Spotify complaint</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VqtFOuFebY1LbsCuVX4Zn5glh60=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69210747/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="l4xjY4"&gt;The European Commission is issuing antitrust charges against Apple over concerns about the company’s App Store practices. The Commission &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_2061"&gt;has found&lt;/a&gt; that Apple has broken EU competition rules with its App Store policies, following an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/13/18263453/spotify-apple-app-store-antitrust-complaint-ec-30-percent-cut-unfair"&gt;initial complaint from Spotify&lt;/a&gt; back in 2019. Specifically, the Commission believes Apple has a “dominant position in the market for the distribution of music streaming apps through its App Store.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O2aX30"&gt;The EU has focused on two rules that Apple imposes on developers: the mandatory use of Apple’s in-app purchase system (for which Apple charges a 30 percent cut), and a rule forbidding app developers to inform users of other purchasing options outside of apps. The Commission has found that the 30 percent commission fee, or “Apple tax” as it’s often referred to, has resulted in higher prices for consumers. “Most streaming providers passed this fee on to end users by raising prices,” according to the European Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hFR5pP"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Our preliminary conclusion: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Apple&lt;/a&gt; is in breach of EU competition law. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppleMusic?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AppleMusic&lt;/a&gt; compete with other music streaming services. But &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Apple&lt;/a&gt; charges high commission fees on rivals in the App store &amp;amp; forbids them to inform of alternative subscription options. Consumers losing out.&lt;/p&gt;— Margrethe Vestager (@vestager) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vestager/status/1388071379094982659?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2VYy8v"&gt;“Apple’s rules distort competition in the market for music streaming services by raising the costs of competing music streaming app developers,” says a statement from the EU. “This in turn leads to higher prices for consumers for their in-app music subscriptions on iOS devices.” The EU has also sent Apple a statement of objections, which is essentially a list of how the Commission believes Apple has violated competition rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uOdCJp"&gt;This is the initial, formal stage of antitrust proceedings against Apple, and the company will have the chance to respond to the Commission’s list of objections within the next 12 weeks. This specific case is limited to Apple’s App Store practices for music streaming, and the EU is investigating additional separate cases on ebooks and the App Store in general. “This is not the last case we will have when it comes to the App Store,” said European commissioner Margrethe Vestager in a press conference this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yvwu7E"&gt;Vestager also revealed the Commission is taking an interest in Apple’s policies around games on the App Store. “We also take an interest in the gaming app market,” said Vestager, responding to a question about the money involved in gaming apps on the App Store. “That’s really early days when it comes to that.” Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/19/21296657/microsoft-apple-app-store-antitrust-comments"&gt;called on regulators to investigate the App Store last year&lt;/a&gt;, just a couple of months before a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357771/apple-cloud-gaming-microsoft-xcloud-google-stadia-ios-app-store-guidelines-violations"&gt;public spat with Apple&lt;/a&gt; over its xCloud game streaming service.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9Uu-KLuKdNnlK8sa1T0vd91UANM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16334298/microsoft_xcloud_e3_2019_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Nick Statt / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The EU may look into gaming apps on the App Store, too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WN6Lnc"&gt;Apple now faces a fine of up to 10 percent of its annual revenue if it’s found guilty of breaking EU rules, which could be as high as $27 billion based on Apple’s annual revenue of $274.5 billion last year. Apple could also be forced to change its business model, which has more damaging and lasting effects than a fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fGyeEf"&gt;Spotify has welcomed the initial charges. “Ensuring the iOS platform operates fairly is an urgent task with far-reaching implications,” says Horacio Gutierrez, Spotify’s chief legal officer. “The European Commission’s statement of objections is a critical step toward holding Apple accountable for its anticompetitive behavior, ensuring meaningful choice for all consumers and a level playing field for app developers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jlGqEp"&gt;Apple has also responded to the EU’s findings in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="jMHOy5"&gt;“Spotify has become the largest music subscription service in the world, and we’re proud for the role we played in that. Spotify does not pay Apple any commission on over 99% of their subscribers, and only pays a 15% commission on those remaining subscribers that they acquired through the App Store. At the core of this case is Spotify’s demand they should be able to advertise alternative deals on their iOS app, a practice that no store in the world allows. Once again, they want all the benefits of the App Store but don’t think they should have to pay anything for that. The Commission’s argument on Spotify’s behalf is the opposite of fair competition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="7ren1R"&gt;Central to this entire case is the 30 percent cut that Apple takes on subscriptions. Companies like Netflix and Spotify have long opposed this so-called Apple tax, but Apple has argued that the revenue contributes toward the costs of maintaining the App Store and enforcing its various content, privacy, and security policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BPZH40"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/6/18530894/apple-music-monopoly-spotify-app-store-europe"&gt;Spotify previously claimed&lt;/a&gt; that Apple uses its App Store to stifle innovation and limit consumer choice in favor of its own Apple Music service. That complaint was followed up with a similar one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21292625/apple-rakuten-kobo-app-store-antitrust-complaint-europe"&gt;by Rakuten&lt;/a&gt;, alleging that it’s anti-competitive for Apple to take a 30 percent commission on ebooks sold through the App Store while promoting its own Apple Books service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lVGfEE"&gt;Epic Games also joined many developers and companies opposing Apple’s App Store policies, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22286998/epic-games-apple-european-comission-antitrust-complaint-app-store-fortnite"&gt;filed an antitrust complaint&lt;/a&gt; with the EU earlier this year. It’s part of an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know/archives"&gt;ongoing dispute with Apple&lt;/a&gt;, after the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;developer publicly criticized Apple’s App Store policies around distribution and payments. This resulted in Epic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366259/epic-fortnite-vbucks-mega-drop-discount-iphone-android"&gt;attempting to circumvent&lt;/a&gt; Apple’s 30 percent cut on in-app purchases in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite, and &lt;/em&gt;Apple quickly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;removing the game from its App Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pp0rbg"&gt;Apple has eased some of its policies over the past year, as the pushback against the App Store grows louder. Apple now lets some video streaming apps &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21203630/apple-amazon-prime-video-ios-app-store-cut-exempt-program-deal"&gt;bypass the App Store cut&lt;/a&gt;, and it has reduced its App Store &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;commission rate to 15 percent&lt;/a&gt; for any developer that earns less than $1 million in annual revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Coinbase now lets you buy cryptocurrency with your PayPal account</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/doS28LXxd_NoRPDZ5n9Nmmw61zk=/87x0:614x351/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69210554/1_EDmBagfVu5kYfH95xOCLDA.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;PayPal is now available as a payment method for US Coinbase users.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Coinbase&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rdZnoW"&gt;Coinbase has added the option for users to buy cryptocurrency using their PayPal accounts in the US, the &lt;a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/a-new-way-to-buy-crypto-on-coinbase-using-paypal-e9162f735dcb"&gt;company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. It says the feature offers a “familiar and trusted” experience for users buying any of the &lt;a href="https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/getting-started/getting-started-with-coinbase/supported-cryptocurrencies"&gt;numerous cryptocurrencies&lt;/a&gt; that the exchange currently supports, and using PayPal as an intermediary means you don’t have to give your bank account or debit card information directly to the cryptocurrency exchange. The feature will expand to other countries in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VRIDJt"&gt;To use the new option, Coinbase says you can add your PayPal account via the “Add a payment method” option, which links to the PayPal login screen. Purchases made via PayPal are capped at $25,000 a day, or 0.46 Bitcoin as of this writing. Debit cards and bank accounts linked to a PayPal account can be used to buy cryptocurrencies, but a &lt;a href="https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/getting-started/add-a-payment-method/paypal-faq#:~:text=prepaid%20cards%2C%20business%20cards%2C%20and%20credit%20cards%20linked%20to%20your%20paypal%20account%20are%20not%20currently%20supported%20by%20coinbase."&gt;Coinbase FAQ notes&lt;/a&gt; the feature doesn’t support payment methods like prepaid cards or credit cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oL5Yg3SkxufAj78uQNT-3yxirjs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22480708/1_hD2y9sfhbtm6uey_UjcXaQ.gif"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A PayPal account can be added from the “Add a payment method” screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JwCoex"&gt;The news is part of PayPal’s broader trend towards embracing cryptocurrency. In November last year, the company started letting US users buy, sell, and hold cryptocurrencies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562771/paypal-cryptocurrency-buy-sell-bitcoin-ethereum-litecoin-us-users"&gt;directly from their PayPal accounts&lt;/a&gt;, and this year it rolled out the option for users to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22357246/paypal-buy-with-bitcoin-litecoin-ethereum-crypto-checkout"&gt;pay with cryptocurrency held in their PayPal account&lt;/a&gt; (though this is converted to local currency before a merchant is paid). PayPal currently only supports four cryptocurrencies natively — Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash — compared to the dozens available on Coinbase.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple adds a way to speed up searches on the App Store by suggesting words</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I84pK6Ff1OVJoG3QqhzZ_U6t_s4=/266x0:1129x575/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69208989/Image_21.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qFFjoR"&gt;Apple has added &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppStore/status/1387865090007908357?s=20"&gt;a new App Store search suggestions feature&lt;/a&gt; in the US, Canada, Australia, and the UK, that might make it easier to find apps. Now, after typing in a search term, the App Store will attempt to predict what you’re looking for and offer suggested words that, when tapped, will further narrow down your search results and speed up your hunt for specific kinds of apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OlpL1h"&gt;Search suggestions actually appeared on some iPhones earlier in April as part of a test, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/08/app-store-search-tags/"&gt;according to MacRumors&lt;/a&gt;, but now the feature should be rolling out to all iPhones in the supported regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vzex1Z"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;  Introducing search suggestions on the App Store!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Select (or deselect) multiple suggestions to refine your search so you can find even more amazing apps and games.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Search suggestions roll out today starting with the USA, Canada, the UK, and Australia. &lt;a href="https://t.co/viaZHlCZMb"&gt;pic.twitter.com/viaZHlCZMb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— App Store (@AppStore) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppStore/status/1387865090007908357?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ahMf2E"&gt;Using search suggestions is pretty simple. Let’s say I’m looking for an app to help me make some pizza from scratch: I can type “pizza” in the App Store’s search field and see additional words pop up like “maker,” “game,” “call,” “calculator,” or “order.” Selecting one of those suggestions filters the results further, so choosing calculator will pull up apps for calculating the correct ratio ingredients for pizza dough (surprisingly there’s a lot of those). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HCpMupZchS3unTOR5WbablRSkHA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22479656/Image_20.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hunting for “pizza calculators” using the new App Store search suggestions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bTN0i6"&gt;Currently, not every search allows you to select multiple suggestions. I was able to refine Apple’s example of “food” with “delivery” and “Indian,” but my other sample searches only gave me one filter each. Not every search brings up a suggested filter, either. We’ve reached out to Apple for clarification on when suggestions appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p3J5PB"&gt;What does consistently show up in search are ads, which Apple originally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/6/13184346/apple-app-store-ads"&gt;added to App Store search in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. It’s easy to see how my plan to make pizza from scratch could get derailed by a big Uber Eats or Papa John’s ad above my helpful dough calculator app. Ordering delivery is so much easier than doing math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="45Z4KY"&gt;Those ads are likely to inflame Apple’s App Store critics further — they’ll no doubt argue that an indie developer trying to make it easier to figure out the ratios of water to flour in pizza shouldn’t have to compete with Uber’s ad budget, the same way &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1019859186224594944?s=20"&gt;they think competing apps shouldn’t be buying ads in front of one another’s products&lt;/a&gt; while Apple profits from the result. But every change to a search engine has winners and losers, and it’s not yet clear whether this one will make it easier or harder for small developers to get more exposure. They could wind up being helpful for everyone who uses the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NCWHHB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic Games v. Apple: the fight for the future of the App Store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RicCkIxRkoBro3EhEkKhuc-Xz_U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69208985/acastro_210429_1777_epicApple_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;All the news about the huge trial&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="NIDuFm"&gt;After months of preparation, Epic Games will finally take on Apple in court in a trial that could fundamentally change the makeup of the App Store. The fight dates back to August, when Epic added a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366259/epic-fortnite-vbucks-mega-drop-discount-iphone-android"&gt;direct payment mechanism&lt;/a&gt; to its hit battle royale game &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; in violation of Apple’s rules. The iPhone maker quickly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;removed the game from the App Store&lt;/a&gt;, and Epic responded shortly after with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367963/epic-fortnite-legal-complaint-apple-ios-app-store-removal-injunctive-relief"&gt;an antitrust lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; aiming to establish the App Store as a monopoly. The case will finally be brought to trial starting May 3rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0C56NR"&gt;The trial promises to deliver huge revelations about the inner workings of one of the biggest and most influential companies in the world, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22405894/epic-apple-store-fortnite-trial-kickoff-witnesses-list"&gt;with testimony&lt;/a&gt; from Apple CEO Tim Cook, Craig Federighi, Phil Schiller, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney, and more. We’ve already made some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406303/imessage-android-eddy-cue-emails-apple-epic-deposition"&gt;fascinating&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407939/fortnite-biggest-platform-revenue-playstation-not-ios-iphone"&gt;discoveries&lt;/a&gt; from documents published ahead of the trial, and there’s sure to be a lot more news ahead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yoXeg2"&gt;You can follow along with everything right here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft reveals how Halo Infinite will look on 32:9 super ultrawide monitors and other PC perks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/25jdpS3_pbawHfPmTWnzWWZ6MOk=/293x0:3548x2170/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69208870/halo_infinite_32_9.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;I wish I’d had this to test with Samsung’s Odyssey G9&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="eq9aV4"&gt;Microsoft has something of a history of neglecting PC gaming, but it’s trying to change that in a big way — by promising its flagship &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Infinite &lt;/em&gt;will feel like a native PC game when it arrives later this year. We’ve known for many months that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21364626/xbox-series-x-pc-game-pass-xcloud-strategy"&gt;it wouldn’t be the Xbox Series X’s killer app&lt;/a&gt;, but Microsoft’s trying to make PC gamers feel like first-class citizens too, with features as forward-looking as support for 32:9 super-ultrawide monitors &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21590961/samsung-odyssey-g9-review-ultrawide-monitor-price-specs"&gt;like the Samsung Odyssey G9 I reviewed late last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BzzBzs"&gt;This morning, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409334/halo-infinite-crossplay-cross-progression-xbox-pc"&gt;we learned the game would support ultrawide monitors&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to triple-keybinds, advanced graphics options, and both crossplay and cross-progression between Xbox and Windows PCs. But this evening, &lt;a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/news/inside-infinite-april-2021"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Halo Waypoint&lt;/em&gt; blog went way deeper&lt;/a&gt;, revealing what &lt;em&gt;Infinite&lt;/em&gt; will look like at 32:9 and an array of other PC-gamer-friendly details like being able to adjust your field of view up to 120 degrees — and the ability to host your own LAN multiplayer server!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YhfhbNV7_sROGyUkyhRV_zfAP3s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22479784/halo_infinite_32_9_003.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jgk7X0"&gt;In my Samsung Odyssey G9 review, I bemoaned how even the games that &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; support 32:9 typically look abnormally, wildly stretched out on each side, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21590961/samsung-odyssey-g9-review-ultrawide-monitor-price-specs"&gt;providing over a dozen examples&lt;/a&gt; of how they don’t properly adjust the shape and curvature of the window they’re opening into the 3D game world. But &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; PC development lead Mike Romero says the game’s designed to support arbitrary window sizes, and can fit its HUD, menus, and even in-game cutscenes into the wider aspect ratios. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gm3b63hwxUTcnL1S27cKnDVg--4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22479797/halo_infinite_32_9_005.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EcparD"&gt;“There’s dozens of people across the studio that have had to put dedicated effort into supporting something like ultrawide throughout the entirety of the game, and I’m very excited to say I think we’ll have some of the best ultrawide support I’ve ever seen in a game,” boasts Romero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O7tLXL"&gt;Looking at these &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;images at 32:9, it’s not immediately clear to me that Microsoft has solved the 32:9 issue — looking at the hill on the right of this image below, for instance, it seems like the game world still might appear a little bit skewed and warped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/coEBGFvbXyz2D40fGDyDJDXa-ls=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22479789/halo_infinite_32_9_006.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ls7wgt"&gt;But it is clear that you’ll see a lot more of the game world at once this way, if you’re one of the few who’ve ascended to an ultrawide monitor — and have a PC powerful enough to drive it, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uSrnfTTeKEUzTOiNP2L4QOS6Wt4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22479795/halo_infinite_32_9_004.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rll32H"&gt;Here’s a short list of all the PC-esque perks Microsoft is promising:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="fMAZjg"&gt;LAN play, hosting a local multiplayer server on PC that you can join from both PC and Xbox &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1ThHcF"&gt;Crossplay, restricting ranked matches to input type rather than console vs. PC, with server-side anti-cheat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="f0gJBy"&gt;Adjustable FOV (up to 120 degrees) on both PC and console&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WzXoY4"&gt;Mouse and keyboard support on both PC and console&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="b080kx"&gt;Triple keyboard and mouse bindings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="szE50I"&gt;Visual quality settings up to ultra presets on PC, with individual settings for texture quality, depth of field, anti-aliasing etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8lSq3R"&gt;High refresh rate options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Aum5A8"&gt;21:9, 32:9 “and beyond” ultrawide monitor support on PC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jNmNbZ"&gt;Minimum and maximum framerate settings on PC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5vGJYS"&gt;Fixed and dynamic resolution scaling options on PC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="i7wPlg"&gt;Optional borderless fullscreen on PC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Mo4hM4"&gt;FPS and ping overlay on PC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SVOSei"&gt;Out-of-game multiplayer invites let you join games through Xbox Live, Discord and Steam&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="EhwCPN"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1387908351074394117"&gt;my colleague Tom Warren notes&lt;/a&gt;, there’s still more to learn, like whether the game will support GPU-dependent features on PC &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22348095/nintendo-switch-nvidia-dlss-graphics-ai-explained"&gt;like Nvidia’s framerate-enhancing DLSS&lt;/a&gt;, ray tracing, and more. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Among Us is finally coming to PS4 and PS5, three years after its 2018 debut</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ycdjEQ7juZfnXrratOXEmppO_0o=/85x0:810x483/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69208523/Screen_Shot_2021_04_29_at_3.44.33_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ratchet and Clank cosmetics in&lt;/em&gt; Among Us&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KHK0Tn"&gt;The hit social deduction game &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; is coming to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 sometime this year, &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/04/29/grab-your-crew-among-us-drops-on-ps4-and-ps5-this-year/"&gt;Sony announced during its State of Play presentation on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nRqU6M"&gt;Like on other platforms, the game will support crossplay and online multiplayer so that you can play with your friends no matter what platform you’re on. But PlayStation players will be the only ones who can get exclusive &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank-&lt;/em&gt;themed cosmetics: a skin and hat to dress up like Ratchet and a pet that is an adorable little Clank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PljCNx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;  AMONG US - COMING TO PLAYSTATION  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;get ready to welcome a whole new crew on board!!&lt;br&gt;✨ on PS4 and PS5 consoles later this year&lt;br&gt;✨ exclusive Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank skin, hat, and pet&lt;br&gt;✨ crossplay and online multiplayer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;tell your friends but more importantly.. tell your enemies heh &lt;a href="https://t.co/E6BduFfNwU"&gt;pic.twitter.com/E6BduFfNwU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Among Us (@AmongUsGame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AmongUsGame/status/1387876005382029315?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KWVHnP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; blew up last year on PC and mobile devices, eventually becoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221075/among-us-2020-most-downloaded-mobile-game"&gt;2020’s most-downloaded mobile game&lt;/a&gt;, but the game didn’t debut on consoles until a surprise release on Nintendo Switch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176459/among-us-nintendo-switch-cross-play-launch"&gt;in December&lt;/a&gt;. Two days after, &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/12/10/among-us-coming-soon-to-xbox-game-pass-for-pc/"&gt;Microsoft confirmed&lt;/a&gt; the game would be hitting Xbox consoles sometime in 2021, and now, we know it’s on the way for PlayStation consoles, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TeXKDj"&gt;Sony also showed off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22406719/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-state-of-play-sony-insomniac-games-playstation-5"&gt;16 minutes of stunning gameplay&lt;/a&gt; for the PS5-exclusive &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank: Rift Apart &lt;/em&gt;during Thursday’s show.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>World’s widest plane nails ‘extremely successful’ second test flight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SbkYFGb_qGGOtP6cSrAqYVmVoU4=/0x56:2000x1389/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69208248/A9_08594_small.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Stratolaunch&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IwIUCN"&gt;Stratolaunch, the aerospace firm founded by the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, flew its behemoth carrier airplane named ‘Roc’ on Thursday for a second time. It was the company’s first flight under new ownership, coming two years after the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2019/4/13/18309129/stratolaunch-worlds-biggest-airplane-first-flight-rockets"&gt;twin-fuselage craft’s initial flight test&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v5CG0P"&gt;“Today’s flight, at first review, has appeared extremely successful,” Stratolaunch’s chief operating officer Zachary Krevor told reporters in a call on Thursday. “We accomplished all test points as desired, we have not seen anything anomalous, and we are very pleased with the condition of the aircraft upon landing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yXiWVk"&gt;Roc’s wheels were up at 10:30AM ET, and the plane reached a peak altitude of 2.6 miles over the Mojave Desert in California, Stratolaunch wrote in a press release. The flight, powered by six engines, lasted three hours and 14 minutes before Roc touched down on a gigantic runway at the Mojave Air and Space Port. The flight lasted longer than its first outing in 2019, but the craft flew slightly lower. One side of the plane landed just before the other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kRoFmz"&gt;“The air crew did an excellent job of bringing the aircraft down according to our expected crosswind procedures,” Krevor said. Roc’s test flight was designed to see how the plane handles cabin pressurization, and test safety features and some new hardware upgrades since its last test flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NoExOS"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Touchdown!! Successful flight tests to round out the day. What a beautiful sight. &lt;a href="https://t.co/gdssjvoN8x"&gt;pic.twitter.com/gdssjvoN8x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Stratolaunch (@Stratolaunch) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Stratolaunch/status/1387826410463531009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jDLOdW"&gt;The carrier plane’s wingspan is 385 feet — nearly twice the width of a Boeing 747, making it the world’s largest aircraft by wingspan. It’s designed to eventually&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;carry Stratolaunch’s fully reusable and autonomous Talon-A hypersonic vehicle — a rocket-powered, jet-shaped craft measuring 28 feet long and 14 feet wide that is designed to serve as a hypersonic testbed for the Department of Defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HZYolc"&gt;Once deployed, Talon A will ignite its liquid-fueled rocket engine to boost itself higher in Earth’s atmosphere for roughly a minute of hypersonic flight test conditions. It glides back for an autonomous landing on a conventional runway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nFnzmM"&gt;No such Talon-A was on board Roc for Thursday’s test flight, however. The company’s chief technology officer, Daniel Millman, told reporters that Roc will soar higher and faster in test flights over the next year until it can prove itself capable of hitting the right flight conditions required to drop Talon-A. “That will happen later in the year,” Millman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jpZ9ra"&gt;Stratolaunch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/19/18189377/stratolaunch-scaling-back-operations-medium-launch-vehicle-rocket-layoffs-paul-allen-death"&gt;scaled back operations&lt;/a&gt;, laid off most of its employees and axed plans for a fleet of air-launched rockets following the death of its billionaire founder Paul Allen in October 2018. The company kept enough employees on board to manage the carrier aircraft’s debut flight, which occurred in April 2019. Stratolaunch went dark for more than a year after that. It eventually &lt;a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2019/exclusive-buyer-paul-allens-stratolaunch-space-venture-secretive-trump-ally/?fbclid=IwAR2tli4rU9aPZTnzSzR8gISWd12ovW2BD5_WzOKbtObKT1zgoXX9p2IFl38"&gt;found new funding&lt;/a&gt; and rehired some employees to revive its carrier plane test program and refocus its business on hypersonic testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S9D4wV"&gt;Today’s flight of Roc, named after the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roc_(mythology)"&gt;large and legendary&lt;/a&gt; bird of prey in Middle Eastern mythology, was the culmination of that revival. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon crosses $100 billion in sales in huge first quarter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pxyr5eelCjz9Fbtfz2GbsJXsTqs=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69208089/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0001.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qz6lEP"&gt;Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22260133/amazon-q4-2020-quarterly-earnings-jeff-bezos-ceo-transition-andy-jassy"&gt;had a wildly successful 2020&lt;/a&gt;, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, and that blazing trail shows no signs of stopping for 2021. The company shared its &lt;a href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Amazon-Q1-2021-Earnings-Release.pdf"&gt;financial results for Q1 2021&lt;/a&gt;, and it brought in $108.5 billion in net sales. That’s a 44 percent increase from the $75.5 billion reported in the first quarter of last year, as the pandemic was beginning to take hold globally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a6DMDn"&gt;Its profits have exploded year-over-year, as well, increasing to $8.1 billion in the first quarter of this year. At this time in 2020, the figure reported was a &lt;em&gt;meager &lt;/em&gt;$2.5 billion. Amazon expects to continue crossing the $100 billion net sales mark next quarter with the figure ultimately landing somewhere between $110.0 billion and $116.0 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MR256L"&gt;But as Amazon’s sales have grown, it has also grown more concerned with government intervention. Its @AmazonNews Twitter account &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22352977/amazon-twitter-feud-bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-trolling-labor-pee-bottles"&gt;made the bizarre decision to troll US Congress members&lt;/a&gt; about tax laws. The account also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350337/amazon-peeing-in-bottles-workers-exploitation-twitter-response-evidence"&gt;publicly disputed reports that some of Amazon’s workers pee in bottles&lt;/a&gt; to meet company goals, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/3/22365330/amazon-apology-pee-bottles-worker-warehouse-union-pocan"&gt;then later apologized&lt;/a&gt; to Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) for a tweet saying &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/amazonnews/status/1374911222361956359"&gt;“You don’t really believe the peeing in bottles thing, do you?”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oHl53X"&gt;Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos shared his final annual letter to investors recently, highlighting the fact that the number of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385370/amazon-prime-subscription-jeff-bezos-2020-shareholders-letter"&gt;Amazon Prime subscribers had grown to 200 million people&lt;/a&gt;, up approximately 33 percent from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/30/21115823/amazon-q4-19-earnings-prime-membership-fresh-one-day-shipping"&gt;its previous milestone of 150 million subscribers in Q4 2019&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A3aYrZ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22263039/amazon-new-ceo-jeff-bezos-andy-jassy-executive-chair-board-q3-2021"&gt;Bezos will be replaced as CEO by Andy Jassy&lt;/a&gt; in Q3 2021, and he’ll be taking the reins of a seemingly unstoppable force that can turn huge sales and profit during tough times. He’ll also be taking on a swath of big issues that the company currently faces, notably unionization. Following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/10/22377142/bessemer-amazon-labor-union-loss-warehouse-rwdsu"&gt;a failed union vote&lt;/a&gt; in Bessemer, Alabama, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22408128/amazon-warehouses-unionizing-staten-island-jfk8-christian-smalls"&gt;a fired worker is attempting to unionize other Amazon warehouse facilities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
