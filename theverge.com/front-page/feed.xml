    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UDQWeD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Last of Us Part II&lt;/em&gt; is getting a long-awaited PlayStation 5 patch on Wednesday that lets you play the game at a targeted 60fps frame rate, Sony announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="362wXP"&gt;“Once patch 1.08 for &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us Part II &lt;/em&gt;is installed on your PS5, you will find a toggle in the Display options that allows you to choose between a Framerate Target of 30 FPS or 60 FPS,” developer Naughty Dog &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/05/19/the-last-of-us-part-ii-performance-patch-for-ps5/"&gt;said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “This allows you to choose your preferred framerate to complement the rest of the enhancements that are part of the PS5 backward compatibility with PS4 games, such as an enhanced resolution, faster load times, and more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USw4fL"&gt;You can catch &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vKTikTO4dE"&gt;a trailer for the patch&lt;/a&gt; at the top of this post, and in my opinion, it looks great. I’ll definitely be checking out the patch myself just to see how the game runs. (Though, I’m not sure I’m ready to put myself through another full playthrough of the grueling but excellent game just yet.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vk9kia"&gt;If you want to check out a technical deep dive about the patch, &lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry&lt;/em&gt; has a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/aj919idPr18"&gt;nearly 20-minute video testing it out&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="o8Gf9y"&gt;Sony is also reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375262/sony-remake-the-last-of-us-ps5-studio-reorganization-report"&gt;working on another remake of &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this one for the PS5.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Imperfect offerings: inside the complex new world of trans tech</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The transgender symbol in a square that looks like an app icon, overlapping with stripes of pink, white, and blue. Glitchy iterations of the symbol appear in the blue background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tDxfUIpGqRrL1cTmX0MrsziGtmE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69311052/acastro_210518_4591_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Apps lie at the heart of one of the most enduring conflicts in the trans community&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="39D9ad"&gt;In late February, a small company called Euphoria became the day’s main character in trans Twitter circles. The company tweeted an article about their suite of apps — Clarity, Solace, and Bliss — which were designed to be companions for trans people at different points in their transition. Euphoria was announcing a new round of funding from Chelsea Clinton, the Gaingels venture investment syndicate, and other investors, expressing gratitude “for the trust and confidence they’ve placed in us to continue to build more trans tech.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DIEeZk"&gt;The company had received very little engagement on Twitter until then. But that tweet in particular gained traction, with hundreds of people quote-tweeting to dunk on the company’s products, calling them grifts or “woke capital” and urging people to seek out community to meet their needs rather than downloading the apps. Trans artist Matt Lubchansky tweeted “my brain is in hell” alongside screenshots of the Euphoria and Gaingels Twitter profiles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bOb0PE"&gt;The apps themselves, sleek and butterfly-themed, look fairly innocuous. The Clarity app consists of three sliders, for gender identity, expression, and attraction, to track a person’s sense of self from day to day. Solace is a sort of guidebook to transition, with goals to choose from and information on a wide variety of transition-related topics. Bliss hasn’t launched yet but will be a savings and financial planning app for transition goals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fwwGGz"&gt;Most critics were skeptical: were these apps data-mining scams? Were they made to replace the function of trans communities? Because so many trans people are rejected both from family and from wider society, community ties are often critical for guidance, support, and survival. “This is yet another product to replace community, giving tips and helpful goals for all things trans, without ever needing to talk to another person,” said trans writer Niko Stratis. “I cannot stress enough that these are all things you can get from community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A butterfly logo with a blue to pink gradient above the word Solace and a log in button. The background is a blue sky with pink clouds." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bksEYH0ag0OGMdmbrFLko42J1qo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22512183/IMG_5487.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Euphoria&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Solace login page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X6gWoY"&gt;Other startups for trans people received similar pushback. Plume (which Euphoria partners with) and Folx are both subscription-based hormone services that faced scrutiny from people skeptical of venture capital solutions to health care disparities. Folx has &lt;a href="https://www.folxhealth.com/library/folx-vc-funded"&gt;an entire page&lt;/a&gt; in its FAQ section titled “Yes, Folx is VC-Funded.” There’s even a highlighted segment — “Venture capital is one of the few avenues available to take the risks necessary to tear down the current system and build anew” — that calls to mind a familiar question for queer people. How can someone dismantle a system while operating within its parameters?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iQtqDl"&gt;Twitter users don’t reflect the entire human population,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;but the argument that played out was a microcosm of a larger historical conflict within queer communities. Some people want to assimilate into dominant society while others seek to liberate themselves from it entirely. That tension has been present for decades, as gay rights gained mainstream attention and pride events turned from political rallies to corporate-sponsored parades. Some trans people will accept, happily or begrudgingly,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;whatever tools might make their lives easier, while others reject solutions that are entangled in the same structures that have kept them ground down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mmRyyu"&gt;For a population that is consistently rendered socially, financially, and politically powerless, it can feel insulting to be offered a product sanctioned by the society that has robbed them of their power. Trans people who reacted with anger and disbelief to Euphoria’s offerings are coming from years of distrust for anything that bypasses community building in favor of the whims of investors and marketers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sc23wq"&gt;Trans people live with constant uncertainty. Compared to the general population, trans people, especially trans women of color, are significantly &lt;a href="https://transequality.org/issues/resources/national-transgender-discrimination-survey-full-report"&gt;more susceptible&lt;/a&gt; to discrimination and violence and experience higher rates of &lt;a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/lgbt-poverty-us/"&gt;poverty&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/lgbt-homelessness-us/"&gt;homelessness&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/suicidality-transgender-adults/"&gt;suicidal thoughts&lt;/a&gt;. Many don’t have even basic health care, let alone insurance that will cover hormone therapy or surgeries. Wave after wave of &lt;a href="https://www.insider.com/over-half-of-us-states-tried-passing-anti-trans-bills-2021-3"&gt;proposed legislation&lt;/a&gt; threatens to strip away rights, from bathroom bills to laws severely restricting young trans people’s access to gender affirming health care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2IrsvI"&gt;At the same time, trans people are the latest population to become marketable, targeted with rainbow products and boilerplate statements from brands that offer validation through consumerism. While trans people struggle to be more than the most frequently ignored letter of “LGBT,” corporations want to &lt;a href="https://www.marketingdive.com/news/why-marketers-must-evolve-their-outlook-on-gender-or-lose-out/572584/"&gt;flaunt their trans acceptance&lt;/a&gt; to both cis and trans consumers. Communities cobble together mutual aid funds for housing, transportation, and health care while startups like Folx, Plume, and Euphoria attract attention from investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MQZPrt"&gt;Robbi Katherine Anthony, or RKA, one of Euphoria’s founders, developed the apps after reflecting on her own transition, which she describes as a rocky road. She says that one of the Solace entries, titled “Loving Yourself,” is a love letter to her former self, telling other trans people the things she wishes she could have heard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cILKtj"&gt;When she tried to research for certain goals early in her transition, she would find an abundance of conflicting information. It took her years to start hormone therapy, partly because “if I had to have 50 tabs open and cross reference against all of them to find the kernel of truth, I usually just kind of took a break from it, because it was so stressful.” She and her co-founder decided to start making apps with the goal to “make transition suck less.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="TBa0Rw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I see us as a complimentary effort rather than an extinction event”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L4VKUC"&gt;RKA easily brushed off the Twitter kerfuffle. “There’s a contingent of people in the trans community that are very, very opposed to capitalism, companies, for-profit services,” she says, “and will just stake out opposition to anything of that nature.” For her, claims that the apps seek to replace networks of community care don’t hold much water. She wants Solace to be one solution among many for trans people. Some people will still want to be involved in their communities and go to support groups, she says, “and as long as we don’t preclude anyone from doing that, I see us as a complimentary effort rather than an extinction event, if you will.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cCPskR"&gt;For her transition, RKA preferred to do things solo rather than trying to find a community of other trans people. “At the end of the day, I’m just looking for a conformist experience,” she says. “I’m just looking to blend in. And so the idea of being part of a community felt almost opposed to my transition goals.” The apps cater to people who feel similarly, and the majority of Solace users prefer the app to community functions, she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tmQywS"&gt;Angry tweets aside, RKA says the overall response to the apps has been positive. She says surveys have shown that users find transitioning more achievable with Solace in their pocket. Most importantly, she says the company receives thousands of messages and emails from users saying their suicidal ideation has decreased. “I have had suicidal thoughts pertaining to body dysphoria, but Solace helps me realize I can’t give up,” reads one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A word bubble that says “Hey friend! It’s good to see you, [name]. How can I help today?” The bubble is coming from a circle that is pink in the center with concentric circles that become blue at the edge. Underneath is a simple illustration of a mountaintop with a trans flag at the top, labeled “goals and progress.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DsHxj9y80uojwL_4Fe_p1k7z7wY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22512159/IMG_5488.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Euphoria&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The homepage of the Solace app, where users can choose goals, track progress, and read a curated news feed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fUgQD0"&gt;Lilly DeLoe, who uses Solace, turned to books, internet digging, and chats with friends to find information about transition. But she says Solace was the first resource that offered “some semblance of a roadmap with a reasonable amount of variability in regards to possibilities for transition.” Like RKA, she didn’t entirely trust forums because the information shared in them could be inaccurate or overly specific to individual people. She’s been using Solace for about eight months and is amazed at the progress she’s made in her transition goals in that time. She had held off on transitioning for a long time, but she says if a comprehensive resource like Solace had existed 20 years ago, “I wouldn’t have waited until I was 39 to transition. I wouldn’t have lost 20 years of my life, pretending to be someone I wasn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HRgCeE"&gt;Still, others are concerned that the apps signal a concerning shift toward individual-based solutions to the symptoms, rather than the causes, of inequality, and a shift away from the communal care that has often been central to trans people’s lives. Euphoria’s products are another individualized approach to the massive gaps in US health care, one of many opportunities for capitalism to pat itself on the back for addressing problems it causes, says Zein Murib, assistant professor of political science at Fordham University. People with political or financial power back apps and hormone delivery services without actually changing the system that makes gender confirmation care unobtainable in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IRV6rm"&gt;It makes sense that people pushed back against a set of venture-backed apps that aim to solve trans people’s complex problems, Murib says. Turning to venture capital is contrary to many trans people’s desire to escape profit-based systems that have kept them marginalized by deeming them unprofitable for companies and therefore worthless. Any product that pitches itself as a guidebook for transition, no matter how nuanced and flexible, can be perceived as a call to assimilate, both into cisnormative society and the capitalist system that comes with it. “I’m not surprised that there was this big Twitter response by people saying, on one hand, not only do they not want to assimilate,” says Murib, “but also from a lot of people saying, ‘what if I can’t assimilate?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pu8OrV"&gt;Solace is clear that its listed goals are not the be-all, end-all of transition, that everyone’s transition will be different and there’s no single correct way to be trans. But it still echoes white, middle class, and cisnormative ideals of what transness looks like, says Chris Barcelos, assistant professor of women’s, gender, and sexuality Studies at the University of Massachusetts Boston. Solace is also hindered by the word count of its entries; picking and choosing which complexities are worth mentioning in its introductory summaries of topics that could (and do) fill books. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A list of goals including: coming out to family, coming out to friends, coping and confronting harassment and discrimination, coping with infidelity, creating a hidden photo vault, dating and sex, and dealing with being misgendered. The misgendered goal appears twice." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f-sEYumbX7lSfRIsaMhKwgAQ6iU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22512207/IMG_5489.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Euphoria&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are over 150 goals in the Solace app, divided into legal, lifestyle, and medical. (Duplicate goals appear if the user chooses “they” pronouns because the app presents masculine and feminine versions.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wyqxhG"&gt;Several people pointed out that Solace is more focused on people of binary genders — woman or man — with little inclusion of nonbinary people. Binary transition narratives are usually the most palatable to cis people, and people who fall outside of that binary are often stung by the feeling that they’re an afterthought in mainstream discussions of transness, leading to tension not just between cis and trans people, but also between binary and nonbinary trans people. “We look at transgender men and transgender women as our greatest point of focus,” says RKA, “because that’s the largest chasm to cross.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oV72no"&gt;The Solace app understands transition through consumption: buy these clothes, get these surgeries, and you’ll be successfully trans, says Barcelos. Even in the goals that aren’t about consumption, the app tries to quantify things that can’t be easily distilled into a checklist, Barcelos says. Checking off goals along the path of transition can be incredibly meaningful for someone like DeLoe, but Barcelos and Murib both argue that self-surveillance and constant tracking could be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="72isab"&gt;The apps are pitched together for a fixed timeline of transition. Use Clarity when you’re figuring yourself out, use Solace to identify and learn about your goals, and use Bliss to help achieve them. But transition is rarely one continuous path. Many people are out in some spaces and not others, have to stop their hormones for long stretches of time, or put off gender-affirming procedures. Some trans people have no plans to ever medically transition, or see transness as a space for experimentation with no end goal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gn852a"&gt;“Part of what contributes to transphobia and trans oppression is these essential ideas of ‘this is what trans means, this is what transition means, this is how you know you’ve completed it,’” says Barcelos. “And I think it’s dangerous to take that up and implement it in our own communities.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="phAVqm"&gt;Beyond the substance of the app itself,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;many of Euphoria’s critics took issue with the overall framing that a guide to transition is a novel idea. Trans people have been seeking and sharing information among their communities for ages. Zines like Lou Sullivan’s &lt;em&gt;Information for the female-to-male crossdresser and transsexual &lt;/em&gt;circulated in queer social networks in the ‘80s. There were online message boards in the ‘90s. Nowadays, people turn to Discord groups, subreddits, Facebook groups, and other online forums to seek advice and find affirmation. One of the frequent calls in response to the Euphoria tweet was “if you have questions about transition, don’t download an app, DM me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A slider labeled “Gender identity?” has female at the left end and male at the right end. Below the slider is text that says “Gender identity is: A person’s innate sense of having a particular gender, which may or may not correspond with one’s natal sex. Think about this as the default way you think of yourself. The person you are around others and when you are by yourself. There isn’t a right or wrong answer here." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3K5mFS9W2tE-L9fQ2YuKi25ghrc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22512161/IMG_5492.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Euphoria&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first slider in the Clarity app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6OKKoJ"&gt;Even before making the decision to socially or medically transition, many people turn to peers, rather than sliders on an app, for help sorting out their feelings about their identity. Transness is often explored not just in self-reflection but in conversation. “A lot of trans experience is communal,” says Alyssa Videlock, who moderates several trans-specific subreddits and Discord groups. She finds joy in helping other trans people find validation during their first moments of exploration. “They come into it and they leave with a sense of self that they didn’t have before,” she says. “Getting them to a point where they can say, ‘I’m more solid in the identity that makes me happy.’ It makes me happy to see, even if they choose not to do anything about it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGKq1V"&gt;Before she started transitioning, Kath Bigfrog, another moderator of trans groups, traveled with two other trans women to the apartment of Rita Hester, the Black trans woman whose murder sparked Transgender Day of Remembrance. They brought flowers and held a small vigil. It was in that moment, full of emotion, that Bigfrog decided, “I have to do this, I have to transition and be who I’m supposed to be.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SsdJhI"&gt;“Part of the problem is you can’t really make a comprehensive resource, because so much of trans community and trans history is just things that you can’t put in a guidebook,” says Bigfrog. (&lt;em&gt;Author’s note: In the interest of full disclosure, I met and became friends with Bigfrog through one of the groups she moderates.) &lt;/em&gt;She points out that Solace actively discourages people from seeking hormones on the “grey market,” a term used for trans people sharing hormones within their communities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TjmFpB"&gt;Taking hormones without the guidance of a doctor can be dangerous, but trans people have a long history of sharing hormones because so few have access to gender-affirming care. There are often self-taught experts within communities who guide other trans people through hormone regimens. Euphoria’s discouragement is well-intentioned, and a smart choice to avoid liability, but the framing of its advice is aggravating for many trans people who have struggled to navigate a health care system that is so often hostile, even harmful, to them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fd5zKn"&gt;“If you don’t trust medical providers, you should strongly reconsider your position even if only as a matter of personal health and preservation,” says the Solace entry about the grey market. This call to action doesn’t acknowledge why many trans people are distrustful of established medical systems, assuming they can access them at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zlm4d4"&gt;Faced with a history of medicine that has pathologized and traumatized them, trans people find medical advice in surprising places.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“I’ve seen a bunch of posts from the same person [on Lex, a queer dating app] that are just like, ‘Oh, thanks for all the help with top surgery shit’,” says Bigfrog. “You could literally just log on to Lex and be like, ‘I want to get top surgery’ and you’ll get a bunch of gay people in your DMs telling you where to go and what to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="loklSA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There is a bit of a cultural rub going on”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pTymnm"&gt;DeLoe approaches the apps from a pragmatic viewpoint. Maybe venture capital isn’t the best answer to trans people’s problems, but she at least had a concrete resource she could use to teach her therapist about transness. It’s hard to see Solace as a grift when it has materially improved the lives of DeLoe and others like her. The app is, instead, another incomplete solution that highlights the precariousness and desperation of trans existence, a response to the difficulties of life within an unjust society. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNO5fs"&gt;“There is a bit of a cultural rub going on right now in which solutions have to be perfect for everyone to be seen as worthwhile,” says RKA. “But in some sense, that’s a really ineffective way to make change. Because the suggestion is, don’t do anything until it’s perfect.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="73GdQi"&gt;There are no perfect solutions as long as transphobia is rampant and health care remains a nightmare. Even successful fundraisers for trans medical care, tangible demonstrations of community power, are tangled up in internalized biases. The crowdfunding campaigns that raise the most money are usually for young white men, and campaign descriptions are often constricted to normative understandings of transness, echoing “wrong body” narratives that appeal to cis people. “We’re both caring for each other by circulating the same $20 around in trans communities,” says Barcelos, “but also complicit in larger patterns of inequality.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="uWownw"&gt;Euphoria, with its imperfect offerings, puts forth options for people who prefer to transition on their own or who are exhausted at the idea of trawling through forums to find pearls of wisdom. But community conversations, online or in person, leave room for complexity and experimentation. It’s among communities that people are able to explore their identities in more expansive terms than simplified Gender 101, where people organize calls to their representatives, discuss how much they’re willing to assimilate, strategize about fundraising, laugh, and mourn. Of her trip to Hester’s apartment, Bigfrog says, “That sort of camaraderie you can’t get from an app, you know? You ain’t sobbing over flowers with the sliders or whatever.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="rNa2z5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/28/21459521/roku-streambar-soundbar-compact-streaming-bluetooth-spotify-connect-tv-audio"&gt;Roku’s Streambar&lt;/a&gt; is one of the few double-duty soundbars out there that can also connect to your TV to stream TV shows and movies in 4K HDR from all sorts of services, like Netflix, Apple TV Plus, and more. If that sounds appealing to you, this compact 14-inch soundbar is just $100 at a variety of retailers today, costing $30 less than usual. The Streambar has four full-range drivers, and on its back is an HDMI port, an optical audio port, and a USB port. This soundbar can be wall mounted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="WYMRX4"&gt;Acer’s excellent 13.5-inch 2-in-1 Chromebook Spin 713 &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740999584841405951" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;i&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740999584841405951#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;s $429 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, down from $629. My colleague Monica Chin rates the Spin 713 as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the best Chromebook you can currently buy&lt;/a&gt; because of its 3:2 aspect ratio QHD display, a backlit keyboard that’s comfortable to type on, and a processor capable of handling a heavy load of tabs with no slowdown. We’ve occasionally seen it sell for $529, but this is a much better deal that seems to be exclusive to Best Buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Vi69Sq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9505954"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BxArUu"&gt;If you’re a Costco member, you can get a good deal on the Apple Watch SE. This model usually sells for $270, but members can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/apple-watch-se-40mm-gps.product.100457716.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;40mm model with GPS connectivity for $240&lt;/a&gt;. This $30 price cut might not be worth getting a membership for on its own, but current Costco shoppers might want to check this deal out. You can also get $30 off the larger 44mm-sized SE, &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/apple-watch-se-44mm-gps.product.100688310.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costing $270&lt;/a&gt; instead of $300 at Costco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UHrjmp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="btajOn"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Chernobyl &lt;/em&gt;miniseries from HBO is available on UHD Blu-ray disc with a collectible steelbook case &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1741000996008832876#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at Best Buy for $30&lt;/a&gt;, down from its usual $45 price. These discs will work with standard Blu-ray players that aren’t capable of true 4K output, and it includes a digital copy of the show. This specific bundle is exclusive to Best Buy, and it costs a few dollars less than the standard version available at other retailers that doesn’t include such a hauntingly clever case design inspired by &lt;em&gt;The Scream&lt;/em&gt; by Edvard Munch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lofelt’s new haptics framework is ready to bring good vibrations to Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Qualcomm Lofelt" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/owHO1DVBrVcpvFHKo7sgIRSPo2o=/69x0:807x492/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69310907/0_66eU5_KB84vIXV7A.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Lofelt&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="htfuLm"&gt;Haptic feedback on Android phones is usually terrible, at least compared to devices that have Apple’s Taptic Engine. You know it, I know it, and a haptics company called Lofelt apparently knows it, too. Today, though, Lofelt, in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297285/qualcomm-lofelt-haptics-vibration-snapdragon-888-api-software"&gt;partnership with Qualcomm&lt;/a&gt;, announced that it’s making its VTX haptic framework available to OEMs, with the hope that these manufacturers will start putting better haptics into more Android devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LeMuxB"&gt;The framework will allow OEMs to utilize high-definition haptic vibration on phones running the latest Snapdragon 8-series and 7-series without any hardware tweaks. The system is “tightly integrated with Snapdragon and fully validated by Qualcomm,” according to Lofelt. While the framework is technically compatible with older phones that have a Snapdragon 7-series and 8-series chipset, it’s at the discretion of each OEM whether to add support. It seems more likely that companies will make the big effort to implement improved haptics in upcoming phones than adding it to older models. As for which newer models will feature the framework, none have been announced yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eNU9eK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;VTX comes with “no performance trade-offs,” says Lofelt&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xsR6Fl"&gt;Ahead of this announcement, I got to actually feel the difference myself that Lofelt’s improved haptics can make on a phone through software tweaks only. The company sent over a custom Google Pixel 4 packed with demos that show off how its vibrations feel compared to the stock Android implementation (the same setup can’t be duplicated on other devices). Compared to phones designed to take full advantage of Lofelt VTX’s integration with the chipset, this Pixel 4 was running the haptics tricks through the application layer as a proof of concept. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m54Hgt2LU3SXibxUiEMAat33Vzs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22522947/lofelttoggle.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lofelt’s app let me feel the difference between stock Android vibrations and the company’s own — and the difference was noticeable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2vih4G"&gt;Each of the demos featured a toggle that lets you switch between the stock Android vibration and Lofelt’s refined haptics, as shown in the bottom right of the picture above. One instance ran through a few scenarios in &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Mobile&lt;/em&gt;. The vibrations varied in strength and duration depending on the kind of gun being shot, and I was able to feel distinct pulsations of a helicopter soaring through the sky. A demo for &lt;em&gt;Asphalt 9: Legends&lt;/em&gt; let me feel the roar of an engine through haptics, as well as the fast, crunchy pulsing of the vibration motor when the car ran over a dirt median. Even though the Pixel 4 and earlier models don’t natively support VTX, these demos were far more expressive than standard Android phone vibrations. If you’re someone who takes mobile gaming seriously, to the point of owning something like a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21285073/razer-kishi-review-game-controller-phone-price-nintendo-switch-stadia"&gt;Razer Kishi controller&lt;/a&gt;, haptics could make your favorite games feel more immersive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPUkDo"&gt;The big challenge for Lofelt isn’t in proving that these sorts of immersive haptic experiences are worth building (give the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lofelt-studio/id1482238306"&gt;Lofelt Studio app for iOS&lt;/a&gt; a try if you need convincing yourself). The real work is ensuring that as many phones as possible can eventually get them, and that it won’t take too much effort for developers. That’s where Lofelt’s AX (adaptive experience) signal processing tech built into VTX comes into play. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i0AHjL"&gt;According to Lofelt, AX converts a universal haptic signal into vibrations that play to the strengths of each individual phone, taking into consideration its haptics driver, actuator hardware, and control algorithms from the manufacturer. The goal is for Android devices to catch up to Apple’s excellent Taptic Engine that’s in modern iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d67vsXP1TXxgnEht8c6zjiSlNZI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21955672/akrales_201012_4137_0103.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Older phones with the Snapdragon 7-series and 8-series can be updated as OEMs see fit, but you’ll likely find better haptics in new phones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LNUdA2"&gt;App and game developers can design advanced haptics using Lofelt Studio, which integrates with Unity, Unreal, and Xcode, and create a universal .haptic file that works across multiple devices. According to Lofelt, these files contain “universal parameters, such as whether the haptics should include smooth, continuous signals or more punchy, dynamic events.” In other words, you’ll only need to build it once, then the framework can deliver a consistent experience across different phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bERQJA"&gt;Existing games and apps running on supported Snapdragon hardware won’t be left in the dust. Lofelt claims that framework will also be able to convert the audio stream coming from an app into vibrations in real time without any hardware or coding modifications. So, you won’t necessarily need to wait for every developer to create bespoke haptics in order to start feeling some tactile enhancements with apps you already know and love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K3gtcJ"&gt;Lofelt says that its VTX framework comes with no performance trade-offs, and that it aims to deliver better haptics “while minimizing the impact on battery and actuator.” That sounds great, and the demo I tried feels ready for deployment. But now, the wait begins for some phone manufacturers to kickstart what could be a big, positive change for Android.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>People are uncomfortable with digital health tools used to control COVID-19</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I3GDGazX19HQe0rdDrH0m93t-Fg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69310908/acastro_200512_1777_socialDistance_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3Bb4sh"&gt;Most people in the United States don’t want their digital data used to control the spread of COVID-19, a &lt;a href="http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.10918?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_term=051921"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; found. More than half of the people in the study remained wary of sharing their data in different scenarios, including a smart thermometer company sharing information with public health officials, or using the Google and Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21222161/apple-google-bluetooth-contact-tracing-system-coronavirus-health"&gt;exposure notification app&lt;/a&gt; to track infections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EgKd6k"&gt;“I was surprised a bit about the degree of skepticism when the potential benefits are so high,” says study author David Grande, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2vaGiT"&gt;Grande and his team collected survey responses from 3,547 US adults during July 2020 about their attitudes toward the use of digital information to respond to the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S5LeGJ"&gt;The survey asked whether or not they approved of using aggregated data pulled from social media to set health policies or contact people for COVID-19 testing. It asked whether they were okay with&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;data from smart thermometers being used for either health policies or contact tracing. It asked about three versions of the Google and Apple exposure notification app: one where using the app and any data sharing with health officials is optional; a second where using the app is optional but it automatically shares data with health officials; and a third where the app is mandatory. Finally, it asked whether people approved of the use of cellphone data to enforce quarantine and identify people at high risk for COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y4ymnU"&gt;The lowest support was for monitoring social media to set health policies — only 28 percent of people approved or strongly approved of that scenario. The highest level of support was for a version of the Google and Apple exposure notification app where use was optional but information was shared with health officials, of which 43 percent of people approved or strongly approved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8m3uim"&gt;Grande thinks people may be more interested in the exposure notification app than official use of social media data because they get a more direct benefit, even though it’s a more invasive tool. “Some of the other uses, people may think, ‘I’m contributing my data for the common good but how is it going to protect me as an individual?’” he says. A tool that was developed to tell people if they’ve been exposed to a virus may seem worth the trade-offs around privacy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AWtTys"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Everyone was facing massive disruption in their lives. I thought that people would be more accepting” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Azr5PQ"&gt;Still, that program only had explicit support from less than half of the people surveyed, even though the survey went out just as the country was coming out of the first wave of COVID-19 and lockdowns. “Everyone was facing massive disruption in their lives,” Grande says. “I thought that people would be more accepting.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pxuQEM"&gt;Having personal experience with COVID-19, like a family member getting the disease, didn’t impact people’s approval of these tools, the study found. Neither did living in an area with high rates of COVID-19. People who were politically conservative, though, were less likely to support the use of digital data to manage COVID-19 than people who were liberal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CimmVB"&gt;In general, people tend to be worried when they start hearing about the collection and use of health data, Grande says. Their personal digital data might already be collected by companies and used for things like advertising, but it might not be as apparent — and they’re not asked direct questions about it. People also don’t realize that virtually all of the data collected by companies can be analyzed to infer things about health, like their mood or behavior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nJoW3"&gt;“I suspect that if we ask people direct questions about many commercial uses of their data that are currently taking place, we would see much greater resistance to those,” Grande says. “It’s just that many of those other uses aren’t so visible to consumers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DLrzAC"&gt;The results of the study show that if they want people to use digital tools, public health officials will have to underscore the privacy protections that they have in place, and point out the direct benefits for users. A large chunk of people who responded to the survey said that they neither agreed nor disagreed with the use of data in the various scenarios — a sign that they could be persuaded. If most of that group backed something like the exposure notification app, officials would have close to two-thirds of people in support, Grande says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r6D2ZT"&gt;“Through effective policies and communication, I think we can convince people that — assuming that protections are in place — these are a good idea,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 778G chipset will put premium features in midrange phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SpeqS7-xZs5K93r7a7GER8zE018=/0x0:895x597/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69310906/Under_Embargo___Snapdragon_778G_Press_Note_Final_11__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Qualcomm’s 700-series Snapdragon chipsets are popular among midrange and premium midrange phone manufacturers.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Qualcomm&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dHT4li"&gt;Qualcomm has announced a new 700-series chipset for mobile devices: the Snapdragon 778G 5G. It will start appearing in premium midrange phones from manufacturers including Motorola, Xiaomi, Realme, Honor, Oppo, and iQOO in the next few months, bringing with it some video capture and AI capabilities borrowed from the Snapdragon 888, the current chipset of choice for flagship Android phones. The company has also made a couple of other announcements today designed to get 5G connectivity into more tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1mhwNy"&gt;The Snapdragon 778G offers three image-signal processors, or ISPs — a feature Qualcomm touted in its flagship 888 chipset, and also appears in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350079/qualcomm-snapdragon-780g-888-5g-mobile-chipset-phone-android"&gt;higher-end 780G&lt;/a&gt;. This makes it possible to capture photos and video from three different cameras at once. You can easily switch between different cameras’ video feeds during recording ala &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/sg/support/mobile-devices/control-your-shots-with-directors-view-on-galaxy-s21-series/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s director view&lt;/a&gt; on the Snapdragon 888-powered S21 series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fgzGLZ"&gt;The processor also supports cameras with staggered HDR sensors like the 50-megapixel chip in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356128/xiaomi-mi-11-ultra-lite-5g-announced-specs"&gt;Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; for better HDR video recording. The 778G also includes some improvements for more GPU-efficient mobile gaming, and things like better noise suppression and camera experiences on video calls. Both mmWave and sub-6GHz 5G are supported, as well as Wi-Fi 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3PGoBr"&gt;In “more 5G in more places” news, Qualcomm is also making M.2 reference designs available for current OEM customers of its X65 and X62 5G modems. This makes it easier for laptop, desktop, gaming, and IoT manufacturers to incorporate 5G connectivity into their products. The company is also debuting a new X65 5G modem, which Qualcomm says is more energy efficient and offers wider support of mmWave frequencies. It will start appearing in commercial mobile devices later this year, the company says.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify enters the virtual concert business, starts selling $15 tickets to events</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3jDAwIgkefm7JvFJkkJxkqe0VPY=/0x0:1227x818/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69310892/spotifylivestream.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Spotify is hosting virtual, prerecorded concerts starting in May.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dQywgq"&gt;Spotify is entering the virtual concert business, just as in-person concerts are becoming more of a possibility. The company &lt;a href="https://www.spotify.live/"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that people can now buy tickets to five different concert streams, which will air throughout May and June. Initial artists include The Black Keys, Jack Antonoff of Bleachers, and Leon Bridges. The streams all are prerecorded but can only be viewed at a given time through the web browser. The shows aren’t available on demand, and they aren’t accessible through the Spotify app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="79LZSv"&gt;Tickets cost $15, and viewers must have a Spotify account to watch the show. (Viewers can set up a free Spotify account during the ticket-buying process if they don’t already have one.) You can check out the &lt;a href="https://www.spotify.live/faq"&gt;FAQ page&lt;/a&gt; for more details, but notably, tickets are tied to individual users’ accounts, so they’re non-transferable, and if you end up missing the show, you can’t get a refund. (Spotify says each artist’s recording will air at four different times to account for the world’s various timezones, so buyers have to select their preferred time.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRS7CL"&gt;Spotify previously participated in the concert ecosystem by allowing artists to list shows through its app and link out to ones from specific partners, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/15/15810710/spotify-eventbrite-integration-concert-recommendations"&gt;Eventbrite&lt;/a&gt;. In 2017, the company said it &lt;a href="https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/spotify-generated-40m-in-ticket-sales-last-year-now-its-accelerating-its-presence-in-live-music/"&gt;generated more than&lt;/a&gt; $40 million in ticket sales through its Fans First program, which gives fans extra perks, like early access to tickets. It also hosted its own in-person events tied to its playlist branding, including Rap Caviar and Viva Latino. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7fAodK"&gt;During the pandemic, the company started listing virtual concerts, too. Fifteen dollars for these prerecorded concerts feels a bit steep, especially because it isn’t much different than live sets you can likely find from late-night shows or other specials for free on YouTube or Instagram Live, but it seems like Spotify is trying to find a new revenue stream and way to keep fans engaged during a time when most have been disconnected from the idea of live music. It’s unclear if the company intends to keep up the virtual concert series. For now, these five shows are all the commitment we’ve seen.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>China releases first images from its Zhurong rover on Mars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vcYr2EHpT8Ept2uc7VEHMrSE5UA=/0x342:2048x1707/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69310749/E1wEz5VWYAINTeA.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IqRu1w"&gt;China’s Zhurong rover has beamed back its first images from the surface of Mars after landing on a vast plain called Utopia Planitia. The rover plunged through the Martian atmosphere last Friday, bundled together with a lander after separating from China’s Tianwen-1 probe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2hHHok"&gt;The new images released by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) show the two robots meticulously executing their first post-landing steps: the lander extended a tiny ramp to help Zhurong put its six wheels on the Martian surface for the first time. And Zhurong unfolded its four wing-like solar panels and a communications antenna, as seen from one of the rover’s navigation cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kBnnoq"&gt;The Tianwen-1 mission, which arrived in Martian orbit in February, is China’s first trek to Mars. Until last week, only the US had been able to successfully land and operate rovers on the Red Planet. NASA’s most recent rover, Perseverance, landed in February at Jezero Crater, a little over a thousand miles from China’s landing site at Utopia Planitia. (NASA’s Viking-2 mission also landed at Utopia Planitia in 1976.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQcB2f"&gt;Surviving the dive through Mars’ atmosphere — the “seven minutes of terror” — is the hardest part of any voyage to the planet. CNSA also released images of the landing phase in action: &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7a_gB7GNu8HGezjTBMrIgD7RCQM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22525334/landing.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: CNSA&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RcrtJh"&gt;Tianwen-1 launched from the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site in China’s Hainan province on July 23rd last year, setting off on its seven-month trek to the Red Planet. Now, with Zhurong preparing to rove Utopia Planitia, China has its first robotic laboratory on Mars. The rover’s instruments will work to study the planet’s geology and climate during its planned 90-day mission.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple asks court to rule iOS is not an ‘essential facility’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lj2NFTGo5oCxlnN603zOw__94tU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69310699/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Cfvrvd"&gt;After two and a half weeks in court, Apple is taking aim at one of the central elements of Epic’s antitrust case. &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20761616-apple-motion-to-dismiss-essential-facility-claim"&gt;In a filing Tuesday night&lt;/a&gt;, Apple asked the court to dismiss one of the 10 counts alleged in the initial complaint, arguing Epic had failed to establish any evidence for the charge that Apple had violated the essential facilities doctrine by failing to provide access to software distribution tools on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cptEsS"&gt;“At trial, Epic adduced no proof in support of this claim,” Apple’s filing reads. “On the contrary, Epic’s principal expert expressly disclaimed any opinion on essential facility, and (in response to a direct question from the Court) rejected the notion that iOS should be treated as a public utility. The Court should enter judgment for Apple on this claim.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="ccReMg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It sounds to me like what Epic is saying is ‘We want Apple to allow us to deal on their platform,’” says the judge&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A1oReY"&gt;Filed as a motion for partial findings, Apple is pushing to split off the essential facilities charge from the other nine charges made in Epic’s initial complaint. In essence, Apple believes it can win a quick victory on this specific point. That won’t settle the case entirely since the other nine charges still require a ruling, but it would be an unexpected and embarrassing loss for Epic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m6KoVn"&gt;Epic hasn’t talked about the essential facilities doctrine much in court, and Apple’s lawyers are responding in part to vocal skepticism from the court. On May 12th, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers specifically confronted Epic about the weakness of its evidence for the charge. “I’ve heard quite a bit of evidence throughout the trial regarding how big Apple is and how anticompetitive it is,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/leah_nylen/status/1392558985643970564"&gt;Gonzalez Rogers said&lt;/a&gt;. “It sounds to me like what Epic is saying is ‘We want Apple to allow us to deal on their platform. And there are only two of these platforms, and because there are only two platforms, all these competitors can’t succeed without access to these platforms.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYdqrB"&gt;Epic’s counsel &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thedextriarchy/status/1392558958972391424"&gt;clarified that&lt;/a&gt; it had “not abandoned that theory” — but it hasn’t substantially raised it in the days since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8WYHR1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple controls iOS, which is essential to effective competition in the iOS App Distribution Market,” argues Epic&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w7qpA0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_facilities_doctrine"&gt;The essential facilities doctrine&lt;/a&gt; is a long-standing element of antitrust law that prevents dominant firms from using bottleneck services to box out competitors. &lt;a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/224/383/"&gt;In a foundational example from 1912&lt;/a&gt;, a railroad consortium prevented competitors from offering passage to and from St. Louis by denying access to switching yards around the city. The Supreme Court ruled that the arrangement was an illegal restraint of trade, establishing that companies must provide reasonable use of facilities that are essential for competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dNnUoX"&gt;In its complaint, Epic argues that app distribution on iOS is the same kind of bottleneck, charging that Apple has used its control over the iOS platform to prevent Epic and other competitors from offering competing app stores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EoQU0Z"&gt;“Apple controls iOS, which is essential to effective competition in the iOS App Distribution Market,” the complaint argues. “Through its denial of its essential facility, Apple maintains its monopoly power in the iOS App Distribution Market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PKEwJA"&gt;But Apple is now countering that Epic has reasonable access to iOS through the App Store itself — and that iOS customers are plainly not essential to the operation of its business since the company has been broadly successful without them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2QIGvj"&gt;“Epic’s own experience, as established by the trial evidence, confirms that there is nothing ‘essential’ about iOS,” Apple’s filing reads. “&lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;was a success before it was made available on the App Store, and &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s revenues from iOS (prior to its removal) accounted for just 7 percent of its total revenue. And native apps are not the only way Epic can reach iOS customers—it also is free to distribute its products (including by selling V-Bucks) to iOS customers over the internet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hbx0cb"&gt;Apple’s motion asks for a hearing on the issue on Monday, May 24th — or “as soon thereafter as the matter may be heard by the Court.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Geoff Keighley’s Summer Game Fest returns June 10th with a ‘world premiere showcase’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VniRdNqzfc_uWS6LUYy-HyTc7rE=/0x0:4095x2730/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69310561/1193629349.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xLwq0h"&gt;Summer Game Fest is back this year, and it will start on June 10th with an event called “Kick Off Live!” that’s billed as a “spectacular world premiere showcase” with “more than a dozen” world premieres and announcements. The show, which will begin at 2PM ET, will be hosted by Geoff Keighley, who you might also know as the host of The Game Awards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QgGjP4"&gt;Kick Off Live! is just the first of many events that will be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22363385/summer-game-fest-returns-back-june-geoff-keighley"&gt;part of Summer Game Fest&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the publishers confirmed to be participating in Summer Game Fest include 2K, Activision, Blizzard, Capcom, Epic Games, Sony PlayStation, Riot Games, Square Enix, Ubisoft, and Microsoft Xbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Emhlfe"&gt;This first event will also feature a performance by Weezer, “who will debut a brand new, stream safe game soundtrack song that can be freely streamed on Twitch, YouTube and anywhere else without being blocked or losing monetization,” according to a press release. (So it seems like we won’t see a repeat of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Slasher/status/1362901765029527553"&gt;what happened with Metallica’s performance at BlizzCon&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yiKfSo"&gt;Summer Game Fest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/1/21243981/summer-game-fest-news-events-geoff-keighley-sony-microsoft"&gt;launched last year&lt;/a&gt; to let publishers showcase their upcoming games after some of the industry’s biggest events were restricted or canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many gaming events have been affected by the pandemic this year as well, forcing some, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22290109/gdc-digital-only-masterclass-showcase-2021"&gt;GDC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/6/22368617/e3-2021-virtual-event-digital-microsoft-nintendo"&gt;E3&lt;/a&gt;, to shift to digital formats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="O82Sgq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here’s how E3’s all-virtual event will work this year","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22433781/e3-2021-virtual-event-free-public-app-online-portal-livestreams"},{"title":"The 2021 Game Developers Conference won’t have in-person gatherings after all","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22290109/gdc-digital-only-masterclass-showcase-2021"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
