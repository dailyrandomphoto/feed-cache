    <title>Sony pivots into cars with Sony Mobility and a Vision-S SUV prototype at CES 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Sony Mobility" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cV-nIyiZV0JumQxQW12g7TMHDVo=/65x0:755x460/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70348653/sony_mobility.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dS1bnG"&gt;During Sony’s keynote presentation at CES 2022, the company rolled out the Vision-S EV we’ve seen before, along with a new concept SUV dubbed Vision-S 02. But the big surprise (this time) is the launch of Sony Mobility, a new company focused on electric cars. While the tech industry has focused on whether or not Apple might produce a vehicle, Sony already showed us a working prototype packed full of its technology, and now it’s going a step further.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aOynDkZ4hfoNjufq5mjDxQb1pf8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146166/sony.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kODjC9"&gt;We don’t know if this all leads to actually taking a Sony-brand car for a spin someday, but clearly it has a vision for the autonomous, electric future that it’s pursuing. “We are exploring a commercial launch of Sony’s EV,” said Kenichiro Yoshida, the company’s chairman, president and CEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YO0qdx"&gt;During last year’s reveal of the Vision-S, Sony talked a lot about its capabilities with sensors, and we’ll see how it uses that technological advantage in the car industry. In 2021, it already shared some pain with automakers in dealing with the chip shortage, whether it’s joining the party as a full-fledged competitor or some form of supplier that can help build next-generation vehicles is what we’re waiting to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pmxc3D"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Shure’s new Aonic 40 are a slightly cheaper pair of noise-canceling wireless headphones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BUlgSWwvmaxeMqBZocHhozkyTqU=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70348677/SBH1DYBK1_AONIC40_Black_StillLife_YogaMat.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Aonic 40 is made of aluminum alloy and glass-filled nylon.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Shure&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="auklSM"&gt;Shure has expanded its headphone lineup with the release of the new Aonic 40. The Aonic 40 are a set of wireless over-ear headphones with adjustable active noise cancellation, Environment Mode, 40mm composite drivers, USB-C quick charging, and an estimated 25 hours of battery life with ANC turned on. Priced at $249, this new model sits below the current $299 &lt;a href="https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/headphones/aonic50"&gt;Aonic 50&lt;/a&gt; in Shure’s lineup — which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;earned a nod in &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s best noise-canceling headphones of 2021&lt;/a&gt; — and shares some features like a user-customizable EQ through the ShurePlus Play app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7hOhjp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Aonic 40 are available now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="msWzAv"&gt;While the Aonic 40 have a slightly revised look taken from their older sibling, with an aluminum build and a collapsible design, 2020’s Aonic 50 remain at the top of Shure’s wireless headphone line with larger 50mm drivers and 32-bit audio with LDAC support. The cheaper Aonic 40 have three levels of noise cancellation, with an Environment Mode to let in ambient sound — all accessible via physical controls. Shure’s claim of up to 25 hours of battery life is more than the Aonic 50’s estimated 20, putting them closer to popular competitors like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Sony WH-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt; headphones and their estimated 30 hours of battery. The new headphones can also be used for phone calls and videoconferencing, utilizing dual beamforming microphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="75Heg5"&gt;The Aonic 40 are available now in black and white / tan colorways and come with a carrying case, 3.5mm cable, USB-C cable, and a two-year manufacturer’s warranty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wIe4Xf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10942089"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="XDETVs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10944699"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Sony confirms PlayStation VR2 name and Horizon game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bQw32w6yeHJdKURZC61oV6VsdCM=/0x1:1200x801/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70348643/slack_imgs.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hKW0XC"&gt;Sony has confirmed the name of its next VR headset: unsurprisingly, it’s going to be called PlayStation VR2. Sony Interactive Entertainment president and CEO Jim Ryan announced the name as part of Sony’s CES 2022 presentation, in a move reminiscent of two years ago when the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21019829/sony-playstation-5-ps5-logo-reveal-ps4-users-numbers-ces-2020"&gt;PS5 logo was first revealed&lt;/a&gt; on stage in Vegas amid much fanfare. (It looked like the PS3 and PS4 logos but with a 5.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iooj85"&gt;Sony still hasn’t shown off what the headset itself will look like, but we know quite a bit about its technical specs already. PS VR2 will work with the PS5, of course, and Sony also detailed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22337700/sony-new-ps5-playstation-5-vr-controllers-features"&gt;controllers&lt;/a&gt; — now officially named Sense controllers — all the way back in March. The headset supports haptic feedback, eye tracking, 4K HDR, 90/120Hz frame rates, foveated rendering, and a field of view of 110 degrees, and it connects to the PS5 with a single USB-C cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Vsoy1"&gt;Ryan also announced the first big new exclusive title for PSVR2: &lt;em&gt;Horizon Call of the Mountain&lt;/em&gt;. It’ll follow next month’s &lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt;, one of Sony’s tentpole releases for 2022, though there’s no indication of a release date for either the game or the headset just yet. You can watch a brief teaser trailer below. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The ROG Strix Flare II Animate puts a tiny dot-matrix display on a keyboard  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SvgZDJON9iKBYaZfS0HOSSuAFMw=/0x0:2560x1707/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70348641/kt3J8vZY.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A built-in display can show animation, system info, and more.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Asus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u7I1T2"&gt;ROG, one of Asus’s gaming brands, &lt;a href="https://rog.asus.com/keyboards/keyboards/aura-rgb/rog-strix-flare-ii-animate-model/"&gt;has announced the Strix Flare II Animate&lt;/a&gt;, a mechanical keyboard that gets its name from the LED display built into it, which can play animations or display logos, similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21052249/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-amd-ryzen-4000-dot-matrix-display-lid-ces-2020"&gt;dot-matrix displays ROG’s built into the lids of some laptops&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VhmXNQ"&gt;Asus calls this tech the AniMe Matrix LED display, and says you can use it to show all sorts of things; custom images and animations, system info like battery life, time, and date, and even audio visualizations. It’s blingy, to say the least, and more eye-catching than an illuminated logo. That could be a good thing though — this keyboard will cost $220, so it has to justify that price somehow.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/04VKbRJBovd_EgrPMhOP3Qo96BM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146118/animatrix_Animated_Image__Large_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Gif: Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, ROG’s all-caps font does make it look like it’s called Anime Matrix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="m0MMrm"&gt;As if the Strix Flare II Animate didn’t have enough lighting with the 312 mini-LEDs display, Asus also added an RGB strip on the bottom. “But wait,” I can hear my hands protesting. “Won’t adding a wrist rest cover up all that lighting?” And indeed, yes it would — if the wrist rest included with this keyboard didn’t include a diffuser that gives it a colorful underglow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/agLhMKlBsugjU01Blj2Ks5-z1Dg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146043/msnnkdJE.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who doesn’t love some nice, diffused RGBs?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WoIb6Uv4HDmhwfSWXbnZm7VWO3g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146052/3D_7_US_ABS_02_FA.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The wrist rest even has a place to hold the diffuser that’s usually on the keyboard, which you have to take off when installing the rest.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PylFBS"&gt;The Flare II Animate also has a laundry list of non-screen and RGB-related features, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ZnV8Vk"&gt;8000Hz polling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dKojl3"&gt;Media controls, which take the shape of a knob, scroll wheel, and button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MEc0AX"&gt;USB 2.0 passthrough&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="frPJLt"&gt;PBT Double-shot keycaps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BodmSM"&gt;Sound-dampening foam&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="FHqiv2"&gt;Finally, and somewhat importantly when it comes to a keyboard, are the actual key switches. The Animate comes with either Cherry MX Blue, Brown, or Red switches. You can also get it with Asus’s own ROG NX switches, also in three different flavors. It even has swappable switches, so you can switch out switches depending on your preference — for example, you could make it harder to press the space bar, and easier to press the WASD.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xZ8LFqldC-s-Q3JvzgXf_JGWdVU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146121/p.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both the key caps and key switches can be swapped on the Animate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AWFK4S"&gt;If you’re not into the heavy bling (and price) of the Animate, Asus will also sell a standard Strix Flare II for $180. There are more caveats though. It doesn’t have as many switch choices, as they’re not easily swappable, and it can’t be equipped with Cherry switches.  You also, obviously, miss out on the AniMe screen — it’s replaced by an RGB ROG logo (the lights on the bottom are gone too). Other than that it’s similar; it still has most of the Animate’s features, like N-key rollover, a 2-meter braided cable, and macro support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cRML1v"&gt;The Strix Flare II non-animated will be available late this month, and Asus says the Animate’s “tentative” availability is around late January as well. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Activision sues company distributing Call of Duty cheats</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oBratJbd_KOWHcY6qLZVnRDeQZs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70348603/acastro_300505_4008_pcGameHacks_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DpLjPu"&gt;Activision Publishing, a subsidiary of Activision Blizzard, filed &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21173574-activision-publishing-v-engineowning-ug"&gt;a lawsuit Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; against EngineOwning, a company that advertises cheats for &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; games and other popular online shooters, and is seeking to shut down software that allows people to cheat in any Activision-published game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sXAa1K"&gt;“By this lawsuit, Activision seeks to put a stop to unlawful conduct by an organization that is distributing and selling for profit numerous malicious software products designed to enable members of the public to gain unfair competitive advantages (i.e., to cheat) in the COD Games,” Activision said. “These ongoing activities damage Activision’s games, its overall business, and the experience of the COD player community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBLP3h"&gt;According to the lawsuit, “the Cheating Software enables players to manipulate the COD Games to their personal advantage, such as by automatically aiming weapons, revealing the locations of opponents, and allowing the player to see information that is not normally available to players because it would give them an unfair advantage within the game.” The company says it believes the defendants “have been fully aware that their conduct violates Activision’s rights but nevertheless have brazenly continued their activities.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4mMZQ6"&gt;The company is naming 50 “Does” in the lawsuit, and while it notes the believed identities of some individuals involved with EngineOwning, it acknowledges that “the true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate, associate, or otherwise, of the Doe defendants are unknown to Activision.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zjIbH8"&gt;Activision has recently been making a lot of effort to tamp down cheaters in the &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; games, focusing a particular amount of attention on the hugely popular — and free to play — &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt;. The company rolled out its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724037/call-of-duty-ricochet-anti-cheat-system-kernel-level-driver"&gt;Ricochet anti-cheat system&lt;/a&gt; globally in &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2021/12/RICOCHET-Anti-Cheat-Progress-Report-Global-Deployment"&gt;in December&lt;/a&gt;, and the company said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1473746439553617923"&gt;soon after&lt;/a&gt; that it had banned 48,000 “cheater accounts” thanks to the new system. In the lawsuit, Activision says it has “been able to identify and ban hundreds of thousands of accounts using cheating software in the COD Games in just over the past year.” (That presumably refers to 2021.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qxCmc5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;  48K cheater accounts were banned yesterday across &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Warzone?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Warzone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Vanguard?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Vanguard&lt;/a&gt; thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TeamRICOCHET?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#TeamRICOCHET&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/CEnAUFwcvt"&gt;pic.twitter.com/CEnAUFwcvt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Call of Duty (@CallofDuty) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1473746439553617923?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6gG2nk"&gt;A Twitter account that appears to belong to EngineOwning did not immediately reply to a Twitter DM asking for comment. It has not posted about the lawsuit on that account, and its website is live as of this writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q8ucN6"&gt;Activision Blizzard is currently embroiled in scandal after being sued by the state of California, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;which alleges&lt;/a&gt; it fostered a culture of “constant sexual harassment” and gender-based discrimination. Some workers at the company have entered their &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK/status/1478186596688179202"&gt;third week of a strike&lt;/a&gt; to protest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22816827/raven-software-qa-contractor-layoff-activision-blizzard-call-of-duty"&gt;surprise layoffs of QA employees at Raven Software&lt;/a&gt;, which is known for its work on &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;The OnePlus 10 Pro | OnePlus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O5xlWi"&gt;Rather than announce all of the details of the OnePlus 10 Pro flagship, OnePlus is choosing to space out the details in drips and drabs. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22613909"&gt;First, it released an official teaser image&lt;/a&gt; that revealed the design of the phone alongside a China release date of January 11th. Now, it’s announcing the phone’s specs, which include the newest Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor, ultra fast charging, and a 5,000mAh battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hpZFls"&gt;If you’ve been keeping up on Android news the past few months, none of these details will come as a surprise. Flagship Android phones in the US all tend to feature Qualcomm’s most powerful processor and if there’s any interesting news here, it’s that OnePlus is getting a small jump on Samsung and becoming the first major smartphone to use the new chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zY2nCD"&gt;The rest of the specs are exactly what you’d probably expect. Though, unfortunately, OnePlus is still leaving out a few key details like the amount of RAM on each model, prices, precise screen sizes, and release dates outside of China. In any case, here are a few of the specs it’s revealing today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="w5kB6W"&gt;Processor: Snapdragon 8 Gen 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IMUVv3"&gt;Rear camera: 48MP + 50 MP + 8MP, Dual OIS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nUJbSy"&gt;Front camera: 32MP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="O8Gz5l"&gt;Display: 120Hz “Fluid AMOLED with LTPP”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HcdE8s"&gt;Battery: 5,000mAh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MWFiwr"&gt;Wired charging: 80W SuperVOOC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9uHOIw"&gt;Wireless charging: 50W AirVOOC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NxpCD9"&gt;OS: OxygenOS 12&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ogvvID"&gt;Dimensions: 163 x 73.9 x 8.55mm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="dVNg1T"&gt;There are a few things to note in that list. Along with picking up Oppo’s operating system, the OnePlus 10 is also using Oppo’s branding for its fast-charging system. Until now OnePlus had the same system but used its own Warp Charge brand. Branding aside, the rated speeds are still ridiculously fast. The dimensions also tell us that the OnePlus 10 Pro is a very large phone, nearly the size of a Galaxy S21 Ultra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KMJ3MD"&gt;As with any Android phone these days, there have been plenty of rumors to fill in the gaps. We’re expecting RAM options to either be 8GB or 12GB, with 128GB or 256GB of storage. As for the rest of the details, including a rumored April release, we’ll need to wait for OnePlus to provide more details in its next announcement — or the one after that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aHZOgA"&gt;Why do companies like OnePlus and Google space out the details on their new phones instead of giving us a single announcement? Your guess is as good as ours, but the obvious one is probably the right one: it gives them multiple bites at the Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1OGyFk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chip shortages cost GM the US vehicle sales crown it’s held since 1931</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KUJ9GN"&gt;General Motors is no longer the top seller of vehicles in the US as &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/04/toyota-dethrones-gm-to-become-americas-top-selling-automaker-in-2021.html"&gt;reported Tuesday by &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The Detroit powerhouse lost the crown to Toyota, which reportedly sold about 114,000 more vehicles than GM in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jKHETU"&gt;GM reported Tuesday that total sales were down &lt;a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2022/jan/0104-gmsales.html"&gt;almost 13 percent&lt;/a&gt; last year due to semiconductor shortages. Vehicle and technology companies worldwide have been faced with production difficulties due to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547826/chip-shortage-cars-playstation-5-gpus-semiconductors-time-foundaries-tsmc"&gt;chip shortages&lt;/a&gt;, and GM has had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575836/gm-wireless-charging-cadillac-chevy-tahoe-chip-shortage"&gt;cut features&lt;/a&gt; from some vehicles, such as wireless chargers and HD radios, due to supply issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DbSael"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;

&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FEebbZ"&gt;But things are looking up for GM — the parent company of Chevrolet and GMC says the chip situation is improving. “In 2022, we plan to take advantage of the strong economy and anticipated improved semiconductor supplies to grow our sales and share. We will also further strengthen our industry leadership in trucks and begin our drive to EV leadership in North America,” Steve Carlisle, GM’s president of North America, &lt;a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2022/jan/0104-gmsales.html"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. A major focus for the company now is bolstering its electric vehicle lineup with the new Hummer EV (which it has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/18/22843805/gm-ev-hummer-pickup-truck-delivery"&gt;begun delivering&lt;/a&gt;) plus the upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826236/chevy-silverado-ev-truck-production-sale-date"&gt;Silverado&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22837827/gmc-sierra-denali-ev-electric-pickup-truck-tease"&gt;Denali&lt;/a&gt; EVs.&lt;/p&gt;

The (now) top automaker in the US leads in sales of sedans with the Camry, SUVs with the RAV4, and minivans with the Sienna, &lt;a href="https://pressroom.toyota.com/toyota-motor-north-america-reports-u-s-december-year-end-2021-sales/"&gt;according to a press release&lt;/a&gt;. The company also reported that it was the “number one seller of electrified vehicles for the 22nd consecutive year” — although it has yet to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22187113/toyota-electric-vehicles-us-suv-debut-hybrids"&gt;actually ship&lt;/a&gt; a fully electric one.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>BMW’s iX M60 is a dual-motor performance EV with 280 miles of range</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zIdzAv2brxEtAY9fjZNk7S2_kDU=/0x2:4961x3309/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70348472/BMW_202111__1251.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The second EV to feature the German automaker’s coveted performance branding&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="rx0X4u"&gt;BMW announced the iX M60, the German automaker’s latest performance electric vehicle, and the second EV to be released under its racing-inspired M branding. When it comes out in the summer of 2022, the iX M60 will feature two electric motors, 610 braking horsepower, and will get up to 280 miles of range on a single charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z54YFW"&gt;There are other impressive specs to note, including 811 lb-ft of near-instantaneous torque when in Launch Control, and a 0 to 60mph acceleration time of 3.6 seconds. BMW says that the power delivery of its M-specific electric drivetrain continues into high load ranges, “so acceleration remains almost constant up to the electronically-limited maximum speed of 155 mph when properly equipped.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="IFMD1Z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“acceleration remains almost constant up to the electronically-limited maximum speed of 155 mph”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UTbsSm"&gt;BMW M, which stands for “Motorsport,” was born in May 1972, conceived to support the company’s racing endeavors. Now, as we near the brand’s 50th anniversary, it's being integrated into BMW’s—arguably belated—effort to shift from dirty internal combustion engines to electric vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lI4CRi"&gt;BMW’s iX M60 sports a massive 111.5kWh battery, with a usable 106.3kWh. By way of comparison, the most powerful Tesla, the long-range Model S, has a 100kWh battery, while Mercedes-Benz’s flagship EQS sedan, with 350 miles of range, has one with 107.8kWh of capacity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="w6gkLO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10961822"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zgcSrY"&gt;In terms of charging, BMW says it will take 97 minutes to go from 10 percent to 80 percent while plugged into a 25-amp system delivering 50kW of charge. When plugged into a 250-amp charger delivering 100kW of power, that time drops to 49 minutes. And when plugged into a DC fast charger delivering 250kW of power, the iX M60 will only take 35 minutes to get from 10 to 80 percent charged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tOZzr3"&gt;The company expects to introduce a whole new package of software and advanced driver assist features with the iX M60. Among the features powered by the vehicle’s new computing platform are partially autonomous driving and self-parking features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LkOcmm"&gt;Notably, BMW says it won’t use rare earth materials to power the iX M60’s two motors. Instead, the motors operate on the principle of a “current-energized synchronous machine,” which BMW describes as “the excitation of the rotor is triggered by the precisely metered supply of electrical energy.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HJb5ZW0qqAhVxdJ7y_WJLc-Nd4Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23145987/BMW_202111__1638.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="esTPfX"&gt;Most electric motors are powered by permanent magnets, sometimes no larger than a pack of playing cards, that are made of rare earth metals. The magnets enable the motors to transform electricity into motion, thus powering the vehicle. These rare earth magnets, mostly made of neodymium (NdFeB), are almost entirely mined and processed in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NXPDFa"&gt;By using current-energized synchronous machine principles, BMW says it can achieve a higher energy density, especially in the rear motor, which in turn allows the automaker to achieve levels of performance it expects out of its M-series vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QZ90jBkgYCaiFXnPjvGSOjSqb1g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23145990/BMW_202111__1935.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ANRQW9"&gt;BMW has a raft of new EVs coming out in the next few years, with the goal of achieving 50 percent of sales by 2030. Later this year, the company is releasing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22462504/bmw-i4-ev-price-specs-photos-release-date"&gt;i4 electric sedan&lt;/a&gt;, with up to 300 miles of range and starting at $55,400 for the low-spec model. It’s also developing an electric version of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21345464/bmw-5-7-series-x1-electric-car-ev-plug-in"&gt;5 Series and 7 Series sedans&lt;/a&gt; as well as its entry-level X1 SUV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NwEJYo"&gt;That means almost all of the German luxury automaker’s most popular cars will soon have all-electric variants. A fully electric version of the 3 Series, BMW’s most popular car in the US, has &lt;a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-electric-bmw-3-series-spied-testing"&gt;already been spotted in testing camouflage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bFz7VV"&gt;There have been some twists, though. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21324114/bmw-ix3-electric-suv-range-specs-price-china-europe"&gt;iX3&lt;/a&gt;, the all-electric version of its top-selling X3 SUV,&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21324114/bmw-ix3-electric-suv-range-specs-price-china-europe"&gt; won’t be available in the US&lt;/a&gt;, only in Europe and China. And the tiny i3 electric hatchback was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554419/bmw-i3-discontinued-us-electric-hatchback-sales"&gt;discontinued last year&lt;/a&gt; after low sales. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Kindle deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tK_0rJq3OvCws9YqPVzhFSZzZQk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67715739/cgartenberg_211020_4803_0006.8.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition is one of many e-readers currently available as part of a discounted bundle at Amazon.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AZCNr8"&gt;When it comes to finding a device to use to read your ebooks, you have a few options to choose from. You can always buy a tablet or use your smartphone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doom-scrolling on Twitter. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while niche, are designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with limited functionality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDKHVT"&gt;Amazon, one of the pioneers of the e-reader, has dominated the space for years with its Kindle lineup, which consists of several unique models with their own pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2UeWxe"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each model currently available for purchase. Sometimes, there isn’t a deal for one, or any, of the products, which is why we’ve mentioned the most recent sale price in those instances. While newer models like the 2021 Kindle Paperwhite are currently only available for full price, keep in mind that the retailer also offers 20 percent off all of its Kindles when you trade in select devices, so there are still other ways to save money when none of the models are available at a discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="U51BKy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"},{"title":"Here are the best Amazon Echo deals right now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21546591/best-amazon-echo-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="r36wrm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10741941"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jqPttv"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/4/10/18302177/amazon-kindle-base-model-low-resolution-screen-backlight-review"&gt;Kindle (10th-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="mXAcFi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10363966"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hfprjz"&gt;The 10th-gen Kindle is Amazon’s most affordable e-reader, and as such, it usually retails for $89.99. Released in 2019, the base Kindle includes a front light, 8GB of storage, and comes with or without ad support. Despite including the same 167ppi resolution as its predecessors, the latest model features a slightly higher contrast than earlier models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIAlEv"&gt;Right now, you can buy a 10th-gen Kindle with lock screen ads at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VT322X/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1221005/2092?subId1=VergeBestKindleDeals121021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-kindle-8gb-now-with-a-built-in-front-light-8211-black%2F-%2FA-79804909%2F"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfxG6j9qO2d" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $89.99, its typical retail price. If you want one without ads, you can grab it for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VZV5VB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$109.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. If you buy either Kindle model at Amazon, you’ll also receive three months of Kindle Unlimited at no additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTnhuW"&gt;If you want to save some money on additional accessories for the e-reader, Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Essentials-including-Amazon-Printed-Adapter/dp/B08C6NDPFM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Essentials Bundle&lt;/a&gt; is $119.97 ($15 off its usual price) at Amazon; it includes an ad-supported Kindle in either black or white, one of three printed covers, and a power adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RkX3DN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ze80m8"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/7/20902588/kindle-kids-edition-amazon-bundle-young-e-reader-case-replacement-program-freetime" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Kids (2019)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JypT34"&gt;The entry-level Kindle and Oasis models were not the only ones that received a refresh in 2019. Amazon also announced and released the Kindle Kids, which provides age-appropriate content for younger readers who prefer digital books for $109.99 ($20 more than the base Kindle at standard MSRP). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LlYfl"&gt;The Kindle Kids Edition consists of five items: the device, a case, a two-year extended replacement guarantee (in the event the device breaks), and one year of Amazon Kids Plus service. The latter is the biggest selling point of the device aside from the kid-friendly patterns, as it allows parents to grant their kids access to a digital library of kid-friendly books like &lt;em&gt;Percy Jackson&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit &lt;/em&gt;at no additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IHO6IB"&gt;Right now, it’s only available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NMY72SC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1746224890339507137" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $109.99, the full retail price, though, we did see it drop to $60 during Black Friday and Cyber Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside id="0EetaF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our over 41,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="t6m9om"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22745670/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2021-review-usb-c-signature-edition-display-e-reader-books" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Paperwhite (2021)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="deHMlR"&gt;Amazon’s latest Kindle Paperwhite is its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22684801/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-features-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;11th-gen model&lt;/a&gt;, which comes with USB-C support, longer battery life, and a larger, 6.8-inch display. Given just how recently the new e-reader launched, however, we haven’t seen a ton of discounts yet. Thankfully, you can still pick up the last-gen model, which is frequently available for far less than the standard retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FkwzBt"&gt;The 2021 Kindle Paperwhite comes in three main configurations: an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KTZ8249/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB model with ads for $139.99&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N38WQSH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB without ads for $159.99&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08B495319/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB Signature Edition for $189.99&lt;/a&gt;. The latter is identical to the standard Paperwhite, except it also features Qi wireless charging and a sensor that will automatically adjust the backlight when needed. Amazon has also rolled out a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WPB8PW9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Paperwhite Kids Edition for $159.99&lt;/a&gt;, which comes bundled with a kid-friendly cover, a two-year extended replacement guarantee, and a year of Amazon Kids Plus, much like the aforementioned Kindle Kids. All 2021 models are also similar to the 2018 model in that they feature a waterproof design and Audible audiobook support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rrLCU1"&gt;Currently, the ad-supported Kindle Paperwhite is available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Kindle-Paperwhite-adjustable-Ad-Supported/dp/B08KTZ8249/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgjh6fhT1VK" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1230703/2092?subId1=VergeBestKindleDeals122921&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fall-new-amazon-kindle-paperwhite-6-8-34-8gb-tablet-black%2F-%2FA-84609459" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; starting at $139.99, its full retail price. Amazon also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Essentials-Bundle-including/dp/B09FC51SFK/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offers it as part of a bundle&lt;/a&gt; that includes a power adapter and one of three fabric covers for $189.97, however, which is a $20 discount. The 32GB, ad-free Signature Edition is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09FNY4RRP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $249.97 as part of a discounted bundle, too, which also includes a “cork” cover and a wireless charging dock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XEYFbp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10765216"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="S8bhtR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10913659"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="iorwh0"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/7/18065960/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2018-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Paperwhite (2018)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UaH6Zy"&gt;While there currently are no price breaks on the 2021 Kindle Paperwhite — save for the $20 discount available on the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition Bundle — retailers like Amazon and Best Buy often lower the price of the last-gen model to $89.99 during major shopping holidays and bigger sales events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jYvMzL"&gt;Although the e-reader is not on sale as a standalone device at the moment, Amazon is discounting the Kindle Paperwhite Essentials Bundle in select color configurations, which includes either the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TSLFS9W/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB e-reader with ads for $169.97&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TTF2SPJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB reader with ads for $199.97&lt;/a&gt;, along with a leather case and power adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5RQ0ML"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10953222"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="X5jbTU"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707619/amazon-kindle-oasis-2019-e-reader-review-price-specs-features-display" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Oasis (third-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IByP4u"&gt;The Kindle Oasis is the most expensive of the lineup, starting at $250. The device comes in two storage configurations, 8GB or 32GB, and like the other models, you can get it with or without ads on the lock screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1AvXZM"&gt;The 2019 Kindle Oasis looks very similar to the previous model. It retains its waterproof, 7-inch, 300ppi E Ink display and supports Audible audiobooks via Bluetooth. However, unlike previous models, it can adjust the color temperature to a yellow-toned display, making it easier to read at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxP7sb"&gt;In the past, we’ve seen the 8GB Kindle Oasis drop to as low as $174.99, which is the lowest it has ever been for that configuration to date. While there are currently no deals on just the Oasis itself, configurations start at $249.99 at Amazon and include three free months of Kindle Unlimited. The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHV8D7P?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB, ad-supported Oasis&lt;/a&gt; is $249.99 and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VDMJJLG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one without ads is $269.99&lt;/a&gt;. If you need more storage, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VCMJSLB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB version is $279.99 with ads&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VGTRMFS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$299.99 without&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XuGlPY"&gt;If you’re looking for a discount, the Essentials bundle is on sale at Amazon for $30 off its normal list price. You can get either the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RSVGLKV/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB, ad-supported configuration for as low as $279.97&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RW2K1MD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB variant for $309.97&lt;/a&gt;, both of which come with a leather cover, a power adapter, and three months of Kindle Unlimited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hPPu8s"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552599"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Robinhood debuts First Trade Recommendations for beginner investors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rvbWV5qK8D-AWrcztxlXURqkGF0=/222x0:2214x1328/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70348390/robinhood_first_trade_recommendation.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image by Robinhood&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bnd7Vn"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2022/1/3/kick-off-the-new-year-with-first-trade-recommendations"&gt;Robinhood has introduced&lt;/a&gt; a new experience geared towards trading noobs, and the company says its personalized stock recommendations could help beginners get a sense of the technical side of trading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="240Qgs"&gt;If you’re a new user and haven’t added anything to your Investment Profile, you’ll get the option to choose “Get help with your first investment” from the Investing tab. Robinhood will then present you with a questionnaire that asks what your investment goals are, how long you plan on investing your money, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1yLBYf"&gt;Based on those answers, Robinhood will recommend a personalized portfolio containing four diverse exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with additional information about each fund and why Robinhood picked it for you. Once you’ve reviewed all of the funds, you can choose whether or not you want to invest in the recommended ETFs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NWHSqgnR2rbNKG4lVfNuYDxmQtU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23145519/robinhood_stock_market_tour.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image by Robinhood&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zP3mTU"&gt;And if you feel especially lost when it comes to investing, Robinhood is now offering something it calls “Tours” to show you the ropes of trading. The app will provide a quick overview of investment-related terminology, along with some of the important elements you might come across when using the app and trading in general. It’s definitely something I could’ve used when dabbling in the stock market for the first time — and is probably something I could still use if I’m honest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1xUNGo"&gt;It’s obviously best to use your own judgment and research and not to over-rely on a simple questionnaire for making major investment choices. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557419/robinhood-finra-fine-70-million"&gt;Robinhood was fined $70 million by financial regulators&lt;/a&gt; last year for not properly protecting investors and supervising trades, and it’s possible that carefully vetted advice will stop it from repeating that experience. It can’t be much riskier than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22618238/online-stock-education-communities-discords-robinhood-trading"&gt;relying on Reddit or Discord for tips&lt;/a&gt; (for many investors, at least).&lt;/p&gt;
