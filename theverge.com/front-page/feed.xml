    <title>Google is weighing an anti-tracking feature for Android, following Apple’s lead</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7GqZ7rzl3eJHMMEzH_uM2rn3p38=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68770894/acastro_190228_1777_vpn_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OQOo4A"&gt;Google is considering developing an Android alternative to Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253366/apple-app-tracking-transparency-opt-in-requirement-beta-launch"&gt;upcoming App Tracking Transparency&lt;/a&gt;, a new planned opt-in requirement the iPhone maker will impose on developers that demands they ask for permission to track iOS users across apps and websites. The news, first &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-04/google-explores-alternative-to-apple-s-new-anti-tracking-feature?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;reported on Thursday by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, underscores the increasing pressure on large tech companies, many spurred on by Apple, to take more proactive measures to better protect user privacy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MkP3j3"&gt;Google won’t say whether it is indeed working on an anti-tracking privacy measure for Android. But in a statement, a Google spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, “We’re always looking for ways to work with developers to raise the bar on privacy while enabling a healthy, ad-supported app ecosystem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w2S3M4"&gt;First announced at Apple’s developer conference last summer, App Tracking Transparency effectively slides a system-level opt in between an app’s tracking capabilities and a user’s preferences. If the user says they would rather not be tracked, there’s nothing the developer can do to get around that because Apple will disable a developer’s ability to gather the so-called Identifier for Advertisers code, or IDFA. That code both lets advertisers track users from one app or website to another for ad targeting while also helping advertisers measure the effectiveness of ads, such as whether a user ends up purchasing a product they saw on one app by using the mobile website of the merchant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vdCIpJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google’s take on App Tracking Transparency may not be as severe&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CWkW9z"&gt;Apple intends to police developers using audits and other methods to enforce its policies, which include potentially suspending or banning apps from the App Store if a developer does not comply. Both Facebook and Google have publicly expressed concern for how Apple’s opt-in requirement could negatively affect their mobile advertising networks. But Facebook has gone a step further and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260274/facebook-prompt-apple-ios-ad-tracking-opt-in-permission-privacy-update"&gt;begun waging a public relations war&lt;/a&gt; against Apple over the change by complaining it will harm small businesses and accusing Apple of being self-serving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vNoHfl"&gt;Google’s take on App Tracking Transparency would likely not be as severe, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports. Instead of forcing opt-in requirements on app developers, the Android alternative may resemble some of the upcoming privacy controls planned for Google’s Chrome browser, in which the company seeks to end some of the more insidious tracking technologies on the web today by developing less invasive alternatives and giving users more opt-out mechanisms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cf9YCA"&gt;Google’s work to develop new privacy practices and standards for the web is known as the &lt;a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-privacy/privacy-sandbox"&gt;Privacy Sandbox&lt;/a&gt;. As part of that ongoing project, Google has taken steps to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349538/google-changes-ads-data-cookies-privacy"&gt;phase out third-party cookies on Chrome&lt;/a&gt; and is working on tools that allow advertisers to target groups of users instead of directly targeting individuals. All of this could inform how Google develops an anti-tracking measure for Android, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Smartmatic sues Fox News, Rudy Giuliani, and others over election disinformation campaign</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-POLITICS-ELECTION-TRUMP" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rF8vzfFRRyvvIFjYDz12d0TKHe4=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68770796/1230450427.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZMjKjC"&gt;Voting tech company &lt;a href="https://www.smartmatic.com/uploads/Smartmatic_Complaint_Against_Fox_Corporation.pdf"&gt;Smartmatic has sued&lt;/a&gt; Fox News, former Trump attorneys Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell, and TV host Lou Dobbs for spreading a conspiracy theory about the 2020 US presidential election. The New York state court lawsuit says Fox and others deliberately made Smartmatic the “villain” in a false story about fraudulent voting. Since then, it says, employees have received death threats, and clients have balked at the company’s tarnished reputation. It’s demanding $2.7 billion in damages and a full retraction of all false statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pZo5Pf"&gt;Smartmatic figured heavily in a sprawling and baseless claim that former President Donald Trump won the 2020 election. The conspiracy &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-smartmatic-ceo-biden-team-d/fact-checksmartmatic-ceo-is-not-on-bidensteamsmartmatic-software-is-not-on-dominion-voting-machines-idUSKBN2801ZJ"&gt;alleged that Smartmatic&lt;/a&gt; secretly owned its competitor Dominion and was founded by associates of long-dead Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in order to steal elections. (Smartmatic’s founders are from Venezuela, but they launched the company in Florida and deny any links to Chavez.) It also asserted that Smartmatic technology contained a “backdoor” that had let conspirators remotely change vote counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hjR1U6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Smartmatic was roped into a sprawling conspiracy involving rigged votes and Hugo Chavez&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Txmsez"&gt;As Smartmatic notes, the company is unaffiliated with Dominion and played a minimal role in the election, providing software only to Los Angeles County. However, the claims received &lt;a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/voter-fraud-and-suppression/smartmatic-conspiracy-theories-proliferated-throughout-right-wing-media"&gt;widespread coverage&lt;/a&gt; on conservative news networks like Fox, often through Powell and Giuliani, who were promoting a &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/4ad3ad/sidney-powells-release-the-kraken-lawsuits-are-a-real-mess"&gt;fruitless legal fight&lt;/a&gt; to overturn the election results. “Defendants’ story was a lie. All of it. And they knew it,” the complaint reads. “Overnight, Smartmatic went from an under-the-radar election technology and software company with a track record of success to the villain in Defendants’ disinformation campaign.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hfryjj"&gt;Smartmatic — which operates in several fields outside election tech — claims the disinformation campaign caused at least two commercial partners to suspend their business relationship. The complaint also says it has threatened employees’ safety. Soon after the reports started, the company was “inundated” with emails and voicemails, some claiming that “you all will be hunted” or that the only way to restore election integrity was to “shoot dead your company executives.” One caller allegedly harassed an executive’s 14-year-old son, and despite increased security, the threats have “left Smartmatic’s personnel shaken and scared.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PR9601"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Threats “left Smartmatic’s personnel shaken and scared”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PoCcme"&gt;The company previously threatened Fox and other outlets with a lawsuit, leading Fox hosts to air a video effectively contradicting their earlier segments. However, it argues that Dobbs (along with Maria Bartiromo and Jeanine Pirro, who are also named in the suit) never acknowledged the network had promoted false claims. And it says Fox “intentionally avoided” experts who might contract the false claims about Smartmatic, even after the stories were widely debunked elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ApAiyz"&gt;A Fox spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; that “Fox News Media is committed to providing the full context of every story with in-depth reporting and clear opinion” and “will vigorously defend this meritless lawsuit in court.” Powell called the suit “another political maneuver motivated by the radical left that has no basis in fact or law.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmkYtJ"&gt;Smartmatic’s competitor Dominion has &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22249207/dominion-voting-systems-rudy-giuliani-defamation-billion-2020-election-donald-trump-sidney-powell"&gt;already filed lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; against Powell and Giuliani. Together, the cases will test whether libel law can defend some targets of disinformation campaigns — which often spread online but &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/20/business/media/smartmatic-lawsuit-fox-news-newsmax-oan.html"&gt;start with major media networks&lt;/a&gt; and public figures.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Genetic testing firm 23andMe is going public via a SPAC backed by Richard Branson</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="23Andme" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ezYSxCHWCkkCY44Iw04hXsefZ2M=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68770758/1061811696.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IcdhJO"&gt;Home DNA-testing company 23andMe will go public via special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) backed by Virgin Group founder Richard Branson, the &lt;a href="https://vgacquisition.com/"&gt;companies announced Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Is5UCY"&gt;“We have always believed that healthcare needs to be driven by the consumer, and we have a huge opportunity to help personalize the entire experience at scale, allowing individuals to be more proactive about their health and wellness,” 23andMe CEO and co-founder Anne Wojcicki said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ScKPc8"&gt;The deal values the company at $3.5 billion, and current shareholders will own 81 percent of the company. Wojcicki and Branson each invested $25 million themselves as part of the $250 million fund formed to take the company public. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter, at which time the company will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ME.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Mq8dLG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;As an early investor, I've seen &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/23andMe?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@23andMe&lt;/a&gt; develop into a company with enormous growth potential. Driven by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/annewoj23?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@annewoj23&lt;/a&gt;'s vision to empower consumers, and with our support, I’m excited to see 23andMe make a positive difference to many more people’s lives &lt;a href="https://t.co/BEAISMort5"&gt;https://t.co/BEAISMort5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/q5PFb8Re0V"&gt;pic.twitter.com/q5PFb8Re0V&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Richard Branson (@richardbranson) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/richardbranson/status/1357301222479450119?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FxfaPe"&gt;SPACs, which grew in popularity in 2020, are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;formed by groups of investors with the intent of acquiring a company&lt;/a&gt;. Also known as a “blank-check” company, a SPAC is seen as a less-risky option than the traditional IPO, and it gives newer companies access to late-stage company amounts of capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="8VN7pc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"SPACs, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="1JlGIS"&gt;Launched in 2006, 23andMe sells saliva kits people can use at home to determine their genetic ancestry and their chances of developing certain diseases. The company has an estimated 10 million customers in its database and says more than 80 percent of customers agree to participate in medical research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dgGPyy"&gt;Wojcicki said Thursday that the funds will let the company expand into developing therapeutics, seen as a more lucrative market than consumer DNA testing, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/23andme-to-go-public-with-richard-branson-backed-spac-11612450687"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. A slide deck announcing the deal showed the company sees big growth potential in the therapeutics market. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-6jnf30srVVkfSQ_T4tC8MT3oZs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22282023/23andme_slide.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;23andMe&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The slide deck from 23andMe SPAC presentation shows how much growth potential the company sees in therapeutics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4jHSan"&gt;Some blame the downturn in the popularity of DNA home testing on privacy concerns, including reports that the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/customers-handed-over-their-dna-the-company-let-the-fbi-take-a-look-11566491162?mod=article_inline"&gt;FBI had used genetic results from consumer DNA companies’ databases&lt;/a&gt; to solve cold case crimes. 23andMe and other firms have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/1/17638680/genetic-data-privacy-consumer-rights-guidelines-23andme-ancestry"&gt;promised not to share customers’ data without consent&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OubU8D"&gt;Wojcicki acknowledged a slowdown in the DNA home-testing market on Thursday. “We have always seen health as a much bigger opportunity” than DNA ancestry, she told the &lt;em&gt;WSJ.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ErJZNk"&gt;Branson, an early investor in 23andMe, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-04/23andme-to-go-public-as-3-5-billion-company-via-branson-merger"&gt;said Thursday&lt;/a&gt; “there is no better money to invest than in health care.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chrome is blocking popular extension The Great Suspender, but there’s a way to recover your tabs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VfUIJmI6mv4ZOly5Lc3GLKS9xeQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68770590/acastro_200207_3900_chrome_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f9GYXk"&gt;Google has apparently blocked The Great Suspender extension from Chrome, with existing users now receiving a message that it has “been disabled because it contains malware.” It’s also been removed from the Chrome Web Store, with &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-great-suspender/klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg"&gt;any links to it&lt;/a&gt; now leading to a 404 page. Some are worried about losing their tabs, but &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chrome/comments/lch3k5/warning_please_immediately_uninstall_the_great/gm0murs?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;Reddit users have found a way to recover them&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;em&gt;XDA-Developers’&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1357397229980549126"&gt;Mishaal Rahman&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FrKyyM"&gt;The Great Suspender was a hugely useful extension — minus the malware, at least — for keeping your browser running smoothly. The tool would automatically shut down tabs that you hadn’t looked at for a while, replacing them with a blank gray screen. Return to the tab, and you could click to reload back to where you were. Given Chrome’s tendency to hog much of a computer’s memory, the extension was a simple way to keep your browser moving a bit faster, without actually forcing you to close old tabs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tSuIBvY0crMurfEZ6R1FC4rcTaU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22281952/Screen_Shot_2021_02_04_at_1.19.16_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The warning Chrome gives users if they have the extension installed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2ABuZ9"&gt;If you used the extension and are looking to get your tabs back, the steps are simple, if a bit tedious. If the tabs were open, you can go to them and click into the URL bar. There will be a ton of text that looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="YKZ40Y"&gt;chrome-extension://klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg/suspended.html#ttl=%22Dawn%22%20Dario%20Marianelli%20(Pride%20%26%20Prejudice)%20Piano%20solo%20%26%20Tutorial%20-%20P.%20Barton%20-%20YouTube&amp;amp;pos=0&amp;amp;uri=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJXGLl_sEDU&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="aHXQ8J"&gt;At the end will be the address for the page you were on. Deleting everything before the URL and hitting enter will bring the page back to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MuNDxE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chrome/comments/lch3k5/warning_please_immediately_uninstall_the_great/gm0murs?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;Reddit user avatar_ENG also discovered&lt;/a&gt; you can still get those tabs back by searching your Chrome history. It’s basically the same process as above: you search for the extension’s ID, klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg, then open the tabs and remove the junk. It may be an annoying process, but it’s better than losing any work or incredible memes you had open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ZpscW"&gt;Neither Google nor the developers of the extension immediately responded to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter team up to crack down on hackers who steal rare usernames</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U3xvqURkdPcl31BNC6cwc4Hxgy0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68770421/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ssQNvO"&gt;Instagram has disabled hundreds of accounts that were stolen as part of online hacking operations designed to gain access to and sell rare and coveted usernames, the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Both TikTok and Twitter also took action on some of the accounts belonging to the same hackers, &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/02/facebook-instagram-tiktok-and-twitter-target-resellers-of-hacked-accounts/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+KrebsOnSecurity+%28Krebs+on+Security%29"&gt;reports journalist and cybersecurity expert Brian Krebs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJ6KGp"&gt;The Facebook-owned platform set its sights mainly on the community surrounding OGUsers, a website well-known for trafficking in stolen usernames and helping facilitate the hacking of these accounts through methods like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/31/20841448/jack-dorsey-twitter-hacked-account-sim-swapping"&gt;SIM swapping&lt;/a&gt;, which is when a user gains control of someone’s phone number and uses it to reset passwords and take control of social media handles. News of Instagram’s enforcement was &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-instagram-cyber-idUSKBN2A42HY"&gt;first reported on Thursday by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kKTe4L"&gt;“Today, we’re removing hundreds of accounts connected to members of the OGUsers forum. They harass, extort and cause harm to the Instagram community, and we will continue to do all we can to make it difficult for them to profit from Instagram usernames,” a Facebook spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The disclosure is notable because it’s the first time the platform has publicly shared information regarding moderation against username hackers. Earlier this week, Instagram released a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262154/instagram-recently-deleted-feature-update"&gt;new feature that lets people recover deleted posts&lt;/a&gt;, in the event a hacker takes control of their account and wipes it clean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bXQ8C5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook and Instagram are taking action against online username-stealing communities&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IwDrTZ"&gt;Krebs reported on Thursday that the crackdown was something of a joint effort, with Twitter and TikTok also taking action against popular OGUsers community members at the same time on those companies’ respective platforms (although it’s unclear how much coordination there was between the three companies or how far-reaching TikTok and Twitter’s enforcement was). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UnmiCJ"&gt;“As part of our ongoing work to find and stop inauthentic behavior, we recently reclaimed a number of TikTok usernames that were being used for account squatting,” TikTok told Krebs in a statement. “We will continue to focus on staying ahead of the ever-evolving tactics of bad actors, including cooperating with third parties and others in the industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WiNeLO"&gt;In addition to disabling the accounts that were stolen, rendering them worthless, the social platforms have also disabled some accounts of well-known OGUsers middlemen who act as intermediaries during username transactions by holding funds in escrow in exchange for a cut of the fee, reports &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ydl6Sr"&gt;OGUsers made headlines last summer when a small cohort of hackers affiliated with the site allegedly participated in an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21327769/twitter-bitcoin-scam-news-updates"&gt;unprecedented Twitter hack &lt;/a&gt;that involved resetting the passwords on the accounts of dozens of high-profile individuals and companies, including Elon Musk and Barack Obama, and using their access to run a bitcoin scam. Like the individual at the center of the Twitter hack, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355746/twitter-hack-teen-hearing-zoombombed-zoom-call-judge"&gt;then-17-year-old Graham Ivan Clark&lt;/a&gt;, many of the hackers Instagram is cracking down on today and those who frequent OGUsers are minors, often drawn into the community by the allure of stealing and retaining a rare username of their own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FFNLnl"&gt;These usernames tend to be single words — in rare cases, individual letters or numbers — and they can fetch tens of thousands of dollars on underground markets for stolen digital goods. And because platforms like Instagram and Twitter have &lt;a href="https://help.instagram.com/581066165581870"&gt;rules barring the buying and selling of accounts&lt;/a&gt;, the hackers interested in procuring one of these coveted handles often resort to illegal means to obtain them. SIM hacking is a popular method, but standard phishing as well as sustained online harassment, extortion, and even swatting are other known techniques, notes &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The next victim of the global microchip shortage is Ford’s most profitable truck, the F-150</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S-gXXx4sGzsUSGBbsteEa1nOnbs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68770242/All_new_F_150_006.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bqCHrh"&gt;Many companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/10/22222166/semiconductor-shortage-ford-idle-kentucky-toyota-nissan-volkswagen"&gt;have had to scale back car production&lt;/a&gt; due to a global computer chip shortage, but &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/04/ford-forced-to-cut-pickup-production-due-to-semiconductor-shortage-.html"&gt;CNBC is reporting&lt;/a&gt; that the shortages are finally hitting &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.edmunds.com%2Fmost-popular-cars%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F4%2F22266483%2Fford-f150-production-slowdown-semiconductor-chip-shortage#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;America’s most popular vehicle&lt;/a&gt;: the Ford F-150. According to the report, Ford is temporarily cutting the number of shifts in its truck production plants in half: its Dearborn, Michigan, factory is going from three shifts a week to one, and its Kansas City, Missouri, plant is going from three shifts to two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tu7At1"&gt;CNBC quotes Ford spokesperson Kelli Felker as saying Ford expects the plants to return to normal operation in a couple of weeks, and the company is “working closely with suppliers to address potential production constraints tied to the global semiconductor shortage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mKO0hg"&gt;This isn’t the first time microchip shortages have hit the car industry, or even Ford. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/volkswagen-china-production/chip-shortages-could-slow-automotive-production-vw-and-suppliers-say-idUSKBN28E1IN"&gt;Volkswagen had to change car production in December&lt;/a&gt; due to the shortage, and &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Automobiles/Honda-cuts-car-production-on-massive-chip-shortage"&gt;Honda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/03/general-motors-hit-by-chip-shortage-will-cut-production-at-four-plants.html"&gt;GM&lt;/a&gt; have also had to cut back. &lt;a href="https://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/local/2021/02/03/nissan-truck-production-reduced-canton-plant-due-chip-shortage/4369759001/"&gt;Nissan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-09/toyota-says-chip-shortage-impacting-output-of-texas-made-trucks"&gt;Toyota&lt;/a&gt; have had to slow their truck production lines as well. For Ford’s part, earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/10/22222166/semiconductor-shortage-ford-idle-kentucky-toyota-nissan-volkswagen"&gt;it had to shut down the factory&lt;/a&gt; that made Ford Escapes and Lincoln Corsairs for a week because it couldn’t get the computer parts it needed. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-13/overview-of-japan-carmakers-halting-output-due-to-chip-shortage"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; has an overview&lt;/a&gt; of how most of Japan’s automakers are affected one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LLn9SS"&gt;While the shortages are hitting the entire industry, the F-150 is a big deal in the US, where the iconic F-series is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.edmunds.com%2Fmost-popular-cars%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F4%2F22266483%2Fford-f150-production-slowdown-semiconductor-chip-shortage#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the bestselling vehicle in the country&lt;/a&gt;. They’re also &lt;a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/why-the-ford-f-150-is-a-profit-machine"&gt;Ford’s most profitable vehicles&lt;/a&gt;, so making fewer of them isn’t likely to be a decision the motor company would make unless it had to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mnLjnc"&gt;We here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; often ask the question “what’s a computer?” but I suspect most people wouldn’t answer “the F-150.” But modern cars have computer systems for almost every component these days, from digital speedometers to vital vehicle functions like controlling emissions and emergency brake systems. If Ford, or other car manufacturers, isn’t able to get the computer chips it needs, it won’t be able to build functioning modern cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6aTQDd"&gt;Of course, the chip shortages aren’t just hitting the car industry — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227040/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-3070-3060-ti-3090-rx-6800-xt"&gt;AMD, Nvidia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"&gt;Microsoft, and Sony&lt;/a&gt; were famously not able to meet demand with their launches last year, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Fearnings%2Fcall-transcripts%2F2021%2F02%2F03%2Fqualcomm-qcom-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcript%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F4%2F22266483%2Fford-f150-production-slowdown-semiconductor-chip-shortage#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Qualcomm’s CEO is warning&lt;/a&gt; that it’s not just the latest, highest-tech products that will see shortages.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple patent application imagines charging cables that might not fray so easily</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KYm_3AqklTk6timJyw4xedSps0g=/0x167:1000x834/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68770228/MD818.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Lightning to USB-A cable.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hx2l9U"&gt;Apple’s charging cables aren’t &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/30/9072323/lightning-cable-issues"&gt;exactly known for their durability&lt;/a&gt;. They often fray after a year or two and can even break down to the point where they won’t charge your device at all. (I’ve also noticed they can turn an increasingly sour shade of yellow.) But Apple is apparently working on some ideas to make its cables more durable, &lt;a href="http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.html&amp;amp;r=13&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;f=G&amp;amp;l=50&amp;amp;d=PG01&amp;amp;S1=(apple.AANM.+AND+20210204.PD.)&amp;amp;OS=aanm/apple+and+pd/2/4/2021&amp;amp;RS=(AANM/apple+AND+PD/20210204)"&gt;filing a patent application&lt;/a&gt; for a “Cable with Variable Stiffness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wiL1Pb"&gt;The patent, first &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/02/04/apple-may-have-a-solution-for-fraying-lightning-cables"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;AppleInsider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, describes some different ideas for a cable that wouldn’t fray as easily. The methods would give different parts of the cable varying levels of stiffness, while keeping the cable uniformly thick. They would also replace what Apple calls the “strain relief sleeve” — the stiff cap you’ll find at the ends of many cables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ht6xY5"&gt;The strain relief sleeve helps prevent the cable from breaking due to bends, which can be helpful since cables are often bent sharply near the ends to plug them in. The thing is, those sleeves often don’t stop cables from fraying anyway. Apple’s ideas in this patent vary the flexibility and stiffness across an entire cable, which would theoretically protect better against fraying no matter where you regularly bend it, all without increasing the thickness (meaning no more strain relief sleeves).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/auNqs7Z-JHYkSD3zXSKZEa_16Ao=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22281634/Screen_Shot_2021_02_04_at_9.50.41_AM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A diagram from Apple’s patent for a cable with variable stiffness.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Go8OWt"&gt;This is just a patent application, and there’s no guarantee that Apple will use this design in future cables. But the fact that Apple has filed this application is a good sign that it is thinking about cable durability. Hopefully we see some improvements down the line. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Two Google engineers quit over firing of ethical AI leader Timnit Gebru</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DAh9QTporX95ZeY7Sl4zabTA1Qg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68770009/acastro_180130_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0ppWnm"&gt;Two Google engineers have quit over the treatment of Timnit Gebru, former co-lead of the ethical AI team. David Baker, an engineering director, said Gebru’s dismissal “extinguished” his desire to remain at the company. Vinesh Kannan, a software engineer, said he was leaving because Gebru and April Christina Curley, a diversity recruiter, were “wronged.” &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-resignations/two-google-engineers-resign-over-firing-of-ai-ethics-researcher-timnit-gebru-idUSKBN2A4090"&gt;The news was first reported by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6H9xg4"&gt;“We cannot say we believe in making a more understanding, informed world, and then ignore how our products amplify biases,” Baker wrote &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fdavid-baker-82552%2Fdetail%2Ftreasury%2Fposition%3A1871451%2F%3FentityUrn%3Durn%253Ali%253Afsd_profileTreasuryMedia%253A%28ACoAAAABpx0BNDjuO71etPuXTsHCmQvmWfNlj2w%252C1611115642127%29%26section%3Dposition%253A1871451%26treasuryCount%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F4%2F22266513%2Fgoogle-engineers-quit-timnit-gebru-ethical-ai-april-christina-curley-firing#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in a farewell note to colleagues&lt;/a&gt;. “We cannot say we believe in diversity, and then ignore the conspicuous absence of many voices from within our walls.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RwzPvc"&gt;The departures point to an ongoing conflict between Google management and staff. In December, Gebru said she was abruptly fired over an &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/the-withering-email-that-got-an-ethical"&gt;email she sent to the Brain Women and Allies listserv&lt;/a&gt;. In the note, she spoke openly about her doubts regarding Google’s commitment to diversity and inclusion. After she went public, &lt;a href="https://googlewalkout.medium.com/standing-with-dr-timnit-gebru-isupporttimnit-believeblackwomen-6dadc300d382"&gt;2,695 employees signed an open letter&lt;/a&gt; calling on Google to do better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfbLLV"&gt;Later that month, Curley tweeted about her September 2020 firing. “THEY DO NOT WANT BLACK TALENT,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RealAbril/status/1341135837585534976"&gt;she said&lt;/a&gt;. “Take it from ME- their most successful BLACK QUEER WOMAN recruiter who they fired in the middle of a MF pandemic because they were tired of hearing me call them out on their racist bullshit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oQe4xn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Take it from ME- their most successful BLACK QUEER WOMAN recruiter who they fired in the middle of a MF pandemic because they were tired of hearing me call them out on their racist bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;— Real Abril  (@RealAbril) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RealAbril/status/1341135838365712384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 21, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oEsFIN"&gt;In a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Google spokesperson said: “We don’t agree with the way April describes her termination, but it’s not appropriate for us to provide a commentary about her claims.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wTmvnE"&gt;Kannan announced his resignation on Twitter on February 3rd. He said the company’s treatment of Gebru and Curley &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vineshgkannan/status/1357130615745892355"&gt;crossed a personal red line&lt;/a&gt;: “retaliation against a teammate who stands up for something I believe in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hji5BL"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Yesterday was my last day at Google. I left because Google's mistreatment of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timnitGebru?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@timnitGebru&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RealAbril?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@RealAbril&lt;/a&gt; crossed a personal red line I wrote down when I started the job. I know I gained a lot from Google, but I also gained a lot from both of their work, and they were wronged.&lt;/p&gt;— Vinesh Kannan (@vineshgkannan) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vineshgkannan/status/1357115873723637764?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VHDBTw"&gt;In January, roughly 230 Google employees announced they were forming a union, building on years of employee activism. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/04/technology/google-employees-union.html"&gt;The news was first reported by &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Today, that organization, the Alphabet Workers Union, has more than 800 members. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPC6cw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="3SKzU1"&gt;If you have been having &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay"&gt;a hard time&lt;/a&gt; finding &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/PlayStation-5-Console/363472942&amp;amp;sharedid=verge&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Be%5D22006903%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/seort/443574645&amp;amp;sharedid=verge&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Be%5D22006903%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X / S&lt;/a&gt; consoles in stock, you have another chance to get your hands on one or both of these next-gen consoles. A Walmart spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the retailer will have the consoles available for purchase today at 3PM ET. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4on9Q"&gt;Like past restocks, Walmart is selling these next-gen consoles exclusively online through its official website as well as through the Walmart mobile app. It’s unknown when Walmart plans to sell these consoles again in stores, so if you want to buy either console currently, online is the only available method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JkD512"&gt;Walmart told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it plans to have inventory for the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPlayStation-5-Console%2F363472942&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Digital-Edition%2F493824815&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5 Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2Fseort%2F443574645&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2Fseort%2F606518560&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series S&lt;/a&gt; gaming consoles today, with prices ranging from $300 to $500 depending on the model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1U3tvW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226833"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="snydbQ"&gt;Due to the popularity of these next-gen consoles, we anticipate that they will sell out &lt;em&gt;very &lt;/em&gt;quickly. So if you plan to buy this console either for yourself or a loved one, don’t hesitate to click the purchase button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tPzI7P"&gt;Both consoles have been out of stock for almost three months, and demand has been through the roof. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22263821/sony-earnings-q3-2020-ps5-launch-sales"&gt;Sony reported earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; that it sold 4.5 million PS5 consoles last year alone, following the November 12th launch. Last week, Microsoft, while not releasing specific numbers in its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250826/microsoft-q2-2021-earnings-revenue-xbox-cloud-services-surface-gaming"&gt;earnings report&lt;/a&gt;, noted that Xbox hardware revenue was up 86 percent year over year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Democrats call on FCC to expand remote learning connectivity</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="agYGqG"&gt;In an open letter on Thursday, dozens of Democrats called on Federal Communications Commission Acting Chair Jessica Rosenworcel &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SenMarkey/status/1357369952567775238?s=20"&gt;to expand the use of broadband funds&lt;/a&gt; for students struggling to stay connected and participate in remote learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wpCJi4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SenMarkey/status/1357369952567775238?s=20"&gt;In a letter to Rosenworcel&lt;/a&gt;, signed by over 30 Senate Democrats, including Sens. Ed Markey (D-MA) and Maria Cantwell (D-WA), they requested that the FCC use E-Rate program funds to connect students with devices and home internet access who are currently unable to participate in online learning as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The E-Rate program provides universal service funding to connect schools and libraries to the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0e2kR1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Your prompt action would provide an essential down payment”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h6vQZ6"&gt;“We urge you to now use your new leadership of the FCC to depart from the prior Commission’s erroneous position,” the senators wrote. “Although the funds currently available through the E-Rate will not be enough to connect every student across the country, your prompt action would provide an essential down payment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fCWkMT"&gt;Previous FCC Chair Ajit Pai denied these calls for E-Rate expansion throughout his tenure at the agency during the pandemic. A minority commissioner at the time called on the FCC to use the E-Rate program to ensure students have the devices and connectivity needed to participate in remote learning &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21183589/fcc-commissioner-jessica-rosenworcel-homework-gap-editorial-wifi-hotspots-coronavirus"&gt;in an op-ed for &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;last March&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ekfzg"&gt;There are already indications that the FCC will take action on the issue. Earlier this week, Rosenworcel announced that the FCC &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/general/e-rate-schools-libraries-usf-program"&gt;would seek comment&lt;/a&gt; on petitions to open up E-Rate program funds for use in supporting remote learning during the pandemic, a first step in more substantial changes to the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oANSVh"&gt;“We need to get to work to update E-Rate funding so all our students can be connected to virtual classrooms, no matter who they are or where they live,” Rosenworcel said in a statement Monday. “Kids shouldn’t have to do homework in parking lots because that’s the only place they can get online. We can do better.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CLn9Lq"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EsradH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
