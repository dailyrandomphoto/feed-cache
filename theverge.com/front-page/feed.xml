    <title>Ray-Ban Stories get software update adding Facebook Messenger support</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m6Y3N6"&gt;The Ray-Ban Stories smart glasses are getting the ability to let you send and receive Facebook Messenger messages right from your face, according to &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10114157023473271"&gt;a Wednesday post&lt;/a&gt; by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. He says that the features being rolled out are just the beginning for the product, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22662809/facebook-ray-ban-stories-camera-smart-glasses-hands-on"&gt;made in partnership with eyewear titan Luxottica&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9eg9h"&gt;Zuckerberg says that you’ll be able to use the glasses’ built-in mics, speakers, and assistant to send messages, have messages read out to you, and make audio calls using Facebook Messenger. He also promises that more updates will be coming in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fNlGDX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sending messages using your glasses feels very Black Widow or Iron Man&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F3P6so"&gt;Adding the ability to use the Stories as a Tony Stark-esque communication device makes them significantly more useful as a piece of wearable tech. The glasses’ main selling point is that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22662809/facebook-ray-ban-stories-camera-smart-glasses-hands-on"&gt;they put a camera on your face&lt;/a&gt;, but when they first launched they weren’t a whole lot more than that. You could use the assistant to take videos and pictures, and the glasses could act as wireless headphones, but beyond that there weren’t many smart features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bAVHZt"&gt;The update should also make some improvements if you use your Stories as headphones — Zuckerberg says you’ll now be able to control volume and track playback with your voice, if you don’t feel like using the touchpad built into the frames. Of course, saying “hey Facebook, pause” is probably going to attract more attention than just tapping your glasses’ right arm, but you do you. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple closes three more retail stores as COVID-19 infections rise</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t79lnqUGVPOcFLxZr7K3KmONZxQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70278293/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sG1QiA"&gt;Apple has closed three of its retail stores following increased COVID-19 exposures and cases among employees, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-15/apple-temporarily-shuts-three-retail-stores-after-covid-19-surge"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mjqhNE"&gt;The stores, which are located in the Brickell City Centre in Miami; Annapolis, Maryland; and downtown Ottawa, Ontario, will be closed temporarily. Right now, Apple’s website says the &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/brickellcitycentre/"&gt;Miami store&lt;/a&gt; is closed until Friday and the &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/annapolis/"&gt;Annapolis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/retail/rideau/"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt; stores are closed until Saturday. Apple reportedly closed a store in Southlake, Texas &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826604/apple-store-closed-southlake-texas-covid-19-outbreak-black-friday"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt; due to a COVID-19 outbreak, though the company’s website currently indicates &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/southlaketownsquare/"&gt;that store is open&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YtBXPn"&gt;The closures are happening as COVID-19 infections are on the rise. Though the omicron variant is beginning to spread, the delta variant “continues to be the main variant circulating in the United States,” &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/omicron-variant.html"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. On Tuesday, Apple once again began requiring customers to wear masks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22834419/apple-retail-store-mask-requirement-december-2021-omicron-covid"&gt;inside its US retail stores&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8UdCj7"&gt;“We regularly monitor conditions and we will adjust our health measures to support the wellbeing of customers and employees,” an Apple spokesperson said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We remain committed to a comprehensive approach for our teams that combines regular testing with daily health checks, employee and customer masking, deep cleaning and paid sick leave.” Employees at the closed stores will have to be tested prior to reopening, the spokesperson added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwc7rS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>VR workrooms app Spatial is now an NFT art platform</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A Spatial gallery reading “Bozo Island”" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d7lq_SaOXZleyeHPsprvWQK3krI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70278227/RVML7Los.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Spatial&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VKLlCc"&gt;Spatial, an early player in virtual reality workroom apps, is changing its focus to virtual art galleries showcasing non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. The company &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211214005169/en/Spatial-Unveils-New-Market-Focus-To-Pioneer-A-Free-And-Open-Metaverse-With-25-Million-In-New-Funding"&gt;announced the news&lt;/a&gt; yesterday alongside a $25 million funding round. It’s a potential indication of where some “metaverse” tech might be going in the near future — namely, away from VR-heavy, work-focused experiences and toward more entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sCH5Kb"&gt;Spatial’s original pitch was a virtual workspace where people could don VR headsets, talk to co-workers in virtual meetings, and collaborate by examining virtual items. But over the past year, that’s changed. The company says it’s gone from 80 percent of its users wearing VR headsets to 80 percent accessing it through the web and mobile apps, many of these users are more interested in social experiences than work ones, and it’s adjusting its priorities accordingly. It’s ended nearly all its partnerships with major companies (with the exception of Mattel and Nestlé) and shut down apps on AR headsets like the Nreal Light and Magic Leap One.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zJvw12"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“In the world of work, convenience is really everything”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J0fAma"&gt;Instead, Spatial is focusing on collaborations with artists who want to show off their NFT projects. The latest iteration connects with MetaMask cryptocurrency wallets and lets people see a catalog of the NFT art they own. They can then place the images into gallery spaces like virtual paintings, letting guests mill around and talk to each other with avatars or live videos that float above the avatars’ heads. Moreover, Spatial will let artists either sell NFTs directly through the platform or import 3D spaces and mint the actual spaces as NFTs, which they could then sell. (For now, it’s only supporting the Ethereum blockchain, but it could support others — potentially ones with a lower carbon footprint — in the future.) Today, for instance, it’s hosting a gallery and NFT launch designed by Renaud Futterer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="40dqUY"&gt;Spatial says it is making the shift based on how it saw people use its platform, but it could also speak to broader industry trends — particularly the idea that people will work in a 3D “metaverse.” Meta, formerly Facebook, has bet big on the idea this year and launched a Spatial-like service called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22629942/facebook-workrooms-horizon-oculus-vr"&gt;Horizon Workrooms&lt;/a&gt; for the Meta Quest VR headset platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bERGgb"&gt;Jacob Loewenstein, Spatial’s head of business, thinks that world is a ways away. “There will be a day when I think people are wearing headsets to work together all day. But that day is not today,” he says. The company has had more success with NFT art, where it adds a sense of heft to something that’s otherwise just a flat image. “Art is quite typically a very experiential medium,” says Loewenstein. “And you can’t do that by just throwing something on a boring old web page.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j4wBcx"&gt;It may simply be harder for a small company to compete head-to-head with a product from Meta, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21455665/facebook-oculus-vr-indie-developers-power-monopoly-concerns"&gt;isn’t a new issue&lt;/a&gt; for VR developers. But “metaverse” platforms also remain clunky enough that making people use them for a required work event can be a recipe for frustration. When I entered Spatial for a meeting, I ended up encountering a bug that forced me to drop and conduct part of the interview over Zoom, and I’ve had a similarly frustrating experience syncing up with other people on Horizon Workrooms. “In the world of work, convenience is really everything,” says Loewenstein. Spatial is betting that in the world of art, people will be more willing to take a leap into its 3D world.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Minecraft crosses 1 trillion views on YouTube</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="minecraft" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZsF-_9U-r2mSe7jPdkGL2X-H13w=/0x21:1100x754/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70278139/Minecraft-360.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PnQdWk"&gt;Long before the metaverse became the premier destination of tech companies and newlyweds, there was &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;. It is a platform that started as a video game about dodging explosions from hissing cactus-shaped creatures and became the blank canvas on which millions of players create their content, upload it, and generate trillions of views — literally. Today, YouTube, in collaboration with &lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;developer Mojang, is celebrating an unprecedented trillionth view (trillion with a &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;) with a snapshot of the game’s unique and transformative history on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uNhjYt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;’s chief storyteller Lydia Winters attributes the game’s trillion views to her team’s respect for the myriad ways players use &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; to tell their stories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z5KlwK"&gt;“We have people who are off on an adventure and people who are building and people who are playing together, and all those ways of playing are important to us,” she tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. As &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;’s chief storyteller, her team’s job is to create and curate a world players want to create in. That enabling of all kinds of storytelling has been critical to the game’s nigh untouchable popularity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sCRd9U"&gt;“The reason why &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; has been so successful on YouTube is because YouTube videos are a way to tell stories,” she says. “So then when you have &lt;em&gt;Minecraft,&lt;/em&gt; and you can tell any story you want in a &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; world, it’s a big reason why we have so many people creating&lt;em&gt; Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;content.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="S9WtFl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“All those ways of playing are important to us”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pmujtn"&gt;By the numbers, &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;’s YouTube community has over 35,000 creators from over 150 countries. The kind of content on YouTube ranges from simple role-playing “Let’s Plays” to videos that don’t feature actual gameplay from &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ayyVUl"&gt;Earnest Pettie, culture and trends insights lead at YouTube, is responsible for keeping track of all the weird and wild ways players use &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; on the site. He’s fascinated by one creator in particular who uses the &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; aesthetic and is popular within the &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; community without actually playing the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FN9V0c"&gt;“Interestingly, one of the biggest trends on &lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;is actually animation, and that’s animation either created with &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; or animation that is derived from the &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; aesthetic,” Petite says. “There’s this creator named Jake Fellman, who creates YouTube shorts. He’s created about 100 &lt;em&gt;Minecraft-inspired&lt;/em&gt; shorts that are actually computer animation. He’s one of the most viewed &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; creators of this year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S0Ntz8"&gt;Fellman’s videos are 15-second bursts of hyper-realistic, “What if &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; graphics were rendered with the Unreal Engine 5” shorts that feature cute interactions with monsters or sheep and garner over 1 million views a pop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ftpx9k"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K6O5LgOZl-I?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D9aS4U"&gt;YouTube has &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/trends/articles/minecraft-trillion/"&gt;a fascinating breakdown&lt;/a&gt; of the history of the game on its platform over the last 11 years, complete with stats and graphs and facts about what it took to make 1 trillion views. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KtrgJt_lnjr3XqaMDwksa-4FU1E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23099334/minecraftgraph.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="44uRvU"&gt;It’s interesting to see how genres of &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; videos change over time as they fade in and out of popularity. In &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;’s early years, the multi-million view hits were &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/I-sH53vXP2A"&gt;music video parodies&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; household names like &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCshoKvlZGZ20rVgazZp5vnQ"&gt;CaptainSparklez&lt;/a&gt;. Now, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTkXRDQl0luXxVQrRQvWS6w"&gt;Dream&lt;/a&gt; (who recently won a Game Award for content creator of the year) dominates the charts with his &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/RJ0jdO5ZfU4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; manhunt series&lt;/a&gt; that features his friends trying to stop Dream from completing the game&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;by any means necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TJOsXy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; is the most popular game on YouTube ever. In 2020, it earned over 200 billion views; second place — which was curiously Roblox, another sandbox-style game — earned less than half that. Part of that seemingly untouchable popularity is because of &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;’s nature. It’s an open space ripe for all kinds of creation and iteration on that creation in a way no other video game can boast. The other reason, according to Pettie, is the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hkcIfU"&gt;“One trillion views doesn’t happen without the creative ingenuity of all the creators who have uploaded &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; videos over the years,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rejuOz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZ1bu5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia’s Matrix PCs can’t play The Matrix Awakens, but they look cool</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QE9IKIudGVFANWvTwcBpxewTVoM=/0x0:4307x2871/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70277986/nvidia_geforce_custom_rigs.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/matrix-resurrections-geforce-rtx-pc-giveway/" target="_blank"&gt;Nvidia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IY5Qcs"&gt;Nvidia has teamed up with Warner Bros. Pictures and professional PC builders to deliver three custom gaming rigs that embody &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt; — and it’s giving them all away as part of the lead-up to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820636/the-matrix-resurrections-trailer-neo-trinity-keanu-reeves-deja-vu-loop"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Matrix Resurrections’&lt;/em&gt; release&lt;/a&gt; on December 22nd. You can find instructions on how to enter for a chance to win one &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fmatrix-resurrections-geforce-rtx-pc-giveway%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F15%2F22837842%2Fnvidia-matrix-pc-gaming" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on its site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UloLjF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nvidia is also giving away five Matrix-themed backplates for the GeForce 3080 Ti&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LCtcPV"&gt;The first gaming computer, dubbed the Digital Storm Backup Operator, was made by artist Stefan Ulrich in partnership with Digital Storm. Small monitors and keyboards come mounted on the case, along with some crazy-looking wiring and fans, giving off the impression that you can actually slip into the Matrix with this machine. In terms of specs, it comes with none other than a GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and a Ryzen 9 5950X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qg2x3m"&gt;The NZXT Nebuchadnezzar was made by PC customizer Dave Cathey. It’s inspired by the Nebuchadnezzar ship from the first two movies and features Sentinel arms that hug the outside of the case. Binary code is etched in on the front of the case, along with a cutout that says &lt;em&gt;“Matrix Resurrections&lt;/em&gt;.” It also comes with the NZXT Z73 Kraken AIO cooler that’s outfitted with an LCD screen — the modder programmed it to show the symbolic white rabbit. Like the previous build, it has a GeForce RTX 3080 Ti but sports an AMD 5800X processor instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QiVK2z"&gt;Lastly, PC modder Staszek “Tip” Wiertelak partnered with Nvidia to create The Breacher, which doesn’t even look like a PC. It trades in a typical, boxy computer case for a mock-broadcast station. Nvidia notes that the entire case is interactive; however, you can remove the case and use the PC as “a stand-alone machine.” This rig comes with a GeForce RTX 3090, along with a Ryzen 9 3950X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cgcdHZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10925751"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3w0eh1"&gt;Of course, the only downside is that these computers can’t &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22828860/the-matrix-awakens-ps5-xbox-series-x-free-next-gen"&gt;play &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Awakens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, considering that the demo isn’t even available for PC for whatever reason. If you don’t end up winning one of the custom computers, Nvidia says you’ll automatically be entered to win one of five custom &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt;-themed backplates that you can attach to a GeForce 3080 Ti. And no, the 3080 Ti card isn’t included.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Help your loved ones stay healthy and happy with gifts suitable for all budgets&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="c6YEGG"&gt;There’s nothing quite like a global pandemic to remind you how true that old cliché is: at the end of the day, health really is wealth. During these past two years, however, emotional wellness has become just as important as physical health, making gifts that focus on our mental wellbeing just as meaningful as those that impact our physical one. Luckily, our gift guide features a range of ideas that should appeal to both, many of which were solicited from &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;staff and can still arrive on time even if the holidays are nearly here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Io2XdI"&gt;Below, you’ll find an under-desk elliptical for the friend who finds making time to go to the gym challenging, as well as the latest Apple Watch, the third-gen Oura Ring, and a pair of sunglasses that let you ditch your earbuds at home. We’ve also included gift cards for popular therapy and meditation services — perfect for those of us who waited until the last minute to start shopping — along with gifts that should also work well with any budget. Take a look and see what great stuff you can get to help your family and friends stay healthy and happy.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ubisoft is remaking the original Splinter Cell</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W4g_JF_Wd_mS9rWNGlZ3kqLca8A=/75x0:885x540/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70277721/ECHOReveal_FINAL_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just don’t put NFTs in it.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Ubisoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mgbcF9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/4adJLuhgYrPboHAPRfK7Oz/splinter-cell-remake-begins-development-at-ubisoft-toronto"&gt;Ubisoft announced&lt;/a&gt; that a remake of the original &lt;em&gt;Splinter Cell&lt;/em&gt; is in the works, and it’s promising to both keep the stealthy spirit of the 2002 game while making it comfortable to play for modern gamers. It’s being developed by Ubisoft Toronto, and the company says it’ll use the Snowdrop engine it co-developed (and has &lt;a href="https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/482924/864200/12050?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ubisoft.com%2Fsnowdrop%2Fgames&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;used in games&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;em&gt;The Division&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mario + Rabbids&lt;/em&gt;) to take advantage of the tech offered by new consoles&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="04qnu0"&gt;According to Ubisoft’s announcement post, the remake won’t go open-world. Instead, there’ll be linear levels where “every square inch is part of a choice, or directly offers a choice.” The team working on the game has also said that it’ll have updated visuals (a good call, since the original came out almost two decades ago), as well as tweaks to “some of the design elements” to make the game “match player comfort and expectations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2bYCfe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s still very early days for the game, but it has been greenlit (ha)&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="11tAr2"&gt;While the initial response from fans seems to be cautiously optimistic (with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Guttapunks/status/1471164158418825217?s=20"&gt;some pleas&lt;/a&gt; for Ubisoft to not &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822410/ubisoft-nfts-quartz-digits-ghost-recon-breakpoint"&gt;ruin the game with NFTs&lt;/a&gt;), it’s not time to start holding your breath for a release date; in its Q&amp;amp;A, one of the game’s producers says that it’s currently “in the very earliest stages of development.” Given that Ubisoft’s promotional material for the game currently has “now hiring” plastered all over it, it seems like it could be a bit before the team is even assembled to fully start working on the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DbOHth"&gt;Ubisoft Toronto isn’t a stranger to &lt;em&gt;Splinter Cell&lt;/em&gt; — the last game in the franchise, 2013’s &lt;em&gt;Blacklist,&lt;/em&gt; was the first game the studio shipped. Since then, it’s worked on games like &lt;em&gt;Far Cry 5&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;6&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hJXUZB"&gt;If you’re looking for a crash course on the original &lt;em&gt;Splinter Cell&lt;/em&gt;, Ubisoft has put out a video with some of the team behind it and the remake discussing what they felt was special about the game when it first came out. You can watch it below.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FCC proposes new rules to make emergency alerts more accessible for people hard of hearing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i94doAsYpq89ppveOwccmfhrSu0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70277718/acastro__171016_1777_0001_v3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The FCC wants to update its emergency alert system | Illustrator by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="W6R7ap"&gt;The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-seeks-improve-accessibility-clarity-emergency-alerts"&gt;proposing new rules&lt;/a&gt; for emergency alerts to make them more accessible to people who are deaf and hard of hearing. The agency said in a news release that the proposal is part of a larger examination of measures to “enhance the system’s overall functionality and accessibility.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OaLv6O"&gt;The legacy versions of emergency alerts broadcast on over-the-air television with a test pattern screen and a loud alert noise followed by spoken instructions. The FCC says it wants broadcasters, cable systems, and other participants in the emergency alerts system (EAS) to use the internet-based Common Alerting Protocol version of the alerts when possible instead. And for the TV alerts, the FCC wants to see improvements to “the clarity and descriptiveness” of visuals that appear on TVs during EAS tests, for people who can’t hear the tests’ audio messages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="outstreamPlayer-inArticle"&gt;FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said in a statement that it’s difficult to know what kind of warning is adequate when “freak weather” occurs, like the deadly tornadoes that moved through the Midwest last week. “But we do know that we are seeing these kinds of storms with greater frequency,” Rosenworcel said. “And I think we have a responsibility to improve the warning systems we have, to get people the news they need in an emergency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9cYUBn"&gt;Rosenworcel and the other FCC commissioners all support the proposed changes to EAS warnings. In June, the commission combined Presidential Alerts and alerts from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/20/22542541/fcc-updates-emergency-alerts-phones-fema"&gt;into one National Alerts category&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM teases upcoming GMC Sierra Denali electric pickup truck</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TA4xyQL7aOfh-M3zMOF6C_3S3p0=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70277439/GMC_Electric_Sierra_Denali.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WKnUzu"&gt;The GMC Sierra Denali full-size pickup truck is going electric. The automaker teased the first image of the upcoming EV much in the same way it did with the Hummer EV truck — by only showing off its front end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SWNXma"&gt;The square-shaped nose of the truck is set off by L-shaped headlights and an illuminated logo in the middle. The massive grille on the gas equivalent has been smoothed out — a clear indication there is no internal combustion engine under this hood in need of cooling. And it appears we’ll be getting some sort of lighting system that indicates when the vehicle is charging, much like the Hummer EV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4dkaZq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The electric Sierra will only be available in GMC’s popular Denali trim&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yM1fyw"&gt;Other than that, details are slim. The electric Sierra will only be available in GMC’s popular Denali trim, it will run on GM’s Ultium electric vehicle battery platform, and it will be assembled at GM’s Factory Zero in Detroit and Hamtramck, Michigan. The truck will be unveiled next year but won’t go into production likely until early 2023, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826236/chevy-silverado-ev-truck-production-sale-date"&gt;much like the Chevy Silverado EV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="guqn7W"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M-CAUX8ESpM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fTEBeA"&gt;The Silverado will make its public debut on January 5th at the 2022 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. When it comes out, it will be one of the flagship vehicles in the company’s much larger $35 billion push into electric vehicles, as well as the first electric truck for the automaker’s Chevy brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PNvbJg"&gt;But when they inevitably hit dealerships, both the Silverado and Sierra Denali will find the market fairly crowded. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2021/9/28/22697309/rivian-r1t-electric-truck-test-drive-off-roading-camp-tested"&gt;Rivian R1T&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522488/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-pickup-truck-first-look-photos"&gt;Ford F-150 Lightning&lt;/a&gt;, and possibly the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/8/22615539/tesla-cybertruck-production-delayed-2022-elon-musk"&gt;Tesla Cybertruck&lt;/a&gt; are expected to reach customers in greater numbers in 2022. GM’s electric truck production will lag behind the F-150 Lightning, which is expected to start in spring 2022. (Ford recently shut down reservations for the F-150 Lightning after receiving nearly 200,000 orders.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I95ufW"&gt;The Sierra is one of GMC’s most popular trucks, with sales increasing 40 percent year over year in the second quarter of 2021. It’s also one of the automaker’s largest and most dangerously designed trucks, with a high hood and square-shaped front end that increases the size of the vehicle’s front blindspot. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21065319/suv-truck-front-blindspot-children-injury-death-wthr-13"&gt;Trucks with larger bodies and higher carriages&lt;/a&gt; mean pedestrians are more likely to suffer deadly blows to the head and torso. And higher clearances mean victims are more likely to get trapped underneath a speeding truck instead of pushed onto the hood or off to the side. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony Glass Sound Speaker review: it’s not what it looks like</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A mood-setting novelty speaker that doesn’t slouch on sound&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="PjkZYO"&gt;Every so often, you get a reminder that Weird Sony is still alive and well. The company might be releasing best-in-class wireless earbuds, gorgeous OLED TVs, and premium soundbars, but it also still dabbles in unusual gadgets that stand no chance of appealing to a mass audience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T8iiuS"&gt;It’s fair to say that the $350 LSPX-S3 Glass Sound Speaker is exactly that kind of product. A combined portable Bluetooth speaker and candlestick-like table lamp, the LSPX-S3 is by no means designed for the everyday consumer. It’s not supposed to be your rugged, take-anywhere speaker. It’s a statement piece that could add ambiance to a romantic dinner, a bedside table, or a meal outside on a summer evening. Sony sees enough in this concept to have kept at it for three generations now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YeRzh5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10925485"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="epYQUI"&gt;The LSPX-S3 stands slightly over 11 inches tall and is heavier than it looks at 2.5 pounds, with most of that weight residing in the very sturdy-feeling silver metal base. The heft is reassuring in that there’s little risk of the device tipping over accidentally. You could say the Glass Sound Speaker gives off futuristic oil lamp vibes, maybe, but most people I’ve shown it to have immediately concluded that it most closely resembles a bong. It’s certainly a conversation starter, but any potential appeal will come down to your own taste. To me, this looks like a speaker that belongs in a lake cabin or an art studio. It might feel a little out of place in some contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ES_3WS1VP8SAWYkwXSU0VzX4i8s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23085918/cwelch_211213_4926_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LSPX-S3 produces warm ambient light.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HEOwSA"&gt;Around back, near the bottom of the base, you’ll find a USB-C port for charging the battery and buttons for power, answering a phone call, and controlling the volume. Sony includes a short USB-C to USB-A cable in the box but no power adapter. Under the speaker are additional buttons for Bluetooth pairing and setting a sleep timer. On Android, the LSPX-S3 supports Fast Pair for easy setup. Perhaps most surprising is that Sony also includes its higher-quality LDAC codec among the speaker’s features, allowing you to play music at higher bitrates from services like Amazon Music, Apple Music, Tidal, Qobuz, and others that offer lossless audio. LDAC might seem like overkill for a speaker of this relatively small size, but I’m glad to see Sony extending it to more products — especially considering the price premium of this one. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F-KYbEccC9BmHmvW-xv6LzphOMU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23085921/cwelch_211213_4926_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The buttons are located at the back of the speaker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mHiJsk"&gt;The glass tube isn’t there purely for aesthetics. According to Sony, three actuators in the speaker are attached to the end of the glass and vibrate the entire glass tweeter when audio is playing “to spread sound in every direction.” And if you’re holding the LSPX-S3 in your hands, it really can sometimes seem like the sound is originating from the tube rather than the base beneath it. But I can’t overlook that there’s an inherent fragility to this design that isn’t present with other portable speakers made from more durable materials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eODDn1"&gt;You can adjust the brightness of the LED but not the color temperature; it’s meant to always mimic the warmth of candlelight. The first mode lets you choose a fixed, consistent brightness by sliding your finger along a touch sensor on the back of the speaker. (There are 32 levels of brightness in all.) Switching over to candlelight mode makes the LED gently dim and illuminate like the flickering of a candle. You can also have the light pulse in sync with whatever music is being played, though this effect is more subtle than you might imagine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="6lgHFr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It might be portable, but this isn’t a speaker you want to drop&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dD1k6W"&gt;The LSPX-S3 plays the role of a candle well enough that its flickering would have you think it was the real thing if it was off to the side of a table during dinner. I found it pleasing, but you’d hope it could pull off that trick for the price Sony’s asking. Even at its highest brightness setting, you should only expect ambient lighting from the Glass Sound Speaker; it’s not some high-intensity household lamp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UebqF1"&gt;So it does the job as a candle replacement, but how does it rank as a speaker? Better than I expected before I turned it on, honestly. Sound is distributed evenly in all directions, and the LSPX-S3 has enough power to fill small rooms with tunes. Where this speaker really shines is in its upper register. Acoustic guitars, other string instruments, and brass all come through with a fantastic, crisp clarity — and the same holds true for vocals. That’s where the glass tweeter really makes a difference. There’s no muddiness whatsoever to the sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JDjN5HOt5FBVbVaWUULb8qRhhBA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23087698/thelamp.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LED can flicker to convincingly mimic candlelight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vazuft"&gt;That said, the speaker is limited by its size and the space constraints that Sony faced when filling it with driver components. The soundstage isn’t all that wide, and this means that some genres (acoustic, classical, jazz, etc.) are better suited to get the most out of this speaker than others like rock, pop, electronic, or hip hop. Having just seen them in Brooklyn a few weeks ago, I’ve been on a Hold Steady kick, and the LSPX-S3 doesn’t have quite enough presence to make their records shine. The keyboard and other instrumentation can get drowned out in the cramped mix output. Bass isn’t going to rattle surfaces, but Sony does include a bass boost toggle in its mobile app if you want to crank that part of the EQ as much as possible. Sony’s glass speaker has more clarity to it than many Bluetooth speakers, but bigger units can definitely outperform it on the boom factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="npOyeu"&gt;You’ll get up to eight hours of battery life from the speaker on a charge, which seems perfectly sufficient for its indoor or backyard use cases. This isn’t the kind of product you’ll be taking on the road, so it doesn’t exactly need to match the 15-hour battery of a UE Boom.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IipKpqfrUS1mWmm-sgWyBfUNiHE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23085919/cwelch_211213_4926_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The glass tube helps the speaker’s treble performance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C5FAxU"&gt;For whatever good traits it has, the LSPX-S3 is unfortunately missing a lot. There are volume buttons but inexplicably no play / pause or track controls. (The buttons are also located on the back, which is nice for looks but more of a hassle for usability.) This speaker lacks any voice control “smarts.” It only does playback over Bluetooth and not Wi-Fi, leaving out features like Apple’s AirPlay 2, Google Cast, or Spotify Connect. You can group two glass speakers together as a stereo pair, but I can’t in good conscience recommend that anyone burn $700 on that proposition: you can do tons better for the money by sticking with more traditional speakers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="e7LebM"&gt;But that brings us back to this being a Weird Sony product that isn’t aimed at someone shopping for a “normal” Bluetooth speaker. Sony itself sells plenty of those for less money, as do brands like Ultimate Ears, JBL, Bose, and countless others. The LSPX-S3 Glass Sound Speaker is one of a kind, and its candlelight-mimicking capabilities make it the best execution of this concept so far. That doesn’t mean I’d buy it, but if you’re itching to put this thing in your dining room or in a getaway cabin, there’s nothing wrong with getting lavish and weird sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
