    <title>Scammy iOS app discovered that refuses to open unless you give it a good review</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mJwUQO2mVOG0Bwa8r_RmzeFyMbA=/0x1:1898x1266/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69344133/E2QqsPEVUAA8_Rg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A selection of app reviews detailing the scammy behavior.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1397288727349657604" target="_blank"&gt;Kosta Eleftheriou&lt;/a&gt; / App Store&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Kxk3Bk"&gt;App developer and scam app hunter Kosta Eleftheriou’s latest discovery is a real doozy, an iOS app that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1397288720357679104?s=21"&gt;refuses to function&lt;/a&gt; before you give it at least a 3-star review in the App Store. Although the UPNP Xtreme app — which claimed to let users stream video to their TVs — now appears to have &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1223416942"&gt;been pulled&lt;/a&gt;, we were able to verify that it generates the App Store rating box the second it opens. You can’t dismiss the ratings box, nor can you tap the 1 or 2-star ratings, Eleftheriou said. We verified this behavior, but &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/prvrtl/status/1397301269279223809"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; other &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HenrickTheBull/status/1397346867965571073"&gt;users &lt;/a&gt;report they were able to dismiss the dialog box or leave a lower rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rrXoCo"&gt;This is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272849/apple-app-store-scams-ios-fraud-reviews-ratings-flicktype"&gt;just&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22386533/ios-app-scam-jungle-runner-magical-forest-apple-kosta"&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395907/apple-match-three-game-gambling-marina-misko-vegas-pirates-lucky-stars"&gt;latest&lt;/a&gt; scammy app to have been unearthed by Elefheriou, who’s been waging a war against them after his own Apple Watch keyboard app, FlickType, was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1356011082075148291"&gt;overtaken by expensive apps&lt;/a&gt; with fake reviews. Eleftheriou says Apple has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou#:~:text=eleftheriou%20tells%20me%20that%20apple%20has%20removed%20over%20100%20apps%20due%20to%20his%20reports%20%E2%80%94%20and%20if%20you%E2%80%99re%20wondering%20whether%20his%20online%20crusade%20is%20personal%2C%20the%20answer%20is%20most%20definitely%20yes"&gt;removed over 100 apps&lt;/a&gt; as a result of his reports, but it’s concerning that the multi-billion dollar company isn’t catching these scams during its App Store review process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="b9o50E"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;If you think you can trust App Store ratings, you haven’t been paying enough attention. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the iOS *system* rating prompt, not a custom look-alike one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The worst part? This trick is EXTREMELY easy for any developer to do, and not limited to this app.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1397288722706489353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QKwGD7"&gt;The UPNP Xtreme app’s behavior directly contradicts one of the best practices Apple lists on its developer site, &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skstorereviewcontroller/requesting_app_store_reviews"&gt;which states&lt;/a&gt; that developers should “avoid showing a request for a review immediately when a user launches your app.” Generally, developers are allowed to prompt for a rating up to there times in a 365-day period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OTXPiB"&gt;Apple’s review process has been under particularly intense scrutiny recently because of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;Epic Games’ lawsuit against the company&lt;/a&gt;. Central to the dispute is the 30 percent commission Apple takes on many App Store payments and in-app purchases. Apple argues it needs the commission to run the App Store and create a safe environment for users. But that argument gets undermined pretty quickly if obvious scammy apps are able to slip through Apple’s review process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YoIyyV"&gt;Apps like the ones discovered by Eleftheriou not only harm customers who end up downloading scammy software and can get tricked into paying for difficult-to-cancel recurring subscriptions. It also harms legitimate developers who have to contend with apps that are willing to play dirty to get the good reviews needed to rise up the App Store’s rankings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sEMtkm"&gt;Eleftheriou filed a lawsuit against Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22336380/apple-app-store-scam-lawsuit-kosta-eleftheriou-flicktype-ios-developer"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, arguing it exploits its monopoly power over iOS app to make money at the expense of app developers and consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla will store Chinese car data locally, following government fears about spying</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="CHINA-AUTOMOBILE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m3ePL85XM7AVPvp0GEfsMHiTJUM=/52x0:3949x2598/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69344105/1212733626.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;China is a key market for Tesla. &lt;/em&gt; | Photo by NOEL CELIS/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K25mBm"&gt;Tesla says it’s established a data center in China to store and process information produced by its vehicles locally. The announcement, &lt;a href="https://weibo.com/3615027564/Kh8mMfpDQ?from=page_1006063615027564_profile&amp;amp;wvr=6&amp;amp;mod=weibotime&amp;amp;type=comment"&gt;made on Weibo&lt;/a&gt;, comes as the US carmaker faces pressure from Chinese authorities over fears its cars could be used for spying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yHQDdT"&gt;“Car data security is very important,” said Tesla (via Google Translate). “All data generated from the sales of vehicles in the Chinese mainland market will be stored in China.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="r3N7XI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Telsa cars are reportedly banned from Chinese military sites&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LNrDDv"&gt;Reports from &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-to-restrict-tesla-usage-by-military-and-state-personnel-11616155643?mod=mhp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-19/tesla-cars-banned-by-china-s-military-on-concerns-about-cameras?sref=GYlFC92K"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said Tesla’s cars have been banned from Chinese military sites, and that “military staff and employees of key state-owned companies” are prohibited from owning the vehicles. Chinese authorities were reportedly concerned that the exterior cameras on the cars could be used to collect sensitive data and send it back to the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDR0oE"&gt;Elon Musk responded by saying if this was true it would be the end of the company in China. “There’s a very strong incentive for us to be very confidential with any information,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/21/22343018/elon-musk-tesla-shut-down-cars-spying-china"&gt;said Musk in March&lt;/a&gt;. “If Tesla used cars to spy in China or anywhere, we will get shut down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="52Lu6s"&gt;Tesla certainly needs to keep China happy to ensure the company’s future growth. China is the world’s largest market for electric vehicles — around three to four times the size of the the US. Tesla sold 147,445 cars in China last year, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-forum-musk/musk-says-tesla-would-be-shut-down-if-its-cars-spied-in-china-elsewhere-idUSKBN2BC04Q"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, accounting for 30 percent of global sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X99nyr"&gt;Last month, the Chinese government &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/china-autos-data-idUSL1N2MM0O0"&gt;published draft rules&lt;/a&gt; outlining its concerns with data-collection by smart vehicles. The rules state that data about roads, buildings, and terrain should not leave the country, and that customers should have to consent to data collection. Tesla &lt;a href="https://www.verdict.co.uk/tesla-gives-chinas-new-data-security-proposal-a-big-like/"&gt;expressed support for the rules&lt;/a&gt; through social media accounts in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fIx6ws"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft claims Edge is now ‘the best performing browser on Windows 10’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YeWS65UIVSHEjM0q-qbe_mH8HkM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69343928/acastro_200207_3900_Edge_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hQm2lP"&gt;Microsoft is now claiming the performance crown in the desktop browser battle. The software maker has been gradually adding new features to Edge over the past year to improve performance and launch times. These additions have allowed Microsoft to claim itself the performance winner, even as Google &lt;a href="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2021/05/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_25.html"&gt;releases Chrome 91 today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="46Kwnu"&gt;“Microsoft Edge will be the best performing browser on Windows 10 when Microsoft Edge version 91 releases later this week,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2021/05/25/whats-new-edge-build-2021/"&gt;says the Microsoft Edge team in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “So, why can we say this? It’s simple: startup boost and sleeping tabs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UntMTW"&gt;Microsoft first started rolling out its new startup boost feature in Edge back in March, with claims that it makes browser launches up to 41 percent faster. The new sleeping tabs feature also appeared earlier this year, designed to improve browser performance. Edge now automatically releases system resources for inactive tabs, which helps new tabs run better or stop the browser from hogging memory and CPU resources in the background. Microsoft is also working on a separate &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391505/microsoft-edge-performance-mode-ram-cpu-battery-usage"&gt;performance mode for Edge&lt;/a&gt; that’s currently in testing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Rhd7Qt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google has also been improving Chrome performance&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5a8PWq"&gt;Google hasn’t been sitting around letting Chrome eat up more RAM, either. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22326952/google-chrome-89-resource-efficiency-memory-hog-startup-speed-improvements"&gt;Recent updates to Chrome&lt;/a&gt; have included a bigger focus on performance, with a more advanced memory allocator to reduce memory usage and increase performance. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571832/google-chrome-2020-speed-memory-improvements"&gt;last update to Chrome in 2020&lt;/a&gt; was also all about efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X4qy9Q"&gt;Microsoft has also revealed it has now submitted 5,300 commits to the Chromium browser project, which will also benefit Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers. While sleeping tabs and startup boost are features for Edge, Microsoft has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/27/21083299/microsoft-google-chrome-tab-management-chromium-improvements-feature"&gt;helped Google improve Chrome’s tab management&lt;/a&gt;, and the rivals have worked together on a variety of underlying Chromium improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp sues Indian government over new rules it says break encryption</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xxRLqJ6NPhk23z-RwrHim66jxgM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69343850/acastro_210119_1777_whatsapp_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C4n87g"&gt;Facebook-owned messaging service WhatsApp is suing India’s government over new internet rules it claims are unconstitutional and will “severely undermine the privacy” of its users, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/25/technology/whatsapp-india-lawsuit.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code, which was introduced in February and comes into effect today, contains a requirement that messaging apps identify the “first originator of information” when asked. But WhatsApp, which boasts nearly 400 million users in its largest market of India, argues that doing so would require it to trace every message sent on its service, violating users’ right to privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JK0cAb"&gt;“Civil society and technical experts around the world have consistently argued that a requirement to “trace” private messages would break end-to-end encryption and lead to real abuse,” a spokesperson for the service said in a statement. “WhatsApp is committed to protecting the privacy of people’s personal messages and we will continue to do all we can within the laws of India to do so.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hYOocJ"&gt;WhatsApp’s warnings about “traceability” are backed of many of the world’s biggest technology firms and digital rights groups including Mozilla, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), and the Center for Democracy and Technology. In a statement about a similar plan to &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/08/faq-why-brazils-plan-mandate-traceability-private-messaging-apps-will-break-users"&gt;mandate traceability in Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, the EFF said that implementing traceability “will break users’ expectations of privacy and security, and would be hard to implement to match current security and privacy standards.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RdFV3Y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A requirement to ‘trace’ private messages would break end-to-end encryption”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CTP3tU"&gt;Responding to efforts by India and other countries to force it to trace messages, WhatsApp has published an &lt;a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/what-is-traceability-and-why-does-whatsapp-oppose-it"&gt;FAQ on its website&lt;/a&gt;. It argues that this traceability requirement would force it to break the end-to-end encryption for everyone on its service, because there’s no way for it to proactively know what message a government might want to investigate ahead of time. “A government that chooses to mandate traceability is effectively mandating a new form of mass surveillance,” WhatsApp’s FAQ says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fCcOeN"&gt;However the Indian government argues the rules are required to track the origins of misinformation. In comments &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/exclusive-whatsapp-sues-india-govt-says-new-media-rules-mean-end-privacy-sources-2021-05-26/"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a government official argued that WhatsApp isn’t being asked to break its encryption, just to track where messages originate from. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EQ7gj0"&gt;But WhatsApp says tracing messages like this “would be ineffective and highly susceptible to abuse,” and risks punishing people for being the “originator” of content just for re-sharing information they found elsewhere. According to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, WhatsApp argues that the new rules fail the tests established by a 2017 Supreme Court ruling. Namely, that privacy must be preserved except when legality, necessity, and proportionality require its infringement. WhatsApp argues that the new law lacks explicit parliamentary backing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3TtrH7"&gt;The lawsuit is the latest heightening of tensions between the Indian government and big tech companies. In recent months officials have ordered social media networks including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/24/22400976/twitter-removed-tweets-critical-india-censor-coronavirus"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/27/991343032/indias-government-is-telling-facebook-twitter-to-remove-critical-posts"&gt;Facebook, and Instagram&lt;/a&gt; to remove posts critical of their handling of the pandemic. The &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; notes that social media companies have complied with many of these requests by blocking posts within the country, but keeping them visible elsewhere. While the government argues these posts could incite panic, critics say it’s using the new rules to silence detractors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XWzRQV"&gt;In another incident, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451271/police-india-raid-twitter-tweets-government-manipulated-media"&gt;police in India raided Twitter’s offices&lt;/a&gt; over a “manipulated media” label applied to a tweet from a government official.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OMNDa6"&gt;While WhatsApp has been accused of facilitating the spread of misinformation around the world, the problem has been particularly acute in India. Since 2017, the service has been linked to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/20/17595478/whatsapp-message-forwarding-end-violent-lynching-india"&gt;series of lynchings in the country&lt;/a&gt; after users on the service spread misinformation about child abductions. WhatsApp responded by placing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/7/21211371/whatsapp-message-forwarding-limits-misinformation-coronavirus-india"&gt;new limits on message forwarding&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to stop such accusations from going viral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3yy0EM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s AI subsidiary is developing smarter opponents and teammates for PlayStation games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nvtfyxS0JjjCO7pyQlwJWaWyo7Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69343848/vpavic_4261_20201023_0030.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8ZV20K"&gt;In 2019, Sony quietly established a subsidiary dedicated to researching &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sony-announces-the-establishment-of-sony-ai-with-the-mission-to-unleash-human-creativity-300961100.html"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt;. What exactly the company plans to do with this tech has always been a bit unclear, but a recent corporate strategy meeting offers a little more information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rj8Odg"&gt;“Sony AI [...] has begun a collaboration with PlayStation that will make game experiences even richer and more enjoyable,” say notes from a recent &lt;a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/strategy/pdf/2021/speech_E.pdf"&gt;strategy presentation&lt;/a&gt; given by Sony CEO Kenichiro Yoshida. “By leveraging reinforcement learning, we are developing Game AI Agents that can be a player’s in-game opponent or collaboration partner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PRm3ps"&gt;This is pretty much what you’d expect from a partnership between PlayStation and Sony’s AI team, but it’s still good to have confirmation! Reinforcement learning, which relies on trial and error to teach AI agents how to carry out tasks, has proved to be a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/6/18222203/video-game-ai-future-procedural-generation-deep-learning"&gt;natural fit for video game environments&lt;/a&gt;, where agents can run at high speeds under close observation. It’s been the focus of heavy-hitting research, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/30/20939147/deepmind-google-alphastar-starcraft-2-research-grandmaster-level"&gt;DeepMind’s &lt;em&gt;StarCraft II&lt;/em&gt; AI&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QtLYEq"&gt;Other big tech companies with gaming interests such as Microsoft are also &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fresearch%2Fgroup%2Fdeep-reinforcement-learning%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;exploring this space&lt;/a&gt;. But while Microsoft’s efforts are tilted towards pure research, Sony’s sound like they’re more focused on getting this research out of the lab and into video games, pronto. The end result should be smarter teammates as well as opponents.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CGplHJhFf3j/?utm_source=ig_embed" target="_blank"&gt;Tom Holland via Instagram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Tom Holland will be starring as Nathan Drake in the  upcoming &lt;/em&gt;Uncharted &lt;em&gt;movie adaptation — part of Sony’s ongoing ambitions to expand its franchises into TV and film. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RwolsJ"&gt;This tidbit was just one point in the presentation, though, in which Sony laid out numerous plans for its future growth. Here are some of the other ambitions mentioned: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="wrlx9w"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Expand Sony’s first-party titles and franchises to mobile&lt;/strong&gt;. “PlayStation has a huge catalog of diverse first-party IP that can transition to smartphone gaming and complement our AAA games or live service games,” say the notes. (Though it’s worth noting Sony established a subsidiary &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11296898/sony-forwardworks-playstation-smartphone-games"&gt;dedicated to making smartphone games&lt;/a&gt; in 2016, and it hasn’t had a huge impact yet.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZnLYka"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Make more Sony games into movies and TV shows. &lt;/strong&gt;This will be done through the company’s PlayStation Productions subsidiary. Sony gives the example of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528606/tom-holland-nathan-drake-first-photo-uncharted-movie-sony"&gt;upcoming &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; film&lt;/a&gt;, starring Tom Holland as Nathan Drake.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xHCYMd"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Grow the PlayStation Network, PlayStation Now, and PS Plus networks&lt;/strong&gt;. The company says it currently connects to about 160 million users but would like to grow that number to 1 billion (I mean, sure, who wouldn’t want more customers?). Getting there will mean growing the company’s various online services and subscriptions, including PlayStation Plus, which has seen steady, but not explosive, growth. It’s interesting to compare this to Microsoft’s huge push in subscription gaming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250795/xbox-game-pass-subscribers-growth-microsoft"&gt;through Xbox Game Pass&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A_K2M1NeYb8GZ8kvqzuBz9MNDS8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22540432/Screen_Shot_2021_05_26_at_9.59.48_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s PS Plus network has seen steady but not explosive growth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sN5gPf"&gt;For more details you can check out Sony’s presentation for yourself &lt;a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/strategy/pdf/2021/speech_E.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Though, be prepared to wade through some absolutely incredible corporation-speak. We particularly liked the opening declaration that the company has now “implemented structural reform that liberated us from a loss-making paradigm.” In other words: they changed things so that Sony makes money instead of losing it! Got to dress that up somehow, I guess. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US admits Xiaomi isn’t a ‘Communist Chinese military company’ after all</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Xiaomi, Mi" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2Ef0bEBi1uBh_U-Y4tcXATJmIco=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69343640/DSCF5652.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9m2EFh"&gt;The US has formally removed Xiaomi from its trading blacklist. The US District Court for the District of Columbia issued a final order yesterday that vacated the Department of Defense’s designation of Xiaomi as a “Communist Chinese military company” (CCMC), which would have prohibited Americans from investing in the Chinese consumer tech giant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9M4GMQ"&gt;“The Company is grateful for the trust and support of its global users, partners, employees and shareholders,” a Xiaomi spokesperson says in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The Company reiterates that it is an open, transparent, publicly traded, independently operated and managed corporation. The Company will continue to provide reliable consumer electronics products and services to users, and to relentlessly build amazing products with honest prices to let everyone in the world enjoy a better life through innovative technology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IQ7x0i"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The blacklisting was described as ‘arbitrary and capricious’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kegxF6"&gt;The US &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22231786/trump-administration-blacklists-xiaomi-communist-chinese-military-company"&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; the CCMC designation on January 14th, in the final week of the Trump administration. Xiaomi sued the government the following month, and in March won a preliminary injunction blocking the designation, with a judge describing the blacklisting as “arbitrary and capricious.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22431838/xiaomi-us-blacklist-remove-trump-lawsuit"&gt;Earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; Xiaomi and the DoD announced that they’d come to an agreement to resolve the matter among themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aslnUi"&gt;While Xiaomi has managed to get out of its tangle with the US government, the Biden administration hasn’t given any indication that Trump’s sanctions targeting Huawei will be lifted. Huawei’s consumer division has been crippled by the resulting inability to do business with companies based in the US, but the company also makes network equipment that several politicians have accused of posing a national security threat. This week founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei reportedly sent an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22452580/huawei-software-pivot-us-sanctions-ren-zhengfei"&gt;internal memo&lt;/a&gt; to staff saying that Huawei should pivot to software as a way to get around US sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amnesty International calls for Google to halt cloud business in Saudi Arabia</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vbKDtmt2zQyQxLWAZOekUAlWxiI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69343408/acastro_210121_1777_google_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A6JeUa"&gt;Amnesty International is teaming up with 38 other human rights groups and individuals &lt;a href="https://www.amnestyusa.org/press-releases/google-must-halt-plans-to-establish-cloud-region-in-saudi-arabia/"&gt;to call for a halt&lt;/a&gt; to Google’s plans to set up an enterprise cloud business in Saudi Arabia because of concerns over the country’s human rights track record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uyVNx3"&gt;The joint statement — signed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Media Matters for Democracy, among others — calls for Google to end its plans in Saudi Arabia until the company conducts a public human rights assessment and makes it clear what kinds of government requests for data it won’t honor. Even more important, the letter writers state, is conducting that investigation in the open, actually consulting with the people Google could inadvertently help Saudi Arabia to hurt, and speaking to groups in the country who can better understand the issues there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmN9Ul"&gt;The organizations cite several human rights violations that they argue should give Google pause. Saudi Arabia has a documented history of seeking to spy on and violate its citizen’s privacy, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20952335/twitter-employees-saudi-arabia-spying-arrests"&gt;allegedly recruiting Twitter employees&lt;/a&gt; to spy on the company from within. It’s also taken extreme and violent measures to silence dissent from people in positions to criticize, most recently with the murder and dismemberment of &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; journalist &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2018/10/17/17989638/jamal-khashoggi-murder-wsj-nyt-dismember"&gt;Jamal Khashoggi in 2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z3Okoy"&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure/google-cloud-announces-new-regions"&gt;initially announced&lt;/a&gt; it was making Saudi Arabia one of its new “Cloud Regions” in 2020, with plans to build cloud infrastructure and partner with Saudi Aramco, the Saudi Arabian Oil Company, to resell enterprise cloud services. The announcement sparked a response from activists groups like &lt;a href="https://www.accessnow.org/google-cloud-in-saudi-arabia-human-rights-concerns/"&gt;Access Now and the Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, particularly because Google’s original blog post included a quote from Snap, the creators of Snapchat, promoting the business, &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/google-cloud-saudi-arabia"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protocol &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The quote has since been removed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hplPdH"&gt;According to Access Now, Google told concerned groups that it had conducted an independent human rights assessment of its future cloud region and taken steps to address issues it had identified. But the company didn’t share what those issues were or what it did, motivating in part the groups and individuals calling out the company today.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>USB-C is about to go from 100W to 240W, enough to power beefier laptops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="usb-c" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xfPGJesdR1-knr-FiIU3Kq5eAxU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69342740/vlad-savov-computex-usb-c-2.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tD3Vf4"&gt;Soon, the majority of portable PCs &lt;em&gt;won’t&lt;/em&gt; need to be equipped with an ugly barrel jack and a proprietary power brick to charge. &lt;a href="https://usb.org/document-library/usb-type-cr-cable-and-connector-specification-revision-21"&gt;The USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF) has just announced&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/usb-c-upgrade-delivers-a-whopping-240w-for-gaming-laptops-and-other-power-hungry-devices/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) that it’s &lt;em&gt;more than doubling&lt;/em&gt; the amount of power you can send over a USB-C cable to 240 watts, which means you’ll eventually be able to plug in the same kind of multipurpose USB-C cable you currently use on lightweight laptops, tablets, and phones to charge all but the beefiest gaming laptops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXBIkF"&gt;Previously, the USB-C Power Delivery spec tops out at 100 watts, and it’s definitely held the industry back a tad — for example, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/14/20909422/dell-xps-15-7590-2019-review-oled-core-i9-specs-features-price"&gt;my own Dell XPS 15&lt;/a&gt; can technically charge over USB-C, it needs 130W of power to charge and run at full bore simultaneously. Some manufacturers have sold off-spec USB-C adapters (I have a Dell dock that outputs 130W), but they don’t always come bundled with machines and generally have a fixed, non-detachable cable to prevent against misuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OOYLBI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Leaving 100W behind&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BJFjy9"&gt;But with 240W of power — something that the USB-IF is calling “Extended Power Range” or EPR for short — you could theoretically charge an full-fat Alienware m17 gaming laptop over USB-C. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6FP2MX"&gt;You’ll need new USB-C chargers and cables to take advantage of the new spec, of course, though you should hopefully be able to tell which is which: “All EPR cables shall be visibly identified with EPR cable identification items,” reads part of the USB-IF’s requirements for the new spec. A cable will need to support up to 5A and 50V to be compliant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RINDgV"&gt;Judging by the photos below, it looks like manufacturers may need to tweak their charger designs as well:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3Je4SzM6dk6tl925_VIrP_ysL0c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539782/epr_3.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5Svmwh"&gt;There will still be exceptionally beefy laptops that demand more than 240W of power, of course. 330W power supplies still come standard with some machines, and there are always &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/22/15672294/acer-predator-21-x-review-gaming-laptop-9000-gtx-1080"&gt;exotic notebooks that require more than one power supply to function&lt;/a&gt;. Gaming desktops generally require far more power, with a 650W PSU or higher PSU required for the latest desktop graphics cards, and 240W &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/1/14/22230943/ps5-xbox-series-x-s-power-consumption-study-nrdc#:~:text=Microsoft%20has%20not%20provided%20official,slightly%20lower%20at%20340%20watts."&gt;may not be &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; enough for the latest game consoles&lt;/a&gt; from Sony and Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E4rstM"&gt;On the other hand, some computers are getting more efficient as the years go by. Case in point: the colorful new iMac &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fimac-24%2Fspecs%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fcircuitbreaker%2F2021%2F5%2F25%2F22453936%2Fusb-c-power-delivery-extended-power-range-epr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;comes with a 143W power adapter&lt;/a&gt;. In a year or two, it’d be a viable candidate for USB-C power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U1LHlW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Eero 6 and Pro 6 owners are now getting Apple’s HomeKit security features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Eero 6" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZRxpe6AmJTfRembxdj0gg1Nl6ZE=/0x0:1162x775/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69342649/eero6.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Eero&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iaRHCK"&gt;Owners of Amazon’s Eero 6 and Pro 6 routers will now be able to isolate their HomeKit IoT devices from the rest of their home network and the wider internet, thanks to a new integration with Apple’s HomeKit that’s now rolling out (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/25/eero-6-routers-homekit-support/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The new feature is coming as part of a firmware update, and makes the routers some of the first Wi-Fi 6 systems that support Apple’s integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OGdrph"&gt;The added feature may be welcome, but it’s probably not a surprise for those who have been paying attention: Eero’s other, cheaper routers were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/2/26/21154531/amazon-eero-routers-apple-homekit-support-internet-connection-security"&gt;updated to support it in February, 2020&lt;/a&gt;, and an Eero Support account &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/eero/comments/jnyua3/got_new_eero_6_pro_no_homekit_support/"&gt;mentioned in November&lt;/a&gt; that the router was going through Apple’s certification process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FdjsQQ"&gt;Setting up your Eero (or any other supported routers) with HomeKit lets you manage how much data your other HomeKit devices are allowed to share over the network. If, for example, you had some smart window blinds that were a bit shady, you could use HomeKit to only allow them to talk to your local HomeKit Hub, and not connect to the internet (or other apps). It’s a niche benefit, to be sure, but if you were holding off on an Eero 6 purchase until it was available, it looks like the time has finally come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HbIgjS"&gt;It’s worth noting that, to use the feature, a separate HomeKit Hub is required: this can be either an Apple TV, HomePod (regular or Mini), or iPad that stays in the house. If you want to activate HomeKit on your Eero router, the company &lt;a href="https://support.eero.com/hc/en-us/articles/360036319531-How-to-use-HomeKit-with-your-eero-Network"&gt;has a support page&lt;/a&gt; laying out all the details.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hundreds of Amazon employees call for Jeff Bezos and Andy Jassy to support Palestine</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1MmzNnvHAcG5k0tu8EBNvT0TXa0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69342425/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8bQtTD"&gt;More than 500 Amazon employees have signed an internal letter to Jeff Bezos and Andy Jassy calling for the company to acknowledge the plight of the Palestinian people. The move comes after Israeli airstrikes devastated Palestinians in Gaza, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/gaza-truce-between-israel-hamas-begins-mediated-by-egypt-2021-05-20/"&gt;leaving 248 people dead&lt;/a&gt;. Hamas and Israel have since agreed to a ceasefire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7zCTFy"&gt;“We ask Amazon leadership to acknowledge the continued assault upon Palestinians’ basic human rights under an illegal occupation... without using language that implies a power symmetry or situational equivalency, which minimizes and misrepresents the disruption, destruction, and death that has disproportionately been inflicted upon the Palestinians in recent days and over several decades,” employees wrote. “Amazon employs Palestinians in Tel Aviv and Haifa offices and around the world. Ignoring the suffering faced by Palestinians and their families at home erases our Palestinian coworkers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fnqd35"&gt;Employees want the company to terminate business contracts with organizations that are complicit in human rights violations, like the Israeli Defense Forces. In April, Amazon and Google &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-picks-amazons-aws-google-flagship-cloud-project-2021-04-21/"&gt;signed a $1.2 billion cloud computing contract&lt;/a&gt; with the Israeli government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yeYbSg"&gt;The note echoes similar petitions from workers at Apple and Google. On May 18th, Jewish employees at Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441236/jewish-google-employees-support-palestine-letter-anti-zionism-israel"&gt;penned a letter to Sundar Pichai&lt;/a&gt; calling for the company to “reject any definition of antisemitism that holds that criticism of Israel or Zionism is antisemitic.” Two days later, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; published a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446059/apple-employees-palestinians-support-internal-letter-tim-cook"&gt;note from Muslim employees at Apple&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CgYISa"&gt;Muslim tech workers say executives have been slow to voice support for Palestinians, or condemn the violence in Gaza. Many feel their CEOs are choosing to ignore Israeli human rights abuses because the situation is fraught. The result, according to multiple sources, is that Muslims in tech feel undervalued and ignored. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="t0mdFJ"&gt;Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
