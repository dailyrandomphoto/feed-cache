    <title>Jeff Bezos will fly to the edge of space with his brother next month</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qzMY9cuGZpO-OJyT1ue3a3m3OcU=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69415416/Blue_Origin_Jeff_Bezos_Pad.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u7YPGI"&gt;Jeff Bezos is headed into space, and he’s taking his brother with him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HxWs6v"&gt;The Amazon CEO announced the news &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CP0MSOqnYEo/"&gt;via a video on Instagram&lt;/a&gt; (below). In it, he says he and his brother Mark will be launching into space on July 20th aboard a rocket built by Bezos’ space company Blue Origin. The firm &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420709/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-new-shepard-tickets-astronaut"&gt;announced in May&lt;/a&gt; it would be targeting this date for a first crewed flight, but did not say that Bezos himself would be taking part. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZWqlD"&gt;In the Instagram video, Bezos says that taking a journey into space has been a lifelong dream for him, and that it will be “meaningful” to have his brother along for the ride. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CP0MSOqnYEo/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading" style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;" target="_blank"&gt;A post shared by Jeff Bezos (@jeffbezos)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vyidVT"&gt;“You see the earth from space and it changes you. It changes your relationship with this planet, with humanity. It’s one Earth,” says Bezos. “I want to go on this flight because it’s the thing I’ve wanted to do all my life. It’s an adventure. It’s a big deal for me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gdvY5W"&gt;The Bezos bros will be flying to the edge of space aboard Blue Origin’s reusable rocket New Shepard. The booster is topped by a gumdrop-shaped Crew Capsule with space for six passengers inside and large windows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZE0KL"&gt;The rocket will blast off from the Earth, and once it reaches the Kármán line, 100 kilometers above sea level, the capsule will detach from the booster, allowing those inside to view the curvature of the earth and experience weightlessness. The booster and capsule will then land separately, with capsule landing in the West Texas desert with the help of parachutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="x81Emp"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SbxbrBLIogc?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HKm9cJ"&gt;In addition to Jeff and Mark Bezos, one seat on the flight will be claimed by the winning bidder of an ongoing online auction ongoing. The auction ends on June 12th and currently has a high bid of $2,800,000. It seems expensive, but forget about the experience of going to space: the winner will also have 10 minutes to bend the ear of the richest person on Earth. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple isn’t just a walled garden, it’s a carrier</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EOVAZBTSxaXtdfoSJRMar_ds3hM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69415337/acastro_170731_1777_0003_v6.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The return of the Angry God of ARPU&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="bil1UH"&gt;As we await the beginning of Apple’s latest WWDC keynote and all of the new software products it will unveil, let’s talk about metaphors. Specifically, the metaphors we use to talk about Apple’s ecosystem. The go-to for years has been it’s a “walled garden” — here’s Joanna Stern at the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; making that case in a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/iphone-airpods-macbook-you-live-in-apples-world-heres-what-you-are-missing-11622817653?mod=followjoannastern"&gt;literal walled garden&lt;/a&gt; — but I’m not sure that’s the best one anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IS0KpJ"&gt;It’s worth kicking around some different ways of describing Apple’s ecosystem in this moment because of the nature of keynotes — even online-only keynotes. Apple is the master of crafting narratives around its products that become an organizing principle for understanding what those products are. Those narratives aren’t intellectual exercises, they’re stories told to change how you feel about Apple and its products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o2Se0M"&gt;There’s nothing inherently nefarious about Apple telling a story about itself and its products, but right now there are more counter-narratives than there ever have been. Apple is facing antitrust scrutiny from governments around the world, from its Epic lawsuit, and from the very developers it is addressing today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BxbHLE"&gt;Having some metaphors in your back pocket is a good starting point to craft your own narrative rather than accepting any of the above. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HAVVct"&gt;Metaphors work because they let you apply the things you know and feel about one thing and apply them to another thing. They help organize your thoughts and can inspire you to look at a device in a different way. Steve Jobs was a master of this way of thinking. Is a computer a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob_GX50Za6c"&gt;bicycle for the mind&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfJ3QxJYsw8"&gt;is it a truck&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;div id="w85Fbb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 75%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ob_GX50Za6c?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Qjzsd6"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YfJ3QxJYsw8?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="utFTUU"&gt;The answer is, of course, it’s both and neither. Metaphors are never one to one — otherwise they’d be &lt;em&gt;definitions&lt;/em&gt;. (Sidenote: I invite you to consider whether “computer” is best thought of as a &lt;em&gt;metaphor&lt;/em&gt; instead of a &lt;em&gt;definition&lt;/em&gt; when you think about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;whether or not the iPad &lt;/a&gt;is a computer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6FCAIz"&gt;So that “walled garden.” It is, first and foremost, a &lt;em&gt;garden&lt;/em&gt; — it is tended, beautiful, and calming. It’s very nice to be in Apple’s world. Most things work together in harmony, and it’s often hard to forget there’s a big, big world of apps and services outside those walls. You can very happily use an iPhone to do almost anything you’d want without ever downloading a third-party app. You’re protected in some ways by those walls and — especially on the iPhone — your privacy is in some ways ensured. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rAl8BK"&gt;It’s a good metaphor! But the destiny of all metaphors is to become cliché. Through use and familiarity, they lose their emotive and explanatory power. When I call Apple a walled garden, it’s likely you know exactly what I mean and have already had the rest of the discussion in your head. The metaphor has lost the ability to help us understand more than we think we know. So let’s  keep “walled garden” around, but think about the other metaphors we might use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j9BNC4"&gt;One is the “Apple Tax,” the 30 percent (or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150629/apple-small-business-program-app-store-reduced-commission-15-percent-developers"&gt;15 percent&lt;/a&gt; if you’re able to wrangle it) cut of every digital transaction Apple takes on the iPhone. It’s at the center of the Epic vs Apple lawsuit, another Supreme Court case facing Apple, Spotify’s complaint in the EU that has led to government action, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EzKxdE"&gt;Lots of people hate taxes, but they are meant to pay for valuable shared infrastructure. But then again maybe Apple already covered those costs by selling iPhones, so the Apple Tax is egregiously high — or, if you prefer a different metaphor with legal overtones, maybe it’s &lt;a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/antitrust-the-app-store-and-apple/"&gt;rent-seeking&lt;/a&gt;. Something about calling Apple’s cut a “tax” strikes me as a little over the top; the 2021 equivalent of spelling Microsoft with a $ in place of the s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U0SkDl"&gt;During the Epic vs Apple trial, a new metaphor popped into my head and I can’t shake it. As I was looking at the emails that Apple executives were sending each other and reading their testimony during the trial, I kept thinking I’d seen this kind of behavior and even some of the justifications before. And so here it is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XzuDZ9"&gt;Apple is a carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="EoeZAd"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="CW38nS"&gt;I mean “carrier” as in cellular network carrier, as in Apple is Verizon or T-Mobile or (shudder) AT&amp;amp;T. Here’s how the metaphor works: The most important thing to any carrier is feeding the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/10/11193086/verizon-att-carrier-crapware-revenue-trick-samsung-software"&gt;Angry God of ARPU&lt;/a&gt; (average revenue per user). That number must go up to please shareholders and pay executives, and the carriers have engaged in any number of shenanigans to make it happen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c9aEAl"&gt;Carriers have forced pre-installed crapware on phones since the beginning of apps on phones, well before the iPhone. Examples are too numerous to count, but I’m talking about more than just pre-installed Candy Crush-style games. Users have always been encouraged by the design of the phone and the restrictions placed on the networks themselves to do things that make the carriers more money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="vyjve4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Carriers once dictated what smartphones were allowed to do. It’s happening again&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PGEbJI"&gt;Verizon made &lt;a href="https://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/12/verizon-how-much-do-you-charge-now/"&gt;data buttons designed to be clicked by accident so you’d be charged&lt;/a&gt;. Sprint &lt;a href="https://blog.chron.com/jkonthephone/2007/01/sprint-testing-daily-charge-for-phone-web-browsing/"&gt;charged a daily fee to users who had the gall to access the web directly instead of using its WAP data portal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/8/22/3260771/ATT-facetime-3g-charges"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T famously blocked FaceTime&lt;/a&gt; from working on its network unless users paid for more expensive data plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PyOMyt"&gt;Every carrier has required wholly unnecessary navigation apps to be pinned to the launcher. Verizon used to go even further, &lt;a href="https://gigaom.com/2009/07/17/verizon-please-stop-disabling-gps-in-smartphones-on-your-network/"&gt;literally disabling GPS on smartphones on its network&lt;/a&gt;. That way it could force users to use (and pay for) its own navigation app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ffdvlv"&gt;All of this is egregious behavior that goes far beyond the practices Apple engages in on the iPhone, but the exercise of control in order to make more money is the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3s7ma"&gt;Apple uses its absolute control of app distribution on iOS to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21506995/apple-forced-in-app-purchase-protonmail-ceo-wordpress-iap"&gt;pressure developers into adding in-app purchases&lt;/a&gt;, creating more opportunities for the company to take a cut. And Apple freely puts notifications and advertisements for its own services on the iPhone while limiting what other apps are allowed to do. A prompt to sign up for an Apple Card here. Apple Music offer there. Arcade, Fitness Plus, Apple News Plus, an offer to get a warranty at the of the main Settings app. It’s a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="JepqbE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;When you have to reset all your iPhone settings it becomes painfully clear that Apple apps have a different set of rules than everybody else when it comes to allowing notifications by default. &lt;a href="https://t.co/C75anymrJw"&gt;pic.twitter.com/C75anymrJw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dieter Bohn (@backlon) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/backlon/status/1352795378119151621?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="87hQST"&gt;I admit it’s not fair to say Apple is as bad today as the carriers were back in the day when it comes to squeezing dollars out of users or developers. Nor is it fair to argue that Apple’s forays into content with TV Plus are the equivalent of AT&amp;amp;T’s flailing efforts at merging a TV network with a cellular network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="humso2"&gt;It’s not fair, but the tune sounds familiar because the parallels strike a chord. And the bitter harmony that I hear is the stifling of innovation to maximize profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="yB7tek"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What businesses and opportunities are foreclosed by App Store policies?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z9HBFI"&gt;Apple forces all apps selling digital goods of any kind to use its payment system and pay its cut. The arguments for why Apple thinks that is necessary are well-known. But the effects of that (and other) rules are that new and innovative  business models simply aren’t possible. Instead of paid upgrades, developers must resort to subscriptions. The nascent market to pay creators directly on services like Twitter and Substack must account for Apple’s platform fees. Instead of game streaming apps, there is… well, nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJlkGQ"&gt;Of all the rules of the Apple App Store, to me the most telling is the “anti-steering” rule that prevents app makers from even hinting that there might be alternate ways to pay for things without using Apple’s in-app purchase system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Spznf"&gt;Take Ring, the division of Amazon that sells smart home gadgets. Because of these anti-steering rules, it doesn’t allow you to sign up for a subscription in its iPhone app. Instead, you are directed to an &lt;a href="https://ring.com/mobile/free-trial-expired"&gt;informational web page&lt;/a&gt;. But Apple’s rules extend even to that web page, hosted on Ring’s own website. It contains no information about how much a subscription costs, no links to sign up, or any other actually useful information. To get around Apple’s rules, Ring instead has a video and a chat bot that will eventually tell you how to subscribe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="wPY8TK"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Similarly, the chat bot requires a few extra interactions before you get to a subscribe page.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In other words, the ways Ring tells you how to subscribe on iOS appear to be designed to get around automated review and maybe even light human review. Incredible!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5/ &lt;a href="https://t.co/67CDpl4nsB"&gt;pic.twitter.com/67CDpl4nsB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dieter Bohn (@backlon) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/backlon/status/1401204093348052992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="424vBS"&gt;The most revealing moment of the Epic v Apple trial came perhaps at the end, when Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers grilled Apple CEO Tim Cook on its policy of refusing to let apps even acknowledge the existence of ways to pay for digital goods outside of Apple’s ecosystem. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22448023/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-lawsuit-judge-tim-cook-app-store-questions"&gt;Here’s Adi Robertson on that exchange&lt;/a&gt; (emphasis mine below):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="8J9qbe"&gt;“If they wanted to go and get a cheaper Battle Pass or V-Bucks, and they don’t know they’ve got that option, what is the problem with Apple giving them that option?” she asked.&lt;br&gt;“If we allowed people to link out like that, &lt;strong&gt;we would in essence give up our total return on our [intellectual property],&lt;/strong&gt;” Cook said bluntly. Apple has talked repeatedly about the work it puts into maintaining the App Store and the iOS platform, and it’s accused companies like Epic of wanting a free ride.&lt;br&gt;Rogers made the opposite case. “The gaming industry seems to be generating a disproportionate amount of money relative to the IP that you are giving them and everybody else. In a sense, it’s almost as if they’re subsidizing everybody else,” she said.&lt;br&gt;Cook countered that Apple’s many free apps attracted a larger audience than developers could get on their own. “&lt;strong&gt;We need a return on our IP. We have 150,000 APIs that we create and maintain, and numerous developer tools, and the customer service piece of dealing with all these transactions&lt;/strong&gt;,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="K0UQEP"&gt;Cook later pointed out that by offering so many free apps on the App Store, it was bringing customers in for the paid apps as well. “I view that we are creating the entire amount of commerce on the store, and we’re doing that by focusing on getting the largest audience there,” he testified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="U31T9r"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="n80HmD"&gt;Before the iPhone, carriers could (and did) point to any number of smartphones and rightfully boast about the incredible things those phones enabled. The Blackberry, the Treo, the Moto Q, and more all did things that nobody would have thought possible just a few years before. But the carriers would take credit for them while at the same time making demands that kneecapped those phones’ capabilities. They used their monopoly on wireless customers to dictate phone design, software capabilities, and business models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MUNvyi"&gt;The result was a series of great phones that were still less than they could have been. I don’t know if any of them could have become the iPhone, but I do know that it wasn’t even possible because they didn’t have the leverage to tell the carriers to leave them be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="eTCrnx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple broke carrier control — and kept it for itself&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oE6A9A"&gt;The great irony is that the only thing that broke the dam on innovation in mobile was the iPhone itself. Steve Jobs was able to tell Cingular (now AT&amp;amp;T) to just accept whatever he made, sight unseen — and that was a key reason why the iPhone was great. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nMLKlS"&gt;And by continuing to keep them from meddling, the iPhone kicked off a wave of mobile innovation that’s still crashing today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="JfuFxr"&gt;Given the opportunity again, I have no doubt that the carriers would find ways to exert control, feed the Angry God of ARPU, and thereby stifle innovation. But Apple effectively took that power away from them — but then kept it for itself. The question now is what Apple intends to do with that power.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube’s TikTok competitor Shorts will soon let users sample audio from any YouTube video</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Three screenshots showing the interface of YouTube Shorts in beta. One shows a video, another shows a carousel of videos on the YouTube app’s main screen, and the third shows a grid of videos using the same sound." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H_cpu2snigYXwEY5qH8tACft-cE=/0x1:4332x2889/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69415312/youtube_shorts_beta.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zGM5zd"&gt;Being able to sample audio from other users’ videos is one of TikTok’s greatest strengths. It allows memes to percolate across the platform and lets users discover new content by watching videos with the same sound. Soon, YouTube will expand this feature in its TikTok competitor, Shorts, letting users sample sounds from &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; content uploaded to YouTube. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RLFHxU"&gt;YouTube officially announced this feature last month in a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/108706620/introducing-a-new-way-to-create-shorts-with-audio-from-across-youtube?"&gt;community support post&lt;/a&gt;, but tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it should now be available for the first time in new markets as part of the launch of Shorts in the UK, Canada, and a number of Latin American countries (including Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Colombia, Peru and Venezuela). The YouTube-sampling tool will then roll out to other Shorts markets including the US in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TrXmlZ"&gt;Shorts users can already sample sounds from other Shorts videos (as well as from a library of licensed music). But this update will greatly expand the audio they have easy access to. The feature will funnel YouTube users into its Shorts feature via a new “Create” button in the mobile app. This will appear underneath videos next to the like and dislike buttons. Clicking it will give users the option to sample the video’s audio in Shorts. Shorts viewers will also be able to tap the audio in any video to head back to the original source in YouTube proper.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Tq9HhbgKPWeDKzNTNgJzbI484aA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22642212/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_10.51.50_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shorts videos sampling audio from YouTube will link back to the original source. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Lk31t1"&gt;This feature will allow longform creators “to benefit by allowing the community to find something interesting in their video,” YouTube’s product lead for Shorts, Todd Sherman, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;Shorts users can create something with the sample audio, he says, and the creators of the audio will “get perhaps inbound traffic or exposure from that. From the longform creator perspective I think a lot of folks are excited to have their things remixed.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iKtDsA"&gt;Not all creators are happy about this, though. After YouTubers noticed a new check-box in the settings for their video uploads that gives Shorts users access to their audio, many complained that this would let people “steal” their content. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=youtube+shorts+permissions"&gt;Search for &lt;/a&gt;“YouTube Shorts permissions” on YouTube itself and you’ll find plenty of videos worrying about exactly this scenario, with thumbnails posing questions like: “YouTube legalized video stealing?”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yQuKAw"&gt;The permissions box seems to have been introduced before Shorts users were actually able to sample audio from YouTube videos. Right now it has to be unticked manually for each video, but Sherman tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; the company is working on a bulk opt-out option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wxwQAm"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;IMPORTANT:&lt;br&gt;YouTube suddenly automatically checked "Yes" on EVERY YouTube video to allow them to be re-uploaded as Shorts on OTHER channels ???&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please let your YouTuber friends know that they have to go through and uncheck this setting on every video or risk stolen content... &lt;a href="https://t.co/b4rjiwmE2c"&gt;pic.twitter.com/b4rjiwmE2c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mysticat #Mysty200k (@MysticatLive) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MysticatLive/status/1388191677836414977?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZnPnbj"&gt;A YouTube-sampling feature could create other problems, too. A huge array of content has been uploaded to YouTube over the years, much of it sensitive or personal in nature. The uploaders of this content won’t necessarily want their videos to be sampled as this could enable harassment or abuse. Despite this, the sampling feature will be opt-out rather than opt-in. That means all YouTube videos will be sampleable by default, and creators will have to specify which videos they don’t want to be used in Shorts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dE6PRN"&gt;Sherman says YouTube is aware of these potential problems, but that the company’s discussions with creators has indicated more excitement. “There is some concern about examples of videos that you might think are personal or sensitive and that’s why creators have asked for the ability to opt out. But they also seem to recognize that it sort of doesn’t work if it’s very selectively an opt-in,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zppWbr"&gt;YouTube originally launched Shorts last September &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436158/youtube-starts-tiktok-competitor-short-form-video-instagram-reels-beta-test"&gt;in India&lt;/a&gt; before bringing the feature to the US &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22286286/youtube-shorts-us-rollout-product-features-updates-chapters-monetization-neal-mohan"&gt;in March&lt;/a&gt;. Last month, the company announced plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22429350/youtube-shorts-fund-video-payments-tiktok-competitor"&gt;pay $100 million to creators&lt;/a&gt; to use the app, though exactly how much individual creators can earn isn’t clear.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>First official images of Honor 50 look weirdly like Huawei’s P50</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/plOQ3XD0AxSEPiHDZ5RvXNmfK1A=/1x0:1231x820/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69415268/E3RP8UBVgAAehBM.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1TvJra"&gt;Honor has released a couple of official images for its upcoming 50 series smartphone via its &lt;a href="https://weibo.com/3206603957/Kj2gp1BMw?type=comment#_rnd1623057835464"&gt;Weibo page&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bhavis/status/1401833284183621637"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. The images focus on the rear of the phone, showing an eye-catching pair of circular camera bumps. The Honor 50 series is currently due to be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bhavis/status/1399599535077220356"&gt;announced on June 16th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U7ODi7"&gt;Amidst a sea of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/6/12/18663281/google-pixel-4-apple-iphone-11-ugly-square-phone-cameras-modules"&gt;square and rectangular camera bumps&lt;/a&gt;, the dual circle design is an interesting look for Honor’s next flagship. It’s also a style that Honor’s former parent company Huawei is planning to use for &lt;em&gt;its&lt;/em&gt; next flagship, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22464776/huawei-p50-phone-camera-periscope-telephoto-leica-harmonyos"&gt;the similarly-named P50&lt;/a&gt;. It’s possible that the two companies finalized their designs before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570744/huawei-honor-sale-announced-us-sanctions"&gt;Huawei sold off Honor late last year&lt;/a&gt;, but it’ll be strange to see such similar looking devices released from two distinct manufacturers within such close proximity to one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4ZZGU2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Honor50series?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Honor50series&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;100W Super Fast Charge&lt;br&gt;Hypercurved screen.                                                  Launching in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Shanghai?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Shanghai&lt;/a&gt;, June 16th! &lt;a href="https://t.co/9MAzE0RsDb"&gt;pic.twitter.com/9MAzE0RsDb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Bhavya (Haya) (@bhavis) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bhavis/status/1401833284183621637?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NTJNMl"&gt;From the images it appears as though Honor’s next handset will have four rear cameras in total. The upper camera circle has one large lens, and it’s joined by three more on the lower bump. In contrast, Huawei’s P50 appears to have three lenses on the upper circle, and a single camera paired with a flash on the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FFDdLE"&gt;Beyond its design, Honor’s next flagship will be powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 778G processor, will feature 100W fast charging, and will also come with a “hypercurved screen.” It may also mark the return of Google’s apps and services to Honor’s devices (including the Google Play Store) if a &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/honor-50-google-apps/"&gt;now-deleted tweet from the company’s German Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; is to be believed. Honor was prevented from including Google’s software because of sanctions placed on its former parent company Huawei, but these are believed to not apply since it became independent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y406pk"&gt;A spokesperson from Honor previously declined to comment to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; as to whether or not Google’s software would be available on the upcoming 50 series. But with an official launch just round the corner, we won’t have long to wait to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rshhL7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="B1ikxe"&gt;Dell is being sued in California over its claims that its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/8/18167444/alienware-area-51m-desktop-laptop-features-price-release-date-ces-2019"&gt;Alienware Area-51m R1 laptop&lt;/a&gt; would offer “unprecedented upgradeability,” &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/dell-hit-with-fraud-case-over-alienware-area-51m-upgrade-claims"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. Alienware customer Robert Felter is accusing the company of running a “false and misleading” marketing campaign, in which it promised that the laptop’s core components, including the CPU and GPU, could be swapped out for more powerful models. A year later, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/13/21256786/alienware-area-gaming-laptops-dell-spec-boost-intel-10th-gen-nvidia-gpu"&gt;Area-51m R1’s successor was announced&lt;/a&gt; with new components not available as upgrades for the original model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bEBaXH"&gt;“Consumers were misled by Dell’s false and misleading marketing campaign and paid a significant premium for the Area 51M R1 under the incorrect belief that this ‘unprecedented upgradeability’ would save them money in the long run by allowing them to upgrade their laptop’s Core Components rather than having to purchase an entirely new upgraded laptop,” the suit alleges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gR5mMS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Consumers were misled by Dell’s false and misleading marketing campaign”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4TwhOJ"&gt;Dell announced the Alienware Area 51-m R1 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/8/18167444/alienware-area-51m-desktop-laptop-features-price-release-date-ces-2019"&gt;at CES 2019&lt;/a&gt;. The laptop offered a variety of 8th and 9th Gen Intel CPU options (including the i7-8700, i7-9700K, or i9-9900K processors) and graphics cards including Nvidia’s RTX 2070 and 2080. However, when the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/13/21256786/alienware-area-gaming-laptops-dell-spec-boost-intel-10th-gen-nvidia-gpu"&gt;Area-51m R2&lt;/a&gt; was announced the following May, it offered 10th Gen Intel CPUs and new GPUs including the RTX 2070 Super and RTX 2080 Super &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/13/21256845/alienware-area-51m-r1-r2-specs-upgradable-parts-gpu-dgff-limited"&gt;not available as upgrades&lt;/a&gt; for the R1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jhUIwm"&gt;If you go back and look at the specific promises Dell made when it announced the original laptop, it doesn’t seem to have &lt;em&gt;technically &lt;/em&gt;broken any of them. It said the laptop would only support Intel CPUs that used its Z390 chipset, which was compatible with the 8th and 9th-generation processors in the original R1 laptop. However, when Dell announced the R2, the new 10th-generation Intel CPUs used a new 400-series chipset. Considering it was Intel’s decision to change its chipset, this decision was arguably out of Dell’s hands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vedrmJ"&gt;Meanwhile, when it comes to upgrades for the laptop’s graphics card, Dell told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; at the time of the R1’s announcement that it’d “like to be able to say yes [to new GPU upgrades]; right now, we have no idea.” Effectively, customers could upgrade a lower end version of the laptop to a higher-end model, but only within the same generation of components. That left customers who bought the top-end model out of luck when a new generation of components rolled around.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Dell’s marketing promised “unprecedented upgradeability” for the laptop. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aGDDNm"&gt;The suit alleges that Dell should have been aware that Intel and Nvidia’s unannounced products wouldn’t work with the laptop. It claims Dell works closely with both companies, and that it should know the specs of their products prior to them becoming public. “Yet, despite being in possession of such designs, and with the full knowledge that the design of the Area 51M R1 could not accommodate future NVIDIA and INTEL chipsets, Dell launched a global campaign to mislead the public that the Area 51M R1 was upgradeable,” it says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQLslY"&gt;The question now is whether that means Dell’s claims about “unprecedented upgradeability” (which are &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/laptops/area-51m-r1/spd/alienware-17-area51m-laptop?AID=8900246&amp;amp;cjevent=d7a6593bc76011eb821a014e0a180512&amp;amp;cjdata=MXxZfDB8WXwxNjA2ODI1MDcwOTk1&amp;amp;gacd=9694607-23736398-5750457-266319267-127795103&amp;amp;dgc=af&amp;amp;VEN1=12839518-8900246-tomshardware-gb-1382540981155333000-Future%20Publishing%20Limited&amp;amp;dclid=CM2a8YP-hPECFYVmGwod6g8JJw&amp;amp;nclid=sCnLdWKocO4tlIbByYhQWxGscbEIKLu2GjmkogdKVjrVGC0eNRCJWg4hSIUGJ4t1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;still live&lt;/a&gt; on its website) were misleading. “Dell’s advertisement to the public didn’t place any restrictions on the upgradeability of the laptop,” Felter’s lawyer David W. Kani told &lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt;. “They also never disclosed that those with the highest spec CPU and/or GPU that their device would not be upgradeable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EGQR2Y"&gt;Dell declined to comment to &lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt; on the lawsuit, and did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. In the filing, Felter is seeking damages, relief, and attorneys fees for himself and other affected customers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple apparently has a spatial audio event right after today’s WWDC keynote</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/97C8gYA5zEOmOk-udEa7arBQExM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69415126/DSCF2672.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RbWUnT"&gt;Apple appears to have planned a dedicated event on Apple Music’s upcoming spatial audio feature for later today. According to a video that &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/06/apple-music-event-june7-after-wwdc/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; says&lt;/a&gt; was uploaded to &lt;em&gt;Apple Music &lt;/em&gt;as a teaser&lt;em&gt; — &lt;/em&gt;it’s since been removed — Apple will broadcast a special event called “Introducing Spatial Audio.” The event doesn’t appear on the Worldwide Developers Conference schedule but is set for 3PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rzXx0I"&gt;That is, of course, immediately after the presumed conclusion of Apple’s much anticipated 1PM ET keynote to kick off this year’s online WWDC, where the company is expected to announce its annual updates to each of its operating systems. Later in the afternoon at 5PM ET Apple will give its usual “State of the Union” presentation, which is more focused on developers than the opening keynote and addresses various technical aspects of the company’s platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xvwrXDo5W-2ZX2-IMMxKqj_xOTQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22642181/apple_music_june_7_post.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gwhGpC"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440090/apple-music-lossless-audio-dolby-atmos-support-audio"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; spatial audio for Apple Music last month alongside the addition of lossless files to the streaming service. Spatial audio will work with AirPods, built-in speakers on Apple devices, and third-party headphones, and should provide more immersive Dolby Atmos mixes compared to regular stereo audio. Apple previously said the feature would launch in June, so a mention of the release date at the WWDC keynote wouldn’t have been surprising, but it seems the company wants to give it a little more time in the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="323wVv"&gt;For more on what to expect at WWDC today, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22457534/apple-wwdc-2021-rumors-ios-15-new-macbook-pro-what-to-expect"&gt;here’s our preview&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk tweets that Tesla’s Plaid Plus is ‘canceled’ because ‘Plaid is just so good’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JXGNVgE7v_bajt3ryy3xTyzXiUA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69414090/twarren_08202017_1939_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gyiy13"&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted Sunday that the automaker’s Model S Plaid Plus is “canceled,” since the basic Plaid is “just so good.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TE9jpr"&gt;Tesla has been teasing its Model S Plaid since 2019, and Musk said late last month that delivery for the vehicle — which  will have top speeds of 200 mph and range between 390 and 412 miles— would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/29/22459617/musk-tweets-model-s-tesla-plaid-delivery-delayed-again-june-10th"&gt;pushed to June 10th&lt;/a&gt; as it needed “one more week of tweak.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KafvAo"&gt;He also tweeted Sunday that the Plaid could go from zero to 60 mph in under two seconds (a statement he’s made previously). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yPivSE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;0 to 60mph in under 2 secs. Quickest production car ever made of any kind. Has to be felt to be believed.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1401642134583791624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4hzqrw"&gt;The Plaid Plus was supposed to have range of more than 520 miles, but its specs on Tesla’s website Sunday are greyed out, although the site still says “Plaid Plus available in mid-2022.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sw-AFk5o2g1eEu9_jbLAncACJYg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22641300/plaid_greyed_out.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Tesla/screencap&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Plaid Plus doesn’t appear to be an option on Tesla’s website&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vezkBI"&gt;The Plaid Model S made its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/12/20862105/tesla-model-s-plaid-laguna-seca-nurburgring-porsche-taycan"&gt;debut at Laguna Seca raceway in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, where it lapped the course in 1 minute and 36 seconds. Tesla later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21451723/tesla-plaid-model-s-available-2021-specs-price-battery-day"&gt;showed off the Model S Plaid as part of its Battery Day presentation&lt;/a&gt; in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p1EVDN"&gt;While it’s possible Musk was joking on Twitter about the Plaid Plus being canceled (maybe to boost confidence in the regular Plaid model?) it seems unlikely, since he’s already tangled with the Securities and Exchange Commission for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18295240/elon-musk-sec-tweets-judge-nyc-ruling"&gt;past tweets&lt;/a&gt; about Tesla business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g1B6pr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N4fPW1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA’s Juno probe will get close to Jupiter’s moon Ganymede on Monday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z-PLZPd9REZ4DB7_5-lZZEKfYFI=/183x0:1617x956/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69414006/ganymede.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;These images of Ganymede were constructed from imagery from NASA’s Voyager 1 and 2 and Galileo spacecraft | USGS Astrogeology Science Center/ Wheaton/ NASA/ JPL-Caltech&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gmKaQO"&gt;On Monday NASA’s Juno space probe, which has been orbiting Jupiter since 2016, will get a close-up look at Jupiter’s biggest moon &lt;a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/jupiter-moons/ganymede/in-depth/"&gt;Ganymede&lt;/a&gt;, the agency said in a &lt;a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-juno-to-get-a-close-look-at-jupiters-moon-ganymede"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. It will be the closest NASA has gotten to the largest moon in the solar system for more than 20 years— &lt;a href="https://www.space.com/18632-galileo-spacecraft.html"&gt;Galileo cruised by Ganymede&lt;/a&gt; in 2000— coming within 645 miles of its surface. The information Juno gathers will give insight into the moon’s composition and ice shell, as well as provide data for future missions to Jupiter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YEhX8n"&gt;“Juno carries a suite of sensitive instruments capable of seeing Ganymede in ways never before possible,” said principal investigator Scott Bolton of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. “By flying so close, we will bring the exploration of Ganymede into the 21st century, both complementing future missions with our unique sensors and helping prepare for the next generation of missions to the Jovian system.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fTker7"&gt;Those missions include &lt;a href="https://europa.nasa.gov/"&gt;NASA’s Europa Clipper&lt;/a&gt; (launch date still TBD) and the European Space Agency’s &lt;a href="https://sci.esa.int/web/juice"&gt;JUpiter ICy moons Explorer&lt;/a&gt; [JUICE] mission, slated to launch next year and arrive at Jupiter in 2029 (and kudos to the ESA for going the extra mile on that acronym). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2KssE0"&gt;Ganymede is bigger than Mercury and is the only moon in the solar system with its own magnetosphere, which NASA describes as “a bubble-shaped region of charged particles” that surrounds it. The &lt;a href="https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/junocam"&gt;JunoCam&lt;/a&gt;, which has taken many of the most striking photos of Jupiter during its mission will only be able to snap about five images during the flyby, since Ganymede will appear and fade from view all within a 25-minute window. Three hours before Juno gets to its closest point near Ganymede, its science instruments will begin collecting data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="89OoXt"&gt;“Literally every second counts,” said Matt Johnson, Juno mission manager at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. “On Monday, we are going to race past Ganymede at almost 12 miles per second (19 kilometers per second).” And less than 24 hours later, Juno will make its 33rd science pass of Jupiter, he added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oob4FG"&gt;Juno is expected to get closest to Ganymede at about 1:35PM ET on Monday. You can track where Juno is now with NASA’s &lt;a href="https://deeq9fypw3lao.cloudfront.net/apps/juno-embed/"&gt;Eyes on the Solar System interactive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter may be close to launching Super Follows, as new research shows what it could look like </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R7KYSvxW3YRanDCMBj4NgpmNU74=/0x92:1842x1320/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69413687/Screen_Shot_2021_02_25_at_1.11.21_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A mockup of what Twitter Super Follows could look like | Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tv6uOu"&gt;Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301375/twitter-super-follows-communities-paid-followers"&gt;announced earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; it was working on a Super Follows feature that would allow some users to charge followers and give them access to extra content. On Sunday, app researcher Jane Manchun Wong tweeted screenshots of what she says it will look like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J48vGm"&gt;According to Wong’s research, which is typically very &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/15/22437690/twitter-blue-subscription-service-299-undo-tweets"&gt;accurate&lt;/a&gt;, the Super Follows program will be limited to Twitter users with at least 10,000 followers, who have posted at least 25 tweets within the past 30 days, and are at least 18 years old. As Twitter has referenced, one of the main features of Super Follows will be bonus content, such as exclusive tweets for Super Followers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yEG7nN"&gt;Wong also discovered a list of content categories that Super Follows users would choose from to describe their content (such as “sports” or “podcasting”), and notes that “adult content” and “OnlyFans” are listed as “content platforms” along with Facebook, Substack, Patreon, Twitch, and YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yJHtjy"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Twitter is working on Super Follows application&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Requirements:&lt;br&gt;- Have at least 10000 followers&lt;br&gt;- Have posted at least 25 Tweets in past 30 days&lt;br&gt;- Be at least 18 years old&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;notably, “Adult content” and “OnlyFans” are mentioned in the category and platform sections &lt;a href="https://t.co/qSEjh0ohm8"&gt;https://t.co/qSEjh0ohm8&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/yvkzx672V2"&gt;pic.twitter.com/yvkzx672V2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jane Manchun Wong (@wongmjane) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1401574554787479557?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nk1ctK"&gt;Twitter declined to comment about Wong’s latest research on Sunday. But It’s previously described the Patreon-like Super Follows feature as a kind of subscription, providing an example where a Super Follows user charged $4.99 per month for users to get access to “perks.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ttkEpv"&gt;It’s the latest direct payments feature Twitter has introduced in recent weeks; in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423583/twitter-tip-jar-feature-sending-money-venmo-cashapp"&gt;May it began testing Tip Jar&lt;/a&gt;, which lets users make one-time payments to creators directly on Twitter by clicking a dollar bill icon on their Twitter profile. Twitter doesn’t take a cut of Tip Jar donations, which supports several payment options including Cash App, PayPal, and Venmo. It’s not clear how payments would be structured for Super Follows, but it seems likely Twitter would take a percentage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DqIiMQ"&gt;Twitter’s product team has been busy this year, introducing several new features including its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22464291/twitter-blue-subscription-service-canada-australia-undo-reader-mode"&gt;Twitter Blue subscription service&lt;/a&gt; which is testing in Canada and Australia. It’s also reopened, then closed, then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22464077/twitter-reopens-verification-applications-badge-after-pause"&gt;reopened again its verification&lt;/a&gt; program, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420586/twitter-offensive-tweet-warning-prompt-updated-success-rate"&gt;updated its warnings&lt;/a&gt; for potentially offensive tweets, improved its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421574/twitter-crop-issue-bigger-images-rollout"&gt;photo cropping algorithm&lt;/a&gt; to allow “taller” images to fully display in users’ feeds, added the ability for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434936/twitter-dm-search-android-expanding"&gt;Android users to search&lt;/a&gt; their direct messages, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22417852/twitter-buying-scroll-subscription-service-news-revue-newsletter"&gt;acquired Scroll&lt;/a&gt;, the $5-per-month subscription service that removes ads from participating websites.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple heads into developer conference under more scrutiny than ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5_f6blu4byEVOq4Ae1XSs1u-Jmo=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69413334/wwdc_scrutiny.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z1fpLh"&gt;Apple needs a distraction, and it needs one fast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Kv4Hd"&gt;On Monday, the company will hold its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/apple-wwdc"&gt;WWDC 2021&lt;/a&gt;) during one of the most fraught moments for developer relations in Apple history. While Apple emerged from the Epic v. Apple trial &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22452035/epic-apple-antitrust-trial-final-arguments"&gt;in a seemingly strong legal position&lt;/a&gt;, its reputation took a body blow. Evidence revealed the company &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21368651/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-ban-lawsuit-epic-games-payments"&gt;“treat every developer the same”&lt;/a&gt; — it cut special deals with big companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348108/apple-amazon-prime-video-app-store-special-treatment-fee-subscriptions"&gt;like Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and Hulu and made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421290/microsoft-apple-xcloud-ios-shadow-cloud-gaming-removal-app-store"&gt;arbitrary&lt;/a&gt;, cutthroat decisions to lock competition out and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375128/apple-imessage-android-ecosystem-lock-in-epic-games-filings-app-store-dispute"&gt;lock users in&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4zUWB7"&gt;Developers have known or suspected these things for years, and at first, online reactions seemed muted. This is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/31/18647249/wwdc-apple-parental-control-app-store-mdm-spotify-moderation-developers-2019"&gt;third year&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21293813/apple-app-store-policies-hey-30-percent-developers-the-trial-by-franz-kafka"&gt;in a row&lt;/a&gt; that the shadow of antitrust regulation has hung over WWDC, after all, and so far the company has largely emerged unscathed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="d9ZWem"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;“We treat every developer the same.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/BsxsXhMiRB"&gt;https://t.co/BsxsXhMiRB&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/XGA2J1hV6b"&gt;pic.twitter.com/XGA2J1hV6b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Paul Haddad (@tapbot_paul) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tapbot_paul/status/1390305227174252547?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2IBSWl"&gt;But Apple watchers were hearing something else in the company’s testimony during the trial, something even devout developers couldn’t ignore: Apple was building its case on the idea that Apple, &lt;em&gt;not developers&lt;/em&gt;, was solely responsible for the success of the iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oObTNI"&gt;Some of those developers are now supremely unhappy. So it would be fortunate if Apple has a new MacBook Pro waiting for them, one that could swing the conversation at WWDC away from difficult questions about whether the App Store is fair.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Marco Arment’s tweets on May 11th slam Apple for shitting on developers" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dbCNShZc48KHH-OOILMvXMa5YXw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22639655/marco_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Tweets by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/1392101013243432960" target="_blank"&gt;Marco Arment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;By May 11th, developers had noted the tone of Apple’s testimony &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/1392101013243432960" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;was clear&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RKlzG7"&gt;On May 21st, Tim Cook himself made Apple’s position crystal-clear: “I view that we are creating the entire amount of commerce on the store,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22448023/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-lawsuit-judge-tim-cook-app-store-questions"&gt;Cook told Judge Rogers&lt;/a&gt;, when she questioned whether Apple didn’t necessarily deserve all the credit for keeping users around. Later, Cook insisted Apple would get paid no matter what gets decided in court: “We would have to come up with an alternate way of collecting our commission,” he told the judge, if alternative app payment mechanisms become a reality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iyimkW"&gt;We’ve seen rent-seeking behavior from Apple in the past: remember when it forced Hey, WordPress and others to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21397424/apple-wordpress-apology-iap-free-ios-app"&gt;add in-app purchases to their &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; apps&lt;/a&gt;, many of whom &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21506995/apple-forced-in-app-purchase-protonmail-ceo-wordpress-iap"&gt;were too scared to speak up?&lt;/a&gt; “These apps do not offer in-app purchase — and, consequently, have not contributed any revenue to the App Store over the last eight years,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296180/apple-hey-email-app-basecamp-rejection-response-controversy-antitrust-regulation#kmmNsE"&gt;the company told&lt;/a&gt; Hey developer Basecamp, as if paying rent was the only value that Basecamp had ever brought to the iPhone. Now, we’re learning that entitled perspective goes all the way to the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="It7IaP"&gt;I thought Nick Heer &lt;a href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/epic-v-apple-ends/"&gt;put it well:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="3ErNWV"&gt;If you thought before that Apple was an overly controlling corporate giant that squeezed money at every possible opportunity, its executives’ testimony reinforced that. Even if you are comfortable with Apple’s business case, Tim Cook’s cold remarks must have shaken some of that confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jexU4b"&gt;And this past Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/06/apple-developers-grow-app-store-ecosystem-billings-and-sales-by-24-percent-in-2020/"&gt;when Apple issued&lt;/a&gt; what his fellow podcast hosts &lt;a href="https://atp.fm/433"&gt;called a “self-serving puff piece,”&lt;/a&gt; prominent iOS developer Marco Arment apparently decided he’d been shaken enough. “[T]o bully and gaslight developers into thinking that we need to be kissing Apple’s feet for permitting us to add billions of dollars of value to their platform is not only greedy, stingy, and morally reprehensible, but deeply insulting,” writes Arment, in a fiery new blog post titled “&lt;a href="https://marco.org/2021/06/03/developer-relations"&gt;Developer relations&lt;/a&gt;” that’s sweeping through Apple’s dev community just days ahead of the show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M5usCD"&gt;“It isn’t the App Store that has enabled all of the commerce on iOS,” Arment challenges Cook: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="c2vDav"&gt;It’s the entire world of computing and modern society, created by a symbiotic ecosystem in which Apple played one part alongside many others. The world was already moving in this direction, and had Apple not played its part, someone else would’ve. The App Store is merely one platform’s forced distribution gateway, “facilitating” the commerce no more and no less than a web browser, an ISP or cellular carrier, a server-hosting company, or a credit-card processor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="6iK953"&gt;This is the part where Apple would argue that the App Store is far more — it’s designed to be a safe, curated, trustworthy experience where you can download apps without fear, which takes investment and a lot of work. But as we learned during the trial, the head of Apple’s own FEAR (Fraud Engineering Algorithms and Risk) team believed that Apple’s App Review program was a joke, “more like the pretty lady who greets you with a lei at the Hawaiian airport than the drug sniffing dog.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="d3Kgs3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Is no one reviewing these apps? Is no one minding the store? This is insane!!!!!!!” - Phil Schiller, 2012&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IjXxPw"&gt;Internal emails also revealed Apple’s own executives couldn’t believe some of the things App Review let into the public sphere, and yet &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;obvious scams continue to flourish&lt;/a&gt; today. While Apple now says its teams &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/05/app-store-stopped-over-1-5-billion-in-suspect-transactions-in-2020/"&gt;stop billions of dollars in fraud&lt;/a&gt; and employ a range of automated tools to detect malicious apps, it also admitted that it only has 500 people reviewing the 1.8 million apps on the store. (500 is not a lot of people to moderate a platform run by the most profitable company in the world, one that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220873/apple-2020-app-store-revenue-60-billion-dollars"&gt;made an estimated $64 billion last year&lt;/a&gt; from the App Store alone.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vVvWJt"&gt;One of Epic’s key arguments during the trial &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22414402/epic-expert-apple-app-store-fortnite-court-profit"&gt;was that the App Store is &lt;em&gt;ludicrously&lt;/em&gt; profitable&lt;/a&gt;, with margins so high (78 percent) they seem like the “Apple tax” that Apple’s long been accused of creating. And while Apple initially said it would refute that figure during the trial, the company instead &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22454959/epic-apple-trial-recap-video-tim-cook-xbox-playstation-business#:~:text=4%5D%20the%20app%20store%20is%20wildly%20profitable%2C%20but%20apple%20won%E2%80%99t%20admit%20it"&gt;repeatedly insisted it didn’t know&lt;/a&gt; how much profit the App Store actually makes. The best it could do was lay out a laundry list of things it doesn’t count against its App Store budget and presumably pays for out of the goodness of its heart, such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440629/apple-app-store-physical-purchases-400-billion-50-million-wwdc"&gt;the $50 million a year it spends on WWDC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jHllMm"&gt;Which brings us to Monday’s developer conference, and how Apple might salvage this mess. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/1392101898191245314"&gt;Like Arment&lt;/a&gt;, I don’t think Apple will suddenly announce that developers can use whichever payment processors they like, or even allow them to steer their customers to ways to pay outside Apple’s ecosystem. There’s also next to no chance Apple will reduce its cut. For one thing, the company’s been &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; clear about its stance on each of these throughout the trial, and it’s not going to give up until the lawsuit is over (and even then, not until after rounds of appeals.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYHqaG"&gt;Besides, Apple may not feel the need for anything that drastic. While a number of prominent Apple developers and bloggers have gone loud and coverage of the trial may have made Apple slightly less of a media darling — “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/26/opinion/apple-app-store-fortnite-lawsuit.html"&gt;The Apple Tax is Rotten&lt;/a&gt;,” declared Farhad Manjoo at the New York Times — there are plenty of developers who are simply happy to have a business at all. Having surveyed over 380 software developers ahead of WWDC, Creative Strategies principal analyst Ben Bajarin tells me that smaller developers tend to be satisfied with Apple as a whole, and over 90 percent of developers surveyed so far say they’re likely to keep developing for Apple’s platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KdaBlp"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A few observations from preliminary results from our Apple software developers study. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Small developers (those making well less than $1m a year) seem to have much higher positive sentiment toward Apple/App Store than those developers who are larger. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Uk1U5gecUu"&gt;https://t.co/Uk1U5gecUu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ben Bajarin (@BenBajarin) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BenBajarin/status/1400539719490965507?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IsFxu9"&gt;“There are still pain points, everyone wants Apple to do better, but there’s this demographic that recognizes Apple provides them value, allows them to do the thing they want to do by being a small indie developer,” he says. While many survey respondents complained about the app review process and a lack of clear communication from Apple, and the “vast majority” said Apple could be doing more about scams, even the more vocal developers plan to stay. “You listen to these very vocal developers who are unhappy...  if a viable alternative existed for them, they’d switch, but Apple’s platform and ecosystem is just such a good ecosystem for them. They won’t go to Android, they won’t go to Windows, because they won’t make the same amount of money,” Bajarin says. There’s no viable alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8Agoro"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Where are developers gonna go?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UPdq6M"&gt;Prominent dev&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith"&gt; Steve Troughton-Smith&lt;/a&gt; feels similarly, when I ask him what Apple needs to do this year to win developers over: “the realistic [answer] is ‘nothing’ — where are developers gonna go? They gotta stick with the App Store if they want to make money on mobile, and there really aren’t other options.” He says the majority of developers “don’t know or care about the trial, and they’re happy to build apps within the sandbox that don’t try to push the boundaries or run into existential issues — which is totally fine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K0Xcyp"&gt;“But I think we’ve lost a decade of innovation at the fringe because of Apple’s nannying, and it gets harder to ignore as Apple is now reaching into apps and trying to dictate their business models,” he adds, referencing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21506995/apple-forced-in-app-purchase-protonmail-ceo-wordpress-iap"&gt;Apple’s forced in-app purchases&lt;/a&gt; as one example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mo6qqy"&gt;Apple columnist and podcaster &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jsnell"&gt;Jason Snell&lt;/a&gt; agrees that Apple “denigrated their developers” during the trial, but also doesn’t expect them to fix that at WWDC: “Short of changing long-held App Store policies, like allowing linking to web sites for alternate payment methods, I’m not sure what they can do other than power through their next round of OS updates and hope developers get caught up in what’s new and forget what Apple said about the role of third-party developers on the stand,” he tells me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vLUj0S"&gt;But I’m betting Apple has another way to take our minds off developer concerns, a plan that’s worked for Apple in the past — a shiny new piece of hardware that’ll make the company’s “pros” excited to work on what’s next. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TwnxEvriVAZ44lI1EUnbjLhKA3A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22407714/Apple_wwdc21_newsroom_article_tile_033021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A hint at AR glasses, or just someone who likes what they see on this Mac?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dtE24G"&gt;Maybe it’ll be a preview of Apple’s long-awaited AR glasses. That would certainly dominate the headlines and be the talk of the show all week and beyond. While the rumor mill isn’t expecting a product to arrive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346564/apple-mixed-vr-virtual-augmented-reality-headset-light-ming-chi-kuo"&gt;until 2022 at the earliest&lt;/a&gt;, Tim Cook has been talking up the potential of AR for years, calling it “profound,” “huge,” a “core technology,” “as big an idea as the smartphone,” and most recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22367715/tim-cook-augmented-reality-apple-car-hints-interview"&gt;calling the tech “critically important”&lt;/a&gt; to Apple’s future. The company’s own WWDC teaser image above definitely makes me think about augmented reality, that’s for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FlqpYi"&gt;But a safer bet is that, for the third time in the post-Steve Jobs era, Apple will use WWDC to remind its “pro” users that it knows how to build a Mac at the intersection of power and flexibility. “Can’t innovate anymore, my ass,” said Apple exec Phil Schiller at WWDC 2013, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/6/10/4412350/apple-new-mac-pro-wwdc-2013"&gt;introducing the radically redesigned cylindrical Mac Pro&lt;/a&gt; with a quote designed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/6/13/4423844/cant-innovate-anymore-my-ass-apple"&gt;to distract from the actual criticism&lt;/a&gt; the company was facing that year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="phil schiller mac pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dui-NzKt5E3I83PJn08iYsvBpuo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/14361890/Screen_Shot_2013-06-12_at_4.06.55_PM.1419979641.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phil Schiller, announcing the 2013 Mac Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ezcra9"&gt;He also claimed that the 2013 Mac Pro was “without a doubt the future of the pro desktop” and while that turned out to be so embarrassingly wrong that Apple wound up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/4/15175994/apple-mac-pro-failure-admission"&gt;publicly admitting that 2013 Mac was a mistake&lt;/a&gt;, the company pulled the same move at WWDC 2019 with its new, improved, and actually-upgradable &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/6/5/18652409/apple-mac-pro-design-comparison-cheese-grater-upgrade-old-vs-new-trash-can"&gt;cheese grater Mac Pro&lt;/a&gt; to show — once again — that it’s listening to its most vocal audience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TUaKBv"&gt;2021 gives Apple a new opportunity. Five years ago, Apple killed off the beloved MacBook Pro with Retina Display, trading its pro-friendly SD card slot, full-size HDMI and USB ports and deep, familiar keyboard for a new machine with a gimmicky Touch Bar and a set of USB-C / Thunderbolt 3 ports that required dongles to plug practically anything into the machine. Developers were disappointed by its lack of RAM, too. &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-microsoft-macbook-pro-surface-studio-creative-professionals/"&gt;“Apple’s new MacBook Pro isn’t for pros,”&lt;/a&gt; I wrote at the time. My colleague Vlad: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/7/13548052/the-macbook-pro-lie"&gt;“The MacBook Pro is a lie.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMQywk"&gt;Yet the biggest issue with the new MacBook Pro turned out to be its ultra-thin “butterfly keyboard,” a design so susceptible to dust that it inspired &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/27/18284042/apple-macbook-keyboard-apology-issues-bad-design"&gt;its own public apology from Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/22/18634932/apple-macbook-pro-butterfly-keyboard-repair-reassure-worrying"&gt;multiple recall / repair programs&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344397/apple-macbook-butterfly-keyboard-switches-defective-class-action-lawsuit-certified"&gt;certified class-action lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;. We called it one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/27/21270299/apple-butterfly-keyboard-hardware-design-macbook-pro-physical-key-button"&gt;worst buttons ever made&lt;/a&gt;, and breathed a sigh of relief when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20974649/apple-macbook-pro-16-inch-laptop-review-keyboard-test-specs-price-features"&gt;2019’s MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; phased it out for good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vmIX5T"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple knows its most important critics love a high-end Mac&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="08e0FQ"&gt;But 2019’s MacBook Pro mostly just fixed 2016’s mistakes — and where pros are concerned, 2020’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;13-inch MacBook Pro with Apple’s new M1 chip&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t quite get there. It is essentially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21559228/apple-new-macbook-air-pro-difference-arm-m1-fan-thermal-performance"&gt; an M1 MacBook Air with an added fan&lt;/a&gt;, the same two ports and the same maximum 16GB of RAM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UfHpeV"&gt;At WWDC 2021, Apple can show that it’s listening again, and by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s account, it will: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22457534/apple-wwdc-2021-rumors-ios-15-new-macbook-pro-what-to-expect"&gt;we’re expecting to see&lt;/a&gt; a new 16-inch MacBook Pro that brings back the SD card slot and HDMI port, heralds the return of Apple’s beloved trip-friendly MagSafe connector, trades the annoying Touch Bar for physical function keys, and supports up to 64GB of RAM. They’re also expected to include double the high-performance CPU cores and at &lt;em&gt;least&lt;/em&gt; double the GPU cores of the Apple M1 chips &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;that already managed to upend our concept of laptop performance&lt;/a&gt; late last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IjcOTq"&gt;It sounds like Apple may be giving its professional users exactly what they’ve asked for in a new laptop, for the first time in many years, and many of those pros are the same developers attending WWDC and building for iOS. A shiny distraction won’t help Apple win at trial, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22404493/amy-klobuchar-interview-antitrust-book-hearings-big-tech"&gt;or stave off Amy Klobuchar&lt;/a&gt;, but it could certainly help change the tone of developer conversations this week at WWDC.&lt;/p&gt;
