    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t4RQBU"&gt;If you bought a new Windows laptop on Black Friday or received one as a gift, you may be struggling to figure out which apps to download. Never fear. I have scoured the internet, the Microsoft Store, and my own downloads folder to find all the best Windows apps for whatever purpose you may need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M0Cbu0"&gt;You might be surprised how many online services you already use that have their own dedicated Windows app. I find that the main benefit of many Windows apps is to help mentally separate my life. It can get hard to navigate all of my various streaming services, work apps, chats, and social media using Chrome tabs — and it also puts me at greater risk of getting distracted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GjqWUi"&gt;There are also some services that are significantly better in app form than they are in browser form — and some that &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; exist in app form. We’ve got some of those here, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n4Zdi1"&gt;To help you search out the apps that work best for you, I’ve divided the 26 apps into separate categories. Take a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2aNq8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’ve rounded up our favorite and most-used games, apps, and entertainment. Check out our app picks for &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21951417"&gt;&lt;em&gt;iPhones&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21942553"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android phones&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21943103"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows PCs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21952855"&gt;&lt;em&gt;M1-equipped Macs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;; our favorite mobile games from &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21942272"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Arcade&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21934070"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Play Pass&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;; and our top choices for &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21929534"&gt;&lt;em&gt;gaming PCs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21941056"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21929530"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xbox One and Series X / S&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21938238"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nintendo Switch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21941004"&gt;&lt;em&gt;VR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. We’ve also listed our favorite streaming shows on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22178393/disney-plus-hulu-espn-plus-best-shows-movies-recommendations"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disney Plus, Hulu, ESPN Plus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22175140/best-netflix-shows-2020-streaming-recommendations-tv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Netflix&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;; some &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21951428"&gt;&lt;em&gt;great sci-fi books&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163667/2020-favorite-best-podcasts-tech-culture-apple-google-stitcher-soundcloud-spotify"&gt;&lt;em&gt;exciting new podcasts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. (Note: pricing was accurate at the time of publishing but may change.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8FdECc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Duolingo" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e1aqArMt9zr7VQlWSzd2QuuSQwA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22188388/duolingo.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Duolingo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Duolingo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="y8Rhx8"&gt;Duolingo &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="j9FXbn"&gt;Duolingo is a fun and easy way to pick up a new language with just a few minutes of practice a day. I started using it to brush up on my Chinese at the beginning of this year, and I’ve found it to be quite effective without taking a ton of time out of my day. It’s a nice break. The desktop app includes courses in Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and more. You’ll start with basic phrases such as greetings and move on to more advanced exercises as you progress. And you can leave in the middle of lessons and come back to complete them later, which makes Duolingo ideal for learners with busy schedules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="0xvcBm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Duolingo","description":"Free","label":"Download now","url":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fduolingo-learn-languages-for-free%2F9wzdncrcv5xn%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="FproSK"&gt;
&lt;p id="89Hmdg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video Chat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Skype" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gLyxiUfFml7JJq-U9fD_Y1Er3J8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19832275/Screen_Shot_2020_03_25_at_11.14.30_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skype&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nkXDDz"&gt;Zoom&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="uYRJDH"&gt;If there’s an app that defines 2020, it must be Zoom. I use this service two or three times a day for work meetings, virtual events, or just chatting with friends. I have a pretty slow and unstable internet connection, but I always find meetings to be stable and easy to start up. (If you’re experiencing connectivity issues, turning off your video feed usually helps.) And there are all kinds of neat features to make it easier. You can customize your background picture, set personal notes on your chat profile, swap between portrait and landscape layouts, and more. Users on the free tier can host sessions of up to 100 participants capped at 40 minutes. For an annual fee starting at $149.90, you can add benefits like unlimited call time, cloud recording, and single sign-on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="uQ6bkB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Zoom","description":"Free; starts at 149.90 / year for Pro version","label":"Download now","url":"https://zoom.us/"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="flSOgC"&gt;Skype&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GBRVwb"&gt;Skype doesn’t have as many business-oriented features as Zoom does. But since it’s a Microsoft product, it has extra integrations with Windows 10. You can sign in with your Microsoft account and connect it with the company’s other software like OneDrive and Outlook. With Skype, you can add people as contacts and call them directly (you don’t need to send any links) as well as message them. Another neat trick: you can share files just by dragging and dropping them into the chat window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="lvGzkK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Skype","description":"Free","label":"Download now","url":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fskype%2F9wzdncrfj364%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="2zbPi5"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Vb90TH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content Creation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="paint 3d" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F15l7FhUs3xZwbkbqJH9YUMU7CU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7350651/Screen_Shot_2016-10-26_at_12.33.42_PM.0.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paint 3D&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gHQ1fJ"&gt;Adobe Creative Cloud&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjwDBQ"&gt;The Creative Cloud apps you need will depend on the kind of work you’re doing and your budget. Photo editors can get Photoshop (the best-known photo manipulation software that’s widely used by professionals) and Lightroom (for image processing) for $9.99 per month. Amateur photographers can get the free &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fadobe-photoshop-express-image-editor-adjustments-filters-effects-borders%2F9wzdncrfj27n%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Photoshop Express&lt;/a&gt;, which has all the features you need for basic image editing. Those who do video work can get the industry-leading Premiere Pro for $20.99 per month or the consumer-focused &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adobe.com%2Fproducts%2Fpremiere-elements.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22179062%2Fwindows-pc-apps-zoom-spotify-netflix-whatsapp-instagram-2020#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Premiere Elements&lt;/a&gt; for a one-time price of $69.99. You can own the entire Creative Suite for $52.99 per month, which includes over 20 desktop apps like Illustrator, InDesign, Premiere Rush, Audition, After Effects, Dreamweaver, and Acrobat Pro. You’ll want for nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="F6b60b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Adobe Creative Cloud","description":"$52.99 / month","label":"Buy now","url":"https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adobe.com%2Fcreativecloud%2Fplans.html&amp;amp;amp;xcust=verge"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="eqnfeO"&gt;Paint 3D&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="YWQyAz"&gt;Paint has come a long way since you had to use it to draw stick figures in computer class. It’s easy to dismiss Paint 3D as crapware that came preloaded onto your Windows PC, but it’s actually one of the best-rated apps on the Microsoft Store. I use it for basic image work, and it has all of the tools I could ever need. Artists can use the free program to make 3D models in addition to 2D creations, with all kinds of textures, filters, and lighting options. And you can easily copy and paste 3D models into other Microsoft apps, including Word, PowerPoint, and Mixed Reality Viewer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="H0NHo5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Paint 3D","description":"Free","label":"Download now","url":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fpaint-3d%2F9nblggh5fv99%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="LYvLdU"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="c0ZJlI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Spotify" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wy96G6S_juW4m2isvyN2xIpeFr8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22176566/image__3_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spotify&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eFkprF"&gt;Audible&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oF2jDq"&gt;If you’re looking for a way to unwind on a Sunday afternoon, an audiobook might be just what you need. From the Windows Audible app, you can browse a huge selection of audiobooks and listen to them at your leisure. An Audible Plus membership starts at $7.95 per month and gives you access to “select audiobooks, Audible Originals, podcasts, and more,” while an Audible Premium Plus membership for $14.95 per month adds one title of your choice per month and a 30 percent discount on additional premium purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="bMSHZM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Audible","description":"$7.95 for Plus version; $14.95 for Premium Plus version","label":"Download now","url":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Faudiobooks-from-audible%2F9wzdncrfj1cr%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="1hYK2N"&gt;Spotify&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="uHxXj5"&gt;If you don’t already use Spotify, you must know at least one person who does. Its Windows app is easy to navigate and gives you access to all kinds of recommendations and curated playlists. I’m not even a Spotify Premium subscriber (I’m an Apple Music loyalist), but I often pull up the Spotify Windows app just to see recommendations for new artists and songs. They’re usually good. Spotify Premium (which gets rid of ads and allows you to play music offline) costs $9.99 per month; there’s a three-month free trial period if you sign up this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ZKc5ke"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Spotify","description":"Free; $9.99 / month for Premium version","label":"Buy now","url":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fspotify-music%2F9ncbcszsjrsb%23activetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="MlNOwJ"&gt;Amazon Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="YoJDxn"&gt;If Spotify isn’t your thing, you might prefer Amazon Music Unlimited — especially if you’re a Prime subscriber. The service costs $7.99 per month for Prime members and $9.99 for non-Prime members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="SNNC0C"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Amazon Music","description":"$7.99 / month for Prime members; $9.99 / month for non-Prime members","label":"Buy now","url":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Famazon-music%2F9nms233vm4z9%23activetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="sM3uUr"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vbcowK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Netflix" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IrP3JfcYe2mEwY84J1sjAsgIPXQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22176609/image__8_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Netflix&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0CKtKw"&gt;Netflix&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="79ZIt6"&gt;If you’ve only heard of one video streaming service, it’s probably Netflix. Netflix is one of the most popular streaming services in the US and also one of the most popular apps on the Microsoft Store. You can use the app to quickly pull up TV shows and movies without having to navigate in a browser, and the service syncs across devices, so you can pause an episode on your PC and resume where you left off on your phone. A membership starts at $8.99 per month, and which plan you want depends on how many screens you want to watch on at the same time, and whether you want access to HD or Ultra HD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="A6QrTG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Netflix","description":"Starts at $8.99 / month","label":"Buy now","url":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fnetflix%2F9wzdncrfj3tj%23activetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="USQeaM"&gt;Hulu&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="pZm62U"&gt;If Hulu is more your speed, there’s a Windows app for that, too. Not only can you access some of the most popular TV shows like &lt;em&gt;Seinfeld &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;This is Us&lt;/em&gt;, but you can also get live TV from over 65 channels and can add content from other services like HBO Max and Showtime for an extra cost. Plans start at $5.99 per month; &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hulu.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22179062%2Fwindows-pc-apps-zoom-spotify-netflix-whatsapp-instagram-2020#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;there is also a bundle&lt;/a&gt; that includes Disney Plus and ESPN Plus for $12.99 per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kF3qha"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Hulu","description":"Plans start at $5.99 / month","label":"Buy now","url":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fhulu%2F9wzdncrfj3l1%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="wQ5iqS"&gt;VLC&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GFsT4n"&gt;Not a streaming service, but still quite useful, VLC is a free media player that can handle all kinds of formats. It’s like Windows Media Player, but significantly better. I’ve used VLC to watch a few different virtual meetings and presentations this year and found it more reliable and stable than using a browser. It includes some features to improve the viewing experience, including equalizer settings and presets for music playback. It can even pull content from DVDs and CDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="c8D4DG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"VLC","description":"Free","label":"Download now","url":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fvlc%2F9nblggh4vvnh%23activetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="DKeKU1"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Wirg6Z"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Messaging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Discord" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H-XCTV-vI9wXMgIXQYjzblSS6vU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22188022/Screen_Shot_2020_12_21_at_11.34.12_AM__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discord&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1ISmSt"&gt;WhatsApp Desktop&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eDEAKn"&gt;I use the WhatsApp mobile app to chat with some of my friends, and I like to use the Windows app to keep up with those chats while I’m not near my phone. It’s very useful if you’re a WhatsApp user. You can see all of your conversations in one place, and they’ll sync up across devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Wo9jzS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"WhatsApp Desktop","description":"Free","label":"Download now","url":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fwhatsapp-desktop%2F9nksqgp7f2nh%23activetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="7JwOCe"&gt;Messenger&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XUGODZ"&gt;There’s now a Facebook Messenger app for Windows that looks almost identical to the Messenger apps for iOS and Android. It’s missing some features of the web client — namely, voice and video calling. I use this app for one simple purpose: to keep my chats separate from my browser, where I’m trying to work, so I’m less prone to distraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="X3JbH5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Messenger","description":"Free","label":"Download now","url":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fmessenger%2F9wzdncrf0083"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="n8U8rl"&gt;Discord&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="B51a5m"&gt;Discord started out as a service for gamers, but the company has worked to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308194/discord-gaming-users-safety-center-video-voice-chat"&gt;expand it to more demographics&lt;/a&gt; this year. It’s more common than ever to see people using the service in business settings, fan communities, or just to chat with groups of friends. Not only does Discord provide text chat, but it’s also super easy to set up voice channels, which are convenient and generally stable. For a variety of additional features, you can subscribe to Nitro Classic for $4.99 a month or Nitro for $9.99 a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="w2BZKC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Discord","description":"Free; $9.99 / month for Nitro version","label":"Download now","url":"https://discord.com/nitro"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="UytgSB"&gt;Slack&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4tPYzA"&gt;Slack is a must-have for many workplaces — especially teams that are partially or fully remote. But you don’t need to be a business user to enjoy Slack. Anyone can create a virtual workspace to chat and hang out, whether for your book club or your fantasy football league.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Bydr3W"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Slack","description":"Free; business plans start at $6.67 / person / month","label":"Download now","url":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fslack%2F9wzdncrdk3wp%23activetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="FaDStd"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UcLDne"&gt;Instagram&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1kJFjA"&gt;Yes, there is a Windows app for Instagram, and it’s actually much better than the browser client. Pretty much anything you can do with Instagram on your phone, you can do in the Windows app — whether it’s viewing photos and stories, reading and replying to DMs, or watching IGTV videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="bEvEGl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Instagram","description":"Free","label":"Download now","url":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Finstagram%2F9nblggh5l9xt%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="hF9BRu"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZVJeYN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Productivity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Sticky Notes" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GzbRM_De1HgYkNKulHZUCF-7KBg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22176574/image__6_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sticky Notes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="j9EI39"&gt;WPS Office &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XpXtef"&gt;I really don’t want to pay for Microsoft 365, so instead, I use WPS Office. It’s quite similar to Microsoft 365 and can open and edit Office documents — except it’s completely free. The Suite includes Writer (Word), Spreadsheets (Excel), PDF Editor, and Presentation (PowerPoint), which can open nearly all Microsoft Office formats (including .docx, .ppt, and .xls, for example). They’re all quite good, and provide a similar experience to their Office competitors. WPS has some handy features of its own: for example, Writer allows you to keep multiple documents open in browser-esque tabs. I actually prefer that layout to Word’s setup — in fact, I would probably use WPS over Word even if it wasn’t free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="4IBYqm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"WPS Office for Windows","description":"Free; $29.99 / year for Premium version","label":"Download now","url":"https://pc.wps.com/"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="mOXYlS"&gt;Todoist&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WyUUwd"&gt;If you’re feeling overwhelmed by all of the stuff you need to do, Todoist can help you keep track. Widely praised as the best task-management program out there, Todoist allows you to create projects and tasks within those projects and assign them priority ratings, due dates and times, labels, and all kinds of other details. The bottom tier is free but doesn’t include some features you might want (such as the ability to comment on tasks and set reminders). A Premium subscription costs $36 per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="SR96A4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Todoist","description":"Free; $36 / year for Premium version","label":"Download now","url":"https://todoist.com/home"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="b6UmXE"&gt;Sticky Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="TOT9qN"&gt;Sticky Notes is about as simple an app as you can find, but it’s a great one to try out if you haven’t yet. I use it to write notes and reminders to myself and keep them hanging on the side of my screen, the same way you would with a Post-It.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="lW2JGT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Microsoft Sticky Notes","description":"Free","label":"Download now","url":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fmicrosoft-sticky-notes%2F9nblggh4qghw%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="UJb1y7"&gt;Microsoft 365&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="I4FILF"&gt;Of course, if you need the gold standard for office work, you’re going to be looking at Microsoft 365. The subscription-based suite includes all the office tools you might be looking for, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote. Subscriptions start at $7 per month or $70 a year and come with a free terabyte of storage for all your creations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="sRYeyJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Microsoft 365","description":"Starts at $6.99 / month or $69.99 / year","label":"Buy now","url":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Fp%2Fmicrosoft-365-personal%2Fcfq7ttc0k5bf%3Ficid%3DSSM_Search_Promo_Office_OfficeProducts_CTA2%26activetab%3Dpivot%253aoverviewtab"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="vGRKzm"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="G3vEmz"&gt;Dropbox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="d1LIpe"&gt;Anyone who uses Dropbox for work or personal use can take advantage of its nice Windows app, which gives you a convenient way to view your photos and documents. You can also download and upload items in the app. You get 2GB of storage with the free plan; if you need additional space, the Plus version ($9.99 per month, billed annually) offers 2TB, along with a number of other features, such as smart sync and full text search. A Family plan for up to six users costs $16.99 per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="dnthVw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Dropbox","description":"Free; $9.99 / month for Plus version","label":"Download now","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/?landing=dbv2"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="iSCxle"&gt;Google Drive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XKPlKk"&gt;Check out Google Drive for a cloud-based alternative to Dropbox. The free version of Google Drive gives you 15GB of storage. That’s going to be shared between all the stuff your account might have in various Google programs — Docs, Sheets, Photos, etc. — but it’s still a lot more storage than you get from Dropbox for free. (If you need more space, &lt;a href="https://one.google.com/u/1/storage#upgrade"&gt;Google One&lt;/a&gt; offers 100GB for $2 / month or 200GB for $3 / month.) The nice thing about the Windows app is that it can sync your online files with your desktop automatically, so you can easily work offline and have backups if something goes awry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="CoDIhs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Google Drive","description":"Free","label":"Download now","url":"https://www.google.com/intl/en_cy/drive/download/"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="TQw3UQ"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dolby Access&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="95Roux"&gt;Dolby Access&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="K1r9p9"&gt;Dolby Access allows you to run &lt;a href="https://www.dolby.com/technologies/dolby-atmos/"&gt;Dolby Atmos&lt;/a&gt; through your headset or headphones. I use it to customize my audio based on the task I’m doing (gaming, music, movie-watching, etc.) — and yes, you can hear the difference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="lbkPPm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Dolby Access","description":"$14.99 / month","label":"Buy now","url":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fdolby-access%2F9n0866fs04w8%23activetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="kMQh3i"&gt;Your Phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LMfMBV"&gt;Your Phone allows you to connect your Windows PC to an Android device so that your PC can become an extension of the Android experience. You can get notifications, share your photos, make and pick up calls, and reply to text messages. You need to be running Android 7.0 or later to use this app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="36fX6N"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Your Phone","description":"Free","label":"Download now","url":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fyour-phone%2F9nmpj99vjbwv%23activetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="azKC7U"&gt;Total PC Cleaner&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="CcDNYb"&gt;This free utility does exactly what it says: it cleans up your PC. Run the program, and it will clear out your various caches, and dig up and remove large junk files. I like to run Total PC Cleaner and similar services every so often to free up storage. Sometimes it even boosts performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="oDpJSK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Total PC Cleaner","description":"Free","label":"Download now","url":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Ftotal-pc-cleaner-free-disk-space-clean-up-optimize-memory-windows-system%2F9nb3xctl0rwd%23activetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="JZyBXC"&gt;7-Zip / PeaZip&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1QlLzU"&gt;If you receive a file with an extension that you don’t know what to do with (such as .RAR), you may need a program like 7-Zip or PeaZip to open it. Both programs also compress files for you and allow you to password protect your files. PeaZip has a more modern-looking interface with some advanced features, while 7-Zip nails the basics and is a better option for general users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="JX5MYV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"7-Zip","description":"Free","label":"Download now","url":"https://www.7-zip.org/download.html"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside id="tVJ0B3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"PeaZip","description":"Free","label":"Download now","url":"https://peazip.github.io/"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Beats Powerbeats Pro are selling for just $90 refurbished at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xp-c59QYmoLC-iVOTYh-etDqP00=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68592704/cwelch_190402_3343_1618.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AVmL7q"&gt;You can snag a refurbished set of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/10/18563329/apple-powerbeats-pro-review-wireless-fitness-headphones-price"&gt;Beats Powerbeats Pro&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s latest truly wireless earphones, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1727919844346770522" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $90 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. This deal is exclusive to the green “moss” color variant shown in the picture above. Looking at new options, the price ranges from $130 to $180 depending on the color you want, so today’s deal is worth jumping on if you don’t care as much about what the headphones look like. And hey, if this shade of green happens to vibe with your look, then even better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8tCUBP"&gt;Though these are refurbished, they’ve been cleaned and tested by Best Buy. They come with a 90-day warranty, as well as all original accessories including ear tips and the charging case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="szdyLg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10058925"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kM3bgP"&gt;Also at Best Buy, Apple’s latest iPad with 128GB of storage &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1727920106073161754" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is $50 off of its usual $430 price&lt;/a&gt;. This isn’t the first time we’ve seen this discount, but it’s worth checking out now if you need to pick one up. Amazon is offering the same deal, but at the time of publishing, it’s sold out of the silver color and all 128GB models won’t ship until February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1thv5E"&gt;This iPad model is visually identical to the previous generation, but it has a much faster A12 Bionic processor to make it more future-proofed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MEhLbv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508346"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PcdaHT"&gt;If you’re in need of speedy portable storage, SanDisk’s Extreme 1TB NVMe USB-C SSD is down to the same price we saw during Black Friday. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1727920735101244007" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GTYFC37/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; offer it for $140, down from the $160 price it has been selling for in late 2020. Though it’s designed for USB-C devices like laptops and phones, it has a USB Type-A adapter that makes it a good option for gaming consoles and other devices alike. What sets it apart is that it features IP55 dust and water resistance and drop protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2WuLHs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10257048"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="NP06Pp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="fIGwxB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>11 great apps ready for your new 2020 M1 Mac</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The new MacBook Air with the M1 chip" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CNGYlf2Kg4I8qzyZj5Qg1fwiaB8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68592449/vpavic_4291_20201113_0366.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ajXKN7"&gt;This year marked the introduction of the first Macs to be powered by Apple’s own silicon instead of Intel chips. As is evidenced by our reviews of the M1 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21334538"&gt;13-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21334087"&gt;Mac mini&lt;/a&gt;, these machines are incredibly powerful and offer wicked fast performance. This is especially true for apps that are designed to run natively on them and take full advantage of Apple’s latest technologies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X7tLg8"&gt;So in that vein, this year’s Mac apps list is going to focus on some of the software that has already been optimized for this new era of Apple hardware. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/27/21029022/best-macos-apps-apple-mac-macbook-air-pro-airmail-alfred-bear-lastpass-vlc"&gt;Last year’s picks&lt;/a&gt; remain just as relevant and useful today if you’re on an Intel machine. But if you’ve been gifted (or are gifting yourself) one of these new speed-demon Macs, these are a few great ways of sampling what they can do.&lt;/p&gt;

(Note: pricing was accurate at the time of publishing but may change.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IFe8Ld"&gt;Pixelmator Pro&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Pixelmator Pro " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZS6AcOBgHUzyazV96I-BgqY3pT4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22182410/Screen_Shot_2020_12_18_at_10.58.41_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pixelmator Pro &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PlFLZ4"&gt;Pixelmator Pro is one of the very best image editing apps for the Mac. It has the usual set of RAW editing tools, presets, sophisticated layer editing, and photo filters, and makes it easy to control every detail of your images. What sets Pixelmator Pro apart are the automatic adjustments it can make through a machine learning algorithm that has been trained with over 20 million photos. The latest update also allows greater customizability over the interface, letting you put everything where it makes the most sense for your workflow. And in a world where many creative apps demand a subscription, I really appreciate the one-time $19.99 price for everything this app gives you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNbmC8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pixelmator/id924695435#?platform=ipad"&gt;Pixelmator Pro’s iPad app&lt;/a&gt; ($4.99) is also wonderful — especially if you like retouching things with your Apple Pencil, which is how I edit many of my review photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="etmcBy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Pixelmator Pro","description":"$19.99 from the Mac App Store","label":"Download now","url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pixelmator-pro/id1289583905?mt=12"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="Dk9WY2"&gt;Lightroom&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Lightroom " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PEzswLv5wFmUXgSEKuA0K2-EeB0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22182853/Screen_Shot_2020_12_18_at_1.13.30_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Lightroom&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vDMkc8"&gt;Lightroom is the first of Adobe’s hugely popular apps to be optimized for Apple’s M1 silicon. And for many people, it's the default choice for editing and organizing their photo collection. Now the app has been updated to leverage the power of Apple’s M1 chip to make that editing go even quicker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3YLnQn"&gt;Keep in mind this is the regular version of Lightroom; Lightroom Classic doesn’t run natively on M1, but Adobe says there are no known issues running it through Rosetta 2 translation. In my experience, Lightroom Classic feels very similar to its performance on Intel Macs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o6J1YX"&gt;A native M1 version of Photoshop is set to follow sometime next year, but Adobe hasn’t given release time frames for other apps such as Premiere Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="xJp0oq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Adobe Lightroom","description":"Free from the Mac App Store (Creative Cloud subscription required)","label":"Download now","url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adobe-lightroom/id1451544217?mt=12"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside id="j6CMDL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Adobe Creative Cloud","description":"$52.99 monthly from Adobe","label":"Buy now","url":"https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="Edml5i"&gt;Google Chrome and Firefox&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google Chrome" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zGnFOzQ5rVY9bTiNXOSsWHecNdo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22182877/Screen_Shot_2020_12_18_at_1.21.37_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Chrome&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xiLzgf"&gt;Two major browsers, Chrome and Firefox, have already been updated to run natively on M1 Macs, so you shouldn’t encounter any issues or irregular performance drops when using either. In the case of Chrome, just be sure that you select “Mac with Apple chip” when downloading — otherwise you’ll end up installing the Intel version, which will still run, but not as efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J6SyCP"&gt;Microsoft Edge currently has M1 support in its beta channel, so that shouldn’t be too far off either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="QCabtd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Google Chrome","description":"Free from Google","label":"Download now","url":"https://www.google.com/chrome/?brand=FHFK&amp;amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAw_H-BRD-ARIsALQE_2ND819UNQ6VlYZ_UVfDnaN_ywpppicn_jldXcokaYMSIu7HhspUrQ8aAuauEALw_wcB&amp;amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside id="UBYNPr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Firefox","description":"Free from Mozilla","label":"Download now","url":"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/mac/"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="037D3q"&gt;Fantastical&lt;/h2&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Fantastical&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="P5SNFk"&gt;If Apple’s built-in Calendar app isn’t doing it for you, then Fantastical might be the more advanced alternative you’re looking for. Its natural language parser can turn normal sentences about your plans into a perfectly formatted appointment entry. You can set your calendar view in exactly the way you want, and Fantastical also has widgets that you can pop into your Mac’s “Today” sidebar. There is a basic free version; the Premium version, which starts at $4.99 a month, offers additional features such as the ability to add tasks, full screen views, and calendar syncing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="lY1cvQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Fantastical","description":"Free on the Mac App Store","label":"Download now","url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fantastical-calendar-tasks/id975937182?mt=12"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="uQ3zEL"&gt;Microsoft 365&lt;/h2&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft 365 &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XBtQ6B"&gt;Microsoft has quickly updated its entire Mac suite to fully optimize Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Outlook, and OneNote for M1. So you should notice very speedy performance when doing work with any of them. I’m sure many people will prefer these over Apple’s own productivity apps like Pages and Numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="5texCt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Microsoft 365 for iMac","description":"Free from the Mac App Store, Microsoft 365 subscription required","label":"Download now","url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app-bundle/microsoft-365/id1450038993?mt=12"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside id="bZRC5V"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Microsoft 365","description":"Subscription starts at $69.99 / year","label":"Buy now","url":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Fbuy%2Fcompare-all-microsoft-365-products&amp;amp;amp;u1=verge"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="AIQclx"&gt;Twitter&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Twitter" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/APrgxC0dcT7m6Nb1rQKNDcbUhUI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22182834/Screen_Shot_2020_12_18_at_1.07.54_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yZKV46"&gt;Hear me out: the Twitter app for macOS has actually gotten very good. It took some polishing and bug fixes to reach this point, but Twitter for Mac is now full-featured, responsive, and not nearly as crash-prone as before. If you haven’t given Twitter’s native app a chance yet, now’s a great time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lN9OXq"&gt;If you still prefer a third-party app, &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-3-for-twitter/id1384080005?mt=12"&gt;Tweetbot&lt;/a&gt; remains the go-to, and it’s also universal and M1-ready. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Nrc5ot"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Twitter","description":"Free from the Mac App Store","label":"Download now","url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/twitter/id1482454543?mt=12"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="TP4iiV"&gt;iMazing&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="iMazing " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bWvkOX8f9H7V_hIv_S0jrwkU_PU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22182969/imazing.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;iMazing&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FqmSFy"&gt;iMazing is a great device manager for digging into everything residing on your iPhone or iPad. You can create backups (different from the regular Apple ones) and grab your messages, photos, music, and more right off the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NHXlBc"&gt;But it was also discovered soon after the launch of M1 Macs that this software can be used to “side load” and install iPhone apps — even those that have not yet opted in — to macOS. If you’re experimenting with this, just expect that not everything will work flawlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5OePes"&gt;iMazing also recently added the option to clearly see which apps on your system are universal or developed for Intel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ESbd5D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"iMazing","description":"Free trial, personal licenses start at $45","label":"Download now","url":"https://imazing.com"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="QfG3CU"&gt;Bartender&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Bartender " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rIlOpp8PFwhsTPgqIDm6lrhtC2w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22182767/BartenderBar_2x.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Bartender&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="janupr"&gt;If you’ve got a cluttered mess of a menu bar at the top of your Mac’s screen, Bartender can help you bring order to things. A longtime favorite macOS utility of ours, this app lets you neatly hide everything under one menu bar icon to ease up on the chaos. You can also set triggers so that certain icons only show at those times when it makes the most sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="zc3D9b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Bartender","description":"Free trial, $15 to purchase","label":"Download now","url":"https://www.macbartender.com"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="s5j6om"&gt;Neural Mix Pro&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Neural Mix Pro " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YK3pVLjsZatn6NNVAErkRYuBv-E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22182728/neuralmix.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neural Mix Pro &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="V4Wh8G"&gt;Neural Mix Pro is an app that lets you separate the various parts of a song — vocals, instrumentation, and beats — and listen to them individually. You can also change up the tempo of a song without ruining the pitch. A handy tool for DJs and musicians, it also just appeals to my inner music nerd. The end result can still sometimes sound a bit phase-y (like most vocal remover software) and have some artifacts, but it does a better job than other apps I’ve tried for this purpose. Just know that it’s pricey compared to other recommendations here; you’ll have to pay $50 to unlock the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="miRqS8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Neural Mix Pro","description":"Free from Mac App Store, $49.99 to unlock all features","label":"Download now","url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/neural-mix-pro/id1527105121?mt=12"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="unCX7N"&gt;BetterTouchTool&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="BetterTouchTool " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lV8gpwcI-dR-vrSd1qszzN2uDBA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22182913/newui_touchbar_0_5x.dd5346e3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;BetterTouchTool &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ODUJaU"&gt;If you’ve got the new 13-inch MacBook Pro with Apple’s M1 chip, well, that means you’ve also got the love-it-or-hate-it Touch Bar above your keyboard. There are ways of &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-il/guide/mac-help/mchl5a63b060/11.0/mac/11.0"&gt;customizing it to your liking in macOS settings&lt;/a&gt;, but BetterTouchTool is a utility that gives you even greater flexibility over what goes where when using the Touch Bar, allowing you to quickly tap useful shortcuts for your most important apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="rZu8qW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"BetterTouchTool","description":"Free 45-day trial, $8.50 to purchase license","label":"Download now","url":"https://folivora.ai"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Apple Watch leak offers rare glimpse inside ‘Ultra security program’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hJ6xDvcK8RnWY2LKRoPbUs4a1jQ=/23x0:1177x769/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68591953/EqXuTU0XMAE7gPC.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/AppleDemoYT" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dgl2PV"&gt;New images and video purporting to show an Apple Watch prototype, concealed by a security case that resembles a tiny iPod, offer a rare look behind the product-development curtain of the notoriously secretive company built by Steve Jobs. First &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/9/4/20975197/apple-watch-prototype-tiny-ipod-security-case-rumor"&gt;teased a few months ago&lt;/a&gt; by Twitter user &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppleDemoYT"&gt;Apple Demo&lt;/a&gt;, this is our first look at the device turned on and running Apple’s own internal development apps on a pre-watchOS 1.0 software build. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4d5lGV"&gt;The video starts by showing what appears to be the original cardboard packaging used to deliver the prototype hardware to testers. “This product is classified as Apple Confidential and is designated an ‘Ultra’ security program,” reads the label. “This prototype MUST be returned when recalled or when your,” says the labeling before being obscured to hide the origins of the device. A sticker on the back of the prototype device itself shows it’s a “PVTe” configuration, which presumably means Production Validation Testing (engineering) in line with language seen on previous Apple development hardware, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/19/18263844/apple-iphone-prototype-m68-original-development-board-red"&gt;leaked EVT board for the original iPhone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_UgFiIdYthbyTUri0Q3neG8-EMg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22202075/CONFIDENTIAL.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/AppleDemoYT" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The original cardboard packaging used to ship the prototype hardware to testers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mDsr6Y"&gt;When the touchscreen device is turned on, we can see that it’s configured to show Apple’s own internal apps. One is the “Lisa tester,” identified with an icon of Lisa Simpson but likely a tribute to Jobs’ daughter and namesake of Apple’s Lisa computer — one of the first computers to feature a GUI interface. The app lets testers tweak the UI elements of the prototype Watch. The “Springboard zoom” app found inside the Lisa tester is very similar to the original watchOS home screen that shipped on the first Apple Watch in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="owrfCR"&gt;There’s no Digital Crown for navigation. Instead, buttons along the right side of the case can be used for home and power. The Home button on the front and what appear to be volume up/down buttons on the left are never shown being used and might not be functional. When clicking into settings, the device reports that it hasn’t received FCC approval for sales, adding further confirmation of its prototype status. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XDtg6TUcRZrFFGaioEH528X3sdE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22202077/EqNaCxJXUAIB_DN.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/AppleDemoYT" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “Lisa tester” is accessible via the Lisa Simpson icon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fIT3EZ"&gt;Assuming the prototype is real — and it definitely seems that way — then it’s a remarkable example of a pre-production Apple device we were never meant to see.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s new ‘QNED’ TVs will have up to nearly 30,000 tiny LEDs behind the screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TCVKEeqJNBCtuKInA9OdnPpvRWA=/88x0:1882x1196/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68591325/LG_QNED_grab.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG’s new QNED TV uses Mini LEDs as the light source.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XGvhhb"&gt;LG might be the company that’s most synonymous with OLED TVs, but tonight it’s announcing what to expect from its LCD-based sets in 2021. Like other manufacturers including TCL have already done (and &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/excited-first-samsung-mini-led-tvs-are-just-around-the-corner/"&gt;Samsung is expected to soon join in on&lt;/a&gt;), LG is adopting Mini LED technology for its premium LCD 8K and 4K TVs coming next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4maltP"&gt;LG says Mini LED allows for “a giant leap forward in LCD TV picture quality.” The best LCD TVs today have what’s called “full-array local dimming,” where LEDs — in some cases hundreds of them — serve as the backlighting behind the screen. These can be controlled in zones, and each zone can be dimmed as appropriate for dark scenes, which helps improve black levels and contrast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HmtF53"&gt;Mini LED changes up the strategy a bit by using much smaller LEDs (but way more of them) for greater contrast than TVs that might top out at a couple hundred dimming zones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TLh67F"&gt;In LG’s case, the company says its new backlight “comprises up to almost 30,000 tiny LEDs that produce incredible peak brightness and a contrast ratio of 1,000,000:1 when paired with up to 2,500 dimming zones and advanced local dimming zones.” The end result is better contrast, more dynamic HDR, and improved color accuracy over the company’s prior LCD sets. Like all of LG’s 2020 flagships, refresh rates of up to 120Hz are supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y6RNTN"&gt;LG has branded these upper-end LCD TVs as “QNED,” with the Q referring to quantum dot color and the N presumably standing for LG’s “NanoCell” branding. It comes off a little awkward — especially since TV shoppers will have to contend with a mix of OLED, QLED, and QNED TVs when at their local Best Buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vaUQE7"&gt;The closest comparison for LG’s QNED TVs would be &lt;a href="https://www.tcl.com/us/en/products/home-theater/8-series"&gt;something like TCL’s 8 Series&lt;/a&gt;, which contains 25,000 LEDs in around 1,000 control zones. (LG says the QNED will come in sizes up to 86 inches, which is the one I’m guessing those earlier numbers come from.) TCL’s 6 Series also uses Mini LEDs, though the total number is much lower than the pricey 8 Series.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eKQT1XArFgVCa3K1JEqmthTKZDQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22201617/Screen_Shot_2020_12_28_at_9.02.59_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TCL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shrinking the LEDs allows TV makers to use many more of them for greater contrast and better blacks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uyyZJ8"&gt;But as the leading OLED TV brand, LG is being careful to underline that OLED is still where the absolute best picture can be had — even with all these advancements on the LCD side. 2020 saw Vizio enter the OLED TV field and try to undercut LG on price, but LG isn’t about to easily give up its position at the top. (Sony also makes high-end OLEDs; all three companies use panels from LG Display.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KXiZoZ"&gt;Last, don’t make the mistake of mixing up Mini LED with MicroLED. Think of Mini LED as another evolution of LCD TVs, whereas &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166062/samsung-110-inch-microled-4k-tv-announced-features"&gt;MicroLED is a more radical upgrade&lt;/a&gt; that removes the backlight from the equation altogether (just like OLED) and combines millions of self-emissive LEDs that only light up when they’re needed. MicroLED TVs are still outrageously expensive, and while we won’t know pricing for LG’s QNED TVs for a few more months, it should be much less eye-popping.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Coinbase halts trading of XRP following SEC suit against Ripple</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cryptocurrency 2018" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VD2hgCexv4DyaQhcuJCFJSJoGDk=/3005x0:5000x1330/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68591099/1035974108.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5JQuZf"&gt;Coinbase announced today that it is halting all trades of XRP on its cryptocurrency exchange, according to &lt;a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-will-suspend-trading-in-xrp-on-january-19-2e09652dbf57"&gt;an official blog post&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/coinbase-suspends-xrp-trading"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coindesk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Certain kind of trades became restricted today, and the full suspension will go into place January 19th, 2021 at 10AM PT. Coinbase is the largest cryptocurrency exchange, and suspending a currency like XRP naturally casts doubt on the currency’s future, even before the SEC lawsuit over it is settled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qDQK9S"&gt;Coinbase says it made the decision to suspend XRP “in light” of the suit the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed against XRP’s original creator, Ripple. With the suspension in place, people will no longer be able to trade XRP on Coinbase, though they will still be able to deposit and withdraw from their XRP wallets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ACHqmx"&gt;In the suit that started it all, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22196064/ripple-sec-cryptocurrency-security-currency-xrp"&gt;the SEC’s main concern is what an XRP actually is&lt;/a&gt;. The SEC claims XRP is a security and should be treated as such. That means Ripple’s former CEO and current CEO should have been responsible for disclosing a variety of additional information necessary to access the risks of XRP before anyone invested. Ripple, of course, believes the opposite. In Ripple’s opinion, XRP is a currency, and so it doesn’t fall under the jurisdiction of the SEC. For more on why it matters what XRP is called, check out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22196064/ripple-sec-cryptocurrency-security-currency-xrp"&gt;my colleague Liz Lopatto’s piece&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8FwZLw"&gt;Coinbase is the highest-profile exchange to suspend XRP, but other exchanges like &lt;a href="https://www.bitstamp.net/article/xrp-trading-and-deposits-be-halted-us-customers/"&gt;Bitstamp&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://blog.okcoin.com/2020/12/28/suspension-of-xrp-trading-and-deposits-on-okcoin/"&gt;OK Coin&lt;/a&gt; have made similar decisions following the SEC’s legal action. With the simple announcement of a lawsuit, the SEC has already impacted the short-term future of XRP.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google inexplicably takes away wide-angle astrophotography from Pixel phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The regular and ultrawide cameras" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PJxqta9Egd54-qSYt-TzfF1WArQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68591078/akrales_201013_4137_0225.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ILFVCu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514312/google-pixel-5-review-camera-speed-processor-fingerprint"&gt;Pixel 5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514296/google-pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-speed-video"&gt;4a 5G&lt;/a&gt; users can no longer use their ultrawide cameras to take pictures of the stars: Google apparently removed the lens’s astrophotography capabilities with the Google Camera 8.1 update. The feature was a selling point of the Pixel 4, and was available on the regular and telephoto cameras. When the 4a 5G and 5 were announced with new wide-angle lenses, the feature was added to those as well. Now it’s been taken away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vAOoxZ"&gt;The astrophotography feature lets users capture the night sky by pointing their phone up and keeping it still, either by balancing it on a nearby object or putting it on a tripod. The feature is still available on the phones’ other cameras, but if you go to Night Sight mode and switch to the ultrawide camera, you’ll now get a warning saying “Zoom to 1x for astrophotography.” Before the update it would say “Astrophotography on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kQhXLN"&gt;Google didn’t respond to our request for comment asking why it had made the change, but it did update its &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googlecamera/answer/9708795"&gt;low-light photography support document&lt;/a&gt; to add the following caveat: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="iUEaWQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important&lt;/strong&gt;: On Pixel 4a (5G) and Pixel 5, astrophotography only works on zoom settings equal to or greater than 1x.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="FuOwKU"&gt;Taking a look &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://support.google.com/googlecamera/answer/9708795?hl=en"&gt;at the Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;, we can see that this change occurred some time between November 1st and November 7th. It’s slightly odd timing given that the update wasn’t released until &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/11/12/google-camera-8-1-redesign-older-pixel/"&gt;a couple of days later&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of a forum post comparing the two cameras’ results in astrophotography mode." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wfb47QYI6FZzfUdkNLdLBexrYEQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22201553/Screen_Shot_2020_12_28_at_5.18.58_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Google Pixel Phone forum user’s posted comparisons of the ultrawide (top) and standard angle lenses shooting in astrophotography mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GkZWAI"&gt;For an explanation as to why the feature may have been cut, you can check out &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/83061074?hl=en"&gt;this thread on Google’s Pixel Phone Help forum&lt;/a&gt;. It has examples from two users, showing the results astrophotography mode produced on the Pixel 5’s regular camera, compared to what the ultrawide lens put out. I’ll let you judge the pictures for yourself. The forum post, however, is another bit of timing weirdness — it was made days after the update removing the feature had already started rolling out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HT4rtz"&gt;Given that the update was out for a month and a half before most people really started noticing that the feature had been removed, it may be obvious why Google thought it could get away without mentioning it in the changelog. Even if it’s a feature that won’t be missed by many, it still stands as a reminder that software features used to advertise a phone may be subject to change (just like the Pixel’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562908/google-future-pixel-phone-no-unlimited-photos-storage-confirmed"&gt;unlimited original quality storage in Google Photos&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Your car may be recording more data than you know</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OtxG6atqyJobMoGrfUbU_73N17Q=/0x0:3120x2080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68590524/DSCF1984_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6j1vbE"&gt;When we think about privacy and who can access our location data, we’re often &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/19/21029992/smartphone-location-tracking-legal-technology-privacy-new-york-times"&gt;focusing on our phones&lt;/a&gt;, and not on the machine that actually takes us places: our car. A &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/snitches-wheels-police-turn-car-data-destroy-suspects-alibis-n1251939"&gt;recent report from NBC News&lt;/a&gt; goes into just how much data is collected by our vehicles, and how it can be used by police and criminals alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N5Urso"&gt;Your car, depending on how new it is and what capabilities it has, could be collecting all sorts of data without your knowledge — including location data, when its doors were opened, and even recordings of your voice. The NBC article uses the example of Joshua Wessel, a man who’s been charged with murder because the victim’s truck has a recording of his voice at the time of the killing. The report also looks at a company called Berla Corp., which has built a business out of extracting that data on behalf of police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kRxXKD"&gt;In broad strokes, it’s hard to guarantee any kind of data protection, simply because cars collect so much sensitive data. Berla’s software boasts the ability to read the unique IDs of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices that have connected to a car’s infotainment system, as well as call logs, contacts, and text messages. But infotainment data isn’t all it can read — it can also look at the logs kept by the car’s internal computer, revealing when specific doors were opened, as well as providing a location log from its built-in GPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VKZeNP"&gt;It’s not just police that are able to get at this information. NBC mentions an Australian man &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-06/ract-employee-pleads-guilty-to-using-app-to-stalk-ex-girlfriend/11678980"&gt;who used an app to access live data from his ex-girlfriend’s Land Rover&lt;/a&gt;. Not only was he able to access live information about the car, he was also able to control it, remotely turning it on and off and opening windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7j5MSu"&gt;I’ve seen firsthand how people don’t think about all the information their car keeps. I recently bought a used one, and it turned out that the dealership hadn’t wiped any of the previous owner’s information. I could’ve easily seen their phone number and home address if I wanted (and I had to see what they had named their phone in order to delete it from the system). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wpm5WK"&gt;The heart of the problem is that we’re sharing our private data with more and more devices, and the systems we rely on to keep that data safe are getting more complex. If we really want to deal with the issue, we may have to take a hard look at our cars, and start thinking about how much data they really need.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>In 2023, you won’t be able to fly most drones in the US without broadcasting your location</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mhqij0APxyjLbj5N5qjzss8HxNc=/0x0:2200x1467/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68590221/DJI_Phantom_3_Skyscraper.0.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GggEW5"&gt;If you intend to fly a drone in the US, you’re going to want to pay attention: &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=25541"&gt;the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) just issued&lt;/a&gt; the single biggest set of changes to US drone law since the agency first took an interest in the technology. With the proper license, you’ll soon be able to fly at night and over people. But the biggest change is this: in 2023, it may be illegal for you to fly some drones &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt; unless you retrofit them with their own broadcasting equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tw76Yi"&gt;In 2022, the US government will require every new mass-produced drone weighing over 0.55 pounds (0.25 kg) to broadcast your location — and I do mean your location, not just the location of your drone. You’ll also be broadcasting an identification number that law enforcement can cross-reference with your registration number, as well as your drone’s speed and altitude. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UmERIS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The FAA is casting it as a digital license plate&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HZIrov"&gt;It’s all part of a new “Remote ID” standard designed to give the FAA and law enforcement a handle on what’s actually flying around in the skies, and it makes sense we might want something like that, considering &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/register_drone/"&gt;the current system&lt;/a&gt; only requires you to slap a sticker on your drone that nobody’s going to be able to see while it’s flying through the air. This way, law enforcement can theoretically figure out who’s flying any given drone dangerously and shut them down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PO5vaL"&gt;But the Remote ID rule doesn’t just apply to brand-new drones: in 2023; it’ll be illegal to fly your existing drones without that same broadcast. There’s no grandfathering clause for older drones, no exemption for home-built racing drones, and it doesn’t matter whether you’re flying it for fun or even just flying it indoors. You’ll either need to retrofit it with a new broadcast module or only fly it in a specially designated drone flying zone called an “FAA-Recognized Identification Area,” according to the new rules. No such areas yet exist — the FAA will be accepting applications for the new zones in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iPGfcc"&gt;It’s also noteworthy the FAA isn’t saying &lt;em&gt;precisely how &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;how far&lt;/em&gt; these drones need to broadcast their identity, largely leaving it up to manufacturers to figure out the best way to do so over the next 18 to 20 months, which is when new drones sold in the US will have to comply. “At this time, no means of compliance have been FAA-approved,” writes a spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RETcYc"&gt;For a DJI-style drone that already packs plenty of technology and already connects to your smartphone, it might theoretically be as easy as sending an additional signal every so often, but it depends on what the FAA decides to approve in the end. DJI declined to comment for this story, which makes me wonder if there’s some wrinkle I’m missing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="220vtP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What does “broadcast” mean? TBD&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aDCkam"&gt;It is worth noting that while &lt;a href="https://content.dji.com/we-strongly-support-drone-remote-id-but-not-like-this/"&gt;DJI railed against the FAA’s original proposal&lt;/a&gt; that might have required every drone to broadcast their Remote ID over the internet, the final rules explicitly don’t require an internet connection, and suggest that manufacturers might simply use short-range Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Aw6Zs"&gt;Here’s self-flying drone maker Skydio’s statement: “We are reviewing the FAA’s new rule on remote identification, which comes into effect in roughly 30 months. There is no immediate impact on Skydio customers. We are working closely with the FAA and taking steps to ensure that our current and future products will be in compliance with the new framework.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EP709d"&gt;If it does prove difficult to add these broadcasts. or if people become worried about revealing their location, it could change the way drones are made and sold. Companies like DJI already try to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21550181/dji-mavic-mini-2-drone-4k-price-release-date-battery-life"&gt;keep some drones under the 0.55-pound weight limit&lt;/a&gt; so buyers don’t have to legally register them with the FAA. Now, more drones are likely to follow suit, and manufacturers of cheaper flying toys might think twice about crossing that weight limit as well. Even racing drones designed to shed as much weight as possible may now need to factor a possible Remote ID transmitter into their build. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yxZM3q"&gt;And just because you’ve got a Remote ID transmitter doesn’t mean you can take an eye off  your drone, by the way. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21505064/faa-visual-line-of-sight-skydio-2-waiver-ncdot-chula-vista"&gt;The visual line of sight rule&lt;/a&gt; still applies. “Persons operating a drone with a remote ID broadcast module must be able to see their drone at all times during flight,” writes an FAA spokesperson, who also confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that there’s no exemption for home-built drones. “[FAA-Recognized Identification Areas] are the only locations unmanned aircraft (drones and radio-controlled model airplanes) may operate without broadcasting remote ID message elements without other authorization from the FAA,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f9ibgH"&gt;If you’re a professional, licensed drone operator, there is some very intriguing and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/15/18183830/faa-drone-regulations-usa-crowds-night"&gt;long-awaited&lt;/a&gt; news today alongside the Remote ID rule, though: the FAA has decided to finally allow you to fly drones over people, at night, and in some cases even over moving vehicles, without applying for a special exemption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IsfOWb"&gt;Flying at night requires additional training and anti-collision lights “that can be seen for 3 statute miles and have a flash rate sufficient to avoid a collision.” Flying over people depends on how dangerous your drone is in terms of weight and sharp propeller blades. There are four categories of drone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="srK1x7"&gt;Category 1 eligible small unmanned aircraft must weigh less than 0.55, including everything on board or otherwise attached, and contain no exposed rotating parts that would lacerate human skin. No FAA-accepted Means of Compliance (MOC) or Declaration of Compliance (DOC) required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lm0rpG"&gt;Category 2 eligible small unmanned aircraft must not cause injury to a human being that is equivalent to or greater than the severity of injury caused by a transfer of 11 foot-pounds of kinetic energy upon impact from a rigid object, does not contain any exposed rotating parts that could lacerate human skin upon impact with a human being, and does not contain any safety defects. Requires FAA-accepted means of compliance and FAA-accepted declaration of compliance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KsBjo7"&gt;Category 3 eligible small unmanned aircraft must not cause injury to a human being that is equivalent to or greater than the severity of injury caused by a transfer of 25 foot-pounds of kinetic energy upon impact from a rigid object, does not contain any exposed rotating parts that could lacerate human skin upon impact with a human being, and does not contain any safety defects. Requires FAA-accepted means of compliance and FAA-accepted declaration of compliance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iPxRI5"&gt;Category 4 eligible small unmanned aircraft must have an airworthiness certificate issued under Part 21 of FAA regulations. Must be operated in accordance with the operating limitations specified in the approved Flight Manual or as otherwise specified by the Administrator. The operating limitations must not prohibit operations over human beings. Must have maintenance, preventive maintenance, alterations, or inspections performed in accordance with specific requirements in the final rule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="SbT4RN"&gt;You can’t fly a small Category 1 or Category 2 drone over people unless it’s got a Remote ID transmitter, while Category 3 can’t be flown over “open-air assemblies of human beings,” only private areas where people are either under covered structures or have been warned that a drone will be flying over. Regardless, you’ll need an FAA Part 107 permit to fly at night or over people at all, which means taking a test and getting licensed. These specific rules should go into effect in about two months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0hkpKq"&gt;Here’s &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/news/media/attachments/OOP_Executive_Summary.pdf"&gt;the FAA’s executive summary (PDF) on flying over people&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/news/media/attachments/RemoteID_Final_Rule.pdf"&gt;full text of the Remote ID rule (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; so you can read for yourself. The FAA has addressed loads of public comments and suggestions in there, so it’s worth a read if you’re wondering why they chose to go this way.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok’s one-night Ratatouille musical will star some of Broadway’s biggest names</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lDIAuKEWkY38ZWqyV-COS0kHjoU=/44x0:607x375/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68590199/Seaview_Work_Featured_Images_Ratatouille_650x375.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HMOKY8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ratatouille: The TikTok Musical&lt;/em&gt; has some big Broadway talent on board for its January 1st streaming performance. Adam Lambert, Wayne Brady, Kevin Chamberlin, Mary Testa, and Priscilla Lopez will play key roles, with Tituss Burgess starring as Remy, the sophisticated rat who loves fine food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qgye8m"&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;COULDN’T GET ANY BETTER! &lt;a href="https://t.co/UeJdEqR70z"&gt;https://t.co/UeJdEqR70z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Emily Jacobsen (@anEmilyJacobsen) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/anEmilyJacobsen/status/1343618164018589698?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 28, 2020&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TSEsFR"&gt;The one-time only performance will benefit the Actors Fund. Based on the 2007 Disney-Pixar movie &lt;em&gt;Ratatouille&lt;/em&gt;, the musical came together on TikTok, with creators composing songs based on the original film, building the “show” piece by piece. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/anEmilyJacobsen/status/1336789469018681344"&gt;Emily Jacobsen&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@e_jaccs/video/6859521038418447622?referer_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.playbill.com%2F&amp;amp;referer_video_id=6859521038418447622"&gt;@e_jaccs&lt;/a&gt;) made the original “&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@e_jaccs/video/6859521038418447622?referer_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.playbill.com%2F&amp;amp;referer_video_id=6859521038418447622"&gt;Remy the Ratatouille&lt;/a&gt;” song for TikTok, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/danieljmertz/status/1336765015911768069"&gt;composer Daniel Mertzlufft&lt;/a&gt; created the very Broadway-esque &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@danieljmertzlufft/video/6885475193410620678"&gt;arrangement of Jacobsen’s song&lt;/a&gt; that really started the ball rolling for a full-blown show. Honestly it’s so good.&lt;/p&gt;
