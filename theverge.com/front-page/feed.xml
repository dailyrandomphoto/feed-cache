    <title>Uber Eats will let you order weed in Ontario but won’t deliver</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Uber Company" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5l6L9Bcp-4yVcRBZQ2QXBTYHLuU=/0x0:2362x1575/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70177648/1232204951.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fGxAcj"&gt;Uber is &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cannabis-retailer-tokyo-smoke-and-uber-eats-form-innovative-partnership-to-offer-cannabis-online-order-and-pickup-in-canada-301429818.html"&gt;partnering&lt;/a&gt; with a cannabis retailer in Canada to allow cannabis purchases via its Uber Eats food delivery platform. The arrangement does not include delivery of weed orders, however, but makes it possible for users in Ontario to order products from Tokyo Smoke in a dedicated section on the Uber Eats app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BLFrBt"&gt;For customers in Ontario, in the Uber Eats app, select either the “cannabis” category or search for “Tokyo Smoke.” After confirming their age, the customer is directed to the menu of a Tokyo Smoke store in the area to place their order, which Uber says will be filled within an hour. The consumer then picks up their order at the Tokyo Smoke store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z09ymZ"&gt;Uber CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22380003/uber-weed-deliveries-cannabis-ceo"&gt;Dara Khosrowshahi said in April&lt;/a&gt; that the company would take a look at cannabis delivery “when the road is clear.” In February, the ride-hailing giant acquired Boston-based alcohol delivery service Drizly for $1.1 billion. But Lantern, a cannabis delivery service Drizly launched in May 2020, was not part of that deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gnMUdb"&gt;The companies did not mention plans to expand into other Canadian provinces, but Uber Eats head of communications for delivery Meghan Casserly&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;confirmed that the new arrangement with Tokyo Smoke is “pickup only.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AFWkgi"&gt;Canada &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/cannabis-changed-canada-1.6219493"&gt;legalized recreational cannabis in October 2018&lt;/a&gt;, and 2021 cannabis sales there are &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cannabis-sales-projected-to-reach-28-billion-for-us-in-2022-headset-launches-market-forecasts-for-us-and-canada-301268415.html"&gt;predicted to reach $4 billion&lt;/a&gt;. In the US, recreational cannabis is legal in 18 states, and medical marijuana use is legal in some three dozen states. However, marijuana remains illegal at the federal level, despite repeated attempts to decriminalize it. In July, Sens. Cory Booker (D-NJ), Chuck Schumer (D-NY), and Ron Wyden (D-OR) released a discussion draft of legislation that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576119/democrats-new-plan-legalize-marijuana-schumer-wyden-booker-senate"&gt;proposed sweeping reform to marijuana policy&lt;/a&gt; in the US. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Analogue Pocket preorders will ship December 13th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Analogue Pocket" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KbkcLpQWhyuwvO8XLomva2GPiRk=/0x334:2000x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70177595/9_Pocket_3_4.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fqHPdx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/16/20906665/analogue-pocket-game-boy-handheld-release-date-price"&gt;Analogue Pocket&lt;/a&gt; preorders will start shipping on December 13th. &lt;a href="https://support.analogue.co/hc/en-us/articles/4414333048333"&gt;In a brief blog post&lt;/a&gt;, Analogue, manufacturers of the retro handheld Pocket, wrote, “Due to unprecedented shipping congestion, your order will ship and be delivered between December 14th - December 30th.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sz6hC7"&gt;If you’re unable to accept delivery during that window, the company also outlined steps you can take to defer shipping until after January 3rd, 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T38K7i"&gt;Customers who preordered the Pocket will receive an email with more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SR8kpv"&gt;The Analogue Pocket, which has the ability to play cartridges from the Game Boy family and the Sega Game Gear, was delayed numerous times due to global electronics component shortages brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. Other handhelds like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774888/steam-deck-delayed-two-months-february-2022-launch-shipping"&gt;Steam Deck&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22776649/panic-playdate-delay-2022-handheld-battery-chip-shortage"&gt;Playdate&lt;/a&gt; faced similar delays, with neither having a firm release date in sight. The handheld was originally slated for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/27/21337403/analogue-pocket-release-date-delay-pre-order"&gt;a 2020 release&lt;/a&gt; before being pushed to May 2021, then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22361017/analogue-pocket-handheld-delayed-electronic-component-shortage"&gt;October 2021&lt;/a&gt;. In September, the company stated the Pocket would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667465/analogue-pocket-preorders-delay-december-2021"&gt;finally start shipping in December&lt;/a&gt;, but no firm date was announced. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku lines up more than 50 new shows for its free channel</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Roku Products Ahead Of Earnings Figures" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2oNQjxHDj4ZBkcFMgP8gTCsTci0=/0x2:4000x2669/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70177519/1232708607.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y42fxx"&gt;Roku serves as a gateway to access various streaming services, but now, a report from &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/roku-plans-to-develop-more-than-50-original-shows-in-next-two-years-11637326800"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reveals that the service wants to develop over 50 original series in the next two years, expanding the original content that it already has on its free Roku Channel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HxZXPw"&gt;As noted by the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, 155 million people have access to Roku devices, and about half tune into the Roku Channel, a hub for ad-supported TV shows, movies, and live news. The service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395533/roku-originals-quibi-content-tv"&gt;added Roku Originals&lt;/a&gt; to the Roku Channel earlier this year, a large portion of which actually come from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21527197/quibi-streaming-service-mobile-shutting-down-end-katzenberg"&gt;Quibi, the short-lived streaming service&lt;/a&gt; that shut down last year. Apparently, the set of 50 new shows also include some of the service acquired from Quibi that never premiered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VYJKun"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Roku could spend $500,000 to $5 million for scripted episodes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LmVmPd"&gt;Roku’s push to produce its own original content likely has something to do with boosting ad sales on the Roku Channel, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22308141/roku-nielsen-video-advertising-business-acquisition-linear-streaming-tv"&gt;ads are one of Roku’s main sources of revenue&lt;/a&gt;. According to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, Roku sells 100 percent of its ads on the Roku Channel, as opposed to selling just 30 percent within other apps. Aside from ads, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22773073/vizio-acr-advertising-inscape-data-privacy-q3-2021"&gt;Roku rakes in an average of $40.10 / month per user&lt;/a&gt; and recorded 56.4 million active accounts in its most recent earnings report (&lt;a href="https://image.roku.com/c3VwcG9ydC1B/3Q21-Shareholder-Letter-Final.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;). The service also makes money through the sale of its Roku TVs and streaming devices, earning a total of $97.4 million last quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ctryCo"&gt;Roku remains tightlipped on its planned budget for its new shows, vaguely telling the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; that it will be close to what typical cable shows spend. However, sources close to the matter informed the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; that the amount could be anywhere from $250,000 to $750,000 for one unscripted episode or $500,000 to $5 million for scripted episodes. This is significantly lower when compared to original content from other platforms — for reference, &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1249573/most-expensive-netflix-original-series-production-cost-per-episode/"&gt;Netflix spends&lt;/a&gt; around $12 million per episode of &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; and $13 million per episode of &lt;em&gt;The Crown&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0LLWYU"&gt;In February of this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285819/roku-original-content-job-listing-plan-original-shows-movies"&gt;Roku posted a job listing for a production attorney&lt;/a&gt; that helps out with Roku’s “original episodic and feature length productions,” suggesting that Roku has been planning a dive into the entertainment industry for a while. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22664322/roku-originals-first-film-zoeys-extraordinary-christmas-release-date"&gt;Roku’s first original movie&lt;/a&gt; is set to debut on December 1st, titled &lt;em&gt;Zoey’s Extraordinary Christmas&lt;/em&gt; — a spinoff of the NBC show &lt;em&gt;Zoey’s Extraordinary Playlist&lt;/em&gt;. As the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; notes, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/roku-children-ruin-everything-streaming-schitts-creeks-1235090626/"&gt;Roku also acquired the rights to &lt;em&gt;Children Ruin Everything&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a comedy series produced by &lt;em&gt;Schitt’s Creek&lt;/em&gt; producer Kurt Smeaton, and is planning to add it to the platform in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge’s 2021 holiday gift guide for working from home</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bH6jbLi3TDyvU9UoR_NtRR4DuJc=/0x2:2048x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70177496/Work_from_home.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Great gifts to outfit the home office of a working professional&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="8r44SV"&gt;Many of us have been working from home for more than a year and a half, and some of us will continue to do so — maybe forever. That said, buying a gift for a friend or loved one who works from home can be tricky. One person might prioritize tech, while another might care more about plant life and energizing lighting. If you need some help, however, you’ve come to the right place. Here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;we have some expertise in working from home, and we have some great ideas for you to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x3edj4"&gt;What makes the ideal home office? Well, the right tech, like the Satechi USB-C Multi-Port Adapter ($80), is essential to getting work done. But comfort is also important, which is why we’ve included a standing desk and an ergonomic chair that can last for years. And if your gift recipient is still stuck working in their dining room or on their couch, a modest gift like a LapGear lap desk ($30) or Nulaxy laptop stand ($25) may be all they need to finally relieve some neck or hand strain. We’ve got ideas big and small, both for physical comfort and a sound state of mind.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Clever gift ideas to satisfy the pickiest of dads&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="SIITPe"&gt;It’s not an easy task to do holiday shopping for the people who you’re closest to, especially for the dad in your life. Not all dads are the same, mind you, but they can be tough to please in the gift department because they might already buy themselves everything they want, thus keeping a clean slate of a wishlist at all times. Or, maybe they’re tough because what they find enjoyment in is really niche, and you fear that you won’t get them something they’ll actually enjoy. No one wants that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aG7bGi"&gt;We at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; can certainly relate to those feelings, but we think we can assuage most of those concerns with the list of gift ideas below. Most of our staff chipped ideas into this gift guide, which encompasses a range of tastes, hobbies, and aesthetic preferences. No matter the kind of dad you’re buying for, there should be something in here that’ll remind them, at the very least, that you’re trying to make sure they stay cool.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Apple Watch SE costs just $219 at Amazon and Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7vGNEa1PrOUMerlqjGUsjdcDgiM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70177423/dseifert_200930_4218_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="82lp7r"&gt;A proverbial tidal wave of deals crashed down this morning, heralding the beginning of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;Black Friday week&lt;/a&gt;. As I searched for deals to include in this roundup, I kept finding one after the other that was better. If you think these are good, consider acting fast, as it’s impossible to tell if they’ll stick around all week or if they’re just a flash in the pan. The very best discount that kicked off recently is a big $60 discount on the Apple Watch SE (40mm, GPS) at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2ht3XXw2g" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-GPS-40mm-Starlight/dp/B09G9FS5YN/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Regularly selling for $279, it’s just $219 — the lowest price yet. If you want the larger 44mm-sized model, it’s $249 instead of $309. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3pUJv7ioh" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;You can shop all of the sizes and colorways right here at Best Buy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JhOMfR"&gt;We heartily recommend the SE over the Apple Watch Series 3, despite the fact that the Series 3 is seeing tremendous discounts at Walmart (&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-38mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F706203065&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeDealRoundup11222021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it will be just $109 starting tonight&lt;/a&gt;). The Apple Watch SE is considerably faster and more capable, with additional features and more storage to make updating its software far less of a hassle. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kojima Productions launches new division focused on film and TV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iwRPicORdFwXWV7qo-NiBh1iMN4=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70177415/death_stranding_screen_09_ps4_us_28may19.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mmZyn4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt; studio Kojima Productions has announced a brand-new division as it looks beyond video games. No new projects have been announced, but the company says the Los Angeles-based office “will focus on securing opportunities in the film and television space.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eXM7oG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20941606/death-stranding-review-ps4-hideo-kojima"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt; originally launched in 2019&lt;/a&gt; as the first title from renowned &lt;em&gt;Metal Gear&lt;/em&gt; director Hideo Kojima following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/19/9572167/hideo-kojima-leaves-metal-gear-solid-publisher-konami"&gt;his much-publicized departure from Konami&lt;/a&gt;. (It has since been re-released on both the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21322476/death-stranding-pc-port-hide-kojima"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696322/death-stranding-directors-cut-ps5-kojima-3d-audio-dualsense"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt;.) While he’s best known for his work in games, it’s also no secret that Kojima is a huge movie fan, something that often bleeds into his gaming work. &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt; featured the likes of Norman Reedus and Léa Seydoux, and Kojima previously partnered with Guillermo del Toro on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/27/9406669/junji-ito-silent-hills-kojima-del-toro"&gt;a canceled &lt;em&gt;Silent Hill&lt;/em&gt; game&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vEzmkY"&gt;Given this history, a film and TV division makes a lot of sense. “Our new division will take the studio into even more areas that present our creative narratives beyond video games and to open up ways for our fans to communicate and immerse themselves in these spaces,” Kojima Productions business development manager Yoshiko Fukuda said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oh1vMY"&gt;Meanwhile, it’s unclear what the studio’s first post-&lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt; project will be — though you can always check out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/10/18/22732413/hideo-kojima-glasses-sunglasses-collaboration-jean-francois-rey"&gt;these Kojima-designed sunglasses next year.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nreal Light review: Hardware is only half the battle</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Through a glass, darkly&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="pRePsK"&gt;Nreal has sold me on the appeal of watching TV with a pair of glasses, and I wish I could recommend buying the glasses that did it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="WB0Ivg"&gt;Nreal’s Light sunglasses, which Verizon will start selling later this month, are one of only a few consumer-focused augmented reality headsets. They’re an impressive technical feat: small for an AR or VR product, comparatively affordable at $599, and capable of full-fledged mixed reality that projects images into real space, not just a flat heads-up overlay &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/14/18223593/focals-smart-glasses-north-review-specs-features-price"&gt;like the North Focals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pkjd6c"&gt;Unfortunately, Nreal’s software doesn’t fulfill its hardware’s promise. The Light is hampered by a bare-bones control scheme, a patchy app ecosystem, and a general user experience that ranges from undercooked to barely functional. Nreal may well have shown us the future of AR, but it seems disinterested in making the experience very pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AUEIu0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10880044"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SPPrGr"&gt;The Nreal Light is (sort of) a svelter version of the $3,500 Microsoft HoloLens or $2,295 Magic Leap One mixed reality headsets. The device looks like a pair of very large sunglasses with two cameras for spatial tracking embedded in the front. When you plug it into a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789172/nreal-light-mixed-reality-glasses-us-launch-verizon"&gt;supported Samsung or OnePlus&lt;/a&gt; phone’s USB-C port, it projects a slightly transparent image on top of the real world. That could include a flat screen that always stays in the center of your vision, a grid of icons pinned to a specific point in space, or a 3D game board resting on a physical desk. You can control apps by swiping a trackpad on your phone’s screen or aiming it like a remote control to point and click.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yV9f0o"&gt;The Light is only “sort of” like those AR products for two reasons. The first is that Nreal isn’t using the same optics tech as Microsoft or Magic Leap. Those expensive, industrial-grade headsets use something called a waveguide: a thin multilayered lens that sits in front of your eyes, refracting light from a projector. The Nreal Light uses a system &lt;a href="https://kguttag.com/2021/06/01/nreal-teardown-part-1-clones-and-birdbath-basics/"&gt;dubbed birdbath optics&lt;/a&gt;: micro OLED screens whose light is reflected off a mirror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZDOrtQ"&gt;I didn’t have a HoloLens or Magic Leap device for comparison, although I’ve used both in the past. The Light’s 53-degree diagonal field of view is similar to the &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/hololens-2-field-of-view/"&gt;current-generation HoloLens&lt;/a&gt;, and its OLED projection system produces remarkably crisp images. The images fade against midday light or a bright laptop screen, and they almost never look totally opaque, but I could say the same about other headsets’ holograms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Adi Robertson wearing the Nreal Light glasses while holding a carrying case under one arm" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HvIGwL0huoxEgmiqG50-3zYrvG8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23022716/akrales_211116_4879_0102.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The glasses come with a compact black carrying case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SGBnFj"&gt;On the other hand, Nreal Light projections look much less convincingly 3D than HoloLens or Magic Leap images. I never got the uncanny sense that an object was literally resting on the ground or rolling behind a table, something I’ve felt many times with more expensive headsets. The illusion was more like a really high-quality version of the Lenovo Mirage’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/4/17315834/star-wars-jedi-challenges-lenovo-mirage-two-player-lightsaber-duel-update"&gt;augmented reality games&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u0u1rR"&gt;I believe that’s partly due to my second caveat: Nreal isn’t focused on creating immersive experiences or great spatial tracking. My review unit came preinstalled with a smattering of full mixed reality apps alongside a variety of apps (like Wikipedia, YouTube, and some Chinese video portals) you could pin as mixed reality windows. But most of the former were haphazardly designed and barely functional minigames. The tracking cameras are supposed to support hand tracking on top of the phone-based control scheme, but you can’t control the main interface that way, and I couldn’t find any preinstalled mixed reality apps that supported it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Nreal glasses seen from above" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xcRC14_49ZBa-Q_pBam_av4j0BM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23022722/akrales_211116_4879_0360.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “birdbath” optics design requires a thick upper edge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Nreal Light glasses seen from below" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CU2tLtiLUgjPi8wy_OrO2t2sfNI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23022721/akrales_211116_4879_0332.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Swappable nose pieces prop up the lenses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Nebula launcher app for Nreal’s glasses on a OnePlus phone" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n2Z-ufG31YzxRyCLkFiig9f55Sk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23022719/akrales_211116_4879_0304.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A launcher app is required for full mixed reality controls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aqF9IX"&gt;Instead, Nreal seems more interested in giving buyers a private virtual screen — and the results are tantalizingly close to great. Lots of companies, including Meta (formerly Facebook) with its Quest 2, offer to replace your monitor or TV with glasses. The Nreal Light is the first time I’ve ever wanted to take that bargain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iFqObk"&gt;Nreal has eased the biggest pain points of virtual screens, most prominently the awkwardness of wearing one. At 106 grams, the Nreal Light is lighter than even the smallest current-generation VR headsets, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/14/22713276/htc-vive-flow-vr-headset-launch-price-hands-on"&gt;189-gram HTC Vive Flow&lt;/a&gt;. Its design is still front-heavy and thick. But a swappable nose bridge props the lenses at the right distance and angle — which is, sadly, unnaturally far away from your face and nixes any chance of people thinking that you’re wearing normal sunglasses — to display an image clearly. When you’re not using the Light, you can fold them up and put them in a nicely compact case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Rh1pX9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s the rare glasses-style AR / VR headset that stays on my head&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XvdJDN"&gt;I’m a small-headed person who finds most glasses-style headsets nigh-unwearable, but the Light was an exception. It’s infinitely easier to put on or take off than other AR and VR devices, and it stayed on my face with occasional adjustments as long as I didn’t move my head around too quickly. Although the sunglass lenses make everything a bit harder to see, there’s a sense of connection to the outside world that even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590794/oculus-mixed-reality-api-quest-2-development-kit-unity"&gt;VR with passthrough video&lt;/a&gt; can’t get you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4clVbr"&gt;After a little experimentation with the Nreal Light, I could comfortably sit on a couch watching YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338418/dream-smp-youtube-minecraft-fanart-fanfiction-video-edits-fandom"&gt;Dream SMP fandom&lt;/a&gt; recaps while knitting, wear it at my desk while using its Wikipedia app, or slip my phone into my pocket and walk around the kitchen making tea while watching anime. I even took the Light on the subway — I got a lot of funny looks, but the experience was about a million times better than my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/9/9878198/samsung-gear-vr-review-real-world-mainstream"&gt;public transit adventures with a Gear VR&lt;/a&gt; six years ago. Nreal ships the device with a black cover that completely blocks out light, but I much preferred being able to see what was going on around me, especially because the glasses aren’t a substitute for a fuller-featured VR headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="ijFk5h"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10880056"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y77jQB"&gt;This involves some tradeoffs, of course. The projected image wasn’t as rich as I’d have gotten on a physical OLED TV or a monitor. The glasses use small speakers that pipe sound into your ears, and their audio was a bit tinny and not necessarily adequate for a public space like the subway, although it seemed to vary by app. (Weirdly enough, there are no volume buttons on the hardware, only a rocker that changes the screen brightness.) The field of view far exceeds, say, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/6/11376442/microsoft-hololens-holograms-parts-teardown-photos-hands-on"&gt;the original Microsoft HoloLens&lt;/a&gt;, but it still doesn’t extend to your full field of vision. The Light also burned through battery life on the OnePlus 8 5G UW phone Nreal lent me, giving me around three hours of TV viewing between charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tFKmyr"&gt;The biggest problems, however, were software-related. An Nreal launcher app offers two modes: air casting, which mirrors your phone’s screen, and mixed reality, which launches apps pinned in 3D space. This latter mode can’t support the DRM of American streaming apps like Amazon Prime Video and Netflix, so you have to air-cast them — which means you can’t pin the windows in a specific part of your room, use the phone as a pointer controller, or minimize the app on your phone’s screen. Even the fairly wide field of view is a double-edged sword here because it means the images stretch to the very edge of the display, where it’s hard to focus on them. I asked Nreal if there were plans to change this, but spokesperson Angela Lin indicated these apps wouldn’t support mixed reality “for the moment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Adi Robertson wearing the Nreal Light glasses" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uTZfaUtyDM3hLU72VksM60P3Pu8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23022715/akrales_211116_4879_0034.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cameras are embedded in the glasses for spatial tracking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yjMS9M"&gt;Nreal’s limited device support also hampers its system. The Light does work with products besides its handful of supported phones — I plugged it into an older Samsung phone and MacBook Pro — but only as an external monitor right at the center of your vision. That means you can’t do things like pin a second laptop screen on your desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8CCF24"&gt;And even inside mixed reality mode, the phone isn’t a very good controller. There’s no attempt at creating a consistent interface across apps, so practically every third-party mixed reality experience has a different, incredibly clunky set of virtual buttons pinned to the phone-remote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wHEc8n"&gt;Bad software can be fixed after release, unlike bad hardware. But there’s simply no sense that Nreal is aiming for a coherent ecosystem rather than an external monitor that sits flatly over your eyes. And for the latter, you might want to wait for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22700782/nreal-air-smart-ar-glasses-release-date-shipping-countries"&gt;the Nreal Air&lt;/a&gt;, an even smaller headset with no cameras that’s supposed to sell at a far lower price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Adi Robertson holding a OnePlus phone as a controller for the Nreal Light glasses" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6UCgoKHgWKQc7QVjpa6VkEn7Dbw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23022723/akrales_211116_4879_0432.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your phone acts as a remote control in mixed reality mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A6ax0u"&gt;Which is a shame because I can envision an exciting future for the Nreal Light. It’s far more low-key and almost &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt; than anything similar I’ve seen from another company — even Apple with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654606/apple-ar-vr-headset-iphone-wireless-connection-stream-data"&gt;widely leaked AR / VR headset&lt;/a&gt;. With a better interface, I could imagine using it with a wireless keyboard and hand tracking as a laptop replacement. While I’d still feel weird watching a movie with somebody through two pairs of personal glasses, it’s a solid TV substitute if I’m watching something alone — or with another person casually milling around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="b1VCYR"&gt;But most US buyers won’t get enough of what the first-generation Nreal Light is offering. It’s an expensive near-prototype that leaves a lot of obvious low-hanging fruit unpicked, almost certain to either improve with another iteration or get crushed by one of Nreal’s many competitors. And until it can actually replace some of the screens in your life, do you really need another one?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Black Friday deals on noise-canceling headphones 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ymSCVgQ1EyxfS2GWFiLZ64jXkoQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70177196/cwelch_202109_4775_5619.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d5KTAD"&gt;Whether you’re overdue for a new pair or are just trying to cancel out the usual onslaught of holiday music, Black Friday season is a great time to invest in some noise-canceling headphones. You’ll find significant discounts on many of our favorite headphones featured in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;noise-canceling headphones buying guide&lt;/a&gt;. These include picks from Sony, Bose, Apple, Sennheiser, and others. In some cases, these deals will save you $100 or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JKhJxM"&gt;Aside from the steep discounts, another good thing about buying headphones during the holidays is the extended return period at many retailers. That gives you plenty of time to try out your new cans and make sure the sound quality, ANC, comfort, and other factors are all to your liking before you’re stuck with them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="maTlax"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2021: news, deal highlights, and money-saving tips ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22783359/black-friday-2021-news-tips-deals-retailers-cyber-monday"},{"title":"Know the price-matching policies for Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21570383/price-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft"},{"title":"How to find the best deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2021 ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21587765/black-friday-cyber-monday-best-deals-how-to-find"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h1 id="BdzHRb"&gt;Noise-canceling headphones deals&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="zyLNwd"&gt;Sony’s WH-1000XM4 remain our overall pick as the best noise-canceling headphones you can buy today. They’ve got excellent noise cancellation, lively bass-forward sound, and fantastic comfort. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="3mytn2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10875864"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="ApgUlE"&gt;Released only a few months ago, Bose’s QuietComfort 45 headphones mark a return to the company’s classic design that has no equal when it comes to comfort. You can wear these things for hours upon hours without any issues. It also helps that Bose made improvements to sound quality and ANC compared to the QC35 II headphones. The QC45s haven’t really been on sale since their release, so the Black Friday 2021 deals are coming at just the right time. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22698629/bose-quietcomfort-qc-45-headphones-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="D4gpLa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10857708"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="3wgngs"&gt;Apple’s AirPods Max can be had for as low as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Blue/dp/B08PZHYWJS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$439 from Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, down from their hefty $549 standard price. You’ll get that deal on the black, blue, and white colors, though green and pink are a bit higher (but still on sale) at $479.  The AirPods Max justify their price with top-tier sound quality, terrific noise cancellation, great voice call performance, and the usual deep integration with Apple’s ecosystem of devices. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="jCtQQh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10880023"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="pmB83v"&gt;Sennheiser’s Momentum 3 Wireless &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-Momentum-Cancelling-Headphones-Functionality/dp/B07VW98ZKG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;are all the way down to $247.46&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon, saving you over $100 compared to their regular $400 price tag. With a classy, premium look and feel that’s matched by their phenomenal audio quality, the Momentum 3s are perhaps the best choice if you’re focused on sublime sound over everything else. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20843395/sennheiser-momentum-wireless-3-review-release-date-news-specs-features-noise-cancelling-headphones"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Sony has patented its PS5 faceplates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/APrbVV6-0A7GLdJBaD8UoF_s1FQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70177042/vpavic_4278_20201030_0292.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jlFSsl"&gt;Sony has filed a patent for its PS5 faceplates. The &lt;a href="https://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?PageNum=0&amp;amp;docid=D0936149&amp;amp;IDKey=AE3DFAA4B3B6"&gt;design patent&lt;/a&gt; was originally filed just a week before the PS5’s November launch last year, and it was subsequently published in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) on November 16th. It has fueled speculation that Sony will create its own PS5 faceplates or skins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZhLWrx"&gt;The design patent, &lt;a href="https://opattack.com/ps5-covers-and-skins/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;OP Attack&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, comes more than a year after Matt MacLaurin, Sony’s former VP of UX design at PlayStation, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21291288/sony-ps5-software-user-interface-ui-design-dashboard-teaser-video"&gt;previously hinted&lt;/a&gt; at a black version of the PS5 or “a special edition for everyone.” While Sony has created black versions of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22433966/sony-black-red-dualsense-controllers-playstation-5-ps5"&gt;DualSense controller&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675347/sony-pulse-3d-audio-headset-wireless-gaming-midnight-black-color-release-date"&gt;Pulse 3D Audio headset&lt;/a&gt;, the PS5 console remains white for now.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Z6rbc7IhExx2x0Y44CP3suHC80=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22299538/ps5__360__01_fd79c03e79f568f3a5f1969a45374077.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: DBrand&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;DBrand’s previous PS5 faceplates.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Lu9iX2"&gt;Third parties have attempted to fill the black faceplates void, but Sony has threatened legal action. A small company first named PlateStation5 then CustomizeMyPlates was &lt;a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ps5-faceplate-seller-is-now-cancelling-all-orders-following-legal-action-from-sony/"&gt;forced to cancel and refund orders&lt;/a&gt; for black PS5 faceplates last year following legal action from Sony. CustomizeMyPlates returned earlier this year and is &lt;a href="https://www.customizemyplates.com/"&gt;still selling custom plates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TX5WR5"&gt;That legal action didn’t stop &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22279685/matte-black-ps5-faceplates-on-sale-dbrand-sue-us-sony"&gt;DBrand from selling its own matte black faceplates&lt;/a&gt; and even daring Sony to sue. Sony eventually threatened DBrand with legal action, forcing the company to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/16/22728936/dbrand-pulls-ps5-darkplates-from-sale-sony-threatens-legal-action"&gt;pull its faceplates&lt;/a&gt; and replace them days later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22733642/dbrand-new-ps5-darkplates-sony-legal-threats"&gt;with a new design&lt;/a&gt; and a marketing campaign that mocked Sony’s team of lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;
