    <title>Huawei’s P50 announced with Snapdragon 888 and HarmonyOS</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9n20KE"&gt;Huawei has announced its latest flagship phones for the Chinese market, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fconsumer.huawei.com%2Fcn%2Fphones%2Fp50%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F29%2F22598135%2Fhuawei-p50-china-release-date-price-news-features-specs-cameras" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;P50&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fconsumer.huawei.com%2Fcn%2Fphones%2Fp50-pro%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F29%2F22598135%2Fhuawei-p50-china-release-date-price-news-features-specs-cameras" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;P50 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. They’re the company’s first major phones to launch with HarmonyOS, the company’s own-branded mobile operating system, which they pair with Huawei’s typically well-specced cameras, and hardware that includes Qualcomm’s flagship Snapdragon 888 processor in some models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="enbexA"&gt;The launch of the P50 series has come a little later in the year than the P40 did in 2020, thanks to US sanctions which have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/9/21360598/huawei-chips-us-sanctions-trump-china-privacy-smartphone"&gt;seriously impacted&lt;/a&gt; Huawei’s ability to produce new phones, and restricted its ability to buy chips and other components from companies using US tech. When he first teased the phones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22464776/huawei-p50-phone-camera-periscope-telephoto-leica-harmonyos"&gt;last month&lt;/a&gt;, Huawei’s consumer business CEO Richard Yu said that a launch date hadn’t been set at the time “for reasons you are all aware of.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YV6Wqz"&gt;These sanctions mean that like other recent Huawei phones, the P50 series won’t include Google’s apps and services if it ever releases outside of China. In fact, according to Huawei, the P50 doesn’t run Android at all, thanks to its own HarmonyOS software. The extent to which HarmonyOS is actually distinct from Android is a &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/huaweis-harmonyos-will-rollout-to-100-android-models-over-the-next-year/"&gt;point of some contention&lt;/a&gt;, however, following reports that it’s effectively a fork of Android’s open-source code.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Huawei P50.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dOdWfF"&gt;US sanctions have meant that not every P50 uses Huawei’s own Kirin chips. The P50 and one version of the P50 Pro use Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 processor, according to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fconsumer.huawei.com%2Fcn%2Fphones%2Fp50%2Fspecs%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F29%2F22598135%2Fhuawei-p50-china-release-date-price-news-features-specs-cameras" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;spec&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fconsumer.huawei.com%2Fcn%2Fphones%2Fp50-pro%2Fspecs%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F29%2F22598135%2Fhuawei-p50-china-release-date-price-news-features-specs-cameras" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sheets&lt;/a&gt; on the company’s site. Qualcomm was granted permission to sell chips to Huawei &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/14/21565185/us-qualcomm-license-4g-chips-huawei-ban-china-phones"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;. There’s also a version of the P50 Pro shown with Huawei’s own Kirin 9000 processor. Both phones are listed as 4G, with no mention of 5G support. The P50 Pro is available with either 8 or 12GB of RAM with up to 512GB of internal storage, while the P50 is available with 8GB of RAM and up to 256GB of storage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OawPTQ"&gt;The P50 Pro has a 6.6-inch 120Hz 1228p OLED display, while the P50 has a slightly smaller 6.5-inch 90Hz 1224p OLED display. The P50 Pro has a 4,360mAh battery, compared to a 4,100mAh battery in the P50. Both can be fast charged wired at 66W, and the P50 Pro can be wirelessly charged at 50W. There’s an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JPtL2p"&gt;If Huawei’s recent flagships are anything to go by, it’s the P50 series’ cameras that’ll be their most interesting feature. Housed within two circular camera bumps, the P50 Pro has four rear cameras — a 50-megapixel main, 64-megapixel telephoto with a 3.5x optical zoom, a 40-megapixel monochrome, and a 13-megapixel ultra-wide. The P50 has a similar camera bump, but it has one fewer camera lens. It has a 50-megapixel main camera, a 12-megapixel telephoto with a 5x optical zoom, and a 13-megapixel ultra-wide. Both have 13-megapixel selfie cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cb7QyT"&gt;The P50 Pro starts at 5988 yuan (around $927) for a model with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage and will go on general sale in China on August 12th. The P50 starts at 4488 yuan (around $695), also with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, and will go on sale in Sepetember. It’s unclear if or when they’ll receive a release outside of China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EVdUTJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s M1 MacBook Air is at its lowest price ever at Best Buy today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Laptops 2020: Apple MacBook Air (late 2020)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6Q4LdpgSh8zHQBD50EhHfXzE3h4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69649644/vpavic_4291_20201113_0385.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple MacBook Air with the M1 processor&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ycd1hm"&gt;Apple’s latest MacBook Air with the M1 processor is an excellent, lightweight productivity laptop for school or work. It has excellent performance, stellar battery life, and runs completely silently, thanks to its fanless design. At Best Buy, you can save &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747531561997035408#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;up to $250 off the price of the 8GB RAM / 256GB storage model&lt;/a&gt;, bringing it down to just $750, the lowest price we’ve seen yet. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2kfbHT"&gt;To get the best deal, you need to be signed into a My Best Buy account (free) and then toggle the option for the limited time student deal, which knocks another $100 off the discounted $850 price. If you need more storage, the 512GB version is getting the same discount, bringing its price down to $1,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="w6DfUn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LUXN3F"&gt;In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/4/18168565/amazon-alexa-devices-how-many-sold-number-100-million-dave-limp" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon claimed&lt;/a&gt; to have sold more than 100 million Alexa devices. It’s a massive number, and while we haven’t heard more recent sales figures since, that number has surely only grown with the arrival of devices like the fourth-gen Amazon Echo. Even today, the spherical smart speaker remains a great entry point into the smart speaker realm, allowing you to play music, control your smart home, and carry out a million other hands-free tasks that once required you to make use of an abundance of apps. The latest Echo also produces robust, room-filling sound, with a surprising amount of bass and clarity. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N1LEXb"&gt;If you haven’t opted for a smart speaker yet — or would like to upgrade from a previous-gen device — you can purchase a &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo--4th-gen----smart-home-hub-with-alexa---charcoal%2F-%2FA-80770246%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pair of 2020 Amazon Echos at Target for $120&lt;/a&gt;, nearly $80 off the typical retail price. To take advantage of the deal, simply add both speakers to your cart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ca4ONh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10674178"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wCrMwX"&gt;In recent years, a steady internet connection has become more vital, whether due to streaming or the new, WFH-friendly approach many companies are continuing to adopt. Luckily, there’s also been no shortage of devices meant to combat shoddy Wi-Fi. Eero’s latest networking gear is a prime example, and it will work with Wi-Fi 6 and internet speeds of up to 500MBps. The bundle, which is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-eero-6-3-pack/dp/B085WSCTS4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon for $223&lt;/a&gt;, includes two extenders and a router, one featuring dual ethernet ports and an integrated Zigbee smart home hub. It’s an easy way to expand your network and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/19/21185759/wi-fi-work-at-home-how-to-router-mesh" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;boost your home’s Wi-Fi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lsdIoE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603441"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XqIiM3"&gt;Despite the fact many of today’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best gaming mice&lt;/a&gt; offer wireless functionality and ample customization, there’s nothing wrong with picking something that excels when it comes to the fundamentals, like Razer’s DeathAdder V2. The wired mouse is one of the best you can currently buy, with a comfortable design, a basic assortment of buttons, and a 20,000 CPI sensor that allows for plenty of precision when you need it most. As part of its ongoing back-to-school promotion, GameStop is currently &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fpc-gaming%2Faccessories%2Fmice-and-mouse-pads%2Fproducts%2Fdeathadder-v2-black-wired-optical-gaming-mouse%2F11100292.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offering the DeathAdder V2 for $40&lt;/a&gt;, the lowest price we’ve seen on Razer’s budget-friendly mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uku9rj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10674248"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s next hardware launch will be its Ray-Ban ‘smart glasses’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Ray-Ban Stores as EssilorLuxottica SA Commits to $8.7 Billion GrandVision Deal" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IA0fos8QNGe5e_VYOtSSQK1RHnQ=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69649392/1233731883.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;What exactly the glasses will look like or how they will function is unclear. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yooLrx"&gt;Facebook’s next hardware launch will be its long-awaited Ray-Ban ‘smart glasses,’ CEO Mark Zuckerberg confirmed on an &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4442353-facebook-inc-fb-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-on-q2-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript"&gt;earnings call&lt;/a&gt; this week. When exactly the glasses will arrive is unclear. We least heard they were launching &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21439929/facebook-ar-smart-glasses-ray-ban-announcement"&gt;some time in 2021&lt;/a&gt;, but the pandemic has changed a lot of companies’ plans, and Zuckerberg did not comment on a time frame. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P9JFX9"&gt;“Looking ahead here, the next product release will be the launch of our first smart glasses from Ray-Ban in partnership with EssilorLuxottica,” said the Facebook CEO. “The glasses have their iconic form factor, and they let you do some pretty neat things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eCqRGJ"&gt;We don’t know what those “neat things” are, though Facebook has previously confirmed that the glasses will not have an integrated display and are not classified as an augmented reality device. Will they be able to make voice calls? Will they have access to a smart assistant? It’s not clear. Though without an integrated display, they will presumably rely on a paired smartphone app for controls, similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/12/20951783/snap-spectacles-3-review-snapchat-glasses-price-specs-features"&gt;Snap Spectacles&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/25/20883917/amazon-echo-frames-smart-glasses-preview-hands-on-photos-alexa"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Frames&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8LCfHqyUr5d2ys49hWeZHlEW6-8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21885703/facebook_aria_prototype_1.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook’s prototype Project Aria AR smart glasses (no relation to the upcoming Ray-Ban frames). &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YZNZQp"&gt;Zuckerberg framed the launch of the Ray-Ban glasses as part of Facebook’s “journey towards full augmented reality glasses in the future.” The company has been working on such a device for a long time, channelling efforts though its &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/09/announcing-project-aria-a-research-project-on-the-future-of-wearable-ar/"&gt;Project Aria&lt;/a&gt; research unit and even producing prototype AR spectacles, seen above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="elM2ts"&gt;Augmented reality glasses are a key part of Facebook’s new plans to build the “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview"&gt;metaverse”&lt;/a&gt; — a multi-modal technology platform that is supposed to blend virtual and physical spaces, and be used for shopping, work, and socializing. Facebook, of course, will use it to sell more advertising. As Zuckerberg noted on the same earnings call this week: “[A]ds are going to continue being an important part of the strategy across the social media parts of what we do and it will probably be a meaningful part of the metaverse too.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RTXZGH"&gt;That’s something to remember when you start wearing a Facebook-designed computer on your face every day. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Looking back a year later at Intel’s worst summer, and how it’s been fighting its way back since&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="8CYyU1"&gt;In the summer of 2020 Intel seemed poised for triumph. Then it all went wrong. “To put it briefly: Intel blew it,” explains Glenn O’Donnell, a research director at Forrester Research. Intel was forced to announce to the world that it’d be delaying its next major manufacturing milestone for its chips for another few years, an admission that, once again, Intel was falling behind the competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dja50b"&gt;After years of misplaced bets, manufacturing delays, and changing leadership, the previously undisputed chip-making king has found itself faced by competition the likes of which it hasn’t faced in decades — while simultaneously finding itself at what could be the company’s nadir. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0SbtMG"&gt;In 2020, Intel was forced to admit that it would be severely delaying its 7nm node, recently rebranded as Intel 4. This precipitated an exodus of leadership and the admission that Intel might have to face the unthinkable and outsource its own manufacturing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E8f3uf"&gt;Intel managed to survive its last summer hell, at the cost of being forced to dramatically rethink its business from the top down. Now it has a new CEO, a new plan, and a market hungry for more chips. It’s set ambitious goals, revealing its most detailed process roadmap and a bold promise to jump ahead and reclaim processor leadership by 2025, if it can avoid the familiar pitfalls of the past decade. The coming years will be a make-or-break moment of redemption that will either right the course — or send Intel into what might be its final tailspin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gOgNq2"&gt;“It wasn’t something that just happened suddenly. These things build, they build and build over time until something happens that causes the whole thing to kind of crumble,” says O’Donnell. Things have been headed in a downward trajectory for Intel for years, yet it was last summer — and the delay on 7nm — when the cracks in Intel’s facade started to look a lot more like canyons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="kkJsLZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It wasn’t something that just happened suddenly.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pHqqN9"&gt;“For all of its history, until recently, manufacturing was one of the magic things that was going on at Intel — part of the secret sauce of Intel was the manufacturing innovations, and that’s why 7nm was such a big embarrassment,” O’Donnell says. “It was a huge hit, psychologically, across the company, but also across the market because that meant Intel no longer had that secret sauce.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="wDXeYM"&gt;The fact that Intel still makes its own chips today is a rarity in the industry. The vast majority of tech companies are fabless, meaning that they outsource the fabrication of their chips — even if they design them themselves — to other companies. AMD, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Apple, MediaTek, and Broadcom are some of the leading examples of fabless companies today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KUB798"&gt;Intel is one of the few computer chip firms that still designs &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; manufactures its own hardware — it can design every part of the process to its own specifications and purposes, and it has an unmatched control over the actual manufacturing of its products. It actually &lt;em&gt;owns&lt;/em&gt; its own fabs, and it’s the only major company still making chips in the US right now. &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/semiconductor-chip-shortage-60-minutes-2021-05-02/"&gt;Manufacturing has been one of Intel’s biggest strengths for decades&lt;/a&gt;. But the fact that the company missed its projections for 7nm, coming after years of 10nm delays that it was only just recovering from, was a huge blow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="dQMThw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10673391"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lcYJI3"&gt;Last year started well for Intel. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21408718/intel-11th-gen-tiger-lake-cpu-processor-announcement-laptops-fall"&gt;announced its Tiger Lake chips&lt;/a&gt; (technically the company’s third-generation 10nm designs) which also saw the debut of the company’s long-gestating Xe GPU architecture, giving it an exciting new wave of processors with prowess in an area (graphics) that had long been one of Intel’s weaknesses. The chips offered great performance, even though — much like their own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/1/20748224/intel-first-10nm-ice-lake-11-cpu-processor-laptop-decoder-ring"&gt;long-delayed Ice Lake predecessors&lt;/a&gt; — they were limited to only lower-powered laptops. The wait for 10nm and Intel’s new graphics turned out to have been worth it: the new chips outpaced AMD’s in single-core performance &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21440302/intel-tiger-lake-hands-on-tests-core-i7-1185g7-processor-release"&gt;when they were released&lt;/a&gt;, and they actually lived up to the hype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JJYAhu"&gt;There was still more to do: Intel had only released 10nm chips for its weakest laptop products; if you were buying a thin-and-light computer, it’d be better than ever, with all the performance and power efficiency improvements that the new architecture node brought with it. But it took the company almost a full year before it released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22423545/intel-tiger-lake-h-mobile-processors-11th-gen-laptops"&gt;more powerful H-series Tiger Lake chips&lt;/a&gt; for beefier laptops designed for gaming and video editing, which are only just starting to see those benefits. And it still has yet to move its desktop chips to 10nm (to the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/desktopc-pc-intel-newest-processors/"&gt;potential detriment&lt;/a&gt; of this year’s chips, which tried to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22325460/intel-11th-gen-desktop-chips-rocket-lake-s-faster-speeds-cores-gaming"&gt;fuse 10nm designs on 14nm architectures&lt;/a&gt; to mixed results). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5CP1aA"&gt;After years of manufacturing delays, Intel almost seemed to maybe, possibly, be heading back on track. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="2XMPiI"&gt;But when June rolled around, Intel’s troubles started back up again. Seasoned engineer Jim Keller announced that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/12/21288938/jim-keller-leaves-intel-chip-designer-executive-silicon-amd-tesla-apple"&gt;he was leaving the company&lt;/a&gt; for “personal reasons.” &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/13048/an-anandtech-exclusive-the-jim-keller-interview"&gt;Keller is the Mr. Fixit of the chip design world&lt;/a&gt;: he helped Apple with its in-house A-series chips, AMD with its Zen architecture, and Tesla with its Self-Driving Computer chip. &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/12689/cpu-design-guru-jim-keller-joins-intel"&gt;Intel brought Keller on board in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, and while the company didn’t publicly define his role beyond leading Intel’s silicon engineering team for “system-on-chip (SoC) development and integration,” his job was clear: as the leader of Intel’s 10,000-person semiconductor engineering team, &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/longform/microchip-designer-jim-keller-intel-fortune-500-apple-tesla-amd/"&gt;he was to get Intel back on track&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VKABh9"&gt;Keller is known for short stints at companies — he often comes in, sets things in motion, and leaves before the fireworks start. But his less than two years at Intel and his abrupt departure marked one of his shortest tenures yet, and an inauspicious start to Intel’s summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="56f9TE"&gt;But there was more bad news waiting for Intel just a few days later, when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21295475/apple-mac-processors-arm-silicon-chips-wwdc-2020"&gt;Apple announced at WWDC 2020&lt;/a&gt; that it would be making the switch to its own Arm-based chips, away from the Intel processors it had been using for over a decade. The reasoning was similar to when Apple first switched from PowerPC to Intel in 2005: &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-09/apple-plans-to-announce-move-to-its-own-mac-chips-at-wwdc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that the Mac maker weighed and measured Intel’s roadmaps, already riddled with recent delays, and found it wanting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xsu6GI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2019/05/02/apple-macbook-pro-macbook-air-delay-intel-arm-release-date-specifications/?sh=29249ced7922"&gt;Apple’s Q2 2019 earnings report&lt;/a&gt; goes even further, straight up blaming a dip in Mac sales that quarter on processor supply issues with Intel. “We believe that our Mac revenue would have been up compared to last year without those constraints,” CEO Tim Cook noted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ywy0IW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;To Apple, leaving Intel behind was a necessary choice to let the Mac leap forward&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FNpSxk"&gt;At least one former Intel engineer corroborates those frustrations: &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/intel-skylake-why-apple-left/"&gt;outspoken principal engineer François Piednoël told &lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the switch was at least partially due to poor quality assurance with the company’s Skylake chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BxmS1C"&gt;But the switch to Arm chips wasn’t just an announcement that Apple was fed up with Intel’s delays — it was a declaration to the world from one of tech’s most influential companies that Intel’s chips just weren’t up to snuff anymore. “When we make bold changes, it’s for one simple yet powerful reason: so we can make much better products,” Cook said at the announcement — to Apple, leaving Intel behind was a necessary choice to let the Mac leap forward. And sure enough, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;Apple’s first M1 chips&lt;/a&gt; exceeded expectations on every front, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;upending our concept of laptop performance&lt;/a&gt; when they arrived later last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="CNElxU"&gt;But all that was still a prelude to Intel’s biggest looming disaster: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/7/23/21336356/intel-7nm-chips-next-gen-delay-q2-2020-earnings-amd-10nm-tiger-lake-desktop-laptop-cpu"&gt;an announcement&lt;/a&gt; on its Q2 2020 earnings call that the company had identified a “defect mode” in its 7nm process, derailing progress by at least a year. The next-generation chip, &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-process-tech-lag-competitors-late-2021-leadership-5nm"&gt;originally set for a late 2021&lt;/a&gt; release and a crucial part of Intel’s strategy to get its production back on track and to catch up to other silicon producers like TSMC, were now delayed until early 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L4VEfY"&gt;And that’s a big problem for Intel. As Natalie Enright Jerger, a professor in computer engineering and leading researcher in computer architectures explains, there are two main ways that chipmakers can improve performance: new designs, like putting more cores or new AI accelerators onto chips; and adding more transistors, which primarily come from new and smaller architectures. “Without being able to shrink the node they’re losing out on one of the two key drivers of performance. They’re still able to innovate … but they’re not able to get that additional win of more transistors that AMD has.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0xiKdS"&gt;AMD is also a beneficiary of TSMC’s more advanced production: its Ryzen chips have been on 7nm since 2019, and it could be poised to leapfrog Intel again when its 5nm Zen 4 chips ship in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZQ2mhc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Intel has been competing with one hand tied behind its back&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4e2bKi"&gt;Intel is effectively competing with one hand tied behind its back. The fact that it’s keeping up at all is a testament to the advantages its in-house production offers, and the innovations in things like its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/21285821/intel-3d-stacked-lakefield-chips-hybrid-core-atom-arm-processor"&gt;unique Foveros packaging technologies&lt;/a&gt; — all of which is the aforementioned “secret sauce”— but the continued delays to new architectures show it’s the kind of trick that Intel can only keep up for so long. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ByUul7"&gt;The fallout from the summer’s events came quickly. Shortly after the 7nm news hit, Venkata “Murthy” Renduchintala, the company’s former hardware chief, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/27/21340993/intel-hardware-chief-venkata-murthy-renduchintala-leaving"&gt;left his position&lt;/a&gt;. And Intel’s former CEO Bob Swan — previously Intel’s chief financial officer before taking the top spot — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228702/intel-ceo-bob-swan-pat-gelsinger-technical-financial"&gt;was replaced by Pat Gelsinger&lt;/a&gt;, a former Intel engineer best known for helping pioneer some of Intel’s earliest innovations in the 1980s and serving as the company’s first chief technology officer. Gelsinger was a hire meant to help right the ship, a sign to both employees and the world that Intel wanted to get serious about chips and play to its strengths again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aIVv9B"&gt;Gelsinger has wasted no time, already announcing a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22347250/intel-new-factories-arizona-20-billion-chips-outsourcing-foundry-services-manufacturing"&gt;new “IDM 2.0” strategy&lt;/a&gt; for Intel that will see the company outsource some of its production to other players like TSMC and Samsung, work to establish Intel as a chipmaker for other companies through a new Intel Foundry Service business, and create an ambitious goal to return Intel to the forefront of cutting-edge chip designs by 2025. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P11clg"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594074/intel-acclerated-new-architecture-roadmap-naming-7nm-2025"&gt;newly announced roadmap&lt;/a&gt; — the most detailed look at its future products that Intel has shared in some time — and the renaming of its technology nodes to better contextualize them with competitors is part of that strategy; a major declaration from the company that it has a plan to make its way back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7mVANX"&gt;In a comment to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Intel executive vice president Michelle Johnston Holthaus said that “We have a solid foundation in place, and an exciting, strategic vision ahead of us,” highlighting the company’s new investments and roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZbxaM"&gt;But it’ll be a challenge to get there. Intel — the company once known for being the untouchable leader of CPU making — is undeniably behind. While some of its new announcements, like the $20 billion it is investing into new factories in Arizona, sound impressive, they’re bets that will take years to pay off. They also pale in comparison to competitors &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-23/behind-samsung-s-116-billion-bid-for-chip-supremacy"&gt;like Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, which announced a decade-long $116 billion investment in semiconductor production in 2019, or TSMC, which has announced plans to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-01/tsmc-to-invest-100-billion-over-three-years-to-grow-capacity"&gt;invest over $100 billion in expanding capacity&lt;/a&gt; over the next three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="6Cprh9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The ball’s in Intel’s court&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="cMrzpJ"&gt;Even Intel’s new roadmap is not guaranteed for the future. There are a lot of ambitious goals there, including launching its long-delayed 7nm Intel 4 chips in 2023, and next-generation transistor architecture with Intel 20A in 2024. But Intel is coming off its recent 10nm and 7nm struggles and will need to make sure that its aggressive annual pace it’s setting here doesn’t hit similar snags that could cascade through the PC industry. And competitors like Samsung and TSMC are &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16639/tsmc-update-2nm-in-development-3nm-4nm-on-track-for-2022"&gt;already gearing up&lt;/a&gt; their &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt; generation of chips with higher transistor density and more advanced technologies, meaning that newly reinvigorated competitors like AMD and Qualcomm will be waiting to pick up any of Intel’s slack. As O’Donnell explains, “‘They’ve got to leapfrog now — simply catching up is insufficient.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vZBT95"&gt;Last summer was a wake-up call for Intel, a clear sign that the years of delays and missed opportunities were a buck that it could no longer continue to pass. The changes that Intel’s made in the year since are the right ones: &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-skylake-chip-architect-returns-shlomit-weiss-gelsinger?_ga=2.117341702.1430922208.1627475975-482687162.1627330714"&gt;bringing back experienced leaders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-bulks-up-engineering-roster-with-returning-technologist-sunil-shenoy"&gt;hardware designers&lt;/a&gt;, and focusing on getting its semiconductor business back on track. Intel will have to regain trust and rebuild its reputation as a leader that OEMs and customers can rely on and show that it can still compete on the bleeding edge of chips. The last year was a good first step, and the ball’s in Intel’s court. But now, it needs to deliver. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s first PS5 software beta arrives with M.2 SSD support</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vQkgYjXl2TjNHMvN0-6PKcec71Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69649239/vpavic_4278_20201030_0292.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EF8n3w"&gt;Sony’s PS5 system software beta program is starting to roll out today, and it include access to the long-awaited M.2 SSD slot. The first PS5 beta is available for select users in the US, Canada, Japan, UK, Germany, and France. The beta includes some new UX enhancements and customizations, but the biggest addition is M.2 SSD expansion support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NomTWN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5-install-m2-ssd/#min"&gt;Sony notes&lt;/a&gt; you’ll need an M.2 SSD that’s PCIe Gen4 and has read speeds of 5,500MB/s or faster. That’s largely what we were expecting, and it means a variety of Gen4 drives will be supported — including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21444428/samsung-pc-980-pro-ssd-solid-state-drive-storage-price"&gt;Samsung’s 980 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507807/western-digital-wd-first-pcie-4-0-nvme-ssds-sn850"&gt;Western Digital’s SN850s&lt;/a&gt;, and many other modern M.2 SSDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2wTApH"&gt;You may need to consider the cooling requirements for using an M.2 SSD in a PS5, though. “Using an M.2 SSD with your PS5 console requires effective heat dissipation with a cooling structure, such as a heatsink,” explains Sony. “You can attach one to your M.2 SSD yourself, either in a single-sided format, or double-sided format.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Samsung 980 Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BcP6g1-igKslcs5bopN1oo2pJCA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21894230/980pro2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll need the latest Gen4 M.2 SSDs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GaPzcr"&gt;While Sony notes that read speeds on Gen4 drives of 5,500MB/s or faster are recommended, it “cannot guarantee that all M.2 SSD devices meeting the described specifications will work with your console.” Playing games from this expandable storage may not have the “exact same performance” provided by the PS5’s internal drive, even if read speeds exceed 5,500MB/s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ZwYDS"&gt;Aside from M.2 SSD support, this latest PS5 beta software also includes 3D audio support for built-in TV speakers. This will be available in the sound menu in the PS5’s console system settings, and the feature uses the DualSense controller to measure the acoustics of a room to apply a 3D audio setting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="DualSense" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/utAOabKTqZcrBHeiYICw_FzgmNo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21990362/vpavic_4261_20201023_0028.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony is using the DualSense to intelligently enable 3D audio for TV speakers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CUCCuY"&gt;Sony is also improving other areas of its PS5 software. The Control Center interface will now  include more personalization options for rearranging or choosing controls, and PS5 users will be able to view and write messages to friends and parties from the Game Base in the Control Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C4tNzX"&gt;The Friends tab in Game Base is also being updated with better management options, and the ability to see how many friends are online. Sony is also addressing some of the confusing aspects of PS4 or PS5 versions of games. Different versions will now appear separately in the home screen and game library, and each game’s title will also now include whether it’s PS4 or PS5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="abSP9d"&gt;This new PS5 beta will also include a trophy tracker that lets players quickly access up to five trophies per game through the Control Center. Sony is also adding options to pick between 720p and 1080p for its PlayStation Now service, and enabling a new automatic video clip for PS5 players that compete in challenges for high scores in games.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is kicking ‘sugar dating’ apps out of the Play Store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QPDtQrjI9-xa6c9riX4KGHJ_Uho=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69649143/acastro_180507_1777_android_privacy_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LxqE0s"&gt;“Sugar dating” apps will not be allowed on the Android Play Store from September 1st, Google has announced as part of a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9934569?hl=en-GB"&gt;series of policy changes&lt;/a&gt; for the platform. The change, which was &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/07/28/google-bans-sugar-daddy-apps-from-play-store/"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, specifically prohibits apps relating to “compensated sexual relationships.” Other changes coming to the platform include a new crackdown on inactive developer accounts, &lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/07/announcing-policy-updates-to-bolster.html"&gt;Google says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hRY4sM"&gt;Traditionally, sugar dating relationships involve older, wealthier individuals dating and showering younger partners with gifts. As &lt;em&gt;Android Police &lt;/em&gt;notes, there’s no shortage of apps on the Play Store designed around setting up “sugar daddy” relationships. None of them explicitly say that older men are expected to compensate younger women for their affection, but many emphasize the wealth of the men on their services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gymfLL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Inactive developer accounts also face removal&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A9gFES"&gt;Google’s Play Store policies &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9878810?hl=en-GB#:~:text=encourages%20bestiality.-,Apps%20that%20promote%20sex-related,Apps,-that%20degrade"&gt;already prohibit&lt;/a&gt; apps that promote “services that may be interpreted as providing sexual acts in exchange for compensation.” But the &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10808976#:~:text=encourages%20bestiality.-,Apps%20that%20promote%20sex-related,Apps,-that%20degrade"&gt;updated wording&lt;/a&gt; expands this definition to explicitly include “compensated dating or sexual arrangements where one participant is expected or implied to provide money, gifts or financial support to another participant (‘sugar dating’).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0dC1t8"&gt;Google’s announcement doesn’t explicitly say why the apps are being banned now. But it comes amidst a crackdown on online sex work by platforms following the introduction of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/11/17223720/trump-signs-fosta-sesta-sex-trafficking-section-230-law"&gt;FOSTA-SESTA legislation&lt;/a&gt; in the US in 2018, which removes Section 230 protections for content that “promotes or facilitates prostitution.” A representative from Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rZnkVJ"&gt;Beyond the dating app rule changes, the search giant is also introducing a new policy which will see it delete developer accounts if they’ve remained inactive for a year. Google says it will make exceptions for accounts behind apps with over a thousand installs or with recent in-app purchases, but if a developer hasn’t uploaded an app or signed into the Google Play Console over the course of 12 months, their account is at risk of deletion. In a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhtKIZPfZMs"&gt;video outlining the change&lt;/a&gt;, Google says it will notify developers of an impending deletion 60, 30, and 7 days before it takes place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="My7izd"&gt;The policy updates also offer more information on Google’s previously announced changes regarding &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22411560/google-play-store-listings-scammy-emoji-deals-misleading-assets-guidelines-policy"&gt;Play Store spam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466531/google-android-ad-traking-advertising-identifier-id"&gt;opting-out of the use of advertising IDs&lt;/a&gt;. It’s updating its store listings and promotion policy on September 29 to ban “spam text and graphics in app titles, icons and developer names” and its ads policy is being updated to reflect the advertising ID changes on October 4th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bang &amp; Olufsen launches its first pair of noise-canceling true wireless earbuds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y-jlNbZ2OX_7XTPWein2bAlsnjo=/0x1:5735x3824/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69648956/Beoplay_EQ_0006.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beoplay EQ are available in gold (pictured) and black.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Bang and Olufsen&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3ZRuuD"&gt;Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen’s Beoplay EQ are the Danish audio brand’s first pair of noise-canceling true wireless headphones. Two microphones on each earbud handle noise cancellation duties alongside an extra mic for making calls, for a total of six across the two earbuds. They’re releasing globally on August 19th in black and gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rmzn6Q"&gt;At $399 (£359 / €399), the Beoplay EQ are around $50 more expensive than B&amp;amp;O’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/1/15/21067061/bo-beoplay-e8-true-wireless-earbuds-price-features-sound-bluetooth-aptx"&gt;non-noise-canceling Beoplay E8 earbuds&lt;/a&gt; were at launch. They don’t feature the third-generation E8’s formidable battery life, which tops out at 35 hours of total charge from the earbuds and case combined. Instead, the Beoplay EQ can run for around 20 hours when used with the charging case. Battery life from the earbuds themselves is about the same, however, at around six and a half hours with ANC on, or seven and a half with it off. Charging is handled over USB-C or Qi wireless charging.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GNnLwHvo2DvxET9dRUzsuN7XaBE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22740505/Beoplay_EQ_0064.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Their case provides two extra charges for a total playtime of 20 hours.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dl86Ho"&gt;Rounding out the specs, the Beoplay EQ support Qualcomm’s AptX adaptive standard, which is able to make various adjustments to optimize your wireless audio depending on your environment or the content you’re listening to. The earbuds also support the AAC and SBC codecs, and there’s an IP54 rating for dust and water resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z0iK5f"&gt;Like all of Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen’s devices, the Beoplay EQ aren’t exactly cheap. They’re $150 more expensive than Apple’s AirPods Pro and around $120 more than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523584/sony-wf-1000xm4-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review"&gt;Sony’s WF-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt; — our current pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best noise-canceling earbuds&lt;/a&gt; available. But what else did you expect from a company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356352/bang-olufsen-beoplay-portal-gaming-headset-features-price"&gt;whose Xbox headset&lt;/a&gt; costs about as much as the console with which it’s designed to be used.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robot arranges 100,000 dominoes into a Super Mario Bros. mural in one day</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AWBZbllEttyVytmHo6Mu8PaK_Ic=/230x0:2651x1614/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69648782/Screen_Shot_2021_07_28_at_5.08.02_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8DPuHD"&gt;Engineer and YouTuber Mark Rober has created a robot that can make domino murals at lightning speed, and has shown it off &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HEfIJlcFbs"&gt;with a video of it arranging 100,000 dominoes&lt;/a&gt; into a &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt;-themed mural in just over 24 hours. Rober says it would take a team of seven humans a week to do the same thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JOwW73"&gt;The robot, named the “Dominator,” achieves this by putting down 300 dominoes at a time — which are, of course, loaded into it by another robot. Rober says in the video that the current version of the Dominator is the culmination of years of work from him and his team, and he goes into how the device actually works, as well as showing some of the failed designs that led to the final product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUL6pl"&gt;If the name Mark Rober rings a bell, it may be because we’ve covered some of his exploits in the past, from a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/18/18146089/mark-rober-porch-pirate-bait-package-glitter-bomb-fart-spray"&gt;glitter-powered device&lt;/a&gt; meant to deter porch pirates, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2017/7/11/15956298/worlds-largest-super-soaker-water-fight-mark-rober-youtube-engineering"&gt;giant Super Soaker&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/3/21/15011588/mark-rober-dartboard-automatic-tracking-bullseye-motor-motion-tracking"&gt;dart-tracking dartboard&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/5/13/21256983/robotic-basketball-hoop-never-miss-stuff-made-here-shane-wighton"&gt;moving basketball hoop&lt;/a&gt;. Helping him build the robot and code the software was a team of three other people. He also enlists domino artist and YouTuber Lily Hevesh to act as a human opponent for the Dominator (a la &lt;a href="https://blog.ted.com/how-did-supercomputer-watson-beat-jeopardy-champion-ken-jennings-experts-discuss/"&gt;Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter playing Jeopardy&lt;/a&gt; versus IBM’s Watson). You can &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1smZYelKX18&amp;amp;t=0s"&gt;watch her video&lt;/a&gt; to see what it’s like for someone skilled in laying down dominoes to go up against the robot.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vb32j86QFNaz-kooH2OHqUYpEbs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22747275/Screen_Shot_2021_07_28_at_5.44.09_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Mark Rober&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;What would a robot be without googly eyes?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FI2l4b"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Solving “the last centimeter problem” turned out to be very difficult&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XQXvB3"&gt;Rober’s video briefly touches on the robot’s construction, but there’s a series of blog posts written by the team that go into immense amounts of detail on everything from &lt;a href="https://www.baucomrobotics.com/domino-robot-posts/design-journey"&gt;how the project went from idea, to prototype, to robot&lt;/a&gt;, how the &lt;a href="https://www.baucomrobotics.com/domino-robot-posts/software-architecture"&gt;software&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.baucomrobotics.com/domino-robot-posts/hardware-overview"&gt;hardware&lt;/a&gt; operate, and more. One of the more interesting sections is about the robot’s navigation — it uses GPS for most of it, but it turns out that making the robot align the dominoes correctly without knocking any over in the process took a lot of trial and error. The team ended up using a camera and marker system to solve &lt;a href="https://www.baucomrobotics.com/domino-robot-posts/design-journey"&gt;what it called “the last centimeter problem,”&lt;/a&gt; after testing out a few other options.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q1L-uxUzisREIXLxoV7Jn66TwMk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22747276/IMG_0011.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.baucomrobotics.com/domino-robot" target="_blank"&gt;Baucom Robotics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The team, the robot, and the robot-loading robot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1QBTsO"&gt;Of course, one of the most satisfying parts of the video is seeing the 100,000 dominoes get knocked down — a task that also required some engineering work, and that delightfully makes use of a Mario-themed prop. It’s a joy to watch a years-long project like this come together, and while this particular robot may not be capable of doing complex household tasks or delivering pizza (though if it could, it’s obvious &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/17/18681891/dominos-nuro-driverless-pizza-delivery-houston"&gt;which chain it would work for&lt;/a&gt;), it can absolutely stack dominoes with the best of them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung boosts profits and pledges to ‘mainstream’ foldables</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VN8GDHZN3lGUW8I88mgKXi112CY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69648657/vpavic_190731_z_flip_0247_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OdLFlF"&gt;Samsung Electronics has released its second-quarter earnings, reporting 20 percent higher revenue and 54 percent higher operating profit year-on-year despite its mobile division taking a hit due to component shortages. The company made an operating profit of 12.57 trillion won (~$10.97 billion) off 63.67 trillion won (~$55.56 billion) in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z14TCM"&gt;Samsung says its mobile business suffered from the industry-wide component shortage as well as “production disruptions” in its Vietnam factories, some of which were closed after a COVID outbreak. Combined with weak seasonality resulting in less demand, revenue declined from the previous quarter, though it was still up year-on-year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="hNF4wV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung confirms Z Fold 3 S Pen support as Note line is in limbo","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594685/samsung-z-fold-3-stylus-support-note-durability"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="42Li6o"&gt;The semiconductor business continues to be Samsung’s biggest financial driver, contributing more than a third of the company’s revenue and more than half of its profits for the quarter. Samsung says memory demand and price increases were higher than previously forecast, though mobile memory sales were impacted by the same issues as seen by the smartphone division.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kbOeNE"&gt;Looking forward to the rest of the year, Samsung says it will “solidify its leadership in the premium [smartphone] segment by mainstreaming the foldable category,” while the display division confirmed it’s working on under-screen camera technology. Samsung has an event set for August 11th where it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594685/samsung-z-fold-3-stylus-support-note-durability"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; it’ll announce new phones in the Galaxy Z Fold and Z Flip lines.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best deals on MacBooks right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hZX5JfVeNbOPhxgT-vEb8Xev40E=/2x0:2039x1358/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69195507/vpavic_4291_20201113_0337_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacBook Air (late-2020).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YgkMYN"&gt;With multiple configurations and various models to choose from, including some equipped with Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;new M1 processor&lt;/a&gt;, finding a deal on a MacBook or Mac Mini is not all that difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5kEtb"&gt;We’ll run through discounts currently available for the latest MacBook models as well as any deals to be had on the Mac Mini. Of course, there are also frequent discounts available for older Intel-based configurations — all of which will be compatible with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22458628/apple-macos-12-monterey-features-updates-wwdc-2021"&gt;macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt; upon its release in the fall — and we’ll also highlight those when we find them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QDx7u"&gt;Alternatively, purchasing refurbished is another way to save money on an Apple computer. &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1022323/7613?sharedid=VergeBestDealsAppleMacbook042721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fmac" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s refurbished store&lt;/a&gt; provides a one-year warranty on all products and generally has discounts of 15- to 20-percent off the price of a new model. Two other retailers to look at for refurbished MacBooks are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738963691650209208#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/certified-refurbished-apple-macbook/s?k=certified+refurbished+apple+macbook" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. For now, however, these are the best MacBook and Mac Mini deals you can take advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EVXzol"&gt;The best MacBook Air deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="aqfkV0"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; is Apple’s entry-level laptop. It’s best suited for typical productivity work, with a comfortable keyboard, excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. The most recent model includes the Apple-designed M1 processor and lacks a fan for quiet, efficient performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FJU3RG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LZawtk"&gt;The base MacBook Air with the M1 chip has 8GB of RAM and a 256G SSD. It typically sells for $999, however, it’s currently &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747531561997035408#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LNQCX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $850 and $899, respectively. Both retail giants also have the 512GB configuration on sale in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5M9XBS/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;all three colorways for $1,099&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747532219045612135#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LFLC3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;), a discount of $150.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DTHGG6"&gt;The best MacBook Pro deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JByVWG"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; comes in more sizes and options than the Air, and it’s more geared toward demanding use cases. The base model is the 13-inch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1-powered variant&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a brighter screen and longer battery life compared to the M1 Air. The M1 MacBook Pro 13 normally starts at $1,299, but the base model with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage is on sale for $200 off at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5N6RSS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738975458064148072#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="afDps1"&gt;The upgraded version of the 13-inch M1 MacBook Pro with 8GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5LH3F7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$200 off at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747532652589677821#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="44XxWs"&gt;Of course, you can also buy some older MacBook Pro models, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21256520/apple-13-inch-macbook-pro-2020-review-keyboard-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;13-inch mid-2020 model&lt;/a&gt;. The older device features four Thunderbolt ports, Ice Lake processors, a new keyboard, increased RAM, and various storage configurations. Right now, the 13-inch model is available in two configurations at Amazon: one with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-Pro-10th-Generation-Quad-Core/dp/B08DTPQ9XB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;10th Gen i7 Intel processor and 512GB of storage&lt;/a&gt; for $1,999, or one with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-Storage-Keyboard/dp/B08821TJLG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB of storage and a 2.0GHz 10th Gen Intel Core i5 processor&lt;/a&gt; for $1,799.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="J3a3Uu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733800"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hij1MQ"&gt;If you want a bigger laptop with more horsepower, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20974649/apple-macbook-pro-16-inch-laptop-review-keyboard-test-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Pro 16&lt;/a&gt; is the top-of-the-line model. Compared to its predecessor, it has a better keyboard, newer processors, and improved speakers. Amazon currently has an Intel Core i7 CPU and 512GB of storage configuration in space gray &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-16-Inch-512GB-Storage/dp/B081FZV45H/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale for $2,000&lt;/a&gt;, a $400 discount. There are other configurations available with more storage and quicker processors — for instance, you can also get the 16-inch model with an Intel Core i9 CPU and 1TB of storage &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-16-Inch-512GB-Storage/dp/B081FV1Y57/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $2,300 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; — but deals are few and far between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zjWXtS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10469149"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="fZkCsg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="LYpjlZ"&gt;The best Mac Mini deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Un7j7n"&gt;While it is not an Apple laptop, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt; is an affordable desktop computer with macOS. It does not include a display, keyboard, or mouse (so you’ll have to supply your own), but this compact machine is an excellent performer if you aren’t concerned about portability. It’s fast, efficient, and comes outfitted with Wi-Fi 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9PC7b"&gt;Like the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro 13, the Mini features Apple’s new M1 processor. It starts at $699, with the price varying based on your RAM and storage configurations. We’ve seen the base model drop to as low as $600, however, right now it’s only available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5PHB83/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604799-REG%2Fapple_mgnr3ll_a_mac_mini.html%2F%3Fap%3Dy%26ap%3Dy%26smp%3Dy%26smp%3Dy%26lsft%3DBI%253A514%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjwieuGBhAsEiwA1Ly_ncXHhq-iWKpvrfYtFChI-bPVIWkyhdRKI-PNhmoD9yjMSRUfQWhABRoCntMQAvD_BwE&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22399419%2Fapple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo for as low as $649&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
