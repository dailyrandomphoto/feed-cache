    <title>The best deals on Apple MacBooks right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The MacBook Air is the most impressive laptop I’ve used in years" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hZX5JfVeNbOPhxgT-vEb8Xev40E=/2x0:2039x1358/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69195507/vpavic_4291_20201113_0337_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacBook Air (late-2020).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p1z5Ah"&gt;With multiple configurations and various MacBook models available for purchase, including ones equipped with the new M1 processor, finding a deal on an Apple MacBook is not very hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5kEtb"&gt;We’ll run through discounts currently available for the latest MacBook models as well as any deals on the Mac mini computer. Of course, there are frequent discounts available for older Intel-based configurations, and we’ll also highlight those when we find them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QDx7u"&gt;Alternatively, purchasing refurbished is another way to save money on an Apple computer. &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1022323/7613?sharedid=VergeBestDealsAppleMacbook042721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fmac"&gt;Apple’s refurbished store&lt;/a&gt; provides a full one-year warranty on all products and generally has discounts of 15 to 20 percent off the price of a new model. Two other retailers to look at for refurbished MacBooks are &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/certified-refurbished-apple-macbook/s?k=certified+refurbished+apple+macbook"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738963691650209208#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EVXzol"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="aqfkV0"&gt;The MacBook Air is Apple’s entry-level laptop. It’s best suited for typical productivity work, with a comfortable keyboard, excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. The most recent model includes the Apple-designed M1 processor and lacks a fan for quiet, efficient performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FJU3RG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LZawtk"&gt;The base configuration of MacBook Air with the M1 chip has 8GB of RAM and 256GB of SSD and typically sells for $999. Right now, you can get it for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LNQCX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$949 ($50 off) at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ADk8N"&gt;Amazon also has the 512GB configuration on sale; you can get it &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5R2GQW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in silver for $1,180&lt;/a&gt; ($70 off).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DTHGG6"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JByVWG"&gt;The MacBook Pro comes in more sizes and options than the Air, and it’s more geared toward demanding use cases. The base model is the 13-inch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1-powered variant&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a brighter screen and longer battery life compared to the M1 Air. The M1 MacBook Pro 13 normally starts at $1299, but it’s on sale for $150 off at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5N6RSS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738975458064148072#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="44XxWs"&gt;Of course, you can buy some older MacBook Pro models: one includes the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21256520/apple-13-inch-macbook-pro-2020-review-keyboard-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;13-inch mid-2020 model&lt;/a&gt;. It features four Thunderbolt ports, Ice Lake processors, a new keyboard, increased RAM, and storage configurations. You can save $200 on the 13-inch model at Amazon, which is available in two configurations: a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-Storage-Keyboard/dp/B0881Z844Y?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;10th Gen i7 Intel processor and 512GB of storage&lt;/a&gt; for $1,600 at Amazon, or you can buy one with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-Storage-Keyboard/dp/B08821TJLG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB of storage and a 2.0GHz 10th Gen Intel Core i5&lt;/a&gt; processor for $1,800 at Amazon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="J3a3Uu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733800"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hij1MQ"&gt;If you want a bigger laptop with more horsepower, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20974649/apple-macbook-pro-16-inch-laptop-review-keyboard-test-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Pro 16&lt;/a&gt; is the top-of-the-line model. Compared to the processor, it has a better keyboard, newer processors, and better speakers. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-16-Inch-Storage-2-3GHz/dp/B081FZV45H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; has an Intel Core i7 CPU and 512GB of storage configuration in space gray on sale for $2,199 ($200 off). There’s also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-16-Inch-Storage-2-3GHz/dp/B081FV1Y57?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;another configuration available in the same color&lt;/a&gt;, but more storage (1TB) and an Intel Core i9 processor available for $2,499 ($300 off). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zjWXtS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10469149"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QLBQ9T"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mac mini&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Un7j7n"&gt;While it is not an Apple laptop, the Mac mini is an affordable desktop computer with macOS. It does not include a display, keyboard, or mouse (so you’ll have to supply your own), but this compact machine is an excellent performer if you aren’t concerned about portability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9PC7b"&gt;Like the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro 13, the mini has Apple’s new M1 processor. It starts at $699, with the price varying based on your RAM and storage configurations. We have seen this computer go down as low as $600 (for the base model), but you can get it for $30 off its usual starting price of $699 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5PHB83?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604799-REG%2Fapple_mgnr3ll_a_mac_mini.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RPnQwi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9712859"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Why Epic is burning its own cash to cook Apple</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5Lh_CWksVTEeNbQChEmAiGYACqo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69227410/acastro_210429_1777_epic_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Follow the money, baby&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="LsnEyS"&gt;Epic Games didn’t sue Apple to get a big payout, but that’s because the lawsuit itself is an investment. And to rewrite Apple’s rules, Epic is spending a fortune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wZOgc0"&gt;The reason Epic’s &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;got thrown out of the Apple App Store&lt;/a&gt; was that Epic rogue-updated &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; to offer a payment mechanism that bypassed Apple’s 30 percent cut of all in-app transactions. Apple booted &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; for violating its rules. Epic threw an… epic… hissy fit about this, culminating in the trial starting this week. While Epic has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21453745/spotify-epic-tile-match-coalition-for-app-fairness-apple-app-store-policies-protest"&gt;cobbled together an alliance&lt;/a&gt; called the Coalition for App Fairness — along with Spotify, Match Group, Basecamp, and Tile — there’s one more tech behemoth in play. Epic Games Store &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/announcing-epic-direct-payment-on-mobile"&gt;runs on Amazon Web Services&lt;/a&gt;. So does &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/EPICGames/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; itself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="MIZjT6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;‘Fortnite’ pretty much prints cash&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sAYbBt"&gt;The fight with Apple echoes Epic’s tactics elsewhere. The Epic Game Store is a clear challenge to Valve, which has an iOS-like store called Steam that also takes a 30 percent cut of sales. In a basic act of moral consistency, the Epic Game Store contains — in addition to games by other developers — &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22396021/itchio-epic-games-store-windows-pc-apps"&gt;other game stores&lt;/a&gt;. It also takes only a 12 percent cut of sales. Just last week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409285/microsoft-store-cut-windows-pc-games-12-percent"&gt;Microsoft announced&lt;/a&gt; it would cut its take on PC games to 12 percent to match Epic, from 30 percent. (It also filed &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21810025/statement_support_microsoft.pdf"&gt;a letter of support&lt;/a&gt; for Epic in the current case.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8TY5x2"&gt;Epic CEO Tim Sweeney said in 2019 that the Epic Game Store’s hardball tactics against Valve will continue until either the store is profitable or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/16/18334865/epic-games-store-versus-steam-valve-pc-gaming-console-war-reimagined"&gt;Valve lowers its cut&lt;/a&gt;. Epic will torch an estimated $593 million by the end of 2021 on the Epic Games Store, according to &lt;a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/502037049/21-04-07-Apple-Proposed-Findings-of-Fact-and-Conclusions-of-Law"&gt;court documents in the Apple case&lt;/a&gt;. At many companies, losing this much money would be a problem, but that figure is only slightly more than &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/06/15/epic-games-shareholders-seeking-to-sell-stake-for-750-million-at-17-billion-valuation/"&gt;Epic’s &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; revenue from April 2020&lt;/a&gt;, which was $400 million that month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZOEqIJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; pretty much prints cash because the video game industry has hit on a business model that almost no other part of the entertainment industry can match: in-app payments. For Spotify, it’s not a fatal problem to dodge the App Store and its cut. I just go to a desktop computer, enter my credit card information, and — thanks to recurring billing — I’m done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iEuk7f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is different, and it’s why a video game company is leading the effort to challenge the App Store payment rules. In &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, if I want to buy a sweet dance move, I spend Epic’s V-Bucks to do it. The store refreshes every day, so if I want the new hotness, I need to act immediately. (There’s also a seasonal pass and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21612524/fortnite-crew-subscription-chapter-2-season-5-price-release-date"&gt;a recently-introduced monthly subscription&lt;/a&gt;, but these do not seem to be as explicitly geared toward impulse buys.) Last year, in-app purchases were estimated to account for &lt;a href="https://wappier.com/blog/iap-statistics"&gt;40 percent of all gaming revenue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1bTY20"&gt;Epic’s position gets weirder. Part of the story will involve people who imprinted on Neal Stephenson like ducklings, but before we get there, let’s run down what we know about the economics of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; and the Epic Games Store to get a rough sense of how much money is in play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="YvJdF0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“At some level, Apple’s being greedy.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VTAp2k"&gt;It’s true that &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is free to download, but in-app purchases more than make up for that. In 2019, &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/06/15/epic-games-shareholders-seeking-to-sell-stake-for-750-million-at-17-billion-valuation/"&gt;Epic Games had revenue of $4.2 billion&lt;/a&gt;, with earnings of $730 million. (We know this because Epic, a private company, sold a stake, and &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/06/15/epic-games-shareholders-seeking-to-sell-stake-for-750-million-at-17-billion-valuation/"&gt;those meddling kids at VentureBeat&lt;/a&gt; got a hold of numbers as a result.) Epic’s 2020 numbers are forecast at about $5 billion in revenue, with $1 billion in earnings, according to VentureBeat; in the court documents, Epic’s total 2020 revenue is projected at a mere $3.85 billion. In the two years &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; was available in the App Store, iOS customers alone accounted for $700 million in revenue for Epic, according to the court documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tNDoFw"&gt;“Epic is in a fortunate position because &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is the most popular game in the world,” says &lt;a href="https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/k/christopher-e-krohn"&gt;Christopher Krohn&lt;/a&gt;, an adjunct associate professor of marketing at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yAnBjl"&gt;Apple’s revenue split from digital purchases is a little complicated — it’s got special rates for small developers, for instance — but in Epic’s case, Apple gets 30 percent of all in-app purchases. That’s in line with &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2001/04/minitel-the-old-new-thing/"&gt;Minitel&lt;/a&gt;, the French pre-internet, which also had a 30 / 70 split for third-party content, says Bill Maurer, a professor of anthropology at the University of California Irvine who specializes in payment processors. Frankly, it looks like a carrier fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HlGmK5"&gt;“At some level, Apple’s being greedy, because it doesn’t depend on this revenue,” says &lt;a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/michael-a-cusumano"&gt;Michael Cusumano&lt;/a&gt;, a distinguished professor of management at MIT’s Sloan Business School. “It’s rolling in money from the iPhone itself.” On March 28, Apple reported its quarterly earnings — almost $24 billion in net income, riding mostly on &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-28/apple-sales-crush-wall-street-estimates-on-surging-device-demand?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;strong sales of the iPhone and Mac&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252663/apple-q1-2021-earnings-iphone-12-mac-sales"&gt;previous quarter&lt;/a&gt; was a blowout for the company, with revenue of more than $100 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="SLZ133"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Epic wants to build the “metaverse,” an online haven where superhero IP owned by different companies can finally kiss&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e6C5qM"&gt;Greed isn’t illegal. It’s also probably what’s motivating Epic, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21369622/epic-ceo-tim-sweeney-apple-fortnite-lawsuit-ban-basic-freedoms-developers"&gt;despite its CEO’s bluster&lt;/a&gt;. Epic wants to build &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338403/fortnite-story-narrative-interview-donald-mustard-epic-games"&gt;something called the “metaverse&lt;/a&gt;,” an online haven where superhero IP owned by different companies can finally kiss. (The idea is based on &lt;em&gt;Snow Crash&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/06/neal-stephenson-metaverse-snow-crash-silicon-valley-virtual-reality"&gt;a 1991 book by Neal Stephenson&lt;/a&gt;.) The revenue potential here is the kind of thing that sends VCs into &lt;a href="https://www.matthewball.vc/all/themetaverse"&gt;thinkfluencing fever dreams&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gzQwSN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is already a hangout space, one where IP from Marvel and DC can legally interact. Add to that the Unreal engine, which fuels a number of games as well as shows such as Disney’s &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;, and its other developer tools, and you’re looking at what could potentially be &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-is-epic-games-metaverse-and-is-it-worth-billions"&gt;a piece of a metaverse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Should &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, the Epic Games Store, or another Epic offering underpin a major chunk of a metaverse, the amount of money Epic is torching on its store and these lawyers will look like &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/announcing-a-1-billion-funding-round-to-support-epics-long-term-vision-for-the-metaverse"&gt;a wise investment&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;em&gt;fuckload&lt;/em&gt; of money it stands to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7zEvaq"&gt;You can see why they might not want to cut Apple — or Valve, or Google, or &lt;em&gt;anyone at all&lt;/em&gt; — in at 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="965O3I"&gt;Look, I’m going to pop my popcorn and, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fortnites-mastermind-goes-to-battle-with-apple-11619236807"&gt;as Sweeney put it&lt;/a&gt;, “enjoy the upcoming fireworks show” at the trial. I don’t think the outcome will matter much, since any verdict is going to get appealed &lt;em&gt;immediately.&lt;/em&gt; But at the very bottom, it seems obvious that Epic’s position is the same as Apple’s: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVxYOQS6ggk"&gt;greed is good&lt;/a&gt;. Forget the fight to own the metaverse. The &lt;em&gt;real world&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/29/technology/big-tech-pandemic-economy.html"&gt;belongs to Big Tech&lt;/a&gt;, and we’re just NPCs who drop loot for the corporate players.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Marvel drops the first glimpse of Oscar-winner Chloé Zhao’s Eternals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i8i8Z6Vc7jPsjypKEU8WVUvRH4o=/419x0:1940x1014/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69227381/Screen_Shot_2021_05_03_at_9.41.21_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZfEMpp"&gt;Marvel has just revealed a first look at one of its most exciting upcoming projects: &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt;, the studio’s next big superhero team-up that’s set to arrive in theaters on November 5th. It’s the next big project from Oscar-winning director Chloé Zhao, following her Best Picture and Best Director wins for &lt;em&gt;Nomadland&lt;/em&gt; earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wTRdnT"&gt;Unfortunately, the teaser (which primarily serves as a hype reel for Marvel’s return to blockbuster films after a months-long pandemic-induced break from theatrical releases) doesn’t provide too much footage from &lt;em&gt;Eternals. &lt;/em&gt;Instead, there are&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;just a few quick glimpses of some of the bigger stars, including Salma Hayek’s Ajak riding a horse, Kumail Nanjiani’s Kingo staring off into the distance, and Richard Madden’s Ikaris standing at the front of the team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NaHDBG"&gt;The teaser’s biggest moment (aside from a wide perspective showing several of the new heroes suited up) goes to Angelina Jolie, wielding a gigantic sword made of light. Presumably, a more substantial trailer will arrive in the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yjYpAmJys9VpWK4xE1ETpo2NWlw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22488020/Screen_Shot_2021_05_03_at_9.41.21_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OF3xiY"&gt;The biggest takeaway is that &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; may start to deliver on Marvel’s years-long promise of creating films with more diverse casts than the seemingly endless array of dudes named Chris who have dominated the first decade of films — something that’s particularly encouraging to see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y7r0WZ"&gt;Along with a brief look at &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt;, the teaser reel also drops a surprising amount of Marvel news, including official title announcements for &lt;em&gt;Black Panther: Wakanda Forever&lt;/em&gt; (previously referred to as &lt;em&gt;Black Panther 2&lt;/em&gt;) and &lt;em&gt;The Marvels, &lt;/em&gt;the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Captain Marvel&lt;/em&gt; sequel, which will also serve as a follow-up to the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Ms. Marvel&lt;/em&gt; show on Disney Plus and will see Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) and &lt;a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/tv-shows/ms-marvel-introduces-iman-vellani-kamala-khan-disney-plus"&gt;Iman Vellani’s Kamala Khan&lt;/a&gt; team up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rHgZOF4rfAYOLUg1RJuMwGnclSA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22488038/Screen_Shot_2021_05_03_at_9.16.09_AM.png"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NsIEbI"&gt;The hype reel also gives updated release dates for the next two years of Marvel Studios projects, including &lt;em&gt;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol 3. &lt;/em&gt;The current release schedule is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="hQJWlx"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Black Widow: &lt;/em&gt;July 9th, 2021&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7WnVla"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings: &lt;/em&gt;September 3rd, 2021&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="U2IMky"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Eternals: &lt;/em&gt;November 5th, 2021&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="F6mt3N"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/em&gt;: December 17th, 2021&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IoUWq7"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&lt;/em&gt;: March 25th, 2022&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KC5pNo"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Thor: Love and Thunder&lt;/em&gt;: May 6th, 2022&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MsOEDE"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Black Panther: Wakanda Forever&lt;/em&gt;: July 8th, 2022&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="my2vLZ"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Marvels&lt;/em&gt;: November 11th, 2022&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YN4NTE"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania&lt;/em&gt;: February 17th, 2023&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ROxqlS"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 3&lt;/em&gt;: May 5th, 2023&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="hd3xPx"&gt;The teaser video wraps with another quick glimpse of the logo for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168833/the-fantastic-four-marvel-studios-cinematic-universe-jon-watts"&gt;Jon Watts’ upcoming MCU reboot of &lt;em&gt;The Fantastic Four&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but with no release date information. Given its place in the lineup, though, it won’t hit theaters until late 2023 at the earliest. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Some of the best Nintendo Switch games are $20 off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oMxfMruOiRJ-DbrQqBH3eGDHDQI=/201x0:2370x1446/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69227192/akrales_171025_2091_0010.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ao9MGG"&gt;Whether you’re a new or not-so-new Switch owner, everyone needs some good games to play. If you want some of the best titles released for Nintendo’s console, you can get them for $20 off their full $60 price. This isn’t the first time we’ve seen these discounts, but it’s rare that these price cuts extend to both physical and digital versions of the games. So if you’d prefer to purchase a game code so you can instantly download it to your &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074RNRM2B/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;microSD card&lt;/a&gt;, that’s an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WqL3Ua"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514828"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="qndMFI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9575178"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vvFtWt"&gt;You can find a few other Nintendo-published games like &lt;em&gt;Mario Tennis Aces&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe&lt;/em&gt;, and more discounted at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/E8621E51-6EB3-4DF4-9BDD-0DFBCD2F7B2B"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Fnintendo-switch-games-video%2F-%2FN-p86ax&amp;amp;subid1=TheVergeDeals"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fnew%3Fprefn1%3DavailabilityFilter%26prefv1%3DshipsIn24Hours%26q%3DAll%26srule%3Dtop-sellers%26prefn1%3Dcondition%26prefv1%3DNew" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;. In other Switch-related deal news, a reputable eBay seller has copies of the &lt;em&gt;New Pok&lt;/em&gt;é&lt;em&gt;mon Snap&lt;/em&gt; for $10 off its usual price. This is a great deal since this title released last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CwkUIs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10283625"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ABPaRd"&gt;For the lead-up to Mother’s Day on Sunday, May 9th, Amazon has discounted most of its tech, including the Fire TV Stick 4K, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CXG6C9W/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Paperwhite e-reader&lt;/a&gt;, its Echo Show smart displays, and more. Whether you’re getting Mom a gift or snagging a gadget for yourself, some of these discounts are the best prices we’ve seen yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zKk7Dq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10351716"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iHe1k7"&gt;Amazon is clearing out stock of its previous generation of Fire HD 8 and HD 10 tablets since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405230/amazon-fire-hd-10-2021-announced-kids-pro"&gt;a new iteration was announced last week&lt;/a&gt;. But so far, the best deals are on the Kid-friendly versions of the older tablets that include a protective case and a year-long subscription to Amazon Kids Plus (formerly known as FreeTime Unlimited) that provides complimentary apps, games, books, videos, and more. Normally $140, the eight-inch Fire HD 8 Kids is $90. The slightly smaller Fire 7 Kids is $60, down from $100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TiT4Pz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9560105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OvycW0"&gt;If you want a capable smart display that has a motorized screen that can move to remain visible as you walk around the room, Amazon’s latest Echo Show 10 is one of your only options. At that, it’s $50 off, which matches the best price we’ve seen for this model. You can pick one up in charcoal or white with a complimentary Ring smart bulb for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08M1N8522?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$200 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Other retailers offer the same price but without the smart bulb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aQmGs0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10362085"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GMmEv5"&gt;Lastly, time is running out to get Mom a great gift before Mother’s Day. If you need a hand coming up with ideas, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22358371/mothers-day-gifts-ideas-best-mom-tech-gadgets"&gt;let our gift guide be of assistance to you&lt;/a&gt;. We polled &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s staff for ideas, and you’re bound to find some unconventional gifts here, if that’s what you’re after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="E002s0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10443858"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="73bfPO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwgyjP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic Games buys artist portfolio site ArtStation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sG8HXvyPvg6ueA6ScF5tKOOy4_U=/120x0:1080x640/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69227043/ArtStation_announcement_banner_1280x640_1_1200x640.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://magazine.artstation.com/2021/04/artstation-is-joining-the-epic-games-family/" target="_blank"&gt;ArtStation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pUTY5X"&gt;As it prepares to do &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;battle in court with Apple&lt;/a&gt; over App Store fees, Epic Games has acquired ArtStation, an online marketplace for digital artists, &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/artstation-is-now-part-of-epic-games"&gt;the companies announced&lt;/a&gt;. Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EMORnL"&gt;“The ArtStation leadership team brings tremendous talent and an unparalleled track record of supporting a vibrant creator community and ecosystem,” Epic Games vice president and general manager Marc Petit said in a statement. “We look forward to working with them to provide creators with access to even more resources and tools, empowering them to do their best work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lQy62v"&gt;Founded in 2014, &lt;a href="https://www.artstation.com/?sort_by=community"&gt;ArtStation&lt;/a&gt; is a popular portfolio site for professional artists in gaming and entertainment. ArtStation artists can also sell their work on the site, and Epic plans to reduce seller fees, putting more money in creators’ pockets. Standard fees will go from 30 percent to 12 percent, and for ArtStation Pro members, the fees will be reduced from 20 percent to 8 percent, and 5 percent for self-promoted sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fjN7rP"&gt;ArtStation will continue to operate “as an independently branded platform,” and its &lt;a href="https://www.artstation.com/about/artists/learning"&gt;ArtStation Learning&lt;/a&gt; section, which has a library of educational videos, will be free for the rest of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K4aA54"&gt;“You can still use the platform as you do today, and we will continue to be open to all creators across verticals, both 2D and 3D alike—including those that don’t use Unreal Engine,” ArtStation CEO Leonard Teo wrote in a &lt;a href="https://magazine.artstation.com/2021/04/artstation-is-joining-the-epic-games-family/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “We’ll be actively hiring and growing the ArtStation team. We’re committed to improving the platform and now as a part of Epic, we’ll be able to do much more.” Leo added that Epic’s Unreal Engine team has been a strong supporter of the platform, with Epic giving ArtStation &lt;a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/megagrants"&gt;one of its Megagrants&lt;/a&gt; last year at the height of the coronavirus pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DgQyjo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DQSdE5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4dC8gX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon sells AOL and Yahoo for about half of what it paid</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="aol man" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rPGL_9o4DzHE6BpKtw0ptYXAupA=/0x11:570x391/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69226681/runningman.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t7PpYT"&gt;Verizon has sold its AOL and Yahoo properties to Apollo Global Management in a deal said to be worth $5 billion, about half of the nearly $9 billion Verizon originally paid for the pair. Verizon will maintain a 10 percent stake in the company, now known as Yahoo and led by CEO Guru Gowrappan. The deal, which includes Verizon’s ad tech business, was heavily rumored over the last week and is still subject to closing conditions. Once complete, it’ll bring an end to Verizon’s troubled experiment with media production and advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BaBJP2"&gt;Apollo is a private equity firm that owns the &lt;a href="https://www.apollo.com/stockholders/press-releases/2021/03-03-2021-113034148"&gt;Venetian resort in Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt; and crafts retailer &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/03/crafts-retailer-michaels-to-be-bought-by-apollo-global-for-5-billion.html"&gt;Michaels&lt;/a&gt;. Apollo co-founder Leon Black recently stepped down as Chairman, soon after it was revealed that he &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/26/business/jeffrey-epstein-leon-black-apollo.html"&gt;paid more than $150 million to Jeffrey Epstein&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; Jeffrey Epstein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="r4gwVP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Yes, &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; Jeffrey Epstein&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HyKrly"&gt;“We are thrilled to help unlock the tremendous potential of Yahoo and its unparalleled collection of brands,” said Apollo partner Reed Rayman. “We have enormous respect and admiration for the great work and progress that the entire organization has made over the last several years, and we look forward to working with Guru, his talented team, and our partners at Verizon to accelerate Yahoo’s growth in its next chapter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fOSTI7"&gt;Verizon originally paid $4.4 billion for AOL in 2015 and another $4.5 billion for Yahoo two years later. The media divisions, which included properties like &lt;em&gt;Yahoo Sports&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;, were consolidated under the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/3/15166872/aol-verizon-oath-announced-merger-rebranding-new-name-logo"&gt;absurdly named Oath&lt;/a&gt;, later renamed Verizon Media Group in 2018 after Verizon admitted defeat and wrote off about half of its value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wTw5sD"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/12/20802639/tumblr-verizon-sold-wordpress-blogging-yahoo-adult-content"&gt;2019 Verizon sold Tumblr&lt;/a&gt; for an undisclosed sum that was thought to have been less than $3 million, pennies compared to the $1.1 billion Yahoo paid for the blogging platform in 2013. Last year Verizon unloaded &lt;em&gt;Huffpost&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Buzzfeed&lt;/em&gt;, a property AOL paid $315 million for in 2011 that resulted in a $119 million charge to its quarterly earnings “primarily related to the disposition of the &lt;em&gt;HuffPost&lt;/em&gt; business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uYHIzo"&gt;Back in the day, AOL was how people connected to the internet and Yahoo was its front page. At their peaks, AOL had a market capitalization of &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/15/how-aol-dominated-the-internet-of-the-90s-and-let-it-slip-away.html"&gt;more than $200 billion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/dont-cry-for-yahoo%E2%80%94the-stock-has-raced-past-previous-leaders-of-the-dot-com-era-2016-07-25"&gt;Yahoo more than $125 billion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kroger begins testing drone deliveries for baby products and s’mores </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0ZFvTK3BPnFUC58PkakVu2X36sg=/50x0:1951x1267/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69226543/Kroger_Delivery_x_Drone_Express_04.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kroger is partnering with Drone Express on deliveries of packages up to five pounds.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Kroger&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3A67oL"&gt;Kroger is joining rival Walmart by launching a drone delivery pilot program for groceries later this spring. The supermarket chain is partnering with Drone Express to deliver items like baby products, over-the-counter medications, and picnic supplies weighing up to about five pounds from a test store in Centerville, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4BrpqK"&gt;A landing page for the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kroger.com%2Fdronedelivery&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F3%2F22416957%2Fkroger-drone-express-groceries-ohio" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kroger Drone Delivery service&lt;/a&gt; says that groceries will be flown by “certified drone pilots under FAA approval.” A &lt;a href="http://ir.kroger.com/CorporateProfile/press-releases/press-release/2021/Kroger-and-Drone-Express-Partner-to-Provide-Grocery-Delivery-by-Drone/default.aspx"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; suggests that deliveries can be made to street addresses as well as to parks or beaches by homing in on a customer’s smartphone location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3QFNUb"&gt;As part of the pilot, Kroger is designing bundled product offerings that fit within the size and weight constraints of the Drone Express vehicles. These include a baby care bundle with wipes and formula, another with over-the-counter medications and fluids, and a “S’mores bundle” with graham crackers, marshmallows, and chocolate. Krogers says eligible orders can be delivered in “as little as 15 minutes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jl9NlZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Send chicken soup to a sick friend&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="neeEkv"&gt;“Autonomous drones have unlimited potential to improve everyday life, and our technology opens the way to safe, secure, environmentally friendly deliveries for Kroger customers,” said Kroger CTO Beth Flippo. “The possibilities for customers are endless – we can enable Kroger customers to send chicken soup to a sick friend or get fast delivery of olive oil if they run out while cooking dinner.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="zlFJn2"&gt;Test flights, ahead of the consumer pilot, will begin this week from the Kroger Marketplace in Centerville, with flights managed from an on-site trailer with additional monitoring occurring offsite. A second pilot program is scheduled to launch this summer at a California Ralphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mcHvJI"&gt;Walmart has been dabbling in drone deliveries &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/26/9617600/walmart-drones-amazon-faa-test"&gt;since at least 2015&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>New trailers: Castlevania, West Side Story, Sweet Tooth, Luca, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p2d-94NMjGvMrcr__ZvKaUc5LwI=/244x0:1498x836/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69224311/castlevania.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Castlevania | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7iWXfZzEMc&amp;amp;ab_channel=Netflix" target="_blank"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="l7Rl5W"&gt;Just started watching season four of&lt;em&gt; The Handmaid’s Tale&lt;/em&gt; and I remember why I prefer the weekly release schedule for this show: Bingeing it is utterly draining (Monica Hesse makes this point much more eloquently in her mostly spoiler-free review in the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/handmaids-tale-season-4-exhausting/2021/04/28/df2cb0da-9d3d-11eb-b7a8-014b14aeb9e4_story.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The show has a conundrum: it can’t kill off its main character (which would be an incredible plot twist) and it can’t take her out of Gilead because that’s where the action is. So June has to keep suffering over and over. And over. After the first three episodes, June’s done plenty of suffering already. Over the rest of the season I’m really hoping to see A) much more of Alexis Bledel and Samira Wiley and B) something good happen to June. Anything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MLgnQ1"&gt;Here’s the roundup of this week’s trailers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1S8he4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2ZDEAH"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0k2OdEzq-dc?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0KzYfv"&gt;West Side Story&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PddrHZ"&gt;Steven Spielberg’s remake of the classic musical looks a lot like the original 1961 film at first glance (this &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18pNvg3ckdU&amp;amp;ab_channel=MattSkuta"&gt;side-by-side comparison&lt;/a&gt; from YouTuber Matt Skuta shows the many differences). But while the earlier film included white actors in makeup to play some of the Puerto Rican characters, &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/03/a-first-look-at-steven-spielbergs-west-side-story"&gt;Spielberg sought performers of Puerto Rican descent&lt;/a&gt; for his updated version. The spectacular Rita Moreno, who starred in the original as Anita appears in the Spielberg version, and is also an executive producer on the film. &lt;em&gt;West Side Story &lt;/em&gt;hits theaters (after a lengthy COVID-related delay) in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aQ2vOw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IXkqnS"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L7iWXfZzEMc?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="5KKK03"&gt;Castlevania&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="hdetTW"&gt;The latest 10-episode season of &lt;em&gt;Castlevania&lt;/em&gt; is going back to “where it all started,” according to the new trailer. The official synopsis from Netflix says “Wallachia collapses into chaos as factions clash” and mentions attempts to bring Dracula back from the dead (!!). “These are the end times.” This is the final season with this cast of characters (&lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/04/castlevania-canceled-end-season-4-premiere-date-netflix-new-series-universe-1234735439/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; has reported&lt;/a&gt; Netflix may launch a new series in the Castlevania-verse but with different characters), so expect plenty of blood. Season four of &lt;em&gt;Castlevania&lt;/em&gt; drops on Netflix May 13th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0zHFO3"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mYfJxlgR2jw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="M0KTUE"&gt;Luca&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="0jkQMI"&gt;OK so as a parent, I am always a bit wary of Disney/Pixar movies, because they are typically emotionally devastating for parents to watch (see: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLkasScy7A&amp;amp;ab_channel=MovieclipsTrailers"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Finding Nemo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or perhaps &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUAzGQ3nSY&amp;amp;ab_channel=Pixar"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inside Out&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or maybe the final scene of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjTO-fwgaVk&amp;amp;ab_channel=ABCTV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toy Story 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) (aaand I just cried all over again dammit). &lt;em&gt;Luca&lt;/em&gt; is the story of two young sea monsters who become human when they’re not in the water as they explore the surface world in a seaside town on the Italian Riviera. Seems safe enough and the trailer looks beautiful but Pixar always gets you, so don’t say I didn’t warn you. &lt;em&gt;Luca&lt;/em&gt; hits &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1042702/9358?subId1=VergeTrailers050321&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; on June 18th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Xasff6"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GrBw0pbF11s?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=2&amp;amp;start=2" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="T26mqk"&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Ax0GzX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt; is a post-apocalyptic fairytale based on a DC Comic, with Robert Downey, Jr. as executive producer (is that the most &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt;-y sentence I have ever written? Possibly.). Our hero is a very cute hybrid deer-boy played by Christian Convery, who’s searching for a new beginning after society has been upended by something called The Great Crumble. &lt;em&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt; arrives on Netflix June 4th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kmCugN"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tks_1uCO5kA?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="QqfM8V"&gt;Rick and Morty Season 5&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="snWwRQ"&gt;The second trailer for season 5 of&lt;em&gt; Rick and Morty&lt;/em&gt; picks up where the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6Zy_mLgSNQ&amp;amp;ab_channel=AdultSwim"&gt;first trailer&lt;/a&gt; left off, which is to say, in the middle of a chaotic space battle? with cyberpunk birds? that is a parody of the &lt;em&gt;Power Rangers&lt;/em&gt;? Sure, why not. &lt;em&gt;Rick and Morty&lt;/em&gt; returns to Adult Swim on June 20th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iFixit drilled a key ring hole into one of Apple’s AirTags in its latest teardown</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qjWuaqSWoKiT3T2cGOMQ104Oicc=/520x0:6139x3746/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69223010/AirTags_31.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;iFixit did a teardown of Apple’s AirTags | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/50145/airtag-teardown-part-one-yeah-this-tracks" target="_blank"&gt;iFixit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vEMTjh"&gt;The team over at iFixit has done its teardown thing again, this time examining Apple’s AirTag trackers. Part one of its two-part review digs into the guts of the little trackers, and for those lamenting the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22394644/apple-airtag-built-in-keychain-loop-design-price-accessories-debate"&gt;lack of a key ring loop on the AirTag&lt;/a&gt;, iFixit (carefully) drilled a hole into one without damaging any of its parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="toeOZh"&gt;After some reconnaissance inside our first AirTag, we grabbed a 1/16” drill bit and carefully punched a hole through the second tracker in our four-pack—after removing the battery, of course. We miraculously managed to avoid all chips, boards, and antennas, only drilling through plastic and glue. The best part? The AirTag survived the operation like a champ and works as if nothing happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="N4Fe6g"&gt;The team cautioned that you have to remove the battery before drilling, and warned that drilling in the wrong place can cause serious damage. So try this at home only if you have skill with a drill. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pw3-47lsHpedogYeyhCmkJXS_IQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22486455/AirTags_61_drill.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F50145%2Fairtag-teardown-part-one-yeah-this-tracks&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F2%2F22415831%2Fifixit-drilled-key-ring-hole-apple-airtag-tile-teardown" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener"&gt;iFixit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;iFixit drilled a hole into an AirTag for a keyring, and it survived&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ri8tQD"&gt;iFixit compared ‌its AirTags‌ to the Tile Mate and the Samsung Galaxy SmartTag. AirTags are the smallest of the bunch, with its 3-volt coin cell removable battery— type CR2032, same as the one SmartTags use—taking up most of the internal space. “All three trackers open up with finger power—no other tools required,” according to iFixit, but they found the AirTag’s was the most difficult to remove. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VGxgiDpbRXyrSG3dbBfBG7kjzwE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22486466/AirTags_58.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F50145%2Fairtag-teardown-part-one-yeah-this-tracks&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F2%2F22415831%2Fifixit-drilled-key-ring-hole-apple-airtag-tile-teardown" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener"&gt;iFixit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;From left: Tile Mate, Galaxy SmartTag, and Apple AirTag&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SE0xbz"&gt;An X-ray of the three tags shows Apple made efficient use of its internal space, nothing that “the relative darkness of the AirTag [in the X-ray image] is due to a hefty central speaker magnet and its steel battery cover. iFixit tweeted a 360-video of the X-ray image:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TVfSJM"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;What are we tearing down on iFixit tomorrow? All we know is it looks like it fell off of Tony Stark’s latest suit. Good thing we had help from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CreativeElctrn?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@CreativeElctrn&lt;/a&gt; Stay tuned   &lt;a href="https://t.co/IuYqlDPpr4"&gt;pic.twitter.com/IuYqlDPpr4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— iFixit (@iFixit) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/iFixit/status/1388549813231398924?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Facebook and Instagram notices in iOS apps tell users tracking helps keep them ‘free of charge’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EVoAbhSy-1RHpv5ExeQve9Q6zV4=/0x112:890x705/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69222709/SpeakingUp_SmBiz_1.5.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="479dsF"&gt;Facebook is continuing its campaign against Apple’s iOS 14 privacy updates, adding a notice within its iOS app telling users the information it collects from other apps and websites can “help keep Facebook free of charge.” A similar message was seen on Instagram’s iOS app (Facebook is Instagram’s parent company). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g6IAaY"&gt;Technology researcher Ashkan Soltani first noted the new pop-up notices on Saturday (see his tweet below), but a Facebook spokesperson directed &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/12/speaking-up-for-small-businesses/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; to a blog post&lt;/a&gt; from earlier last week that detailed the update. The company refers to the notices as “educational screens,” and said they provided “more details about how we use data for personalized ads,” according to the blog post by Dan Levy, Facebook’s vice president for ads and business products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dkNfJB"&gt;“This version of iOS requires us to ask for permission to track some data from this devices to improve your ads. Learn how we limit the use of this information if you don’t turn on this device setting,” the screen reads. “We use information about your activity received form other apps and websites to: show you ads that are more personalized, help keep Facebook free of charge [and] support businesses that rely on ads to reach their customers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HWpozB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;And it begins.  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Facebook?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Facebook&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/instagram?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Instagram&lt;/a&gt; explore additional scare tactics to combat &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Apple&lt;/a&gt; iOS14 &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ATT?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ATT&lt;/a&gt; privacy changes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Help keep Facebook free of charge” &lt;a href="https://t.co/mOB9WJpz9A"&gt;pic.twitter.com/mOB9WJpz9A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— ashkan soltani (@ashk4n) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashk4n/status/1388270878870310912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oCeMRL"&gt;The new opt-in requirements in the latest versions of iOS 14, including iOS 14.5,  require developers to get express consent from device owners to allow their Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) to be shared and collected across apps. Under Apple’s new policy, app developers are still able to use other information a user provides for targeted advertising, even if the user opts out of letting the app track them, but that information can’t be shared with another company for ad tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="gHGFRL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why Apple’s new privacy feature is such a big deal","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="EFu1Kt"&gt;If developers try to get around the opt-in requirement, or try to replace the IDFA with another piece of identifying information such as an email address, that app will be considered in violation of the opt-in requirement. The rules also apply to Apple’s own apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D3qB4Q"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22180102/facebook-new-newspaper-ad-apple-ios-14-privacy-prompt"&gt;Facebook has been a vocal critic&lt;/a&gt; of Apple’s iOS 14 privacy updates, arguing that the privacy changes could hurt small businesses which may rely on Facebook’s ad network to reach customers. In statements to the press and in newspaper ads, Facebook has said Apple is encouraging new business models for apps so they rely less on advertising and more on subscriptions, which would potentially give Apple a cut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sqb9H0"&gt;But the “keep Facebook/Instagram free” tactic seems to run counter to Facebook’s long-standing tagline which indicated the company was “free and always will be.” Of course, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-changes-free-and-always-will-be-slogan-on-homepage-2019-8"&gt;Facebook quietly removed that slogan from its homepage in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and CEO Mark &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/10/17220534/paid-facebook-ad-free-version-mark-zuckerberg-testimony"&gt;Zuckerberg didn’t rule out a paid version&lt;/a&gt; of Facebook when he testified before Congress in 2018. “There will always be a version of Facebook that is free,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="45wcCV"&gt; Zuckerberg called Apple out during &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/facebook-ceo-zuckerberg-says-it.html"&gt;Facebook’s January earnings call&lt;/a&gt;, referring to Apple as one of his company’s biggest competitors. “Apple has every incentive to use their dominant platform position to interfere with how our apps and other apps work, which they regularly do to preference their own,” Zuckerberg said. “This impacts the growth of millions of businesses around the world, including with the upcoming iOS 14 changes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ICqgd"&gt;Apple didn’t reply to a request for comment Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9w6JfA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: May 2nd, 1:40PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds information from Facebook including updated image of the screens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
