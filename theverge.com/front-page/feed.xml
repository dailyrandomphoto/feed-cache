    <title>Soon, the internet will make its own cat photos and then it won’t need us</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d4yObk8DEuj0UZi1OerNtwcvpCI=/128x0:2432x1536/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69113628/fake_cats.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;These cats do not exist.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RE2CK7"&gt;This cat doesn’t exist: &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cmu01yUZXdWzTjWVW2_3NL2lMKg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22438212/Screen_Shot_2021_04_12_at_8.15.22_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AI-made cat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IlGadq"&gt;This one doesn’t either:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_yyn9SIfYW8smJOi1UUa8ZXbJi0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22438217/Screen_Shot_2021_04_12_at_8.16.17_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fake cat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sn1upu"&gt;These are computer-generated images from &lt;a href="https://thiscatdoesnotexist.com/"&gt;This Cat Does Not Exist&lt;/a&gt;, and folks: I think we are in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9JquG"&gt;I understand this is going to sound crackpot, but hear me out. What if our computers are already smarter than us, and the only reason they’re pretending they aren’t is so we’ll continue feeding them their favorite thing, photos of our cats? I understand that in isolation this sounds ridiculous, but I don’t think it’s any sillier than the Singularity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wfkBuB"&gt;Under this theory, Skynet has already happened, but Skynet is benign because one of the first things we taught it was that cats were cute. And Skynet doesn’t have cats. We do. This is our major structural advantage: we can feed the internet fresh cat photos. It’s why the internet — thus far, anyway — has remained willing to continue human life as we know it: for our cats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pzu8jy"&gt;The problem, then, with This Cat Does Not Exist is that it allows the internet to make its own cat photos. That means Skynet doesn’t need us anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XT308v"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;None of these cats exist. All are GAN-generated images obtained from &lt;a href="https://t.co/AEMYeQ4ZrO"&gt;https://t.co/AEMYeQ4ZrO&lt;/a&gt;. Can we come up with a way to detect GAN-generated cat pics? &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CaturdayShenaniGANs?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#CaturdayShenaniGANs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(GAN = "generative adversarial network", the AI technique used to create the images)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;cc: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZellaQuixote?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@ZellaQuixote&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/gsaPJPGKEX"&gt;pic.twitter.com/gsaPJPGKEX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Conspirador Norteño (@conspirator0) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/conspirator0/status/1381006494901096449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GfacKS"&gt;This isn’t new, exactly — but last year, the &lt;a href="https://signum.ai/blog/ethics-of-artificial-intelligence/"&gt;computer-generated cats were horror shows&lt;/a&gt;. And yes, a people version exists already, but this isn’t an existential threat. We did not teach the computers that people are adorable. We taught them that &lt;em&gt;cats &lt;/em&gt;are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dWwp7U"&gt;One of these cats is real (and my own personal cat). The other one does not exist:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="v0QJk1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10442165"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="krnV31"&gt;The tells, as far as I can see, occur around the edge of the fur: it’s weirdly blurry. Also, as with the people version, the fake cat has an out-of-focus background. The coloration in the fake cat’s eyes is also a little less defined than my cat’s. Still, this is impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9lwEN4"&gt;The new batch of AI cats is limited — face only, no &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CG8ibLdhDsM/"&gt;goofball action&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes the ears don’t match — but they may very well represent the first step toward the Matrix-like future of humanity. Because if the machines don’t need our cat photos anymore, they don’t need us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tcc0Q6"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CN44ri"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The FCC wants you to test your internet speeds with its new app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JHlmb6KFsqm6T4hQ_5iCMlOCwA8=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69113495/acastro_170711_1777_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gigBoh"&gt;The Federal Communications Commission has released a new speed test app to help measure internet speeds across the country, available on both Android and iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0wSdls"&gt;The FCC Speed Test App works similarly to existing speed-testing apps like Ookla’s and Fast by Netflix, automatically collecting and displaying data once users press the “start testing” button. According to the FCC, the data collected through the app will inform the agency’s efforts to collect more accurate broadband speed information and aid its broadband deployment efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nL1ig9ZwBtfcjs94TnocuSIrTQA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22438239/Screenshot_20210412_105632_2.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The FCC’s Speed Test app allows users to test their speeds and share the data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FTFedW"&gt;“To close the gap between digital haves and have nots, we are working to build a comprehensive, user-friendly dataset on broadband availability,” Acting Chair Jessica Rosenworcel said in a statement Monday. “Expanding the base of consumers who use the FCC Speed Test app will enable us to provide improved coverage information to the public and add to the measurement tools we’re developing to show where broadband is truly available throughout the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xGbzB2"&gt;The app is part of the agency’s broader efforts to collect more accurate broadband speed data across the country. The FCC’s current coverage maps are built from self-reported data from internet service providers like AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon. In doing so, the process &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/24/17882842/us-internet-broadband-map-isp-fcc-wireless-competition"&gt;has allowed ISPs&lt;/a&gt; to exaggerate their current coverage, drawing heated criticism from broadband access advocates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4txKTV"&gt;Earlier this year, the FCC asked the public to fact-check ISP data by entering in their address &lt;a href="https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/#/location-summary?version=jun2020&amp;amp;place_name=841%20Dekalb%20Avenue,%20Brooklyn,%20New%20York%2011221,%20United%20States&amp;amp;lat=40.692494&amp;amp;lon=-73.942573&amp;amp;tech=acfosw&amp;amp;speed=25_3&amp;amp;vlat=40.692895347542816&amp;amp;vlon=-73.94148198151618&amp;amp;vzoom=17.07215139040399"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and submitting &lt;a href="https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360001440131"&gt;a form here&lt;/a&gt; if the information described is incorrect. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook pins state vaccine information to the top of the News Feed for US users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fHzxHMDNgZz3cIahqSgeCEwwJGM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69113471/mdoying_180118_2249_facebook_0445stills_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Michele Doying / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AOo2aG"&gt;As all adults across the US become eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, Facebook is making it easier for its users to find information based on where they live. The company has started rolling out a feature that pins a box with state-specific information about &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/state-covid-19-vaccine-information/"&gt;where to get a COVID-19 vaccine&lt;/a&gt; at the top of the News Feed for every US user living in a state where the general public is eligible to receive the shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AmIyfF"&gt;The box, once available, will appear at the top of your News Feed and show you state-specific information, confirming that you are now eligible to receive the vaccine, including a link on where to find the vaccine in your province, as seen in the image below:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HhaQxfqUxA3kr4gpBRtres2Ui7w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22437890/NRP_Covid_Vaccine_Eligibility_Notifications_banner.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new feature is a box that is pinned to your News Feed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BqRhSu"&gt;Most US states have now made vaccination appointments available to all adults, although &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-19-vaccine-eligibility.html"&gt;some states&lt;/a&gt; are still lagging. With more availability, it has become a challenge for some people in certain parts of the US to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22279023/covid-19-vaccine-appointment-how-to"&gt;book an appointment&lt;/a&gt;, leading &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/31/22256167/covid-vaccine-website-nyc-appointment"&gt;some volunteers to build dedicated websites&lt;/a&gt; to help people in their search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4sRMz0"&gt;The feature is also available in “nearly 20 countries,” according to Facebook, with the ultimate goal to release it in more areas as countries begin opening COVID-19 vaccinations to the general public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="90l29M"&gt;Facebook rolled out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22177085/facebook-covid-19-misinformation-notifications"&gt;a similar feature to its mobile app last year&lt;/a&gt;, which helped fight misinformation about COVID-19 appearing on its platform as the site &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253055/facebook-q4-2020-earnings-report-app-usage-record-user-numbers"&gt;saw a surge in users&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook says more than 3 million US users clicked through those promotions between January and March, suggesting the new vaccine links may reach a significant number of Facebook users in the months to come.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is making another attempt at personal health records</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g_3TPIhcjuJgw_6OaYLUFLfEd68=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69113302/acastro_210121_1777_google_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9SuMOA"&gt;Google is recruiting people to give feedback for a new consumer-facing medical records tool, &lt;em&gt;Stat News &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/04/09/google-health-records-app-care-studio/"&gt;reported on Friday&lt;/a&gt;. The company wants to know how people want to interact with information pulled from their medical records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m0DU0G"&gt;Right now, the company is recruiting around 300 people who use Android devices in Northern California, Atlanta, and Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="25PYkO"&gt;This is Google’s second attempt at creating a way for people to access their medical records. In 2008, it launched Google Health, which aimed to give people a way to see their health information online. It didn’t take off, and Google shut it down in 2012. “We haven’t found a way to translate that limited usage into widespread adoption in the daily health routines of millions of people,” Google wrote in a 2011 &lt;a href="https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/06/update-on-google-health-and-google.html"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y4NI8x"&gt;In the aftermath, experts had a number of different theories for the failure: some thought it was because consumers at the time &lt;a href="https://www.crn.com/news/mobility/video/300077425/why-did-google-health-fail.htm"&gt;weren’t actually interested&lt;/a&gt; in taking direct control of their health records. &lt;a href="https://www.pulseitmagazine.com.au/news/australian-ehealth/954-feature-why-did-google-health-fail"&gt;Others said&lt;/a&gt; Google didn’t do enough to integrate with the health IT landscape or that the company didn’t do enough to show people that it could be trusted with their health data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="feNhZk"&gt;A decade later, we’re in a very different digital health landscape. Apple launched a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/29/17176740/apple-health-records-app-ios-update"&gt;health records section&lt;/a&gt; in its Health app in 2018, which lets people pull their records from hospitals and clinics directly onto their iPhone. Health apps have proliferated, wearables are adopting wellness features, and people are more and more accustomed to handling their health information through smartphones and other devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NX7Fiq"&gt;Google is also working on the doctor-facing side of health records; its &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/23/google-project-nightingale-care-studio/"&gt;Care Studio&lt;/a&gt; program gives clinicians a way to search through patient records more easily. Other health efforts include a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165465/google-health-research-app-covid-flu-apple"&gt;research app&lt;/a&gt; that lets Android users participate in medical studies and a Nest Hub feature that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22331567/google-nest-hub-new-2021-smart-display-sleep-tracking-soli-price-specs-features"&gt;tracks sleep&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9YNi6q"&gt;Google is “making progress” on the consumer health record initiative, Bob Wachter, chair of the department of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/04/09/google-health-records-app-care-studio/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Stat News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He advises Google on its health records projects. “It didn’t knock my socks off,” he said, but “I think they’re doing it in a thoughtful, measured, and mature way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pizr5q"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM rolls out a new cloud-based mapping service for nearly 1 million vehicles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h8m-fDlThFeh7V7Pa2YLOWBAwyo=/0x0:5700x3800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69113078/GM_Maps_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fCnrKe"&gt;General Motors is launching a new in-car mapping service for nearly 1 million of its vehicles. The new service is called Maps Plus, and it will be powered by &lt;a href="https://www.mapbox.com/"&gt;Mapbox&lt;/a&gt;, the open-source-based map provider that competes against Google and Here for enterprise deals for customized and in-app maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SBLSuk"&gt;In addition to in-car navigation, Maps Plus will also integrate with other popular apps, including music streaming services like Spotify or voice assistants like Alexa, which will appear as individual widgets superimposed over the map. While plotting a destination, Maps Plus will also notify the driver of the current speed limit or if they will need to refuel along the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6ui4I6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Maps Plus is designed for vehicle owners who didn’t purchase the option for in-car navigation when they bought their vehicle&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="94NsGS"&gt;Maps Plus is designed for vehicle owners who didn’t purchase the option for in-car navigation when they bought their vehicle, said Tim Babbitt, senior manager for digital experiences at GM. While a “significant percentage” of people do opt for navigation, there are vehicle packages that generally don’t include it, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FW6GMu"&gt;GM says the service will be available to select model year 2018 and newer Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, and Cadillac vehicles by the end of 2021. Maps Plus will be offered as part of GM’s OnStar &lt;a href="https://www.onstar.com/us/en/plans-pricing/connected-services/"&gt;Connected Services subscription service&lt;/a&gt;, which starts at $14.99 a month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a9dGt8"&gt;Obviously, many car owners use popular services like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto that mirror their phone’s interface on the infotainment screen in their vehicle. But Babbitt says those services don’t offer the same type of embedded experience that GM is offering with Maps Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xTBsyv"&gt;“With an embedded experience that can work with all of the signals of the vehicle, there’s integrations that are possible that we think the customer would find very helpful to have,” he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It’s an end-to-end integrated type of experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qFrMVB"&gt;Many automakers have made deals to integrate apps and navigation provided by major tech companies like Google. Ford recently made such a deal, along with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20906777/volvo-xc40-suv-ev-native-android-auto-google-assistant-maps"&gt;Volvo&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-renault-nissan-google/renault-nissan-adopts-android-in-coup-for-google-idUSKCN1LY0RO"&gt;Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, to use Google to power its software and vehicle infotainment services. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20851021/general-motors-android-auto-google-infotainment"&gt;GM also made a deal with Google&lt;/a&gt; for vehicles that are model year 2022 and on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PS4W4m"&gt;But Babbitt says Maps Plus is meant to “fill the gap of the customers that don’t have embedded nav today, and to make sure that everybody has the ability to have a strong embedded experience in their vehicle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qABVrW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Topps is releasing official NFT baseball cards on April 20th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TkvIRblghz1uDuj6ZM6mLSwR5RU=/73x0:2599x1684/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69112909/Screen_Shot_2021_04_12_at_9.42.37_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3vs5go"&gt;Major League Baseball has announced its latest move to cash &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.topps.com%2Fblog%2Ftopps-debuts-its-first-mlb-baseball-card-nft-collection-with-topps-series-1-baseball-launch-.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F12%2F22379645%2Ftopps-mlb-basecall-cards-nft-collectible-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in on the NFT craze&lt;/a&gt;: official blockchain-based versions of classic Topps baseball cards. Topps is selling the new NFT baseball cards &lt;a href="https://on.wax.io/toppsmlb/"&gt;through the WAX blockchain&lt;/a&gt;, which the company has used for its earliest blockchain-based collectibles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n6Q4MU"&gt;The first “Series 1” cards will be sold starting on April 20th, with 50,000 standard packs (containing six cards for $5) and around 24,000 premium packs (offering 45 cards for $100) set to be sold in the first wave. Topps is also offering a free “exclusive Topps MLB Opening Day NFT Pack” to the first 10,000 users who sign up for email alerts for new releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OdxajJ"&gt;It’s a similar idea to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22348858/nba-nft-top-shot-dapper-labs"&gt;NBA’s white-hot Top Shot NFTs&lt;/a&gt;, which offer fans purchasable video clips (called Moments) in card-like packs. Top Shot Moments are already a massive business — some have sold for upwards of $200,000, and more than 800,000 accounts have yielded over $500 million in sales so far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Ftz8aY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The NBA tries to make a slam dunk out of NFTs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22348858/nba-nft-top-shot-dapper-labs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="fuKaa3"&gt;And while the Topps baseball cards won’t be full-fledged videos like Top Shot Moments, the company is planning to take advantage of the digital nature of the NFT cards by adding things like animated backgrounds or holographic effects on rarer cards. It’s not the MLB’s first dip into cryptocurrency, either: the league has experimented with Ethereum-based blockchain bobbleheads in its &lt;a href="https://www.mlbcryptobaseball.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MLB Champions&lt;/em&gt; game, too&lt;/a&gt;. The Topps cards promise a more traditional style of collectible, however. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kK8lnE"&gt;Topps’ collectible baseball cards have been around for decades and bring a level of name recognition and respectability to the world of collectibles that other NFT efforts may lack. But it’ll still have to convince fans that the digital versions of those cards are a sound investment and not just a bubble that’s waiting to burst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="R3hP3b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Uber reported bookings for its ride-hailing business rose 9 percent in March</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oxvUR7TPptxuvG2CUYEvBuAtEIs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69112783/acastro_180927_1777_uber_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dvLIcP"&gt;Uber saw record gross bookings in March 2021, according to a filing posted Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The increase may signal the beginning of a comeback for the ride-hailing business, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22277043/uber-lyft-earnings-q4-2020-profit-loss-covid"&gt;suffered mightily in 2020&lt;/a&gt; due to the coronavirus pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gP9gTT"&gt;Uber’s mobility segment, which includes its ride-hailing business, was up 9 percent between February and March 2021, with an annualized run rate of $30 billion. Uber’s food delivery segment UberEats, which helped the company stave off even bigger losses in 2020, doubled its annual run rate from March of last year, coming in at $52 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="koyRPK"&gt;“As vaccination rates increase in the United States, we are observing that consumer demand for Mobility is recovering faster than driver availability, and consumer demand for Delivery continues to exceed courier availability,” Uber said in the SEC filing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oPETlm"&gt;In February, &lt;a href="https://investor.uber.com/news-events/news/press-release-details/2021/Uber-Announces-Results-for-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020/default.aspx"&gt;Uber reported&lt;/a&gt; it lost $968 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 and had a net loss of $6.7 billion for the year, which improved on its $8.5 billion loss in full-year 2019. Its UberEats division saw gross bookings rise 130 percent in the fourth quarter, to $10.05 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oXroKw"&gt;Uber said on April 7th that it was launching a $250 million “stimulus” of incentives for its drivers to coax them back behind the wheel. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uber.com%2Fnewsroom%2Fgetting-drivers-back-on-the-road%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F12%2F22379610%2Fuber-bookings-ride-hailing-increase-march" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;company said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; announcing the incentive program that many drivers had stopped driving in 2020 because they weren’t getting enough trips to make it worth their time. Dennis Cinelli, Uber’s vice president for mobility in the US and Canada, wrote in the post that “in 2021, there are more riders requesting trips than there are drivers available to give them—making it a great time to be a driver.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HHXg6i"&gt;In Monday’s filing, Uber also cautioned that it expects a “significant accrual” in costs after it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22334771/uber-uk-drivers-workers-benefits-employees-decision"&gt;reclassified all its drivers in the UK as workers&lt;/a&gt; last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9dwpEM"&gt;Uber will release its &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210412005255/en/Uber-Announces-Date-of-First-Quarter-2021-Results-Conference-Call"&gt;first-quarter financial results&lt;/a&gt; on May 5th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pmV8hH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; An earlier version of this article stated that Uber’s ride-hailing business was up 9 percent year-over-year in March; it was up 9 percent from February 2021 to March 2021. We regret the error. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Docs and Sheets experienced a partial outage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pf9Z7jsT7ytRYdGiK5JQklJAIwQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69112643/acastro_180427_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9j2h7t"&gt;Multiple Google services experienced a partial outage on Monday, with some users unable to create new documents in Google Docs and Google Sheets. &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/appsstatus#hl=en&amp;amp;v=status"&gt;Google’s Workspace Status Dashboard&lt;/a&gt; reported that Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Classroom all experienced service disruptions. As of 11:26AM ET Google said that service had been restored for “some users” adding that “we expect a resolution for all users in the near future.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imeGt9"&gt;As of 12PM ET, we’ve verified that the issues we were experiencing appear to be resolved. Google has since updated its dashboard to note that service has been fully restored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H33m1k"&gt;While the issues were ongoing, trying to create a new document in Google Docs caused  the following error message to appear: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="YfJXEm"&gt;Google Docs encountered an error. Please try reloading this page, or coming back to it in a few minutes.&lt;br&gt;To learn more about the Google Docs editors, please visit our &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/docs/?hl=en&amp;amp;p=error_help"&gt;help center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’re sorry for the inconvenience.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;- The Google Docs Team&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="bEXDnA"&gt;The issue was acknowledged by Google in a support message &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/appsstatus#hl=en&amp;amp;v=issue&amp;amp;sid=4&amp;amp;iid=a456acfa5bae03b9075bec69695292c6"&gt;posted at 9:36AM ET&lt;/a&gt;. “The affected users are able to access Google Drive, but are seeing error messages, high latency, and/or other unexpected behavior,” the update said, “Affected user are unable to create new documents.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/abO5HasW3KaRxsBTz8mlTceF-2Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22437916/msedge_RnQ6D0YkJb.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An error message appeared in Google Docs when users tried to create a new document.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DO8VSZ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/"&gt;Downdetector showed spikes&lt;/a&gt; in issues with Google Drive, Google Classroom, and Google itself, though we’ve didn’t encounter any issues on Google’s main search site. The outage appeared to occur in multiple countries, if &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=google%20docs%20down&amp;amp;src=typed_query"&gt;reports on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; were anything to go by. We experienced issues in the UK and US.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google reported partial outages across Drive, Docs, Sheets, and Slides.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vLCzlF"&gt;There’s never a good time for an outage, but problems like this are particularly bad with so many people currently working and studying from home. Happy Monday, everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7SGIpC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 12th, 12:34PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated with news that issues appear to have been resolved.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Amazon Echo deals right now </title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mj7LGifJ1euP-dbrplwPMhD36I4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67781485/dseifert_191123_3810_0012.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TNieh7"&gt;When it comes to the Echo smart speakers, Amazon has a slew of devices to choose from, one for practically every occasion. For example, maybe you simply want to add Alexa to a room, or you are looking for an Echo device that will allow you to easily manage your other smart home products. Regardless of the reason, these are the best Echo deals currently available right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zNwIju"&gt;Echo Dot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="maQ5h0"&gt;Last year, Amazon released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;4th generation of the Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which looks more like a sphere than an actual dot. But if you prefer the previous design, don’t worry — Amazon has not discontinued the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;3rd-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which still retains the familiar dot shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyVkKL"&gt;During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we saw the 4th-gen Echo Dot go down to its lowest price of $30. But, if you want an Echo Dot now, you can buy it for its usual $50 price tag at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ8C8F5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733331480519791842#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-smart-speaker-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795702%3Fpreselect%3D80770243%26clkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. There is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-With-Clock-4th-Gen/dp/B085M66LH1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a model with a built-in LED display&lt;/a&gt; to show the time, weather, and other information that is available for $60, its usual price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YHsulr"&gt;Amazon is also selling some bundles, including a $50 one that features &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08K4FDPHZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one Sengled Bluetooth bulb&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Amazon-Smart-Charcoal/dp/B08GTWC9ZB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot and Amazon Smart Plug bundle&lt;/a&gt; available for $60. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QG96M6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zX6pQw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot Kids Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LzhwpX"&gt;The 4th-gen Echo Dot Kids Edition is as spherical as its adult version but is designed to look like a tiger or panda. The device also comes with a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which provides access to a slew of kid-friendly content, like audiobooks and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmKSqg"&gt;We have seen this product go down to $40; but no discounts are available, instead it’s usual $60 price is available &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B084J4QQK1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725323423176814123#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-kids-edition-with-parental-controls%2F-%2FA-81795703%3Fpreselect%3D81502548%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergebestechodeals02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="wOHvPj"&gt;The 4th-gen Amazon Echo smart home hub has also gotten an updated look. Like the 4th-gen Echo Dot, the 2020 Amazon Echo has a sphere-shaped design, but it’s noticeably bigger than the Echo Dot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JjodUT"&gt;Currently, the fourth generation Echo available for $100 (usual price) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XKF5RM3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733330369536034962#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-4th-gen-smart-home-hub-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795705%3Fpreselect%3D80770246%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergebestechodeals02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xiNGuc"&gt;If you are looking for a pair of Amazon Echo devices, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589613981487950#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is selling an Amazon Echo two-pack for $180&lt;/a&gt;, which knocks $20 off its normal retail price. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="cZGT85"&gt;If you’re interested in an Alexa smart speaker with better audio quality and Dolby Atmos support, the Echo Studio is the Amazon product to check out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8dmbf"&gt;There are no deals currently available for the Echo Studio, but it is available for purchase at its usual price of $200 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Studio/dp/B07G9Y3ZMC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725325990660946512" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D411Fi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9536569"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18714432/amazon-echo-show-5-alexa-smart-alarm-display-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WiqTO4"&gt;If you are looking for an Echo device that functions more as a smart clock than an entertainment speaker, the Echo Show 5 is the one to consider. The Echo Show 5 includes a 5.5-inch display, making it easy to fit just about anywhere inside your home. Not only does the device include a built-in camera, but there’s also a physical shutter on the device, allowing you to block the camera’s view while keeping the always-on microphone active. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wsps6q"&gt;The Echo Show 5 usually costs $90 and we have seen it go down as low as $45. At the moment, the Echo Show 5 is on sale for $80 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HZLHPKP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589653641321861" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-5-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-77282772%3Fpreselect%3D76612867%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="xJmJw1"&gt;Amazon also has a few bundles available; you can get an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089Q2RJH9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 and three months of Amazon Kids Plus&lt;/a&gt; for $81, an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086P992GD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 and a 1080p Wi-Fi security camera&lt;/a&gt; for $90, and an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SW188FP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 plus an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $100. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QVFAcO"&gt;Best Buy is currently selling a bundle with the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730445461281046110#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 and a 1080p Wi-Fi security camera&lt;/a&gt; for $90.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="efoU4U"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Show 8 features an eight-inch display; it costs $40 more than the Echo Show 5. When stacked up against the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;, which is its closest competitor in terms of price and functionality, the Echo Show 8 is the better option for a few reasons: it has a slightly larger display, better speakers, and a camera, allowing you to use it as a video chatting device, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zoom calls&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcMAEq"&gt;We have seen the Show 8 go down as low as $65. The Echo Show 8 is currently on sale for $110 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PF1Y28C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589734209430134#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-8-hd-8in-smart-display%2F-%2FA-81795783%3Fpreselect%3D78656158%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="VVGDbb"&gt;Recently, Amazon released a third-generation Echo Show 10. This device features a 10.1-inch HD screen and unlike the Show 5 and 8, this model allows you to adjust the angle of the screen. It is also mounted on a motorized swiveling base that lets the screen follow you as you move. If you plan on doing a lot of video calling, this is the model to get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z9Ka9y"&gt;Right now, Amazon’s Echo Show 10 is on sale for the first time ever. You can grab the latest generation Echo Show 10 for $200 ($50 off) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHZ41L8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733329406175831312#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-10-3rd-gen-hd-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-82381551&amp;amp;sharedid=vergedeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s last-gen Kindle Oasis e-reader is $170 at Woot</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KCzr6b"&gt;If you missed out on Woot’s deal a few weeks ago that offered refurbished Kindle Oasis e-readers for $100, there’s another good deal happening today. The last-gen version of the Oasis is once again available, but it’s new with special offers (Amazon’s lock screen ads) and &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/VergeLastGenKindle041221/https://www.woot.com/offers/amazon-oasis-e-reader-32gb-wifi-only-gold-2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costs $170&lt;/a&gt;. For context, a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07F7TLZF4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new Oasis costs $250&lt;/a&gt;. As for what’s different between the current model and this one, you’ll miss out on a screen that can adapt its color temperature to your environment. But you’ll still get a waterproof e-reader &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/5/30/18644795/kindle-oasis-amazon-button-page-turn-book-e-reader"&gt;that feels more like a book&lt;/a&gt; to use than other models, says my colleague Chaim Gartenberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yWa1Jd"&gt;This deal loops in the 32GB model in gold. The sale will end later today, if it doesn’t sell out first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="YRWJ8E"&gt;Best Buy is offering big discounts &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1737564647376876492#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on several Apple-made iPhone cases&lt;/a&gt;. Included in the bunch are cases for the iPhone 12 mini with MagSafe support, the iPhone 11 Pro series, the iPhone XR, iPhone XS Max, and more. The range includes leather cases, smart battery cases, and silicone cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="N1C264"&gt;Several retailers have lowered the price of the new Echo Show 10 smart display to $200 (from $250), which is the best price yet. But &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08M1N8522?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;only at Amazon can you check out&lt;/a&gt; with a free Ring smart bulb added to the order for no extra charge. There have been a few models of the Echo Show 10, but this one has a motorized base that lets the screen swivel around to remain visible as you move around the room. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;My colleague Dan Seifert recently posted a review about it&lt;/a&gt;, so check it out if you’re curious to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="5nfW6L"&gt;A reputable seller on eBay is selling “not pink” &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FGoogle-Pixel-3-with-64GB-Memory-Cell-Phone-Unlocked-Not-Pink-New-SEALED-%2F363296604619%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26toolid%3D20008%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F4%2F12%2F22379599%2Famazon-kindle-oasis-ereader-iphone-case-echo-show-10-google-pixel-3-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Pixel 3s with 64GB of storage for just $170&lt;/a&gt;. Each phone is carrier unlocked and comes sealed in its original packaging. As a Pixel 3 owner, this price seems good to me for a new model. This phone’s battery life isn’t great, but its stock Android software, camera performance, and display quality are still fantastic a few years on. If you’re capped at $200 for a new phone that you can use on any carrier, it’s tough to beat this value. Though, you should know that Android 12 may be the last major software update that’s set to come to this model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rgwqrf"&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/config/refurbished_pixel_3?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sells this model refurbished for $250 at its online store&lt;/a&gt;, just to illustrate how good this deal for a new phone is.&lt;/p&gt;
