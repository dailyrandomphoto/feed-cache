    <title>The bitter lawsuit hanging over the Apple Watch’s new swipe keyboard</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lf7t7XTCie4KES3CJ5bsAFEKnWQ=/141x0:1640x999/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69869170/3tX1ydZgxW.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, Apple really did type “copy” into its own keyboard during the event.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Apple allegedly offered to buy his app; instead, it’s being Sherlocked&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="7J0PhN"&gt;In January 2019, Kosta Eleftheriou had every reason to believe Apple was about to make a deal, his lawsuit alleges. Apple’s head of keyboards &lt;em&gt;loved &lt;/em&gt;his FlickType keyboard app for the Apple Watch, gushing over how few mistakes it made. “Apple should buy this from you,” the man exclaimed, saying it “could be a key feature for the watch.” He demoed it for the Apple Watch team on January 24th, where a senior engineer allegedly gushed too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TlJd8e"&gt;That evening, Eleftheriou received a message from Apple, but not the one he expected. In the course of one afternoon, the company had seemingly decided that Apple Watch keyboards were against the rules. “Specifically, the app is a keyboard for Apple Watch. For this reason, your app will be removed from sale on the App Store at this time,” Apple wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x0RHrV"&gt;This Tuesday, Apple revealed its own swipe keyboard app alongside the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JmmCZf"&gt;Eleftheriou had been Sherlocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cN0A7V"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So now we know. See you in court, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Apple&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/hJtPI2Z83J"&gt;https://t.co/hJtPI2Z83J&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/1s7MUSLTpc"&gt;pic.twitter.com/1s7MUSLTpc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1437845736951992321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Dvc5W8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sherlocked&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DS3fQr"&gt;He’s far from the first. Apple has a long history of looking to its own app developers for inspiration, copying their ideas, and integrating them into its own operating systems for free. (It’s called “Sherlocking” because Apple famously copied a lot of features from the third-party Watson app over to its Sherlock desktop search tool in 2002; here are some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/4/18651190/apple-ios-13-mac-os-catalina-third-party-apps-products-copy-wwdc-2019"&gt;more&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/5/17428598/ios-12-apps-features-third-party-clones-bitmoji-houseparty"&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133023/apple-bluemail-blix-restored-mac-app-store-sherlocking-patent-lawsuit"&gt;examples&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6zfBkO"&gt;But this isn’t your typical case of whether a developer should be entitled to their income or whether users deserve the functionality for free — and not just &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1437899751496769541"&gt;because Apple’s making users pay for a new Watch to get it&lt;/a&gt;.  When Apple blocked his app two years ago and continued to tussle with him over updates, the company made an enemy of Eleftheriou. He’s become one of Apple’s most vocal critics, developing a reputation as a scam hunter. He continually and effectively points out that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;Apple is terrible at keeping out frauds&lt;/a&gt; which bilk ordinary users out of outrageous sums of money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="BLa2oV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s $64 billion-a-year App Store isn’t catching the most egregious scams","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"},{"title":"Eight things Apple could do to prove it actually cares about App Store users","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22654197/apple-app-store-editorial-scams-refunds"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="TpIt0S"&gt;In March, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22336380/apple-app-store-scam-lawsuit-kosta-eleftheriou-flicktype-ios-developer"&gt;he filed a lawsuit against the company over his app&lt;/a&gt;, alleging that the company continued to reject and hold up his Apple Watch keyboard for months in an attempt to force him to sell it to Apple for cheap. “Evidently, Apple thought Plaintiff would simply give up and sell its application to Apple at a discount,” &lt;a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/499290311/Kpaw-LLC-v-Apple-Inc#from_embed&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22336380/apple-app-store-scam-lawsuit-kosta-eleftheriou-flicktype-ios-developer&amp;amp;xcust=___vg__p_22100421__t_w__r_google.com__d_D"&gt;the complaint reads&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kEjYab"&gt;Here’s the part where you might be thinking: “Wait, didn’t Apple ban every keyboard app for the Apple Watch back in 2019?” or “Didn’t Eleftheriou just tweet that rejection message and say ‘see you in court’ a couple days ago?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pXLYTJ"&gt;The timeline’s a little confusing, it’s true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9SL6Hu"&gt;Yes, Eleftheriou filed his suit nearly six full months before the Apple Watch Series 7 announcement. It’s not clear what impact the Sherlocking might have on the suit, and he won’t say. His lawyers are advising him against saying too much to journalists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="MwCU4u"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Let’s untangle the timeline&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0szggv"&gt;But no, Apple didn’t actually reject every Apple Watch keyboard app in 2019 — Eleftheriou believes his app was singled out for this treatment. &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shift-keyboard-swipe-type/id1452694750"&gt;Shift Keyboard&lt;/a&gt; had already arrived in February 2019, and even partner apps that included Eleftheriou’s keyboard tech (the complaint names Nano for Reddit, Chirp for Twitter and Lens for Instagram) allegedly made it through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FkarpU"&gt;Apple tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it changed its mind over time. Originally, the company didn’t think it was appropriate for a keyboard to take up the entirety of the Apple Watch’s small screen, but decided differently in 2019 after it saw the potential and says it’s encouraged Apple Watch keyboards ever since. The company basically admits that removing Eleftheriou’s app was a mistake, and claims it quickly corrected the issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6jM85i"&gt;But Eleftheriou disputes that last point, saying it took a year of appeals and resubmissions to get his keyboard back onto the store. “From [January 2019] on, I was simultaneously discussing a FlickType acquisition with them, while also being rejected,” he tells me. And Apple initially made it look like those appeals failed, too. “The App Review Board evaluated your app and determined that the original rejection feedback is valid. Please note that all appeal results are final,” reads Eleftheriou from a message he received in May 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YJC81x"&gt;In the complaint, he alleges it wasn’t until January 2020, a year after the surprise takedown, that his Apple Watch keyboard extension was approved. When FlickType for Apple Watch did finally arrive, it became the number one paid app in the entire store, pulled in $130,000 in its first month, he claims, and was named &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/story/id1535572713/"&gt;one of Apple’s top paid apps of 2020&lt;/a&gt;. That’s what he’s using as grounds that he’s been financially harmed in the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5GnWbN"&gt;Not that he’s necessarily too worried about finances right now. “The FlickType income, yeah, I do expect it to eventually disappear given that the functionality will now be built-in,” he says, casually. “I don’t have a day job, but yeah this isn’t a big financial problem for me,” he adds when I ask. I wonder if he made good money &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/pinterest-acquires-team-that-builtfleksy-inc-1466021492"&gt;when he sold his keyboard company Fleksy to Pinterest&lt;/a&gt; roughly five years ago. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/2/10900456/microsoft-swiftkey-acquisition-reported-250-million"&gt;Microsoft bought keyboard app SwiftKey for roughly $250 million&lt;/a&gt; just months earlier.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ll0yzt"&gt;Eleftheriou says FlickType has “mostly been a hobby,” but his other hobby — hunting down scam apps and calling out the App Store’s failings — stems from this whole situation, too. He was fed up watching competing apps thrive, including scams, after his own had been blocked by App Review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXy0HE"&gt;And last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22627515/flicktype-ios-keyboard-discontinued-blind-visually-impaired"&gt;Eleftheriou publicly gave up on his popular iPhone keyboard extension for the blind&lt;/a&gt; after one too many rejections, due to what he describes as the latest misunderstanding by Apple’s App Review team of how his app (and the company’s own VoiceOver screen reader technology) are supposed to work.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="q8n3rg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It's with a heavy heart today that we're announcing the discontinuation of our award-winning iPhone keyboard for blind users.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple has thrown us obstacle after obstacle for years while we try to provide an app to improve people's lives, and we can no longer endure their abuse. &lt;a href="https://t.co/cH1HCQzeP1"&gt;pic.twitter.com/cH1HCQzeP1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— FlickType Watch Keyboard (@FlickType) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FlickType/status/1427292830523744257?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CRdQ69"&gt;“Our rejection history already spans more than FOURTY [sic] pages filled with repeated, unwarranted, &amp;amp; unreasonable rejections that serve to frustrate &amp;amp; delay rather than benefit end-users. And dealing with App Review isn’t just time-consuming. It’s also very emotionally draining,” he wrote at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B1BPQm"&gt;Apple effectively tells me this, too, was a mistake on its part. The company says it now realizes the keyboard does in fact comply with its guidelines, has explained that to Eleftheriou several times, and has repeatedly encouraged him to submit the app again. Apple would prefer that he doesn’t take it away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8H7idJ"&gt;But Eleftheriou says he’s had enough. Here’s the statement he sent me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="65BG7X"&gt;I will be delighted to bring back the accessible FlickType Keyboard for iPhone when Apple finally fixes their broken 3rd-party keyboard APIs on iOS and allows developers to fairly compete with Apple’s own keyboard. They must also ensure that every single reviewer has basic VoiceOver training - we keep getting rejections due to reviewers not knowing or even understanding how to use VoiceOver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nMSeyl"&gt;I’ve already poured thousands of hours developing my app, working around countless keyboard API issues and dealing with app review, so I’m really looking forward to Apple’s improvements and will promptly re-submit the FlickType VoiceOver keyboard when sufficient progress has been made in these areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OrE2Qb"&gt;As a separate note, I’m also calling on Apple to allow developers to access their own rejection history. Apple currently hides this from developers and even refuses to provide it upon request. It’s unacceptable that Apple will send us rejection messages that disappear shortly after, with no way to access them ever again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="KGCtwr"&gt;He’s particularly annoyed with how Apple’s own keyboard has an unfair advantage since it doesn’t need to use its own APIs, and how those APIs are lacking features &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1430271507305881600"&gt;that Apple publicly promised years ago&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQepWa"&gt;Technically, Eleftheriou is the one making the iPhone keyboard extension disappear, not Apple. It still exists in the current version on the store. He submitted a new version that removes the extension, one that’s currently pending with Apple’s App Review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="rdnJxC"&gt;For now, Eleftheriou is going to take his keyboard and go home. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hundreds of T-Mobile stores will be able to fix phones soon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="T-Mobile Data Breach Affects 40 Million People" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/19ADhN7Y624a9A-3P9RN9ehAdP8=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69869166/1334909491.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="li5Bon"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fdevices%2Ft-mobile-adds-in-store-repairs-and-more-device-protection-benefits-for-customers&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F16%2F22677969%2Ft-mobile-retail-store-repair-protection-program-increased-claims" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile announced&lt;/a&gt; that 500 of its retail stores would start offering repair services starting on November 1st. The company says technicians will provide same-day fixes using manufacturer-approved parts to customers who subscribe to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fdevices%2Fphone-protection-plans&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F16%2F22677969%2Ft-mobile-retail-store-repair-protection-program-increased-claims" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;its Protection&amp;lt;360&amp;gt; service&lt;/a&gt;, which also includes device replacement in case of loss or theft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RPKppu"&gt;T-Mobile is also improving that device protection plan by letting customers make five claims in a 12-month period, up from the previous limit of three. The claims are handled by Assurant and come with a deductible based on what kind of phone you have and what kind of claim you’re making. Still, it’s likely to be cheaper than buying five new phones if you wind up having &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/s-1WxfsJzPM?t=33"&gt;an 18-karat run of bad luck&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZuvseH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Assurant technicians will be handling the in-store repairs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cSZCc0"&gt;Interestingly, this change has echoes of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22587790/t-mobile-sprint-acquisition-dish-promises"&gt;contentious T-Mobile / Sprint merger&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href="https://mytmoclaim.com/media/3234583/CL05179-0821-TMO_NW_Buckslip_Brochure.pdf"&gt;a brochure for Protection&amp;lt;360&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;, T-Mobile pitches the changes as providing “the same key features you enjoyed under the Sprint Complete plan” and lists the five claims and walk-in repairs as benefits that were previously available. A &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sprint.com%2Fen%2Fsupport%2Fsolutions%2Fdevice%2Fknow-which-sprint-stores-to-go-to-for-repairs.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F16%2F22677969%2Ft-mobile-retail-store-repair-protection-program-increased-claims" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sprint support document&lt;/a&gt; from 2020 references having 1,300 repair centers, making T-Mobile’s 500 stores feel like a bit of a downgrade — though T-Mobile does say that more locations are coming. As of fall 2020, when the merger was completed, the carrier &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sprint.com%2Fen%2Flandings%2Fwelcome-to-your-new-experience%3Famp%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F16%2F22677969%2Ft-mobile-retail-store-repair-protection-program-increased-claims" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reported having over 7,500 retail locations&lt;/a&gt;, so there’s room for expansion. T-Mobile says that its current repair locations will cover “nearly every major city” in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PkYMLf"&gt;Still, it’s good to see that T-Mobile is at least looking to continue providing in-person repair services. While the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22570826/president-joe-biden-executive-order-right-to-repair"&gt;battle for right-to-repair&lt;/a&gt; rages, a trend of the mobile industry making repairs more widely available is spreading. In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18691649/best-buy-apple-iphone-mac-ipad-repairs-all-stores"&gt;Best Buy started offering authorized repairs&lt;/a&gt; for iPhones, and Apple has made progress on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357187/apple-independent-repair-program-in-over-200-countries"&gt;expanding its Independent Repair Provider program&lt;/a&gt; (though the program has gotten pushback for some of its requirements). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2a2uvd"&gt;If you’re looking to add T-Mobile’s protection plan to your service to take advantage of in-person repair, the restrictions are worth noting. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fdevices%2Fprotectionandlt360andgt-and-device-protection%23heading5&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F16%2F22677969%2Ft-mobile-retail-store-repair-protection-program-increased-claims" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The company says&lt;/a&gt; you can only enroll within 30 days of a qualifying event, like buying a T-Mobile device or bringing your own device to the network. There may also be an inspection process to make sure your phone is working before it's covered. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Home Assistant Amber is a ready-to-use smart home platform</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B2B-HxMP6lVnKz5cNfPJNZXT7SI=/61x0:1860x1199/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69869006/naba_casa_square_v4.588.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Home Assistant Amber is a smart home hub for the free, open source home automation platform.&lt;/em&gt; | Nabu Casa&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6c8cH8"&gt;Home Assistant, the powerful-yet-prickly smart home automation platform, is finally moving toward the mainstream. Nabu Casa, the company behind the free, open-source software, has launched Home Assistant Amber, its first ready-to-use hub that can run Home Assistant software out of the box. Unlike with prior methods of using Home Assistant, there’s minimal programming required and no need to build your own computer when you have the Amber. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kIW32k"&gt;Debuting on the creators’ crowdfunding platform &lt;a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/nabu-casa/home-assistant-amber"&gt;Crowd Supply&lt;/a&gt; this week, the $149 box is designed for both beginners and experienced HA fans. Shipping is targeted for June 2022, provided the $140,000 funding goal is met (it’s about a third of the way there as of publish).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Home Assistant Amber is designed to be user-upgradable, helping future-proof it in the fast-moving smart home space.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pQkbuE"&gt;The brains of the device is a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 (CM4), and &lt;a href="https://www.mouser.com/new/silicon-labs/silicon-labs-mgm210p-mighty-gecko-lighting-module/"&gt;a built-in Silicon Labs Module&lt;/a&gt; powers the Zigbee 3.0 connection, the main Home Assistant communication protocol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="431p2O"&gt;With Zigbee on board, you can connect popular home automation products like Philips Hue lightbulbs and Ikea’s smart shades directly to the Amber hub (no need to use their own bridges) and then control them in the Home Assistant software on your smartphone, tablet, or computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FTfdLI"&gt;The Silicon Labs chip also supports OpenThread, and it says it’s working on making it compatible with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430666/matter-project-chip-smart-home-partnership-apple-amazon-google-zigbee"&gt;Matter&lt;/a&gt;, the open standard on a mission to simplify the smart home. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7U4EbTCTrXuWrMGOvBPUXeW3o0I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22855882/naba_casa_square_v4.628.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nabu Casa&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Amber Hub comes pre-assembled in a custom enclosure with a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 (CM4) and a heatsink for silent operation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tDnOWq"&gt;Z-Wave compatibility can be added with a Z-Wave USB stick or via a connection to a third-party hub like Vera or SmartThings. The Amber hub also has an M.2 extension port so you can plug in an SSD hard drive for more storage, among other expansion capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b6a9ni"&gt;Notably, there’s no Bluetooth or Wi-Fi built in, and the internet connection is over gigabit ethernet. Home Assistant founder Paulus Schoutsen says that’s because they “don’t want people to get the idea to connect the brains of their smart home via Wi-Fi. It needs a reliable connection.” The &lt;a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/nabu-casa/home-assistant-amber"&gt;full specs&lt;/a&gt; of the Amber line up with other Raspberry Pi 4-based systems, though there’s no video-out to plug in a display — you do all of the maintenance and setup through the Home Assistant mobile or desktop apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Feek6T"&gt;Home Assistant’s primary appeal lies in its local control (the ability to access your devices even when the internet is down); its secure, privacy-focused cloud offering; and that it’s completely platform agnostic. There are over a thousand compatible devices and integrations, including many that aren’t supported across other popular platforms such as Apple’s HomeKit, Samsung’s SmartThings, or Amazon’s Alexa. (A complete list of devices is published on the &lt;a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/#all"&gt;Home Assistant website&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C9FCF3VkSbDfdllIYU7NeZkB9sA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22855865/framed_lovelace_energy.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nabu Casa&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Amber hub can be controlled by the Home Assistant app on a smartphone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="htILzo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:1523637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qc67kO"&gt;As an open-source project (with over 8,000 contributors on GitHub just this year), Home Assistant’s capabilities are literally endless. However, they require a steeper-than-most-people-will-put-up-with learning curve. Get ready to do some light coding to get your lights to turn on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kw58gr"&gt;The eight-year-old platform is incredibly powerful and can do more than most mainstream options currently offer. The standard automations to turn your thermostat down and lock your doors at night are there, but it can also track energy use, energy production (if you have solar power or similar), and offer up a sustainability score for your home to help keep you on track. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="87YpiK"&gt;To nab a Home Assistant Amber you need to be one of the first 500 backers as the company has only secured components for that many units due to the current global shortage. There’s also the option of an Amber Kit that you can assemble yourself and which has the added capability of Power over Ethernet. Those don’t ship with the CM4, though, and they’re not as user-friendly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1F60d8"&gt;The campaign ends October 27th, 2021, with production scheduled to begin in six months and units shipping June 30th, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why smartwatch-measured blood pressure still isn’t ‘ready for primetime’ </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A red blood pressure meter sits on a wooden desk, in the background, a doctor looks over papers. A patient’s arm is also visible on the desk. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YF7IN-0rkj6VZubN3LLDD72XDFw=/0x0:2916x1944/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69868792/151262809.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Cardiologists are looking forward to the future of blood pressure tech — but the field still needs to catch up&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="as9z79"&gt;It’s been over two years since Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18236373/samsung-galaxy-watch-blood-pressure-monitoring-health-fda"&gt;first announced&lt;/a&gt; that its Galaxy Watch would be able to measure people’s blood pressure. The feature is available in a number of countries, including South Korea, but not in the United States — the company is still awaiting Food and Drug Administration clearance. In the meantime, other smartwatch companies have started experimenting with blood pressure tech in a bid for monitors on their devices. Fitbit &lt;a href="https://blog.fitbit.com/fitbit-study-blood-pressure/"&gt;announced a study&lt;/a&gt; trialing a blood pressure monitor in April, and Apple is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652120/apple-watch-blood-pressure-temperature-sleep-diabetes"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; working on its own version, as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2TCjjb"&gt;Adding a blood pressure monitor to smartwatches could arguably be more important for users’ cardiovascular health than the heart rate and rhythm monitors they have now, says says Ann Marie Navar, a cardiologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. “Blood pressure measurement is something we need to do a lot more a lot of,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QxttbM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re not ready for primetime yet”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rB3WNm"&gt;But it’s still not clear how reliable smartwatch-measured blood pressure could be. Measuring blood pressure is much harder than tracking heart rate and rhythm, and getting it right is arguably even more important. “We’re not ready for primetime yet,” says Jordana Cohen, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania who studies hypertension. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ahlwoF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Squeeze-free methods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rBbhrS"&gt;Having more ways to easily take blood pressure measurements at home could be a big benefit to people with hypertension (high blood pressure) or other concerns. Pressure measurements taken exclusively in a doctor’s office are often unreliable: some people have higher blood pressure in-office because they’re anxious about the visit, while other people have masked hypertension — high blood pressure at home, but normal blood pressure at the doctor. “We don’t pick it up unless we have people check their blood pressures at home,” Navar says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wMlcML"&gt;There are plenty of at-home blood pressure cuffs that take the standard approach: a cuff gets strapped onto a patient’s upper arm. Inflating the cuff cuts off blood flow, and the device measures the pressure blood is putting on vessel walls when blood starts flowing again as the compression is released. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A watch displaying blood pressure reading on a person’s wrist." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fL4YZRBaCQ7y9mqa1QgY_h8vNEw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22855694/1090712796.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Omron HeartGuide device has a built-in blood pressure cuff.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SbciQc"&gt;Right now, there’s one wearable device cleared by the Food and Drug Administration to measure blood pressure: a device from medical equipment company Omron, which has an inflatable cuff inside the band that lets it take blood pressure measurements at the wrist using the traditional squeezing method. Unlike smartwatches that are hoping to add blood pressure to existing tech, Omron’s HeartGuide is extremely specialized. It’s even marketed as “a wearable blood pressure monitor in the innovative form of a wristwatch”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B0P4Mj"&gt;Smartwatch companies like Samsung and Fitbit are taking another approach. They are using light sensors on the smartwatches to calculate blood pressure. It’s a big challenge, says Wendy Mendes, a psychophysiologist at the University of California San Francisco who works with Samsung on its tool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ma3Gk2"&gt;Samsung’s approach is based on a measure called pulse transit time, which is the time between the contraction of the heart and when the pulse arrives at a particular body part, like the wrist. It’s correlated with blood pressure. “The faster that pulse transit time is, the more the vessels are tightening — that’s what’s making the pulse travel faster,” Mendes says. Optical sensors also check if vessels are tightening or widening. An algorithm then uses those two bits of information, along with heart rate, to estimate blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mvomnI"&gt;Fitbit is a few steps further back in the process — it doesn’t have any blood pressure features available but has a handful of &lt;a href="https://blog.fitbit.com/fitbit-study-blood-pressure/"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; underway looking at the relationship between the metrics already collected by its devices and blood pressure. They’re focusing on a measure called pulse arrival time. It’s similar to pulse transit time but measures the pulse at a slightly different time than Samsung does, says Eric Friedman, vice president of research at Fitbit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A watch sits next to a phone in a photo illustration. The watch has an image of a heart, and text that says “your watch will start measuring automatically” The phone displays a photo of a person wearing a white shirt. One of the person’s arms has a watch, the other has a blood pressure cuff." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cPoRBVrFnWmihZUEuogKCGcm-E0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22855654/Samsung_Health_Monitor_App_Blood_Pressure_dl2.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A press image of Samsung’s Health Monitor Application with Blood Pressure Measurement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HTc5YB"&gt;There’s a limitation to both of these strategies: generally, they can only reliably measure &lt;em&gt;relative&lt;/em&gt; blood pressure. Mendes could strap a watch on and find out if someone’s blood pressure was higher in the morning than it was when they went to sleep the previous night, but wouldn’t be able to tell what the raw number it started at was without benchmarking the device off of a standard blood pressure cuff. “Almost all of these sensors are going to be good at changes,” she says. “But to get the level, you have to calibrate it.” Samsung suggests users recalibrate the blood pressure monitor on their smartwatches &lt;a href="https://www.wareable.com/samsung/how-to-take-blood-pressure-on-samsung-galaxy-watch-active-2-8321#google_vignette"&gt;every four weeks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="op2V2I"&gt;Apple’s blood pressure feature is still in development and has not been formally announced. It would reportedly just give people information on trends in their blood pressure — if it’s increasing or decreasing — rather than a raw measure, which requires the calibration step used by Samsung, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-plans-blood-pressure-measure-wrist-thermometer-in-watch-11630501201"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That’s a more realistic approach, Cohen says, because the techniques used in smartwatches are much more capable of detecting relative changes in blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="QgRdsB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I don’t have the hubris to view it as something that’s coming out any day now.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q3OCqv"&gt;The sensors currently common in smartwatches probably won’t be able to measure blood pressure without calibration against an outside cuff, Mendes says. “I do think it’s possible, but I don’t think the technology is there yet,” she says. It’s a herculean task, Friedman says. “There have been whole books written around why this is an impossible thing to solve,” he says. “I don’t have the hubris to view it as something that’s coming out any day now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GT6h5x"&gt;That’s why Fitbit is taking a broad approach and is considering all the ways it might be able to incorporate pulse arrival time and blood pressure into the data it offers users, Friedman says. Even if companies can’t directly measure blood pressure through a watch, they might be able to use metrics like pulse arrival time to give people information about &lt;em&gt;swings &lt;/em&gt;in their blood pressure (like Apple is reportedly pursuing) or their general fitness levels. “We’re ultimately looking at the maximal health impact we can achieve, and there are a lot of things that would also be quite satisfying,” Friedman says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="20GzBr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Validating the tech&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="YoRqfP"&gt;There’s more and more data available on non-cuff blood pressure monitors — movement in the right direction, Navar says. “There’s been a lot of progress in terms of trying to validate that technology against what we would consider more of a gold-standard blood pressure measurement,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HWEAzu"&gt;Right now, the only way to access Samsung’s blood pressure feature in the US is through Mendes’ research program at the University of California San Francisco, &lt;a href="https://mybplab.com/"&gt;My BP Lab&lt;/a&gt;, which tracks stress and blood pressure. The team asked 123 participants to spend a week taking blood pressure readings using both a blood pressure cuff and a Samsung Note 9 phone (which includes the same sensor as the smartwatches). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="FNrT8M"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s so, so important that we get it right,”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hurdvY"&gt;The analysis, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8346904/"&gt;published in July&lt;/a&gt;, found that the blood pressures calculated by the Samsung device had “moderate to strong agreement” with pressures measured by an FDA-approved cuff. The results were about as close together as the results from two different FDA-approved cuffs were each other, Mendes says. The results held for people of varying skin tones and ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oy5FiS"&gt;Navar hopes to see public data on devices made by companies like Fitbit and Apple, as well. “We’ve seen companies really hold themselves to a higher standard, and I think the clinical research community is really demanding it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YSNIEW"&gt;Still, Cohen says the data available so far isn’t enough to make her confident in blood pressure tracked through a smartwatch. “I wouldn’t recommend somebody use it to diagnose hypertension or for monitoring or treatment of high blood pressure. Not yet,” she says.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Fitbit Sense" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4ItrQXnja0IvpfQnm2hCerg1ojA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21812132/sense2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Fitbit&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fitbit wearables don’t measure blood pressure yet, but the company is studying whether it can use other metrics, like pulse arrival time, to measure people’s blood pressure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kdiN0Z"&gt;It’s important to get right — maybe more important than something like heart rate, Cohen says. “High blood pressure is such a major risk factor for stroke, major cardiac events, and kidney disease,” she says. “It’s so, so important that we get it right, because if devices are giving you an inaccurate reading, you can get very false reassurance that your blood pressure is normal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qKOJKj"&gt;Cohen’s seen multiple patients with inaccurate data collected through blood pressure-monitoring wearables purchased overseas, or that don’t make the type of medical claims that would require clearance from the FDA. “I had one patient that had one of those watches that she got from overseas, and she was convinced her blood pressure was perfect,” she says. A monitoring test showed that it was actually 50 points higher than what the watch said. The patient was so reluctant to accept that determination that her care team had to run a second test. “She wouldn’t accept the values,” Cohen says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ll0EGc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We have to be cautious”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="isoqp5"&gt;Clinicians will have to carefully examine any new device on the market to make sure it’s working well enough to trust in different groups of people, including people with high or abnormal blood pressure, Navar says. “It may work in someone with totally normal blood vessels, but does it work in an older person who may have stiffer blood vessels? We have to be cautious,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iH02GD"&gt;Blood pressure is relatively easy to double check with a medical-grade cuff at home or in the doctor’s office, Navar says. She’d want to use that as a backup for patients with smartwatches, at least at first. “I’d probably want to make sure that, if somebody is using one of these watches to measure their blood pressure, that we check it against a more standard measure,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="iWZ0yR"&gt;If smartwatches are able to run the validation gauntlet and prove that they can reliably track blood pressure, it could help expand the options people have to manage a health condition at home. “I love the idea of more people checking their blood pressure at home, and anything to help people do that is wonderful,” Cohen says. “But it needs to be accurate or it’s of no value.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTPfhe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FjKVR4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Helen Mirren finds a side door into Harry Potter with a new game show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Celebrity Sightings During the Dolce&amp;amp;amp;Gabbana Alta Moda In Venice" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LFscZ1ypEvpwwntEYm1fT_hIX_o=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69868666/1337108167.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Hm8PV0"&gt;Dame Helen Mirren is a wizard, reader. Or a witch. Or maybe a concerned Muggle? The details don’t really matter; either way, the Oscar award-winning actress is hosting a new &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; quiz show later this year to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the film series. &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter: Hogwarts Tournament of Houses &lt;/em&gt;will be simultaneously broadcast on Cartoon Network and TBS, with plans to eventually stream on HBO Max as well, &lt;a href="https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/us/media-release/helen-mirren-host-harry-potter-hogwarts-tournament-houses"&gt;WarnerMedia announced Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ue3WeO"&gt;The four-part special “will unveil Wizarding World fans willing to put their &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; knowledge to the test for the ultimate honor to be named House Cup champion,” according to WarnerMedia. Mirren will shepherd the latest expansion of the &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; franchise and lend “some British grandeur” to the proceedings, adds Tom Ascheim, Warner Bros. president of global kids, young adults, and classics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oy6eTa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Another British film legend checked off the list&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cjvFwP"&gt;In many ways, it was only a matter of time. Across eight films, and now several spinoffs, &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; has featured a majority of the United Kingdom’s stars of stage and screen. It was honestly unusual Mirren hadn’t popped up in some way. Now she can, through an equally unusual game show loophole. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jbVWlG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Harry Potter: Hogwarts Tournament of Houses&lt;/em&gt; is slated to air later this year. When asked, a WarnerMedia representative was not yet able to share the exact date the special would hit HBO Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="BVaOtL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Hogwarts Legacy is an open world Harry Potter game coming to PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21440330/harry-potter-hogwarts-legacy-ps5-playstation-5-trailer-open-world-sony"},{"title":"What should the inevitable Harry Potter HBO Max series look like?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/6/5/21281528/harry-potter-hbo-max-series-spin-off-prequel-ideas"},{"title":"Warner Bros. reassures fans that J.K.

    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E4HlSTPy9mIv55UgBqfkRWE6f9I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69868094/acastro_210329_1777_nft_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="k5idZc"&gt;OpenSea head of product Nate Chastain, who was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676075/opensea-insider-information-nft-trading-nate-chastain"&gt;recently accused of&lt;/a&gt; a form of NFT insider trading, appears to no longer be working for the company. His Twitter bio now includes the phrase “Past: @opensea.” OpenSea has not publicly named the employee involved in the incident, but CEO Devin Finzer says the NFT trading platform asked for and received their resignation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9gv6eC"&gt;Yesterday, Finzer &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/employee-information-use-at-opensea/"&gt;put up a blog post&lt;/a&gt; saying an employee used knowledge gained from working at the company to purchase NFTs that were about to be posted to the popular trading site’s homepage (and would thus likely go up in value). While an investigation is apparently still ongoing, OpenSea does say that it’s implemented clearer rules to prevent employees from doing this kind of thing in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="VMHrQj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;div id="bjhElS"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We have a strong responsibility to our community, and we take any breach of trust incredibly seriously.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We've taken additional steps to address this and are investing in policies that move the space towards greater transparency and openness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Update: &lt;a href="https://t.co/NWExSdThOf"&gt;https://t.co/NWExSdThOf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Devin Finzer (dfinzer.eth) (@dfinzer) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dfinzer/status/1438550045293436928?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JxI9US"&gt;The incident came to light after the NFT community began digging into transactions in Chastain’s public wallet. Community members, taking advantage of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22654785/blockchain-explained-cryptocurrency-what-is-stake-nft"&gt;the blockchain’s openness and semi-transparency&lt;/a&gt;, were able to find transactions that seemed to indicate that he was secretly flipping NFTs. The community members also say that the transactions show that this flipping earned the employee thousands of dollars or more — you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676075/opensea-insider-information-nft-trading-nate-chastain"&gt;read more about the investigations and accusations here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="06DEVg"&gt;Chastain has yet to make a public statement or acknowledge the situation in any way. However, his Twitter profile, and OpenSea’s blog post, would seem to indicate that his time at the company is over. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo’s latest FCC filing reveals a mysterious new controller</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Nintendo Switch" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/repAeI8bJJic4tXsu7stEfEgoCc=/100x0:4300x2800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69868086/NintendoSwitch_hardware_Joy-Con_02.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FbrH6n"&gt;Nintendo may have a new wireless controller in the works based on &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/BKEHAC043"&gt;this FCC listing the company filed Thursday&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.vooks.net/nintendo-files-fcc-listing-for-new-mystery-controller/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Vooks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The new device has received the model number HAC-043, which, if it matters, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/13/20803344/nintendo-switch-snes-controller-fcc-listing"&gt;is one model number higher&lt;/a&gt; than Nintendo’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/16/20869382/nintendo-wireless-snes-controller-for-switch-now-available-on-sale"&gt;wireless SNES controller from 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tzasG9"&gt;Nintendo submitted a 180-day request for confidentiality to the FCC on July 26th that hides more revealing details of the device, like photos and actual schematics. But there are still a few details to share. The device is wireless and uses Bluetooth, and it appears to draw more power at 3.5mW than &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/BKEHAC015"&gt;the Joy-Con’s 2.7mW&lt;/a&gt;. FCC label placement, which can sometimes reveal a bit more of how a device actually looks, also suggests whatever it is would be a departure from the single label that Joy-Con use.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U_3iP6vgZW9p-IpbUHXo0WGUPjs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22855324/Screen_Shot_2021_09_16_at_9.33.34_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two labels on a very mysterious rectangle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0wQPEG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/09/rumour_it_looks_like_nintendo_will_soon_unveil_a_new_controller_for_switch"&gt;Some speculate&lt;/a&gt; the new controller could replicate another old console’s controller like the wireless SNES controller did for the SNES. Maybe Nintendo could finally pull the trigger on a wireless N64 or GameCube controller for even more retro gaming? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5CK3ut"&gt;There’s also the possibility of a new Pro Controller to go with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"&gt;the OLED Nintendo Switch coming in October&lt;/a&gt;. Nintendo has been tight-lipped about what Joy-Con revisions will come with that new console — specifically &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/10/22570868/nintendo-oled-switch-joy-con-drift"&gt;refusing to say if it fixes Joy-Con drift&lt;/a&gt; — but maybe there’s something in the works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JPtWYd"&gt;Either way, given Nintendo’s track record, it’s safe to expect the unexpected. The company does, and largely gets away with doing, whatever it wants. It randomly added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674704/nintendo-switch-bluetooth-audio-software-update"&gt;Bluetooth audio support to the Switch via a software update&lt;/a&gt; just this week, after years of pleading from gamers. A new controller could be as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/18/17253574/nintendo-labo-review-switch-learning-diy"&gt;exciting and odd as Nintendo Labo&lt;/a&gt; or as bog-standard as a slightly tweaked version of the Pro Controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ppWUVO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook will treat coordinated rule breakers using real accounts like troll farms</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FJZPFQOEjYT1mhdcQsScDRTpm10=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69867936/jbareham_180409_2445_0001_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5Cemvq"&gt;Facebook is expanding its playbook for tackling “coordinated inauthentic behavior” to cover similar campaigns that don’t involve impersonation. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-facebook-target-harmful-coordination-by-real-accounts-using-playbook-2021-09-16/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; first reported&lt;/a&gt; the new policy, which Facebook apparently says is in its early stages. Practically speaking, it means moderators can take broader actions than banning individual accounts or posts when they break hard rules, aiming to stop coordinated attempts to harass users or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611309/instagram-banned-accounts-business-impersonation"&gt;get them banned&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7MdBcf"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; points out, Facebook acknowledged in January that its coordinated inauthentic behavior (or CIB) rules had limits. “We have little policy around coordinated authentic harm,” an internal report &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/full-facebook-stop-the-steal-internal-report"&gt;published by &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;admitted, referring to the Stop the Steal campaign to overturn the US presidential election. “What do we do when a movement is authentic, coordinated through grassroots or authentic means, but is inherently harmful and violates the spirit of our policy?” The report suggested things like adding “friction” to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552752/facebook-stopthesteal-ban-twitter-parler-discord-trump"&gt;growth of movements&lt;/a&gt; like Stop the Steal — ultimately, it ended up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225643/facebook-stop-the-steal-ban-inauguration-day-capitol-mob-attack"&gt;banning the phrase&lt;/a&gt; from Facebook and Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qdMtVK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;cites two types of incidents where Facebook might target “groups of coordinated real accounts that systemically break its rules”: mass reporting, where people falsely report another user for policy violations, and brigading, or a coordinated campaign to target someone for harassment. Some of these incidents could involve state-sponsored groups that are similar to government-backed “troll farms” but use &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/how-vietnams-influencer-army-wages-information-warfare-facebook-2021-07-09/"&gt;participants’ real Facebook accounts&lt;/a&gt;. Others could be independent — coordinated by political movements or groups of fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="meVOGB"&gt;Facebook expanded on the news &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/removing-new-types-of-harmful-networks/"&gt;in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;, discussing a category it dubbed “coordinated social harm” and planned to crack down on. As an example it cited actions against the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-56675874"&gt;conspiratorial Querdenken anti-vaccination movement&lt;/a&gt; in Germany, whose members it said “used authentic and duplicate accounts to post and amplify violating content” including health misinformation. “While we aren’t banning all Querdenken content, we’re continuing to monitor the situation and will take action if we find additional violations to prevent abuse on our platform and protect people using our services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4BsoR9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 2:10PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added further detail from a Facebook blog post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This Dell gaming laptop with an RTX 3050 is just $750</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uuQ6yXDn2gtXyVgnuecNl2TNgXA=/0x0:1463x975/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69867859/Dell_G15_Press_Image_3.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Dell&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Qd2DeV"&gt;Grabbing any of Nvidia’s new GPUs for less than a grand is unheard of, but today, you can grab a &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeDeals091621/https://deals.dell.com/en-us/productdetail/afwj" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell G15 gaming laptop for just $750&lt;/a&gt;, nearly $300 off the initial list price. It may not have the same extraterrestrial curb appeal as Dell’s Alienware laptops, but this G15 still has muscle where it counts. This 15-inch laptop manages to pack in an RTX 3050 graphics card and an 11th Gen Intel Core-i5 CPU, which is ideal for supplying the high refresh 120Hz FHD display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YFKLfz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10756456"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VEO4Iq"&gt;A trio of USB-A ports provides ample connectivity for peripherals or external storage, and a Type-C connection allows the G15 to dock and connect with an external display. There is also the option to use the built-in HDMI port to connect to your monitor or TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JQ33io"&gt;As with most manufacturers, you do get the added bonus of a one-year limited hardware warranty, as well as a 12-month subscription to McAfee LiveSafe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ImA9Sj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best gaming laptops for 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"},{"title":"Nvidia expects GPU supply constraints for the ‘vast majority’ of 2022 ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632047/nvidia-gpu-supply-rtx-30-series-constraints-2022"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="J2DBM2"&gt;This laptop does come with a couple of caveats, however. The standard 256GB SSD this laptop comes packaged with won’t last very long unless you supplement it with some type of external storage, and the 8GB of RAM does leave a bit to be desired. The G15 is also a little on the beefier side, weighing in at just shy of six pounds, meaning it’s hardly the most portable laptop. Still, it’s certainly light enough to tote around if you needed to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ku8JuW"&gt;With the current shortage of GPUs slated to extend well into 2022, buying a system with a new graphics card built in seems to be the best way to get your hands on one currently that isn’t a secondhand markup. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s new commitments on climate misinformation miss the point, activists say</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Climate Change Activists Continue Their Protest" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xVOubqCicdfxtgctEhK3yO-IqTA=/2x0:2998x1997/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69867817/1181412886.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;An Extinction Rebellion environmental activist mother group protest outside Google UK HQ demanding they stop climate deniers profiting on their platforms on October 16, 2019 in London, England.&amp;nbsp; | Photo by Ollie Millington/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TSCK5U"&gt;Lies about climate change still fester unchecked on Facebook, environmentalists say, even as the social media giant announces new climate initiatives. The company today &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/tackling-climate-change-together/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that it’s beefing up a “Climate Science Center” with more facts, quizzes, and videos. It’s also investing $1 million in grants to groups “working to combat climate misinformation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhMi6d"&gt;Those efforts still don’t get at the root of the problem. Trying to funnel Facebook users to a “science center” doesn’t actually stop climate deniers from posting false information that can spread like wildfire on the platform. And Facebook continues to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/05/facebook-fossil-fuel-industry-environment-climate-change"&gt;accept&lt;/a&gt; advertising dollars from oil and gas companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="CbDXbw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Those efforts still don’t get at the root of the problem.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BJPSbg"&gt;“Facebook knows the super-spreaders of climate disinformation and should put an end to their repetitive lies,” Michael Khoo, co-chair of the climate disinformation coalition at the nonprofit Friends of the Earth (FOE), said in a statement today. “Facebook and other tech platforms must take far stronger action to limit the super-spreaders, and not put the burden on ordinary users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NoOjmI"&gt;One of the most recent bouts with misinformation on climate solutions like renewable energy took place during a deadly blackout and sudden cold snap in Texas last February. Posts spread on social media that falsely claimed frozen wind turbines were primarily at fault for the outages. In reality, the severe cold affected just about every energy source, not just renewables, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287130/texas-natural-gas-production-power-outages-frozen"&gt;frozen natural gas infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; played a huge role in the blackouts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DpyAXp"&gt;In a new &lt;a href="http://foe.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Texas_Disinfo_Report_final_v4.pdf"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; released today, Friends of the Earth analyzed the top 10 “highest-performing” Facebook posts falsely blaming wind turbines for blackouts. Less than 1 percent of interactions — including likes, comments, and shares — were with posts that carried a fact-check label, which Facebook places on posts that have been reviewed by the platform’s third-party fact-checkers. FOE argues that without fact-checking, misinformation can spread both within and outside of the platform to mainstream media and politics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNyZC6"&gt;Facebook defends its handling of misinformation in the wake of the winter storm.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“Many of the examples in the report cited as not having labels are simply positions that the [FOE] disagrees with,” Facebook said in an emailed statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tl6Fls"&gt;The posts FOE analyzed include several from &lt;em&gt;Fox News&lt;/em&gt; that quote Tucker Carlson saying things like, “Green energy inevitably means blackouts,” and “global warming is no longer a &lt;a href="https://www.houstontx.gov/mayor/Climate-Impact-Assessment-2020-August.pdf"&gt;pressing concern in Houston&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve solved that problem. The bad news is they don’t have electricity. The windmills froze so the power grid failed.”&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2021/feb/16/natural-gas-not-wind-turbines-main-driver-texas-po/"&gt;Neither statement is true&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDqJh8"&gt;Friends of the Earth also looked into the top 10 performing posts that shared a viral image of a drone defrosting a wind turbine. The image was actually &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-9953125062"&gt;taken years earlier&lt;/a&gt; and had nothing to do with the power outages. Ninety percent of those posts did carry Facebook’s fact-checking label, according to the FOE report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6fTop9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Misinformation about renewable energy online can have real-world consequences&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OJN3CB"&gt;Misinformation about renewable energy online can have real-world consequences. Following the disaster, lawmakers in Texas lambasted wind power and cited the outages while &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/texas-lawmakers-are-using-the-blackouts-to-make-fossil-1846583275"&gt;pushing bills&lt;/a&gt; to boost natural gas and place new fees on renewables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tVZcay"&gt;Facebook also got flak today for the money it makes from oil and gas advertising. “The  company often talks about its commitment to tackling climate change, but it continues to allow its platform to be used by the fossil fuel sector to undermine science-based climate action,” Faye Holder, a program manager at climate and energy think tank InfluenceMap said in a statement today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zBxizH"&gt;Twenty-five companies from the oil and gas sector spent nearly $9.6 million on Facebook ads last year, InfluenceMap found in a &lt;a href="https://influencemap.org/report/Climate-Change-and-Digital-Advertising-a40c8116160668aa2d865da2f5abe91b#"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; it released last month. Those ads had been viewed over 431 million times. Facebook rejects ads that its independent fact-checkers rate as false or misleading, the company said in its emailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IkJcqi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
