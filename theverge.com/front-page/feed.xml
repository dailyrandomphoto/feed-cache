    <title>Let’s all finally post a fleet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Twitter bird logo in white against a dark background with outlined logos around it and red circles rippling out from it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WXumwIQ8WNFO-QzruQrlPZ4kIJk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69667141/acastro_180827_1777_0001.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EZO4ov"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577166/twitter-fleets-shuts-down-stories-clone"&gt;Twitter is yeeting Fleets&lt;/a&gt;, its Stories-like ephemeral posts, on August 3rd, meaning that depending on when you read this, you may have mere hours to unleash that fleet you’ve been thinking about for months unto the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sJfTmC"&gt;And I ask — no, beg: please, post the fleets. I need some entertainment to kick off my month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3n2yFW"&gt;Look, I know that there are already a lot of different places where you can share expiring posts. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/3/4791934/snapchats-next-big-thing-stories-that-dont-just-disappear"&gt;Snapchat&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/2/12348354/instagram-stories-announced-snapchat-kevin-systrom-interview"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/28/15081398/facebook-stories-snapchat-camera-direct"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/119760/linkedin-stories-overview?lang=en"&gt;Even LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;. And that huge number of choices is probably part of why Fleets never really took off. Why share expiring posts on Twitter when many other apps have offered better tools to do so for years? Even on my iPhone 12 Mini, my Fleets bar was rarely filled up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HJALgI"&gt;But let’s change that just for one day to send Fleets out in a blaze of glory. I’ve contributed to the cause, posting my final (and first ever) fleet. It’s a bad fleet, so please don’t leave me on an island — help me out by posting better fleets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6EOoTK"&gt;Disappointingly, that annoying bar at the top of the Twitter app won’t be disappearing entirely once Fleets go to the great social media graveyard. Instead, it will show active Spaces, its social audio rooms (another feature that’s appearing in some shape or form in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586845/clubhouse-open-beta-invite-access-android-ios"&gt;zillion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22431438/discord-stage-channel-discovery-social-audio-threads-logo-clyde"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391875/reddit-talk-clubhouse-social-audio"&gt;apps&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22359332/linkedin-clubhouse-clone-social-audio-networking-room"&gt;including LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;). But until Spaces take over, let’s finally fill up that Fleets bar with the best (or cringiest) stuff that you’ve got. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A man violated a restraining order by renaming his estranged wife’s Napster playlists</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Napster" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t2V72xSJPMzPUyQHl-c7BFPExmc=/0x0:3364x2243/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69667088/1083228848.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="svRuxX"&gt;An Ohio man harassed his estranged wife through a shared Napster account, evading a no-contact order by changing the titles of playlists. Ohio’s Eighth District Court of Appeals &lt;a href="https://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/rod/docs/pdf/8/2021/2021-Ohio-2590.pdf"&gt;outlined the case&lt;/a&gt; in a July 29th ruling, which was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ericgoldman/status/1421629682013806596"&gt;flagged on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; by writer and attorney Eric Goldman. It’s an example of how metadata can become a vector for harassment outside major social platforms — echoing long-standing problems on other services like Spotify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0f0fpo"&gt;According to the court ruling, defendant Jacob Dunn admitted to reaching out to his wife through a Napster account that both of them could access. A court had issued a temporary protection order (TPO) against Dunn in 2018, prohibiting him from contacting his wife through any means. But Dunn violated the order by renaming music playlists — one was changed to “I want us to work. Do you? I’ll do anything,” another to “I love you more than ever ... do you still love me?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SVX3I0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;He’d agreed not to contact his wife through any medium&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bdJ1Mn"&gt;Dunn pled no contest to aggravated menacing and violating the order, although he later unsuccessfully attempted to withdraw and appeal his plea. At his sentencing hearing he claimed he hadn’t understood the rules of the TPO, despite explicitly agreeing to them beforehand — “I figured out the hard way, unfortunately,” he said. Court records indicate he was sentenced to probation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oDzsgl"&gt;Napster — a streaming service previously called Rhapsody, distinct from the defunct file-sharing service — is one of many usually innocuous services that stalkers and harassers can exploit. As &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/barrycollins/2021/06/03/spotify-accused-of-letting-stalkers-hound-their-victims/?sh=4a297142253f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forbes &lt;/em&gt;contributor Barry Collins has reported&lt;/a&gt;, Spotify users have complained about being followed by stalkers who can view targets’ listening sessions and &lt;a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Your-Library/Stalker-using-Spotify-to-intimidate-and-harass-me/td-p/5030326"&gt;share playlists&lt;/a&gt; with abusive names. They’ve criticized Spotify for dragging its feet on privacy and blocking tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w4qC04"&gt;This case involves a more unusual problem that most anti-harassment measures wouldn’t mitigate, since it involves two people who had agreed to share an account. (It’s not clear whether they agreed to keep sharing it after separating or if Dunn’s wife simply hadn’t considered revoking his access.) It’s a clearer demonstration of how digital entanglements can have unexpected downsides — even with something as simple as a music playlist.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter verifies fake Cormac McCarthy account (again) </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kHVwF2E-g6tat-cavq2WZaqoHEU=/8x0:1223x810/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69667008/Screen_Shot_2021_08_02_at_4.44.08_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cormac McCarthy at the premiere of the film adaptation of his novel&lt;/em&gt; The Road&lt;em&gt; in 2009&lt;/em&gt;.  | Photo by Jim Spellman/WireImage&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DLCzSa"&gt;Twitter’s verification process is notoriously slapdash, but you’d expect the company not to fall for the exact same fake twice, right? Wrong! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kr5Y8d"&gt;In 2012, Twitter verified an account supposedly belonging to illustrious author Cormac McCarthy, which was in reality started by an &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/01/unpublished-novelists-week-fake-cormac-mccarthy/332435/"&gt;unpublished novelist&lt;/a&gt;. Now, in 2021, it’s done the same thing again, briefly verifying a &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; McCarthy fake under the handle @CormacMcCrthy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DPtL4b"&gt;The account has now been un-verified, but a representative for McCarthy’s agent at ICM Partners confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it was fake. “I can confirm that this is definitely not a genuine Cormac McCarthy account,” they said. “Twitter is aware of this situation and we hope to have the issue resolved shortly.” Twitter has yet to respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BO6QTs"&gt;It is certainly hard to believe that the 88-year-old McCarthy — best known for the unrelenting darkness and violence of his many novels, including &lt;em&gt;The Road&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Blood Meridian&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;No Country for Old Men —&lt;/em&gt; would ever tweet anything quite as twee as the following:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/owWm-jeRHvVN3U4CF24eB3enHy0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22756183/Screen_Shot_2021_08_02_at_5.02.06_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A tweet from the Cormac McCarthy account when it was verified earlier today&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2qPxBb"&gt;But apparently Twitter HQ was none the wiser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6rnBoE"&gt;The @CormacMcCrthy account has been tweeting infrequently &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CormacMcCrthy/status/1052301984865214464"&gt;since 2018&lt;/a&gt; but was verified after a pair of its tweets went viral, racking up tens of thousands of likes and retweets. Many Twitter users were instantly skeptical about the authenticity of the account. “We have so normalised the idea of geniuses demeaning themselves on social media that people can actually believe Cormac McCarthy would tweet in the cadence of a John Oliver monologue,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NedBeauman/status/1421948813644865539"&gt;commented&lt;/a&gt; British novelist Ned Beauman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M3N6P7"&gt;But the lure of Doing Numbers apparently was too much for some to stay away. Another verified author, Stephen King, had a bit of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StephenKing/status/1421859855489449989"&gt;back and forth&lt;/a&gt; with the fake McCarthy, though whether King was actually fooled by the account isn’t clear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gbbyx7"&gt;Twitter’s verification process is frequently criticized for being slow, unfair, or just simply wrong. It relaunched the verification process earlier this year, using the criteria that accounts should be “&lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/about-twitter-verified-accounts"&gt;authentic, notable, and active&lt;/a&gt;” to be verified &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/28/22458914/twitter-verification-pause-applications-relaunch"&gt;only to “pause” the program a week later&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers have noted that the company’s checks seem so haphazard that it frequently verifies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575025/twitter-verified-fake-accounts-botnet-researcher"&gt;spam and bot accounts&lt;/a&gt;. But still, they really should have noticed that something was up here. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This is the Pixel 6</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google’s new Pixel 6 phones, regular and Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Da2gdZDEVuvf3zGD1efSQjCb4mw=/448x0:7198x4500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69666896/Google_Pixel_6__Portfolio_Shot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Google’s new Pixel 6 phones, regular and Pro | Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Google’s new Tensor SoC is the heart of its next phone&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ZtbQzN"&gt;Google is announcing the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro today, though it might be &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/google-tensor-debuts-new-pixel-6-fall/"&gt;better to call it a preview or a tease&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than releasing all the details on its new Android phones, Google is instead putting the focus on the new system on a chip (SoC) that will be inside the new Pixels. It’s called the Tensor SoC, named after the Tensor Processing Units (TPU) Google uses in its data centers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HBPbOE"&gt;Tensor is an SoC, not a single processor. And so while it’s fair to call it Google-designed, it’s also still unclear which components are Google-made and which are licensed from others. Two things are definitely coming from Google: a mobile TPU for AI operations and a new Titan M2 chip for security. The rest, including the CPU, GPU, and 5G modem, are all still a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OeH2zJ"&gt;Less mysterious: the phones themselves. I spent about an hour at Google’s Mountain View campus last week looking at the phone hardware and talking with Google’s hardware chief Rick Osterloh about Tensor. After all that, my main takeaway about the new Pixel 6 phones is simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wpRydn"&gt;Google is actually, finally trying to make a competitive flagship phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro lineup" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qYkC6nm2kiiK0khVjc2DFmxtpp8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22755114/Google_Pixel_6__Portfolio_Shot.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro lineup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Lm1UgR"&gt;This fall, Google will release two slightly different Pixel phones: the Pixel 6 and the Pixel 6 Pro. If the final versions are anything like the prototypes I saw last week, they will be the first Pixel phones that don’t feel like they’re sandbagging when it comes to build quality. “We knew we didn’t have what it took to be in the ultra high end [in the past],” Osterloh admits. “And this is the first time where we feel like we really have it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zWmy8w"&gt;Both versions of the Pixel were glass sandwiches with fit-and-finish that are finally in the same league as what Samsung, Huawei, and Apple have to offer. “We’ve definitively not been in the flagship tier for the past couple years, this will be different,” says Osterloh. He also admits that “it will certainly be a premium-priced product,” which I take to mean north of $1,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 6" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UU_zDtDmN0Whd2AQ5rBPEMEVMD8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22755092/Google_Pixel_6_Pro.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Pixel 6.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 6 has a hole-punch camera and thin bezels" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jI9FMVxxrJ1KCJAKXTee1WUPXks=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22756252/screen.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Google Pixel 6 has a hole-punch camera and thin bezels&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5xkLUu"&gt;Google is only sharing a few of the key specs for each phone, leaving the details for later — likely October. (And no, there was no mention of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22525271/google-pixel-fold-folding-phone-samsung-display-theelec"&gt;folding phone&lt;/a&gt; nor a &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-watch"&gt;watch&lt;/a&gt;.) Google also wouldn’t allow us to take photos or video of the devices during our meeting. In any case, here is what we do know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C0ruPW"&gt;The Pixel 6 Pro will have a 6.7-inch QHD+ display with a 120Hz refresh rate. That screen is very slightly curved at the edges, blending into shiny, polished aluminum rails on the side. It has three cameras on the back: a new wide-angle main sensor, an ultrawide, and a 4X optical-zoom folded telephoto lens. Google isn’t sharing specs on the camera beyond saying the main wide-angle sensor takes in 150 percent more light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YFYPpa"&gt;The regular Pixel 6 has a 6.4-inch FHD+ screen with a 90Hz refresh rate. Its screen is perfectly flat, with matte-finished rails. It also loses the telephoto camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9wl2uW"&gt;Although there will be memory differences between the phones, both will have the new Tensor SoC, a Titan M2 security chip, and in-display fingerprint sensor. There will be slightly different color options for the two types of phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lrHB6l"&gt;As is often the case with polarizing designs, the look of the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro make a little more sense in person than in leaked images. There is a huge “camera bar” that runs the full width of the phones, with a barely raised metal rail to protect the glass from scratches. There are only so many ways to handle massive camera bumps on big phones and Google’s solution is to “celebrate and highlight” them, in Osterloh’s words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google’s promo image for the Tensor SoC" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5sBcy2wSUE3dFWs1qKA34dsLrjY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22755094/Google_Tensor__Info_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s promo image for the Tensor SoC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="vDdD7X"&gt;If all Google were doing was rescuing the Pixel line from the doldrums of the midrange, that would be significant but not worth a months-early pre-announcement. The most important part of the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro is that Google is using that new Tensor SoC inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="nYzXVf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It took us a few years, but we’ve finally built a technology platform that we think is really important.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="Vu8EX0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So excited to share our new custom Google Tensor chip, which has been 4 yrs in the making (  for scale)! Tensor builds off of our 2 decades of computing experience and it’s our biggest innovation in Pixel to date. Will be on Pixel 6 + Pixel 6 Pro in fall. &lt;a href="https://t.co/N95X6gFxLf"&gt;https://t.co/N95X6gFxLf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/wHiEJRHJwy"&gt;pic.twitter.com/wHiEJRHJwy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sundarpichai/status/1422228336533676035?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hiP4hI"&gt;Qualcomm has a virtual monopoly on processors in Android devices in the US. Worldwide, there is a little bit more competition as Samsung, MediaTek, and Huawei all have chips in Android phones. But on the whole, processing power on Android phones is rightfully thought of as woefully behind what Apple has done with its own in-house silicon on its A-Series line of chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iD9pjC"&gt;Because of that situation, there’s a lot of interest to see if Google could potentially make a more competitive chip that could differentiate its products. But don’t let that interest trick you into thinking that Tensor is exactly equivalent to Apple’s A-Series chips. Tensor is the system on a chip, with a mix of components that Google itself has designed and others that it has licensed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wG72wj"&gt;Google’s not sharing who designed the CPU and GPU, nor is it sharing benchmarks on their performance — though Osterloh says that it should be “market leading.” (Current rumors suggest that it might be &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/09/everything-we-know-google-whitechapel-gs101-pixel-6/"&gt;Samsung providing those more standard component designs&lt;/a&gt;.) He adds, “The standard stuff people look at will be very competitive and the AI stuff will be totally differentiated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K5qky4"&gt;Instead, this week’s announcement is an attempt to reframe the narrative away from gigahertz and toward artificial intelligence and machine learning in phones — areas where Google, of course, has a big advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VbxM0h"&gt;Typically when you think about a phone’s specs, you think of the core three: CPU, GPU, and RAM. Those pieces of the SoC are what impact your day-to-day experience the most — how fast the phone feels, how long it lasts on battery, how well it connects to a cellular network, and so on. After that, there are generally some co-processors off to the side that handle discrete tasks like image processing or security. Google itself has already made some of those — the Titan M chip and Pixel Visual Core have appeared on previous phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7acPqk"&gt;“It’s definitely very different than just another co-processor,” Osterloh says. “Like with any SoC, we license a lot of technology into it, but this is our design and it was designed specifically with the purpose of driving our ML and AI forward.” Google’s argument is that the new chips in Tensor are an essential part of many of the things the new Pixel phones can do — not unlike Apple’s Neural Core in its A-Series processors.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Pixel 6 has two more fun color choices" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tt0ROElXG4wQo6XFI8EBRn2SZXo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22755096/Pixel_6_Group_Image__Transparent_.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6 has two more fun color choices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0EqsGm"&gt;“The computers of the future are becoming much more heterogenous than they have in the past,” Osterloh argues. He has for years been signaling that the end of Moore’s law will mean that computers — and phones — will need to be built differently. “There’ll be a lot more specialized sub-elements to the design to be able to do things in specific ways. This is a consequence of raw computing power running out of headroom or growing more slowly than the kinds of processing we want to do with AI,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sWIrUK"&gt;The most important of those chips is a mobile version of a Tensor Processing Unit. Google has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/5/19/11716818/google-alphago-hardware-asic-chip-tensor-processor-unit-machine-learning"&gt;making TPUs for its server farms for over five years now&lt;/a&gt;, dedicated to more efficiently performing AI and ML tasks. It offered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/26/17616140/google-edge-tpu-on-device-ai-machine-learning-devkit"&gt;an “edge” version of its TPU for enterprise solutions&lt;/a&gt; a few years ago, but the Pixel 6 marks the first time Google has put a mobile TPU in a phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8sBRVH"&gt;So what can the new TPU inside Tensor actually &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;? Google had a small handful of demos. The first two were, unsurprisingly, related to photography. Using ML to make better photos has historically been a huge advantage for Pixel phones, but in recent years progress has stagnated and competitors have caught and surpassed the Pixel — and far surpassed it when it comes to video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ekejP9"&gt;Google clearly wants to take back the crown and thinks the TPU is the way to do it. The first demo Google showed was a blurry photo of a toddler — the kid was moving because that is what kids do. A second version of the photo was the same but run through Tensor’s TPU, and the kid’s face was sharper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="Umsfbk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This problem is a very difficult smartphone camera physics problem. We’re trying to turn those kinds of problems into data problems, where we can solve them with Tensor.”  &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 6 (top) and Pixel 6 Pro (bottom)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wtGJVbpSxRQ-1mZX2Td8DvmiXtI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22755093/Google_Pixel_6_Pro_Google_Pixel_6.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Pixel 6 (top) and Pixel 6 Pro (bottom).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The regular Google Pixel 6 has a matte rail." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vTVVJxkcFa-nfkz1Kyx9ZPf-pOw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22755110/Google_Pixel_6.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The regular Google Pixel 6 has a matte rail.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VMfZs2"&gt;It wasn’t a deepfake. What the Pixel 6 does is run the process of snapping a bunch of photos from the main sensor and combine them into a single, HDR image. But now the Pixel 6 also has the ultrawide grab a fast, sharper image to capture that detail. Then the TPU recognizes that there’s a face, and then combines the ultrawide’s image with the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4mSnOL"&gt;But impressive image demos are a dime a dozen these days. Google itself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/17/15654476/google-photos-object-removal-feature-demo"&gt;famously promised&lt;/a&gt; to remove chain link fences from photos in 2017 but never delivered. The promise of Tensor is to deliver better results more quickly, since the SoC is designed to more efficiently run data through the TPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWqimK"&gt;It’s right to be skeptical until we get a chance to test the camera ourselves. It’s &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; to be skeptical of the Pixel 6’s video abilities given the Pixel line’s history of mediocre video — but Google’s second demo didn’t make skepticism easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iHlccE"&gt;It was a simple pan across a beach, with the setting sun fully in frame for much of the shot. As an HDR video, it was challenging. Google set up a rig with the Pixel 6, Pixel 5, and iPhone 12 Pro Max and shot the same pan with all three. As you might expect in a demo provided by Google, video from Google’s new phone looked the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l5X1s6"&gt;Specifically, it didn’t artificially brighten shadows too much like the iPhone 12 Pro Max and also maintained a more natural white balance throughout. Compared to the Pixel 5, it was no contest. Last year’s Pixel over-sharpened everything into abstract art while the Pixel 6 looked much more natural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BZDoGR"&gt;The main reason the Pixel 6’s video was better, according to Osterloh, is that putting the TPU in line with the whole image processing stand means that the same HDRNet process that Google applies to still images can now be applied to every single frame in video. The demo I saw was in 4K at 30fps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PWNvSE"&gt;The other demos were a bit more subtle and were related to translating speech to text, which Tensor handled locally without needing an internet connection. In one, the Pixel’s on-device auto-caption feature appeared to be a little faster and more accurate — and was even able to translate from French to English in real time from a playing video. “We’re now able to run data-center quality models on our device,” says Osterloh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6fqNSB"&gt;In another demo, Osterloh showed that speaking to type was nearly instantaneous and that he could use the keyboard to edit words inline at the same time he was speaking — both input methods were active at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7cCzEr"&gt;In addition to the TPU, the Pixel 6 will also have a new version of Google’s Titan M security chip. In the blog post announcing the Pixel 6, Google is going so far as to say that “with Tensor’s new security core and Titan M2, Pixel 6 will have the most layers of hardware security in any phone,” with a footnote that the claim is “based on a count of independent hardware security subsystems and components.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vujKKs"&gt;Finally, Osterloh says there will be an “always-on computer” that will handle low-level, low-power processes like the ambient display. The battery life target for the Pixel 6 is still only “all day,” however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 6 Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5lEcuap0y9W88cjxHw_0a_-k5V4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22755100/Google_Pixel_6_Pro__Alt_Angle_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Pixel 6 Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="vDq0Xi"&gt;The thing about AI and ML is that it might make search more accurate and photos better, but it’s not necessarily going to improve everything that happens on your phone. Osterloh suggests that as the TPU takes up more AI cycles, that could free up the other chips for more performance. That may be, but it’s still hard to make AI a selling point for a phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="48JZZ9"&gt;So Google has its work cut out for it. Doubly so, actually, since the Google Pixel line has languished in the low single digits of market share in the US ever since it was announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J6HZlJ"&gt;With the Google Pixel 6, Osterloh says that’s going to change. He’s ready to start grabbing market share wherever he can get it — whether that be from Apple or Samsung. “The product is really, now, The Google Phone,” Osterloh says. “So we are ready to invest a lot in marketing and we want to grow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BAkOHu"&gt;In last week’s earnings call, Google CFO Ruth Porat warned investors to keep a look out for higher than usual marketing costs: “In addition, we expect sales and marketing expenses to be more heavily weighted to the back half of the year in part to support product launches in the holiday season.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="NgOcWh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s the first time Google has truly pulled out all the stops for a Pixel phone, but will that be enough?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XqhROr"&gt;It has been five years since Google started making Pixel phones and in nearly every single one of those years I’ve asked some variation of the same question: is Google really serious about hardware? Does it intend to be a real competitor and make real money or is the entire effort just a rehashing of the old Nexus strategy? Or, to use a more recent reference, is the Pixel line just in a kind of “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/21/technology/sundar-pichai-google.html?referringSource=articleShare"&gt;Pantry Mode&lt;/a&gt;,” kept alive just in case it’s ever needed for real?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mo0jKv"&gt;Osterloh says that work on this new Tensor silicon began four years ago. Perhaps not coincidentally, it was about four years ago when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/20/16340108/google-htc-smartphone-team-acquisition-announced"&gt;Google announced it intended to buy HTC’s phone hardware division&lt;/a&gt;. That must have been the year Google got serious about the Pixel line — and it’s only now that we’re beginning to see the fruits of that effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m1I6ga"&gt;Will it be enough? Will the Pixel 6 seriously vie for the enthusiast crowd that wants the very best phone and also grab measurable market share at the same time? We are very far from being able to answer those questions right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="sv73Ck"&gt;I am not going to tell you to get hyped up for the Pixel 6. It’s too early and there’s too much we don’t know. But I do think it’s very interesting that &lt;em&gt;Google&lt;/em&gt; wants to start building up hype. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VmhrjB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CsuCuO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Senate negotiators release bipartisan infrastructure bill</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="U.S. Lawmakers Narrow Infrastructure Gaps Without Reaching Deal" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bc9ApbSa5l1C2Qd13dJ1lEW_R-U=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69666829/1234273799.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qQZv2E"&gt;On Sunday, a bipartisan group of senators released their over $1 trillion infrastructure package after weeks of negotiations. As written, the bill authorizes over $500 billion in new spending to strengthen roads, bridges, and other physical infrastructure like high-speed broadband and electric vehicle adoption. The result is the largest domestic spending bill in more than 10 years, touching on nearly every aspect of the US economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YhmCC7"&gt;Last week, negotiators reached a deal to bolster the nation’s broadband networks with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598636/white-house-infrastructure-broadband-package-bipartisan"&gt;an additional $65 billion&lt;/a&gt;, but left it unclear exactly how that funding would be spent or how much of it would go toward increasing affordability and adoption.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;But the text released yesterday contained language to make the FCC’s Emergency Broadband Benefit program permanent, renaming it the Affordably Connectivity Fund. The permanent version of the program would offer lower monthly subsidies — $30 rather than the previous $50 — but would also provide $100 for equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RIui6c"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The Senate can quickly process relevant amendments and pass this bill in a matter of days”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IjTsCq"&gt;More than 4 million households have enrolled in the Emergency Broadband Benefit program since it was established during the pandemic, according to the FCC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MYiGjd"&gt;The bipartisan package also includes billions to build half a million electric vehicle (EV) chargers across the country, in an effort to increase EV sales in the US. The bill would also expand government involvement in cryptocurrency, &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/new-infrastructure-bill-looks-to-raise-30b-through-crypto-taxes"&gt;raising $28 billion&lt;/a&gt; from a new tax on cryptocurrency brokers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0AzMQ3"&gt;It’s unclear when the bill is expected to receive a vote on the Senate floor, but Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said that it could be approved later this week. “Given how bipartisan the bill is and how much work has already been put in to get the details right, I believe the Senate can quickly process relevant amendments and pass this bill in a matter of days,” Schumer said on Sunday. The text of the bill could still change as a result of amendments accepted on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYUDX0"&gt;Still, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has pledged not to bring the bipartisan package to the floor until the Senate votes on a second $3.5 trillion spending package through the reconciliation process, likely to proceed on party lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e5KZQg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PwO07G"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft director with intelligence background will lead the White House’s space council</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Key Speakers At The Satellite 2020 Conference" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AnnUn4M2YsvNAe9z6r6UNUfLZ6c=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69666716/1206287582.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HO4RGG"&gt;The White House’s core space policy body will be led by Chirag Parikh, a veteran intelligence official and senior director for Microsoft’s space-based cloud services, Vice President Kamala Harris announced on Monday. Harris, chair of the National Space Council, tapped the seasoned national security official to lead the council’s day-to-day activities as the Biden administration sees global competition mount in space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="04U2D2"&gt;Parikh’s appointment, coming three months after the White House confirmed Harris would chair its space council, gets the ball rolling for the Biden administration’s coordinated priorities in space. Harris aims to put “her own personal stamp on the council” that could include a heightened focus on cybersecurity for space assets and ways to leverage satellites in Biden’s push to fight climate change, senior administration officials said in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pV0l0u"&gt;In 2017, the Trump administration revived the space council, which had been disbanded since 1993, four years after it was formed by George H. W. Bush. Parikh will succeed Trump’s space council executive secretary Scott Pace, whose space policy directives sought to craft standards of international behavior in space and retooled an Obama-era space exploration program into a commercial-focused sprint to land humans on the Moon, what’s now called the Artemis program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jL3oHz"&gt;Parikh served two years as deputy national intelligence officer for science and technology for the US intelligence community, and later led the National Security Council’s space policy wing for six years under the Obama administration, when the National Space Council was defunct. Before his appointment to helm Biden’s space council operations, he was a senior director for Azure Space, Microsoft’s cloud platform that links with satellites in space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CyIgYH"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Congratulations to Chirag Parikh, who was appointed today as Executive Secretary of the National Space Council by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VP?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@VP&lt;/a&gt; Harris! I look forward to working with you to ensure American leadership and a safe, sustainable future in space.&lt;/p&gt;— Bill Nelson (@SenBillNelson) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SenBillNelson/status/1422207705398272003?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8zNRGZ"&gt;Parikh’s appointment was welcomed by space analysts, who say his experience leading an array of space-related bureaucracies makes him a good fit for his new role. The space council bundles a number of cabinet-level officials together, from NASA administrator to the director of national intelligence, for quarterly or biannual meetings to discuss civil and international space issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2neLY"&gt;“He was almost like an interagency coordinator, which is very similar to the role that he will be playing as the executive secretary of the National Space Council,” said Victoria Samson, space policy analyst and Washington director for the Secure World Foundation. “So he’ll be bringing years of expertise to do a lot of the same sort of things that he’ll be doing in his new job.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tyWuyU"&gt;In the two months before the Biden administration confirmed Harris would helm the space council, it wasn’t immediately clear whether the White House would even keep it after the Trump administration. The Obama administration crafted its space policy through the Office of Science and Technology Policy and the National Security Council — under Parikh’s space tenure. But the vice president’s commitment to lead the council in May became one of a few rare instances where Biden’s White House aligned with Trump-era initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Former Vice President Mike Pence speaks at the sixth meeting of Trump’s National Space Council in August 2019.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4CDJ7V"&gt;Biden has embraced NASA’s Artemis program, the Trump-branded effort to land humans on the Moon by 2024 and use its surface as a training ground for future missions to Mars. And under Biden, NASA is keeping its preference for commercially focused projects in space, like its Commercial Crew Program — which began under Obama — and core elements of the Artemis program, which was created under Pace’s space council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="InIKCJ"&gt;“They certainly have different backgrounds,” space policy analyst Brian Weeden of the Secure World Foundation, said on Pace and Parikh’s resumes. “It might be the case that Chirag [Parikh] is a little more focused early on in the national security side of space, rather than the civil side, because that’s his background ... but the Biden admin as also expressed strong support for the Artemis program, and for Gateway, and for commercial cargo and crew, so I don’t expect that to just be ignored.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>8BitDo adds Xbox media remotes to its lineup of excellent console accessories</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pFKOJuRY-OLSRAExdvHC9Eba638=/0x0:2560x1707/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69666522/2_8BitDo_Media_Remote.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The remotes will ship in September.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: 8BitDo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A1q1FX"&gt;8BitDo has a new pair of officially licensed media remotes for the Xbox Series X, Series S, and the Xbox One, which offer a more suitable controller for streaming services or the consoles’ built-in 4K Blu-ray players. There are two versions available: a slightly larger &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B2R2GRM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$24.99 black model&lt;/a&gt; which includes a full numpad and a compact &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B2SYWH9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$19.99 white version&lt;/a&gt;. Both are available to preorder on Amazon today, with shipping expected September 15th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DJhXgn"&gt;We’ve generally liked 8BitDo’s controllers in the past. Its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22364301/8bitdo-pro-2-controller-review-switch-back-buttons"&gt;Pro 2 controller&lt;/a&gt; gives Nintendo’s own Switch Pro controller a run for its money in terms of functionality and is more affordable to boot, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22243957/8bitdo-arcade-stick-review-switch-pc-price"&gt;its wireless Arcade Stick&lt;/a&gt; is a great way to play fighting games on Switch and PC. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The white model is more compact, but lacks a numpad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tv2kU8"&gt;Although only one of 8BitDo’s Xbox Media Remotes includes a numpad, both have basically every button you could want, including playback and navigation controls, and a mute button. Most of the Xbox controller’s face buttons are also present, including A / B / X / Y, view, menu, and a home button that can wake the paired console remotely. The buttons are back lit, which should help with using the remote in cinema-appropriate lighting, and power is provided by a pair of AAA batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtULkB"&gt;8BitDo’s new accessory is &lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/theres-brand-new-xbox-series-x-series-s-pdp-talon-media-remote-preorder"&gt;far from the only media remote&lt;/a&gt; available for Microsoft’s latest consoles, and any older media remotes designed for the Xbox One &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/majornelson/status/1319303597041930241"&gt;should also be cross-compatible&lt;/a&gt;. But 8BitDo’s Media Remotes are cheap, stylish, and come from a brand that knows a thing or two about console peripherals. If you’re in the market, then they’re definitely worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>R2-D2 is officially a Tamagotchi digital pet now, two decades too late</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u7tkVxTrERLKITAkXYSkjg7ALhM=/120x0:1416x864/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69666349/r2_d2_tamagotchi_droid_buddy_blue_TALL_01.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8WycKn"&gt;R2-D2 — &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;’ beloved droid — is now officially a &lt;a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-r2-d2-tamagotchi"&gt;Tamagotchi toy&lt;/a&gt;, letting you take a pocket-sized, pixelated virtual pet version of the iconic astromech with you wherever you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uEo6Ak"&gt;The R2-D2 Tamagotchi comes in two colors: a white model that more accurately resembles R2’s chassis, and a more retro translucent blue version that harkens back two decades to when people actually bought Tamagotchis.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kAueX32iwa2RESsRYkgBfJNe5cY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22755862/Screen_Shot_2021_08_02_at_9.44.25_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VsE88d"&gt;As for the actual gameplay experience, the R2-D2 version of the digital pet appears to be virtually identical to the same Tamagotchi gameplay loop that has existed for over 20 years. Using a 24 by 30 pixelated LCD display and three physical buttons, you’ll be able to train your R2-D2 pet in 19 different skills, take care of the droid by charging and cleaning it to keep it happy, and play nine different mini-games (including Dejarik and a firefighting game). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xgLshn"&gt;Technically, the new R2-D2 toy is the first &lt;em&gt;official&lt;/em&gt; Tamagotchi to feature the popular droid. But all the way back in 1997, Tiger Electronics released a Giga Pet toy starring R2-D2 (along with two other licensed &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; models featuring Yoda and the Rancor). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HfoYAG"&gt;It’s not clear that the new R2-D2 model is any more technologically advanced or materially different than the original Giga Pet version, given that virtual pet technology appears to have advanced at an even slower pace than TI-83 calculators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ekiFfj"&gt;Given that the virtual pet fad also ended sometime around the turn of the millennium, it’s also not immediately obvious &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; there is a Tamagotchi R2-D2 being released in 2021, nor why Tamagotchi and Disney felt the need to spend nearly three months teasing said product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="xlq6Pr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Tamagotchi is back, but does it need to be?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/10/16430134/tamagotchi-pet-bandai-america-nostalgia"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="zQwLNv"&gt;But the new Tamagotchi R2-D2 is, well, an actual Tamagotchi this time around, complete with the familiar egg-shaped case. It’ll also presumably be more affordable than the Giga Pets version, which can &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fb%2FStar-Wars-Giga-Pets%2F158701%2Fbn_1892804&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F2%2F22605668%2Fr2-d2-tamagotchi-digital-pet-star-wars-release-date-preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;cost $35 to $50 on eBay&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hC3xhr"&gt;Tamagotchi has yet to announce a price for the pocket astromech pet, but the company currently sells branded Tamagotchi toys for other franchises for around $25, so it’s likely that the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; model will land somewhere in that price range, too. &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B097Z451CX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Preorders start later today&lt;/a&gt; at 12PM ET, ahead of a November 11th release date. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Govee’s excellent TV backlight kit is even more affordable today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/82IH1Q0KZWxnnbIFrFyzOF9u9iM=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69666309/verge_IMG_8618_2040pxl.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wd0vGA"&gt;Govee’s Immersion TV LED backlights can elevate your TV watching experience by syncing its lights to what’s on your 55-inch or 65-inch screen. The effect makes it look like the colors bleed through the bezels of your TV, out onto your walls. It’s not the only product that can do this, but it’s far less expensive than most at $80. For a limited time, Govee is knocking $5 off that price to sweeten the deal a little more. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Immersion-Backlights-Ambient-Assistant/dp/B08LVPWQQP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;You can get this product for $75&lt;/a&gt; if you check the $5 “extra savings coupon” listed underneath the price on the product page. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22566408/govee-immersion-ambilight-tv-backlight-review"&gt;R&lt;strong&gt;ead our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bG3Ar3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10681491"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mXEjJ1"&gt;Best Buy has been a reliable source for deals on Apple’s iPhone cases that rarely see much in the way of discounts. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747953714241426864" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It launched another batch of price cuts today&lt;/a&gt;, focusing on cases for the iPhone 11 and iPhone 12 models, with a few extras in the mix. For those who are looking to maximize battery life in their &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747953525061579568" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPhone 11 Pro&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747953663624836410#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;11 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt;, you can get the Smart Battery Case for either phone at the same $52 price. This is $78 off its usual price. Sure, it’s going to add some serious heft to your phone, but it’s a smart purchase if you’d rather not plug into a charger every night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EV23et"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10607518"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e0ceuf"&gt;The same retailer is also hosting a tempting deal on Amazon’s latest generation of Echo Buds. They’re $120 at Amazon, but &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747338177907879421#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can get the improved version for $80&lt;/a&gt; in either the black or white colorways. Best Buy offered this deal last week, but today appears to be your last chance to take advantage of it. According to Chris Welch, who reviewed them at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, these are tough to beat for the price (even tougher since they’re $40 off). They offer better comfort than the previous generation, as well as a noise cancellation effect that’s better at silencing your surroundings. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432633/amazon-echo-buds-2021-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bpujWQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10600144"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cWaAqx"&gt;If you prefer a pair of dedicated on-ears over a pair of earbuds, &lt;a href="https://store.simplymac.com/products/apple-airpods-max" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Simply Mac is offering the Airpods Max for $440&lt;/a&gt; with promo code &lt;strong&gt;INSTA20&lt;/strong&gt;, their lowest price to date. Apple’s luxe, noise-canceling headphones offer a comfortable build and superb, balanced sound, not to mention an intuitive set of controls and perks like Apple’s spatial audio, a feature that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recently rolled out to Apple Music&lt;/a&gt; (to varying degrees of success). They’re one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best pairs of noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; you can buy right now, especially if you’re already entrenched in the Apple ecosystem. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qCEmAL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M5udHk"&gt;Here are some other deals that you might be interested in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="j2sXig"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Scarlet Nexus&lt;/em&gt; (Xbox One, Xbox Series S / X, PS4 / PS5) is $50 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747955926186318906#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Scarlet-Nexus-PlayStation-4/dp/B088CK6GP1/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (usually $60).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RZbJQF"&gt;Sony’s WH-1000XM4 wireless, noise-canceling headphones are back down to $278 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0863TXGM3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. This is the $72 price cut that reappears about once a month. So far, these haven’t sold for a lower price than this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mw7hwp"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; for Nintendo Switch &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747956084706079660" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is down to $41&lt;/a&gt; at Best Buy, which is frankly a steal for how much replay value this game offers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Libertarians built a crypto mecca in Keene, New Hampshire — then feds tore it down</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NiPgxqUBym3UHfySkycJ_YQ2qto=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69666076/akrales_210614_4628_0601.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Libertarians built a Bitcoin economy in a small New Hampshire town — then feds tore it down&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="BtajKc"&gt;The sky was still dark when the agents arrived at Leverett St. in Keene, New Hampshire, a leafy block of kit houses at the quiet edges of the small college town. They settled on a house at the corner, surrounding it with two armored BearCat G3s and a fleet of unmarked SUVs. Both BearCats had gunners stationed in a hatch on the roof, clad in camo fatigues. The only light came from the blue-and-red sirens, strobing off houses in every direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eYzVNT"&gt;Inside, Ian Freeman was asleep with his girlfriend and their small dog Coconut. He woke to the sound of exploding glass. A ramming pole, tethered to the front of one of the BearCats, had plowed through a first floor window, tearing off the frame as it backed up. Freeman threw on a bathrobe and stumbled downstairs, still shaking off sleep. There was shattered glass everywhere. His first thought was that some stranger had thrown a brick. But then he heard a whirring sound, a small hovering drone that police had deployed to explore the house. He looked outside and saw blinding lights. Coming into focus beside the lights, men pointed rifles at him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMxTOz"&gt;One mile east, Freeman’s talk radio co-host Aria DiMezzo stumbled downstairs in her underwear only to be met by a tactical assault team, who told her they would shoot her if she moved. At the town’s Bitcoin Embassy, a group of agents tore a Bitcoin dispenser from the concrete floor, leaving four symmetrical holes where it had been bolted down. They took another machine from the Campus Convenience in central Keene, another from a bar called Murphy’s Taproom, and a fourth from the Red Arrow Diner in Nashua. Together, they held more than $50,000 in cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y8PwAG"&gt;There was even more money in Freeman’s home, seized by federal agents and later reported to the courts in a forfeiture filing: $180,000 in cash, a 100oz Swiss silver bar (worth roughly $3,000), and a platinum coin stamped with a portrait of Ron Paul. There were boxes full of gold-laced bills called goldbacks that were too obscure to even put a value on — some taken from Freeman’s home, others seized in transit by the postal service. The biggest prize was two Casascius physical Bitcoins, worth 100 and 1 btc respectively, first available in 2011 and now worth more than $4 million.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0MMjLrgqc_UWnNwWfzMlqa7xlls=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22750682/Free_Talk_Live___LRN.fm_Studio_Raids.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Video: Christopher Waid&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A BearCat ramming through the window of Freeman’s studio, as captured on video by Christopher Waid.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XZP1nD_julm23Gv4_9PMF466-4c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22750683/Mighty_Moose_Mart___Bitcoin_Embassy_Raids.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Video: Christopher Waid&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Evidence being removed from the Bitcoin Embassy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wS0BPU"&gt;For police, the money was nearly as important as Freeman himself. For years, they had been tracking his Bitcoin business for evidence of money laundering or other crimes. As far as they were concerned, it was all part of an unlicensed money transmittal scheme processing millions of dollars a year. The purpose of the raid was to break that system, tearing out Freeman’s Bitcoin machines one by one and seizing any illegal proceeds along with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w8iE74"&gt;News of the raid spread fast. A local Linux developer and crypto activist named Christopher Waid rushed to Freeman’s house to film the last gasps of the raid, catching footage of the BearCats, the drone, and the bizarre militarism of it all. When he was done there, he headed to the Bitcoin Embassy, where a crowd had gathered to watch police carry out duffel bags and plastic tubs full of loose paper. Despite the name, the embassy was little more than a side room to a convenience store. The most radical part of it was the bookshelf, offering DevOps manuals alongside copies of Ludwig von Mises’ &lt;em&gt;Socialism&lt;/em&gt; and Robert A. Heinlein’s &lt;em&gt;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X2jzAM"&gt;For years, Freeman had been warning about federal encroachment, broadcasting every night on the radio about the tightening fist of the state. His Bitcoin venture was part of a broader Free State movement in New Hampshire, turning a quiet corner of New England into a libertarian paradise. Now the counterforce was here, like a prophecy fulfilled, and the Free Staters understood their role perfectly. They were ready with cameras, asking for warrants and litigating precisely where they were allowed to stand while the raid dragged on. When police herded the crowd across the street, it just meant they had to yell that much louder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xtK2m5"&gt;“You guys are the fucking enemy!” one of the protestors told the agents, as they carried out another tub of papers. “You’re not protecting anybody’s fucking freedom. You’re all a bunch of gangsters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="gFwn2B"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="oxpc6c"&gt;By the end of the day on March 16th, six people were in custody: including Freeman, his girlfriend, and a married couple who lived nearby. Two co-hosts on the radio show were also named: DiMezzo and a man born as Richard Paul, who had legally changed his name to Nobody in protest of the bureaucratic state. According to the indictment, all six had been involved in Freeman’s Bitcoin dispenser business. An indictment filed under seal the day before the raid counted out thirteen instances when someone from the group had contacted a bank on behalf of the business since April 2017, listing each call or email as a count of wire fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5aL3et"&gt;The defense lawyers describe the project in more idealistic terms. “The defendants were a loosely affiliated group of people with libertarian political leanings that included a strong belief that Bitcoin was a great development for those who champion human freedom,” one filing reads.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L2RMpoBl_8YSGlT6AKX3cZCn9Y8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22729604/akrales_210614_4628_0094.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ian Freeman in his home recording studio where he produces FreeTalk Live.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CwHjFq"&gt;There are lots of people like that in Keene, although you might not guess it from driving through. A quiet college town of less than 25,000 people, the libertarian migration to New Hampshire (also known as the Free State Project) has turned it into a magnet for cryptocurrency buffs, some of whom have unexpectedly become millionaires after the Bitcoin boom of the past few years. In 2019, &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; called the town a “crypto mecca,” citing more than 20 businesses accepting some form of cryptocurrency payment. Many of those businesses were solicited directly by Freeman and his cohort, who saw cryptocurrency as a kind of moral crusade against the belligerence of the US government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UH2JY3"&gt;Freeman is best known as the host of &lt;em&gt;Free Talk Live&lt;/em&gt;, a libertarian talk radio show syndicated to 185 radio stations across the country. Many of the activists outside the embassy had appeared on the show at some point, including Waid. When the BearCat rammed through the window, it was ramming into Freeman’s studio, a maze of cables and audio racks where the show is recorded, mixed, and distributed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2GC6p3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Free Talk Live&lt;/em&gt; gave Freeman the power to draw together a community of crypto-minded libertarians in Keene, but it also amplified his ugliest mistakes. Most recently, it gave center stage to his still-active lawsuit against New Hampshire’s mask mandate. (“I was never really convinced that COVID was a particularly dangerous thing,” Freeman tells me when I ask about the case.) The show also gave an early home to the infamous “crying nazi” Christopher Cantwell, who appeared on &lt;em&gt;Free Talk Live&lt;/em&gt; when he was still trying to brand himself as a libertarian anti-police activist. (“When he became a racist, I fired him from &lt;em&gt;Free Talk Live&lt;/em&gt;,” Freeman says. “He just kept getting deeper into that world.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0wEK9n"&gt;The chaotic world of libertarian talk radio made Freeman’s show a natural gathering point for the early Bitcoin community. &lt;em&gt;Free Talk&lt;/em&gt;’s first call about Bitcoin came in December 2010, the same month Satoshi Nakamoto disappeared from active development of the Bitcoin spec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="caBY4L"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Freeman’s cryptocurrency holdings are now worth well over $5 million, according to forfeiture documents&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k3Wjtg"&gt;Hyped on the &lt;em&gt;Free Talk Live &lt;/em&gt;site as the first consumer media mention of Bitcoin, the episode now comes off as a bizarre time capsule. The first 20 minutes are taken up with a discussion of voluntarist alternatives to the fire department and municipal road maintenance, after which the conversation turns to crystal meth and Venezuela. Around 40 minutes in, a caller named Jeremy from Australia chimes in to talk about a new digital currency called Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rbd8es"&gt;“It was about six cents for a Bitcoin in August and now it’s 26 cents, so it’s already increased quite a bit,” Jeremy says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rjohq1"&gt;“My initial concern was that it’s essentially a fiat currency, because it’s not backed by anything,” Freeman responds. “It’s a neat idea. I don’t know if it’s yet a fantastic alternative.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Ex8ry"&gt;Freeman came around to Bitcoin in the months that followed, eventually fitting it into broader complaints about the way the US government controls the value of the dollar. The price kept rising: within three years it had cleared $1,000, then $10,000 four years after that. According to the forfeiture documents, Freeman’s cryptocurrency holdings are now worth well over $5 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="np4ZOz"&gt;As more money flooded into cryptocurrency, something else came with it. The version of Bitcoin that’s become popular in recent years is less political and more straightforwardly interested in making money. Venture capital has embraced the blockchain as an opportunity on the same scale as targeted advertising or independent-contractor labor schemes. It’s rare to hear concerns about the Federal Reserve at a Bitcoin conference these days, and few are interested in standoffs with regulators — there’s just no money in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A4na7I"&gt;But if you’re ready to work with regulators, the money is almost endless. Coinbase, an early adherent to federal Know Your Customer rules, is now processing more than $100 billion of transactions every month, while the company itself is valued at $50 billion. New wallet regulations are creeping forward from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, and while some activists cry foul, most entrepreneurs have welcomed them with open arms. At the Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami, the Winklevoss twins promised a crowd of real estate moguls and retail investors that anyone who owns a Bitcoin will one day be a millionaire. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vuBEuuluCjeDh5TRKt0Uy6yDt_k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22729637/akrales_210615_4628_0976.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;FreeTalk Live radio co-host Aria DiMezzo is facing unlicensed money transmittal charges.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nhOO1L"&gt;For true believers like Freeman, that shift has been bittersweet. “There’s nothing wrong with somebody seeing it from that perspective and just wanting to invest in a thing and be successful,” Freeman tells me. “But in the libertarian Bitcoin community up here, they see it differently. They see it as a dramatic transfer of power.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7qkb9F"&gt;But if Mt. Gox and the Silk Road represented a transfer of power, the power is now shifting back the other way. In 2017, international raids took down BTC-e (then the largest unregulated exchange), with a money laundering sting revealed the following year. An Ohio man was arrested last year for running a Bitcoin tumbler called Helix, which mixed blockchain records with obscure transactions; a month after the New Hampshire raid, a Russian-Swedish national was arrested for running a similar service called Bitcoin Fog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4OctrU"&gt;In public statements, prosecutors refer to these as “darknet” cases, treating the unregulated Bitcoin system as a loosely organized criminal conspiracy. There is a lot of tainted money on the blockchain: money from drug sales, online scams, or stolen from individual users as part of a breach. Tumblers and anonymous exchanges let criminals escape with that money, so law enforcement agencies are trying to shut them down one by one, like plugging holes in a dam. With so much dirty money trying to get clean, the prosecutions take on a kind of fatalist logic. Any unregulated exchange will eventually be used for money-laundering; any unmonitored flow of coins will eventually be an accomplice to a crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fSYDsc"&gt;For the Keene project, keeping those coins unmonitored was the whole point. Their goal was to maintain the privacy and freedom of Bitcoin’s original design while staying just inside the bounds of the law. But to the federal government, it just looked like one more hole to be plugged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="OLkxdb"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="gBauwi"&gt;By the end of May, both Freeman and DiMezzo were out on bail, with the trial scheduled for October 2022. Waid announced Freeman’s release with a wry blog post on Free Keene: &lt;a href="https://forum.shiresociety.com/t/after-significant-delays-hostage-takers-release-ian-from-from-merrimack-county-spiritual-retreat/12666"&gt;“After Significant Delays Hostage Takers Release Ian From From Merrimack County Spiritual Retreat.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVQmV3"&gt;The conditions of the bail are stringent, befitting the aftermath of the raid: they can’t leave their homes, trade Bitcoin, or communicate with other co-defendants. That last provision created significant problems for &lt;em&gt;Free Talk Live&lt;/em&gt;, since it meant the main two co-hosts could no longer speak to each other without risking more jail time. Within a few weeks, the court granted a relief order letting them talk for the purposes of coordinating the show, and the show returned to its usual troublemaking. By the end of July, they were drumming up support for a ballot measure that would allow New Hampshire to secede from the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="byjha9"&gt;Nobody took a more adversarial stance toward the legal system and stayed in jail for months longer. According to court records, his calls with the public defender broke down into screaming matches. After two weeks in jail, he made a phone call so alarming that it halted his efforts for pretrial release. The recording itself is sealed, but a filing gives alarming titles for the exhibits, including “audio clip — needs to die,” “audio clip — start shooting pigs,” and “audio clip — kill himself if sentenced.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mt058S"&gt;Prosecutors say he made threats against his public defender’s life, and the public defender withdrew from the case the next day, putting the bail hearing on hold. As late as August, he was still in jail. Supporters rallied outside the corrections building, waving signs that said “Free Nobody.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y3YHdkK03rZOt11pkHr09fhS_hs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22729627/akrales_210614_4628_0553.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Christopher Waid, a crypto activist, filmed the raids on both Freeman’s house and the Bitcoin Embassy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G8QXr0"&gt;Freeman’s cohort had always lived at the margins of the broader Free State Project — but after the arrest, a new wave of libertarian activism sprung up around him. The Free Keene website became a flurry of daily news about bail hearings and protests. Waid &lt;a href="https://thecrypto6.com/"&gt;started a website&lt;/a&gt; to support “the Crypto6,” as he called them. Soon, T-shirts bearing the name were a regular sight around town. A longtime Free State activist named Dave Ridley started organizing jail rallies, lending more local credibility to the cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jFwdhM"&gt;As the jail rallies tapered off, Ridley turned to a more ostentatious kind of activism: branding himself as “Bitcoin Gandhi” and launching a 24-day march from Keene to Concord dressed in robes in a historically accurate Gandhi costume. A string of YouTube videos show him walking down the narrow shoulders of two-lane highways, picking up trash and occasionally being questioned by confused but genial highway patrollers. In an open letter to the head of New England’s General Services Agency, Ridley called for the federal government to distance itself from the case, saying, “escalations of this type indicate a Venezuelan-style slide into currency-fascism.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The month after, Ridley’s Gandhi alter ego took part in another protest outside the Concord federal building with Mr. Bitcoin, a Mr. Met-style foam suit embodiment of a physical Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CzxxKM"&gt;Freeman was familiar with this kind of civil disobedience, acting out to showcase the brutality of the carceral status quo. Years earlier, Freeman had smoked marijuana on the main street of Keene, daring local cops to arrest him for a crime that usually goes unpunished. (A friend filmed the encounter from across the street.) A longer running gag is Freeman’s refusal to pay municipal fines, litigating every parking ticket or summons until the bureaucracy finds it easier to simply give up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dKWdL2"&gt;Looking at his Bitcoin business, it can be hard to tell where that activism ends and the straightforward business begins. Freeman’s machines were real, and he was making money by building out cryptocurrency infrastructure like any entrepreneur. But he arranged the business in a self-consciously risky way, avoiding financial licensing and other measures that insulate many Bitcoin businesses from prosecution. Even more than his Wall Street competitors, Freeman was deeply familiar with cryptocurrency prosecutions. He knew that his Bitcoin dispenser left him exposed, but it never slowed him down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="s0GfNo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I was on a mission to spread Bitcoin”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ezul7Z"&gt;Freeman believes he was under investigation as early as 2018, when he says a federal agent approached Renee Spinella with questions about Freeman’s Bitcoin dealings. Spinella refused to inform on Freeman; she and her husband were among the six arrested during the raids. But it was an ominous sign, the first indication of a federal case against Freeman’s Bitcoin business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oDkYtF"&gt;Still, it wasn’t enough to make Freeman drop the project. As he tells it, his Bitcoin work was too important to give up, a kind of moral crusade against the American state and its ability to wage war. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GX7hoV"&gt;“I was on a mission to spread Bitcoin,” Freeman says. “To give people an opportunity to get out of this government money system that funds evil and funds violence and funds war. Dollar by dollar, people need to get out of that system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ehlMw"&gt;Freeman also didn’t think the FBI could make a case. “We believed that this was legal,” he says. “There was a legal opinion written by our church attorney that looked at both federal and state regulations and he said, this is just a sale of a product; this isn’t money transmission.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Poo6Yt"&gt;That opinion, prepared by the Shire Free Church, rests on a unique technical point that makes Freeman’s Bitcoin dispensers more like vending machines than an ATM. The machines look like a Cupertino-fried version of your standard cash machine, but each one holds its own wallet, akin to a stash of Bitcoins held physically inside the machine. So instead of transmitting your money from somewhere else, Freeman argues it’s merely dispensing a locally controlled inventory. It’s a clever distinction, although one can see how the FBI might not be convinced.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k_WaLyg5aQC5NwxpaJ436asEj-A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22729635/akrales_210615_4628_0735.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Bitcoin Cash sticker remains on the door to the Campus Convenience store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kVZFZr"&gt;Freeman was operating the business openly and the New Hampshire Banking Department never told him to shut it down, but he kept receiving ominous signs from law enforcement. Earlier this year, he was cultivated by a stranger who claimed to be a drug dealer — and who Freeman believes was actually an undercover FBI agent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VLwBm5"&gt;“This guy had been a Bitcoin buyer, seemed like a decent guy. He’d shown up at one of our crypto meetups,” Freeman says. “He wasn’t even talking to me personally, but I was within earshot and I heard him say he was a heroin and ecstasy dealer and it was like, ‘Red alert! We have a possible fed here! You’re either a federal agent or you’re a fucking moron.’” Freeman says he recognized the legal danger and refused to sell to the man, thinking he’d avoided a money laundering charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EPY1Na"&gt;But if Freeman was ready to butt heads with the federal government, he wasn’t ready for the dramatic violence of the raid. “They could have just come and knocked,” Freeman says. “No one had to get their windows busted in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FaagWO"&gt;He also wasn’t ready for the full scope of the charges. Reviewing the case now, he’s particularly alarmed by the charge of operating a “continuing financial crimes enterprise,” which was levied against him specifically. It seems to have been triggered by the Shire Free Church allegedly bringing in more than $5 million in gross receipts over two years, which puts it in a different class of criminal organization. When we spoke, Freeman was still expecting more charges to emerge from ongoing grand jury proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UEfOuO"&gt;“It was worse than I expected it to be,” he tells me. “And they’re not done yet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="FmD02o"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="d3dgpC"&gt;Once DiMezzo was released, one of her biggest surprises was the bail restriction on Bitcoin. It’s a reasonable request from prosecutors — you can’t let an accused diamond smuggler sell diamonds — but it’s meant a huge change in her lifestyle because, unlike most cryptocurrency enthusiasts, DiMezzo actually uses Bitcoin as money. She tells me she made about 80 percent of her purchases directly off the blockchain before the arrest, usually businesses in the Keene area that have set up Bitcoin payments through a local point-of-sale system called AnyPay. DiMezzo says she could eat at a different restaurant every night and always pay in crypto. This isn’t how Bitcoin works for most people and it can feel like Keene’s crypto mecca is a kind of island, blissfully cut off from the broader motion of cryptocurrency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XO5Z2V"&gt;After the raid, the island is shrinking. In a phone call from the Merrimack jail, Freeman’s co-host Nobody spoke to me bitterly about Bitcoin developers’ refusal to increase the block size, a disagreement that ultimately led to the 2017 Bitcoin Cash split. His side lost that fight — the block size didn’t change, pushing the price of Bitcoin up while on-blockchain transactions got slower and slower. The Keene contingent still uses Bitcoin Cash where possible or fully anonymous alternatives like Monero, but it’s a much harder sell than Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ibjtVu"&gt;The financial side of Bitcoin (the side you would find partying in Miami) isn’t interested in Bitcoin Cash. They don’t care about on-chain transactions or anonymity or anything else that would add friction to the vast sums of money pouring into cryptocurrency. For most of the new arrivals, Bitcoin is about profit, not politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZzGpok"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They probably won’t speak up in any of our cases”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nYjf8a"&gt;“There’s that division,” Freeman says, “between the people who want to be regulated and controlled and people who see [cryptocurrency] as a new freedom that we have.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LoaHGs"&gt;That division is particularly stark after the raids, now that supporters are trying to raise money and awareness. It would be a good time to have rich and powerful friends, but Freeman doesn’t have any expectation that the institutional Bitcoin world will step in. “They probably won’t speak up in any of our cases,” Freeman tells me. “We’re irrelevant to them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pV5gsa"&gt;Bitcoin was born as a way to escape from all this, to build a monetary system outside the reach of the dollar, the Fed, or the government. That was the dream that first drew Freeman into Bitcoin, before it was any more plausible of an investment than gold-laced currency or silver coins. In the decade since, Silicon Valley and Wall Street have gotten friendlier with Bitcoin, and prosecutors have learned how to tame it — but Freeman sees the same dream of escape still living beneath it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7SC8jl"&gt;“They’re gonna regulate the exchanges,” he says. “We know that. They’re going to regulate the banks, wherever else they can apply pressure… But regardless of how much effort they put into trying to control cryptocurrency, it will fail because of the decentralized nature of it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IjKZ9n"&gt;It is a point of almost religious faith for him. No matter how hard the clampdown, it will be incomplete. The wilder forces will survive just out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pwrnhR"&gt;“They can’t control Bitcoin,” he tells me. “That’s why they hate it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="ylrBWQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;A previous version of this piece misstated the total of Freeman’s physical Bitcoin holdings (101 btc, rather than 11), as well as the date of Spinella’s contact with the FBI (2018, not 2016) and the nature of AnyPay’s point-of-sale service. &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt; regrets the errors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
