    <title>Apple hires former Canoo CEO as it ramps up electric car project</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p5JmsrBSefgoMP7KT9iQdJuFS6w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69436099/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P0NglS"&gt;Ulrich Kranz, a former BMW executive and the recently departed CEO and co-founder of EV startup Canoo, has been hired by Apple, the company has confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Kranz will &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-10/apple-hires-former-bmw-executive-for-its-rebooted-car-project?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; work on the Silicon Valley behemoth’s electric car under Doug Field, the former Tesla executive who runs the day-to-day operations of the project, which is codenamed “Project Titan.” News of Kranz joining Apple was first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-10/apple-hires-former-bmw-executive-for-its-rebooted-car-project?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bOm0Rh"&gt;Kranz was one of the executives who helped launch BMW’s all-electric i3 hatchback and hybrid i8 sports car. Shortly after he left the German automaker at the end of 2016, he and fellow BMW executive Stefan Krause were tapped &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2017/12/12/16651026/faraday-future-investigation-money-debt-finances-yueting"&gt;to help turn around struggling EV startup Faraday Future&lt;/a&gt;. The pair clashed with Faraday Future’s founder, though, and in late 2017, they left and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/13/17111026/evelozcity-stefan-krause-interview-electric-cars"&gt;formed what eventually became Canoo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aImjXg"&gt;Kranz, Krause, and a handful of other expats from BMW and other legacy automakers came up with an all-electric van that they planned to sell on a subscription basis only, which they revealed in 2019. The van was designed around a compact, modular platform that included the battery pack, the electric motors, and basically all of the vehicle’s electronics, which Canoo hoped to sell or license to other manufacturers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rEWORQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Kranz was running Canoo when it held talks with Apple in 2020&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="STsz7H"&gt;Canoo’s EV platform pitch was attractive enough that Apple held talks with the startup in early 2020, as &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev"&gt;exclusively reported earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. Talks between the two companies eventually broke down, though, as Canoo preferred to take an investment, while Apple was interested in an acquisition. Canoo also had an agreement with Hyundai to build vehicles based on the platform, but the startup has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357318/canoo-hyundai-deal-dead-electric-vehicles-goev"&gt;since walked away from that deal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gix7J7"&gt;Kranz now finds himself near the top of a very large team inside Apple that is working on an electric, autonomous vehicle. Apple started the project in 2014, but it has gone through multiple revisions, with the company at one point focusing solely on developing autonomous technology. But over the last year, Apple has &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-07/apple-s-aapl-tesla-tsla-killer-won-t-ship-for-at-least-half-a-decade?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;shifted back to trying to develop a vehicle&lt;/a&gt; and has reportedly held talks with multiple automakers as well as &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/exclusive-apple-talks-with-catl-byd-over-battery-supplies-its-electric-car-2021-06-08/"&gt;battery companies like China’s CATL&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJDEog"&gt;Kranz was just one of a number of top executives who left Canoo over the last year. Krause, who was Canoo’s first CEO, departed last year. Canoo’s chief financial officer and its chief lawyer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397356/canoo-cofounder-ulrich-kranz-resign-new-ceo-tony-aquila"&gt;also left this year&lt;/a&gt; following the startup’s merger with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC. Five of the original nine co-founders remain with the company, while those who’ve left have been replaced by people close to the company’s new CEO, Tony Aquila, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397356/canoo-cofounder-ulrich-kranz-resign-new-ceo-tony-aquila"&gt;took over after Canoo went public as a result of the SPAC merger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qGaVTr"&gt;Aquila has since pivoted Canoo away from the subscription model idea and is instead focused on creating commercial electric vehicles for small businesses. Aquila detailed the changes he was making to the company on Canoo’s first call with investors as a public company in March. Krause was not on that call, despite still being CEO at the time. As &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; first reported late last year, Kranz’s contract with Canoo was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22179588/canoo-delivery-vehicle-nasdaq-spac-merger-listing-public"&gt;renegotiated as part of the SPAC merger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Joe Biden’s order could be bad news for TikTok</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tessellated TikTok logos against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6zvtzFHsYWKFwnJGNl6qlca6Zno=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69436018/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D3aXUg"&gt;Last summer, former President Trump cast TikTok as the mascot for the US’s growing concerns over China when he signed a series of executive orders to erase the popular short video platform off app stores. It set off a wave of lawsuits keeping the orders from going into effect but left the door open for a future administration to take more serious action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dg9Yi9"&gt;That’s what President Joe Biden did Wednesday when he signed his own order revoking these Trump-era bans and beginning the process to set new rules for software tied to the Chinese government. Biden’s order laid out a fresh framework for identifying the actual national security risks posed by these apps — a stark contrast with the chaos spurred on by Trump’s individual bans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CkPlTu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT IT MEANS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Ur6lTu"&gt;Over the last few days, the Biden administration &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22516719/biden-executive-order-american-investment-chinese-firms-huawei-zte"&gt;has ramped up on action&lt;/a&gt; against China. The White House is sensitive about appearing soft on China policy compared Trump, and action against the US adversary has broadly seen bipartisan support.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNPQS3"&gt;But in some ways, the Biden order could pose a more significant threat to TikTok and other apps with purported ties to the Chinese government. In contrast with Trump’s sweeping bans, the Biden order creates a system for evaluating a slew of foreign-owned apps and recommending more intensive action. The Trump-era bans haven’t held up because of ongoing court challenges, but this new process could provide new evidence to make it easier for future bans to take effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oWhiUv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is the White House trying to come up with a clever solution”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ahYolP"&gt;“This is the White House trying to come up with a clever solution that they believe is more defensible in court,” Jason Waite, leader of Alston and Bird’s International Trade and Regulatory Group said. “It still allows them to take the action, the ultimate action, if they want to.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kcIGsp"&gt;The Biden order doesn’t address actions or investigations going on at the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS. Trump’s bans kicked off a bidding war last year between huge tech companies like Microsoft and Oracle to take over Bytedance’s (TikTok’s owner) stake in the company and keep the app live in the US. A new system at the Commerce Department could incentivize CFIUS and Bytedance to reach a divestiture agreement faster before the government comes to its own conclusions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GluxGh"&gt;“The [Trump] TikTok and WeChat orders&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;served as leverage to get them to complete the CFIUS review,” Waite said. “In some ways, this maintains that leverage and you could argue that it preserves or restores it because the other orders had been running into trouble in the courts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="st6C1V"&gt;All eyes will be on the Commerce Department in the coming months — but Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo has largely avoided commenting on what she could do about TikTok. In April, Raimondo said that she would take &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/547013-commerce-dept-still-weighing-approach-to-huawei-tiktok"&gt;aggressive action against China&lt;/a&gt; but did not directly address specific companies like TikTok and WeChat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qaTWUW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Lord of the Rings anime movie is headed to theaters</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IAwgELeaD6so42_voNkohm5cG9o=/86x0:1640x1036/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69435909/Screen_Shot_2021_06_10_at_1.29.54_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: New Line Cinema&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qzfgaq"&gt;New Line Cinema and Warner Brothers Animation are working on a new Lord of the Rings movie that’s bound for theaters, with an anime twist (&lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/lord-of-the-rings-anime-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-new-line-cinema-warner-bros-animation-1234993740/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The movie will be called &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim&lt;/em&gt;, and it will cover the history behind the fortress at Helm’s Deep — whose battle is one of the most exciting parts of the entire original trilogy with its exploding walls, shield surfing, and incredible horse stunts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="epXFzx"&gt;In case you need your memory jogged:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3Zvql7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X5wABDrzg9I?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TKs3FT"&gt;Kenji Kamiyama will be directing the movie, and it’ll be interesting to see how well his style maps to a medieval fantasy setting — he’s mostly tackled futuristic sci-fi projects before, including &lt;em&gt;Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; 009 Re: Cyborg&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and Netflix’s &lt;em&gt;Ultraman.&lt;/em&gt; The movie is being written by the creators of &lt;em&gt;The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance&lt;/em&gt;, and while Peter Jackson isn’t directly involved, one of the writers for the original trilogy (and the &lt;em&gt;Hobbit&lt;/em&gt; movies) is acting as a consultant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9GWtjC"&gt;While the names behind the film are interesting, it doesn’t seem like Warner Brothers or New Line are going deep into the Tolkien well for story ideas — the events &lt;em&gt;Rohirrim&lt;/em&gt; will be depicting are only a few hundred years before the battle depicted in &lt;em&gt;The Two Towers&lt;/em&gt;. Compare that with, say, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22388035/amazon-lord-of-the-rings-lotr-tv-series-production-cost-season-1"&gt;Amazon’s &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; show&lt;/a&gt;, which is set in the Second Age, &lt;em&gt;way &lt;/em&gt;before the War of the Ring — the characters in the anime movie may be unfamiliar to most viewers, but the world will likely be pretty similar to what we’ve already seen. Of course, there’s still room for this project to be interesting, but perhaps it would’ve been more exciting if we were getting a story about something like the Silmarils or the fall of the Númenor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iaUGNV"&gt;So far, we don’t know details like when the movie will be released or who will be staring in it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch the first gameplay trailer for Elden Ring, coming January 21st 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EJQfTIMCd6YIF0s2puaqQlxn-oI=/124x0:1539x943/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69435523/eldenring.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OAzhOY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt;, the long-awaited action RPG made in collaboration between FromSoftware and writer George R.R. Martin, has finally shown new signs of life. We got a surprise trailer today at the end of the Summer Game Fest Kickoff Live event as well as a release date. January 21, 2022 is when you’ll be able to play it on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X, and last-gen consoles. Publisher Bandai Namco says the Xbox version of the game will support Smart Delivery, and players who purchase the PS4 version of the game will get a free upgrade to the PS5 version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IW6Zrl"&gt;The first gameplay from the elusive title that was announced during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/7/18647110/elden-ring-leak-george-rr-martin-from-software-ps4-xbox-e3-2019"&gt;E3 2019&lt;/a&gt; shows plenty of PvE magic and swordplay while traversing through fantastical environments on horseback. I’m sure we’ll see more gameplay in the near future, but this first look at &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt; looks like it should please fans of &lt;em&gt;Bloodborne &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JeTEEn"&gt;It seems to be delivering a new take on the studio’s signature action RPG gameplay, nestled into deep, entrancing game design. Congratulations to George R.R. Martin for delivering some new content in this decade — maybe now he can get back to finishing &lt;em&gt;The Winds of Winter&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QqQFPu"&gt;Though there was a long gap between when this game was announced and when we got this trailer today, we’ll likely hear more from FromSoftware and publisher Bandai Namco as the game’s release date is approaching.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>The best laptop you can buy in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Dell XPS 13, Dell XPS 15, HP Elite Dragonfly, Surface Laptop 3, MacBook Pro, and Lenovo Yoga C740." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C554ZjlwY7R1hgqzx9H7bhxKvWA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66770456/VRG_4013_Best_Laptop_Grid.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: William Joel/The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best laptops for you, from ultraportables to high-powered editing machines&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="x1Etox"&gt;The best laptop of 2021 can come with a variety of brands, prices, and features. Here, we’ve got the rest of the best laptops, Windows 10 business notebooks, gaming rigs, Chromebooks, laptops for school, and 2-in-1 convertibles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lfv5g0"&gt;Our current pick for the best laptop of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a device that does just about everything right. While it’s certainly not a perfect device, there are no major flaws. It’s a great pick for productivity, browsing, and even light gaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNThzL"&gt;We live in a world where smartphones are ubiquitous, tablets are commonplace, and even smartwatches are a thing that people talk about on the regular. But throughout all of these advances, the humble laptop has persevered — and for good reason. When it comes time to work, whether that's editing photos, writing a lot of emails, composing documents, or staying in touch with colleagues and family, we’re here with our top picks to help you find the best laptop for the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="31HnuI"&gt;It's getting harder to buy a bad laptop, but what separates the best laptop of 2021 from good laptops is how they balance power, efficiency, portability, and comfort. The top laptop should have a fantastic keyboard and trackpad — after all, those are the two biggest reasons you'd choose a laptop over a smartphone or tablet. Its display should be easy on the eyes, bright, and sharp enough that you aren't distracted by jagged edges and visible pixels. It should be powerful enough for most anything short of intensive video editing and advanced gaming. It should be easy to carry around from place to place, and it should be able to last all day without needing to be plugged in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hnoYs"&gt;In our view, the best laptop for budget shoppers is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 13&lt;/a&gt;. For a sub-$1,000 price, it delivers performance on par with much more expensive laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ABV8A"&gt;Our other picks for the best laptops, Chromebooks, and 2-in-1s of 2021 include the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14, the MacBook Pro 16, and the HP Elite Dragonfly. Check out the full list of best laptop picks below or our roundup of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"&gt;best gaming laptops&lt;/a&gt;, if you’re looking for a powerful machine that doesn’t sacrifice portability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="4mn8ET"&gt;Best Laptops 2021&lt;/h1&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple MacBook Air is the best laptop of 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oTToOm"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air (late 2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best laptop of 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="qIDMjX"&gt;The late-2020 MacBook Air, powered by Apple’s M1 processor, is the best laptop you can buy. The base model, which includes 8GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage, starts at $999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYCzY0"&gt;Appearance-wise, this laptop has a lot in common with the Intel-powered MacBook Air that Apple released earlier this year, including the same 2560 x 1600 screen, Touch ID, 720p webcam, fingerprint sensor, and scissor-switch keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iDDWFN"&gt;But the new processor is the star of the show here; it’s fast. In our testing, it handled intense photo- and video-editing workloads better than almost any Intel-powered laptop we’ve tried this year. It was also able to run &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at close-to-playable frame rates, which is quite a feat for integrated graphics. At launch, these apps hadn’t yet been optimized for the M1 processor and were running through Apple’s Rosetta 2 translation layer — but they still worked fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ACwNY3"&gt;And the processing power didn’t even weigh down the battery life: we got between eight and 10 hours of sustained work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XZkaRR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10220133"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8eGPnz"&gt;Another benefit of the M1 processor is that it enables the MacBook Air to run iPhone and iPad apps natively on macOS. As of this writing, there still isn’t a huge selection of mobile apps available, and some that have been released aren’t quite optimized for the laptop screen. Still, it’s a benefit we can look forward to as time goes on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NjPO8F"&gt;Overall, there’s no reason that a general-use customer shouldn’t consider the MacBook Air. It’s a reliable device with excellent performance, as well as the excellence in build quality for which Apple is known. Power users who need a MacBook Pro probably know who they are; the Air should be fine for everyone else. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Spectre x360 14 is one of the best convertible laptops you can buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O7mXrt"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22264792/hp-spectre-x360-14-laptop-stylus-oled-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Spectre x360 14&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="N7xEV5"&gt;The best Windows laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4nwIVn"&gt;It’s hard to come up with a single complaint about the Spectre x360 14. It’s a drop-dead gorgeous machine with a sturdy build and a premium look and feel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xL3xF1"&gt;But the Spectre x360 14 isn’t just pretty to look at: it’s also a pleasure to use as a daily work driver. Intel’s latest 11th Gen processors and Iris Xe integrated graphics deliver snappy performance with no slowdown or freezes that we observed. And we got an average of 10 hours of battery life out of the device — one of the best results we’ve ever seen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfMa1S"&gt;On the outside, the Spectre includes a roomy 3:2 display, and if FHD resolution doesn’t suit your fancy, there are OLED and 1,000-nit options available. There’s even a packaged stylus, which attaches magnetically to the side of the Spectre — handy if you’re using the device as a tablet. Pretty much every other aspect of this laptop, from its comfortable keyboard and smooth touchpad to its bass-heavy audio and practical port selection, rivals or exceeds the best convertibles on the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xxTNW9"&gt;Such an exceptional package of features doesn’t come cheap, and many customers will find everything they need in a less expensive product. But the Spectre x360 14 is the new gold standard of Windows convertibles. Overall, it’s the best Windows laptop you can buy.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LG Gram 17 is the lightweight 17-inch laptop to buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aOmcws"&gt;The best laptop in 2021 for big-screen fans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ovDneV"&gt;Even if you’ve used a light laptop before, it’s difficult to explain how light the LG Gram 17 is. It has a massive 17-inch display, but it’s somehow only three pounds. Picking it up messes with your mind; you feel like you’re not holding anything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AbftFc"&gt;But the Gram 17’s weight isn’t the only standout feature. It also has some of the best battery life you can get, lasting over 12 hours in our testing. Add a great keyboard, a solid port selection, quiet fans, and a fast processor, and there’s very little not to like about this device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BvoTCC"&gt;Not everyone needs a 17-inch display, and many folks who do are looking for a heavier-duty workstation that probably doesn’t get moved very often. But if you’d just really like a large screen for your daily office work and Netflixing, you’re the target demographic for this machine. It’s a niche, but truly impressive device without much real competition in today’s market.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7dLyUJ"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 (2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IOuDKK"&gt;The best budget laptop in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6ONzJr"&gt;You don’t need to spend $1,000 to get a laptop that looks and feels premium. The HP Envy x360 2020 is the best budget laptop you can buy, thanks to its sturdy and compact build, chic convertible design, and excellent performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TwdF5"&gt;Part of what makes the Envy so great is that HP has ported over a number of elements from its excellent 2019 flagship, the Spectre x360, including the thin-and-light chassis and nearly bezel-free display with an 88 percent screen-to-body ratio. The touchscreen (which supports HP’s MPP2.0 pen) is bright and looks great. (You can choose a 300-nit, 400-nit, or 1,000-nit panel). And HP has added a row of convenient hotkeys to the keyboard, including kill switches for the microphone and webcam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xRbztF"&gt;But the most exciting feature is inside: the new Envy x360 is powered by AMD’s Ryzen 4000 series. The Ryzen 5-4500U in my model did an outstanding job with a fairly heavy load of multitasking. And AMD’s integrated Radeon graphics delivered good gaming performance comparable to what you’d expect from a lower-powered discrete GPU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lYrZ3f"&gt;The best MacBook Pro for everyday users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="yUbRrT"&gt;If you’re looking to buy an M1 MacBook for heavier workloads, you’ll want to look at the late-2020 MacBook Pro. It starts at $1,299, which is $300 more than the late-2020 MacBook Air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNImzP"&gt;The MacBook Pro has a slightly different design and look than the Air, as well as a few additional features like the Touch Bar. But the two have the same processor. The main difference is that the Pro includes a fan (the Air is fanless), which means it can sustain heavy workloads for a longer period of time without needing to throttle its performance. But you won’t notice much of a performance difference between the two MacBooks unless you’re routinely pushing heavy tasks for long periods of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USngRn"&gt;If that’s you, though, go for the Pro. We were able to run a number of hefty Premiere Pro exports and didn’t see a dip in times. The Pro also achieved a significantly higher score than the Air in a 30-minute loop of Cinebench R23; the scores were closer together after a single run. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 is the best convertible you can buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NKt5f4"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575308/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 13 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Ucqsb1"&gt;A great 2-in-1 laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iLNMXR"&gt;If you’re looking for a convertible laptop that does just about everything right, we recommend Dell’s latest XPS 13 2-in-1. It features a sturdy and well-made chassis, a nearly bezel-free 16:10 touch display, and Intel’s newest 11th Gen processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dghfZI"&gt;The base model, for $1,099, includes a Core i3-1154G4, 8GB of RAM, a 1920 x 1200 display, and a 256GB SSD. You can spec that up to a 3840 x 2400 display, a Core i7-1165G7, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. There are various add-ons as well: you can pay $50 extra for a white model and $60 to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro. Basically, there’s something for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BEAGgI"&gt;Dell has made a few minor tweaks to the 2-in-1 since last year’s model. The webcam now supports Windows Hello, and the RAM and microSD reader have been upgraded. But the exciting news is the new chip and, in particular, Intel’s new integrated graphics. The XPS 13 2-in-1 did a better job than any 10th Gen laptop with an iGPU on our Adobe Premiere Pro export test. And you can even play some games on this thing: it broke 60fps on &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, and even managed 36fps on &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at its lowest settings. That’s an improvement over the results we saw from 10th Gen systems, and it also beats some 11th Gen systems (including the clamshell Dell XPS 13). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izx3w7"&gt;Of course, it’s not perfect. The port selection is limited (as is customary for modern XPS models) and the keyboard is a bit flat for my taste. But overall, the 2-in-1 excels on the fundamentals: build quality, display, performance, and battery life. What more could you want?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="w7TWDY"&gt;The best laptop for college&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6xPrkB"&gt;The Dell XPS 13 is a compact and reliable laptop. Its beautiful chassis, excellent 16:10 display, and great performance make it an excellent choice for general-purpose users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ik0URk"&gt;This late-2020 model comes with Intel’s new Tiger Lake processors, from a Core i3-1154G4 up to a Core i7-1165G7. It starts at $999, so it’s a bit cheaper than the 2-in-1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZCO5H"&gt;My review unit (an i7 model) blew through the work tasks I needed it to do without any slowdown or heat. It did quite well, and handily beat its 10th Gen predecessor in both gaming and media work. It didn’t do as well as the XPS 13 2-in-1, which is why that model is ranked higher on this list. But if you like the look and feel of the XPS 13 and would prefer a clamshell model (or need a bouncier keyboard), this XPS is still a great option. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nxYz9i"&gt;The best gaming laptop in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="2eqQM4"&gt;At just over four pounds, the Zephyrus G15 is one of the lightest 15-inch gaming laptops you can buy. But you’re not compromising performance for that portability. The G15 is powered by the top mobile chips AMD and Nvidia have to offer, and pairs thim with a fast 165Hz QHD display. In our testing, the system was able to handle even the toughest AAA titles at QHD resolution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SxthwN"&gt;Almost everything else about the G15 is great too: the audio sounds good, the keyboard and touchpad are some of the best on the market, the port selection has just about everything you’d need, and the battery can last over eight and a half hours to a charge. If you’re looking for a high-powered gaming machine that also works great as a daily driver, the Zephyrus G15 should be at the top of your list. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="TA1Mem"&gt;The best laptop for business travel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="XTubRZ"&gt;In many ways, the ThinkPad X1 Nano is a run-of-the-mill ThinkPad. It’s got a solid sturdy chassis, discrete clickers, a physical privacy shutter, a red TrackPoint in the middle of the keyboard, and all kinds of business-specific security and management features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WdGWMd"&gt;But the Nano is special because it’s the lightest ThinkPad Lenovo has ever made. It’s also one of the lightest laptops you can buy, at just 1.99 pounds. You’re not sacrificing performance to get that mindblowing weight: The Nano kept up with our heavy testing workloads without any fan noise or noticeable heat. If you’re looking for a reliable business laptop that will feel like nothing in your briefcase, this is the one for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="pLq6K9"&gt;The best 14-inch gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="FBMA49"&gt;The Zephyrus G14 is an astonishingly powerful gaming laptop for a low price (relative to other notebooks with comparable hardware). It pairs AMD’s new Ryzen 9 4900HS with an Nvidia RTX 2060 Max-Q GPU and a 120HZ display, and it can run demanding games at their highest settings without a problem. It’s also quite light for such a powerful laptop, weighing just over 3.5 pounds. Its battery life is also impressive for a gaming rig; we got almost nine hours of multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWOpxK"&gt;But you don’t need to be a gamer to appreciate the Zephyrus G14. It’s also a great notebook for business and everyday multitasking with a unique retro design. Plus, the keyboard and touchpad are exceptional and quiet enough not to bother officemates. On the flip side, if you need to use your laptop for videoconferences, the G14 would not be a great choice, as it lacks a webcam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="TfAFYg"&gt;The 16-inch MacBook Pro is the best Apple laptop for power users. Apple dealt with the biggest complaints that people have historically had about MacBook Pros, and if you can stomach the price, there’s not a lot else to complain about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cIH5ZZ"&gt;Most importantly, the keyboard is good again. The keys have a full millimeter of travel, and while the typing experience isn’t exceptional, it’s a world away from the maligned butterfly keyboard of MacBooks past. It’s fairly quiet, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjExSY"&gt;This MacBook also features the best sound you’ll find on a laptop. Apple has crammed three speakers into each side, including two woofers. The result is balanced audio with audible bass and great stereo separation. For those who need a laptop that can crank through editing video, working with multiple audio tracks, or processing large batches of photos, the 16-inch MacBook Pro is the king of the hill.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Elite Dragonfly is a great business laptop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XU9ktC"&gt;12. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/9/21247274/hp-elite-dragonfly-2020-review-tile-test-specs-price-features"&gt;HP Elite Dragonfly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="t0EL7n"&gt;The best business laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="MrOD1p"&gt;If you’re a business professional and money is no object for you or your company, you can’t do better than the HP Elite Dragonfly. The 2020 model is the first Dragonfly that features HP’s super-secure SureView Reflect technology, which tints the screen so that snoops can’t see what you’re doing while you’re working in public. When it’s not tinted, the display gets quite bright (over 700 nits) and has great viewing angles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OzVcoU"&gt;The new Dragonfly is also the first laptop to include a built-in Tile tracker. That means if you lose the device, you can use the Tile smartphone app to set off an alarm (if it’s in Bluetooth range) or locate it anywhere in the world using Tile’s crowd-finding network. The tracker can work for a limited time even when the laptop is off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yXS6n7"&gt;Almost everything else about the Dragonfly is good; it has some of the best battery life of any laptop on the market (we got over 11 hours), a sleek and stunning 2-in-1 design, and an exceptional keyboard. Plus, it incorporates sustainable material, including ocean-bound plastics and recycled DVDs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IEHKpz"&gt;The Dragonfly is pricey, and there are cheaper business laptops that will suit the needs of most professionals just fine. But if you’re looking for the best of the best, it’s the unambiguous winner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WpIKDR"&gt;The best laptop for students&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="5khaPj"&gt;Lenovo’s Chromebook Duet is a great convertible laptop for kids, or anyone who wants a reliable secondary driver for browsing and games. It’s a nice-looking, well-made 10-inch device that comes with a detachable keyboard and kickstand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FV5DZN"&gt;The Duet is tailor-made to be used around the house and on the go, weighing just 2.03 pounds and delivering over 11 hours of battery life. Its MediaTek processor isn’t designed to shoulder heavy loads, but it’s just fine for browsing in a couple tabs, watching Netflix, or playing Android games — it even handles photo editing pretty well. The Duet also features a new “tablet mode” for Chrome OS, which supports an Android-inspired gesture navigation system and a unique Chrome layout optimized for tablet use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XiBrWO"&gt;The Chromebook Duet is an absolute steal for its low price, and is the Chromebook to buy if you’re on a tight budget. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sky6IZ"&gt;A stylish, powerful productivity laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="1AVfKp"&gt;Razer is best known for its gaming laptops, but the company is making a big splash in the business and productivity space with its new Razer Book 13. At 0.6 inches thick and 3.09 pounds, the Book 13 is a portable workstation with a gorgeous and sturdy aluminum build. It features a good port selection including Thunderbolt 4, USB-A, HDMI 2.0 and a microSD slot, and it’s one of very few non-gaming laptops out there to come with a per-key RGB keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAI01n"&gt;On the inside, this laptop is even more impressive. Its powerful chip did better than any other Windows laptop of its size on our Premiere Pro media export test. And while the Book 13 isn’t a gaming laptop, it delivers some of the best gaming performance I’ve ever seen from integrated graphics — it can even run &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; over 30fps. While the Razer Book 13’s high price means it won’t be ideal for everyone, it’s still an outstanding laptop all around, combining a high-quality chassis with powerful productivity performance.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DdByBe"&gt;The best 17-inch gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="S5SM7Z"&gt;Usually, if you want a 17-inch laptop that can pull playable frame rates out of today’s most demanding games, you’d expect some compromises on portability and design. Notebooks of this size often weigh north of seven pounds and require multiple power bricks to charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Whz2V3"&gt;But while the Blade Pro 17 doesn’t have quite the gaming chops of some bulky desktop replacements, it makes up for that by sporting the compact and attractive design that’s a trademark of the Razer Blade line. At just over six pounds, it’s not too difficult to move around (as 17-inch workstations go). You get an RTX GPU (up to Nvidia’s 2080 Super Max-Q) an eight-core CPU (Intel’s Core i7-10875H) and either a 300Hz screen or a 120Hz touchscreen. There’s even an RGB keyboard with color effects tailored to the game you’re playing. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="il7XYS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among Us &lt;/em&gt;is getting a new hide and seek mode, visor cosmetics, achievements, and a fifth map, developer Innersloth announced at Summer Game Fest on Thursday. However, there wasn’t a date shared for any of those updates, so it’s not clear when you might be able to check them out for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gch8tl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://innersloth.itch.io/among-us/devlog/261572/among-us-roadmap"&gt;In a blog&lt;/a&gt;, Innersloth also announced that account linking is on the roadmap as well, which should be handy if you play the game across multiple platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kdKKu0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;dev log for all info: &lt;a href="https://t.co/zS1fX4J3p9"&gt;https://t.co/zS1fX4J3p9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;if you ask me questions that are answered in this dev log!! i will honk at you!!!&lt;/p&gt;— Among Us (@AmongUsGame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AmongUsGame/status/1403059468481417218?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h2qsB0"&gt;In the lead-up to Thursday’s announcement, Innersloth teased a number of new features for the next big update, including upping the max player count from 10 to 15 players, new player colors to pick from (including &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AmongUsGame/status/1400533508859203584"&gt;tan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AmongUsGame/status/1397696818499121156"&gt;gray&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AmongUsGame/status/1395467085837307905"&gt;rose&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AmongUsGame/status/1402386196077056002"&gt;maroon&lt;/a&gt;), and, perhaps most importantly, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AmongUsGame/status/1402003911825772548"&gt;ability to honk the airship’s horn&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1JVPDG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; is currently available on PC, iOS, Android, and Switch. Innersloth has also announced that the game is on the way for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410775/among-us-playstation-4-5-ps4-ps5-ratchet-clank"&gt;PlayStation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/12/10/among-us-coming-soon-to-xbox-game-pass-for-pc/"&gt;Xbox&lt;/a&gt; sometime in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber offers to pay for drivers’ health insurance, and then yanks it away</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Uber and Lyft sign in windshield of car, Queens, New York" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WHFK5W9UkEyA2G9i6z37gHEzHzI=/0x168:4032x2856/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69435107/1310967778.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by: Lindsey Nicholson/Education Images/Universal Images Group via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n1fei1"&gt;Uber mistakenly sent out an email to some of its drivers and delivery workers last month offering to cover some of their health insurance costs — only to revoke the offer two weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3VLchn"&gt;On May 26th, an email from Uber with the enticing subject line “It’s a great time to get health coverage” appeared in the inbox of an unspecified number of the company’s drivers and delivery workers. When they opened the email, they were greeted by an even more alluring proposition: “Uber can help cover your healthcare costs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKdlcx"&gt;Drivers and couriers for Uber are classified as independent contractors, making them ineligible for employer-sponsored health insurance plans. For years, many of these workers have lobbied for more benefits and protections, only to face strong opposition from Uber. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6BpIb0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Uber can help cover your healthcare costs”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="099LW1"&gt;So one can only imagine the shock from drivers who opened this email and saw an offer for subsidies ranging from $613.77 to $1,277.54, depending on the type of insurance plan they had and the amount of hours they worked each week. That kind of money could be transformative for drivers, many of whom subsist on &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-03-08/uber-drivers-earn-pay-that-s-just-above-the-poverty-line"&gt;poverty-level wages&lt;/a&gt; and are struggling to find work amid a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371850/uber-lyft-driver-shortage-covid-bonus-stimulus"&gt;steep drop in demand&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic. What could account for this radical change in position by Uber? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eJJzoOjjfy3Dj0T6dzAoiP2xg0s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22650718/Screen_Shot_2021_06_10_at_2.19.13_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The May 26th email promising health insurance subsidies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bwuj9P9eBjEv3a1DabgvV21U1so=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22650717/Screen_Shot_2021_06_10_at_2.19.39_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The June 9th email revoking those subsidies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BikqPu"&gt;As it turns out, nothing has changed. Uber intended only to send the email to drivers and delivery workers in California, and not any other state. “Unfortunately, we made a mistake sending this email to you, as this policy only applies to drivers and delivery people in California,” the email to one driver read. “We sincerely apologize for this error.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l09ZJJ"&gt;A spokesperson said that the company’s support team is working with drivers and delivery workers who received the email by mistake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GpOEih"&gt;Last year, Uber — along with Lyft, DoorDash, and other gig economy companies — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551136/uber-prop-22-victory-national-q3-2020-earnings"&gt;poured over $200 million&lt;/a&gt; into the “Yes on 22” campaign to exempt them from a California state law that would require them to treat their workers like employees. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21549760/uber-lyft-prop-22-win-vote-app-message-notifications"&gt;The companies aggressively opposed the law&lt;/a&gt;, arguing it would eliminate driver flexibility, while also increasing consumer prices and wait times. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21546037/prop-22-california-uber-lyft-ballot-measure-result"&gt;The measure passed in November 2020&lt;/a&gt; with 59 percent of the vote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q3R1MI"&gt;Under Prop 22, Uber and other gig work companies are required to “provide healthcare subsidies equal to 41 percent the average [California Coverage] premium for each month” for drivers and couriers “who average between 15 and 25 hours per week of engaged time.” This would explain the email, but doesn’t explain why it also ended up in the inboxes of drivers and couriers who don’t reside in California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ueotce"&gt;Edward Burmila, a political science professor who lives in Raleigh, NC and occasionally drives for Uber, received the original email about healthcare subsidies. “I may be an atypical Uber driver — I have a PhD and so tend to think of these things in a political context — but it is part of the ludicrous song-and-dance the ride-share companies are always doing to maintain the fiction that their labor force are not employees or workers,” Burmila wrote to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="873FC1"&gt;He added, “It also demonstrates that they’ll provide benefits — for riders or for passengers — only when they are forced to.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TtZAcV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9xZFFP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands&lt;em&gt; hits early next year.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Gearbox&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zAp591"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Borderlands&lt;/em&gt; developer Gearbox and 2K Games announced a new fantasy shooter called &lt;em&gt;Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands &lt;/em&gt;on Thursday at Summer Games Fest. It has an all-star cast, including Andy Samberg, Will Arnett, Wanda Sykes, and Ashly Burch. The new game is set to launch in early 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SdvdRL"&gt;At the event, Burch, who voices Tiny Tina in the &lt;em&gt;Borderlands&lt;/em&gt; series, described it as a “high fantasy looter shooter,” and in the trailer, it certainly looked a lot like a &lt;em&gt;Borderlands&lt;/em&gt; game, both with its cel-shaded visual style and the appearance of a ridiculous-looking gun that shot some kind of electric laser beam. Unlike in &lt;em&gt;Borderlands&lt;/em&gt;, though, you’ll create your own character.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Death Stranding is getting a director’s cut on PS5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Death Stranding" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sesrIisuW-JOpUtbkd-dYGEpPkg=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69435028/ds_01_60.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3hghUJ"&gt;Hideo Kojima stopped by this year’s Summer Game Fest to announce a surprise: &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt; is not only coming to the PS5, but it’ll be an enhanced director’s cut of the game. Unfortunately, there’s no real detail about the new version, but an early glimpse hinted at some additional stealth elements, similar to Kojima’s work on the &lt;em&gt;Metal Gear Solid&lt;/em&gt; franchise. Players can likely expect visual and performance upgrades as well. The director’s cut is slated as “coming soon,” with a proper reveal in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rXzDMU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20941606/death-stranding-review-ps4-hideo-kojima"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt; first launched on the PS4 in 2019&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21322476/death-stranding-pc-port-hide-kojima"&gt;made its way to the PC last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft teases new Windows 11 startup sound with 11-minute video</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/el5QcgYKIM2mORZYH5G53Qar9m0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69434932/VRG_ILLO_4030_Windows_10_Guide_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uchFNS"&gt;Microsoft is back teasing Windows 11 again. In a new video on YouTube, the software giant has published an 11-minute (&lt;em&gt;ahem&lt;/em&gt;) collection of startup sounds from various versions of Windows. They’re all slowed down by 4,000 percent, and Microsoft positions this as a relaxing video for those far too excited by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465126/microsoft-windows-event-june-24th"&gt;the Windows event on June 24th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zC0PR7"&gt;“Having trouble relaxing because you’re too excited for the June 24th Microsoft Event?” asks the YouTube caption. “Take a slow trip down memory lane with the Windows 95, XP, and 7 startup sounds slowed down to a meditative 4,000 percent reduced speed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZGyhX"&gt;I think this is very much teasing a new startup sound for Windows 11, or whatever the next version of Windows will be called. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466394/microsoft-windows-11-launch-teaser-rumors"&gt;Microsoft has been teasing “a new version of Windows” recently&lt;/a&gt;, and has dropped a number of hints that it could in fact be called Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="WnZgG4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Microsoft to reveal its next generation of Windows on June 24th ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465126/microsoft-windows-event-june-24th"},{"title":"Microsoft looks ready to launch Windows 11 ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466394/microsoft-windows-11-launch-teaser-rumors"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HZtkXS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft loves the number 11 right now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hRcYbt"&gt;Among those hints is the event starting at 11AM ET and the event invite that has a window that creates a shadow with an outline that looks very much like the number 11. Microsoft execs have been teasing a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453222/microsoft-windows-next-generation-announcement-sun-valley-build-2021-keynote"&gt;“next generation of Windows” announcement&lt;/a&gt; for months, and it’s clear from this latest video that these 11 teasers will continue in the weeks ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8X0LrH"&gt;We’re expecting Microsoft to announce a new version of Windows with significant user interface changes. Microsoft has been working on something codenamed “Sun Valley,” which the company has referred to as a “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212817/microsoft-windows-10-visual-changes-update-sun-valley-2021"&gt;sweeping visual rejuvenation of Windows&lt;/a&gt;.” There will be many other changes, including some significant Windows Store ones, so &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466394/microsoft-windows-11-launch-teaser-rumors"&gt;read our previous coverage for what to expect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RqyX5v"&gt;We’ll find out on June 24th whether Microsoft is ready to dial the version number of Windows up to 11, simply name it Windows Sun Valley, or something else entirely. The Windows elevent (as we’re now calling it) will start at 11AM ET on June 24th, and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; will be covering all the news live as it happens.&lt;/p&gt;
