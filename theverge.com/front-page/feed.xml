    <title>Waze now shows EV charging stations on its driving map</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qzby3xsF3v-Yqia1UaKUYuaYL7s=/70x0:651x387/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70297462/waze_ev_charging_station_search.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TghYKB"&gt;Waze can finally help you locate and drive to nearby electric vehicle (EV) charging stations across the US, letting you find EV pit stops just as easily as you would a gas station. You can also search for charging stations along your route, which should make it a bit less stressful to find a place to juice up your EV if Waze is your preferred navigation app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vO1AvH7zmNv1UewGh_40SS4qOfk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23115036/waze_ev_volkswagen.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Waze&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BG8ziE"&gt;Waze is partnering with Volkswagen for the initiative. As part of the campaign, you can switch your car icon within the app to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22302883/vw-id4-review-volkswagen-ev-specs-range-photos-video"&gt;Volkswagen’s all-electric ID 4 SUV&lt;/a&gt; (in case you’re tired of polluting the virtual air in your cartoon smiley face on wheels).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jTiR6Y"&gt;This may give the Google-owned navigation app the boost it needs to catch up with its more mainstream counterpart, Google Maps, which has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/16/17983986/google-maps-electric-car-charging-tesla-superchargers"&gt;displaying EV charging stations since 2018&lt;/a&gt;. Google Maps also lets you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/21023979/google-maps-ev-charger-plug-chademo-ccs-tesla-search-filter"&gt;filter the stations by EV charger plug types&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18512330/ev-charger-google-maps-real-time-charging-status-electric-car"&gt;shows you which stations are currently in use&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252261/google-maps-electric-vehicle-charging-station-ai"&gt;uses AI to help you plan trips&lt;/a&gt; with your EV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="36aVlE"&gt;It’s also worth mentioning that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299325/apple-ios14-maps-updates-cycling-directions-electric-charging-wwdc-2020"&gt;Apple Maps introduced a feature in iOS 14&lt;/a&gt; that lets you plan your route around EV charging stations. If your vehicle is compatible with the app, Apple Maps can even track your charge and automatically add compatible charging stations to your route if your charge gets too low.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford Mustang Mach-E joins New York City’s yellow taxi fleet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8fMy_D8p3IBeiJnyeuvfRNhYx-0=/0x0:1260x840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70297160/RearMidtown.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5idw25"&gt;The Ford Mustang Mach-E is hitting the streets of New York City as the latest electric vehicle to join the ranks of the city’s iconic yellow taxi fleet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LOWlft"&gt;The Mustang Mach-E, with its fresh coat of Rally Yellow paint and classic taxi iconography, is being operated by Gravity Technologies, a startup focused on EV fleets and charging infrastructure. This is the first time that Ford’s new, mass-market EV is being deployed as a taxi. But it won’t be the last — Gravity says it hopes to eventually operate a fleet of 50 electric vehicles comprised of both Mustang Mach-Es and Tesla Model Ys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WQaK86"&gt;“I think the Mustang and the Model Y are kind of like the ideal taxi vehicles that are available today,” Moshe Cohen, founder and CEO of Gravity, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0Eid0y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I think the Mustang and the Model Y are kind of like the ideal taxi vehicles”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M1uRan"&gt;Gravity isn’t the first company to deploy EVs as taxis. Back in 2019, the city’s Taxi and Limousine Commission approved the Tesla Model 3 as the first EV eligible to become a yellow taxi. A year later, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/11/06/first-tesla-model-3-official-nyc-yellow-cab/"&gt;the first Model 3 was spotted in the city&lt;/a&gt;. (&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; alum &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShGyRzsETw8"&gt;Sam Sheffer took a ride&lt;/a&gt; late last year.) And earlier this year, moped sharing company Revel announced a plan to launch 50 Tesla Model Ys as a for-hire vehicle fleet in Manhattan — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22546955/nyc-tlc-electric-vehicle-license-taxi-vote-revel-tesla"&gt;though the city later blocked that plan&lt;/a&gt;. (The company &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/07/26/revel-to-launch-tesla-taxis-in-nyc-after-row-with-city-regulators/"&gt;eventually won&lt;/a&gt; approval.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fGSQIZ-fm9X0Le8PTQ0t-jNNlA8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23114878/SideviewBB.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ppOtrg"&gt;Gravity is going a different route by integrating its vehicles into the city’s regulated fleet of yellow cabs. The vehicles are authorized for use as taxis under an EV pilot program adopted by the TLC earlier this year. But to do so, Gravity will need to lease a taxi medallion, which is a permit issued by the city to allow people to own and operate cabs. The company is certified as a taxi agent, meaning it’s authorized to lease medallions. The Mustang Mach-E has gone through TLC approvals and inspections, but Cohen said there will likely be additional features to roll out that will require future approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xAdmoP"&gt;Cohen said that Gravity has installed an “artificial intelligence camera” that tracks the driver’s face to prevent distraction. The company is also tracking the vehicle’s speed and other driving maneuvers to ensure drivers are operating safely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KUSUb1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cohen said that Gravity has installed an “artificial intelligence camera” that tracks the driver’s face to prevent distraction&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z2ryad"&gt;EV charging infrastructure can be hard to find in New York City, but Gravity operates its own charging station out of a parking garage in Midtown Manhattan. The company plans on installing more chargers in the future, Cohen said, including fast-chargers capable of speeds of up to 350 kW. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4SFghh"&gt;In the US, more taxi operators are integrating EVs into their fleet, encouraged by the cost savings and marketing potential. Rental car companies are also getting in on the action, with Hertz recently placing a 100,000-car order with Tesla. (The news of the order sent shares in both companies soaring, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744504/hertz-tesla-order-100000-vehicles-electrify-fleet"&gt;pushing Tesla’s valuation over $1 trillion&lt;/a&gt; for the first time.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disabled passengers were promised autonomous vehicles — they’re still waiting</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v7UrmRXGbb6_cnd8nz76MsHGiDM=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70296965/acastro211213_4881_0001.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;It turns out that designing autonomous vehicles for disabled passengers is an immense challenge&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="43AJ3L"&gt;For years, people with disabilities have been promised that autonomous vehicles are right around the corner. Self-driving cars will open up new possibilities for people with vision, hearing, and mobility impairments. Help was on the way.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P8c43J"&gt;But Haben Girma is tired of waiting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4y1JTD"&gt;“People with disabilities stand to benefit the most from self-driving cars, but developers are not making accessibility enough of a priority,” said &lt;a href="https://habengirma.com/"&gt;the author and deafblind disability justice lawyer&lt;/a&gt;. “Waiting until a product is ‘finished’ to start thinking about accessibility is like completing construction of a skyscraper and then tearing part of it down to install an elevator.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="nWUzZH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“People with disabilities stand to benefit the most from self-driving cars, but developers are not making accessibility enough of a priority”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SedtNT"&gt;Over 25 million Americans have disabilities that make traveling outside the home difficult. Historically, car companies have provided little relief, producing vehicles that are either inaccessible or cost thousands of dollars to retrofit for a driver with disabilities. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) present a tantalizing solution to millions of frustrated people. But the industry’s well-publicized struggles, as well as the broken promises of tech companies in the past, are forcing many in the disabled community to wonder whether AVs are the salvation they’ve been waiting for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l0LlNS"&gt;The skepticism among the disabled toward tech companies is warranted. Uber and Lyft initially claimed that their ride-hail fleets would be a boon for disabled customers, but wheelchair-accessible vehicles are largely absent from both companies’ platforms. And over the past decade, the ride-hailing industry has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774771/uber-disabled-discrimination-lawsuit-justice-department"&gt;routinely resisted efforts by regulators&lt;/a&gt; to force them to deploy more accessible vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zAy9B0"&gt;Whether it is a broken foot, an unforeseen traumatic event, or just getting old — we are all likely to have a disability at some point. Currently, a disabled individual might not have the means to modify a vehicle, they may not be able to drive, or it may be too difficult to navigate public buses and trains. The more accessible AVs are from the beginning, the more everyone will benefit.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6esqX"&gt;One of the biggest automakers in the world, Volkswagen, is already taking steps to ensure its AVs are designed to serve a broad range of people. By talking to groups like the American Association of People with Disabilities, Volkswagen said it is well aware of the engineering challenges they face. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="u1FsnS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The more accessible AVs are from the beginning, the more everyone will benefit”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ieYSDf"&gt;The automaker’s Inclusive Mobility team, based in Santa Clara, California, is working on how an autonomous vehicle could communicate on multiple levels with users who are d/Deaf or have low vision. The team is working on a software interface with an accessible screen reader and on interior concepts with visual, text, and tactile notifications for d/Deaf passengers, as well as external vehicle speakers and microphones, to support locating and boarding for those with low vision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xZkjxe"&gt;VW isn’t alone in thinking about how its AVs should be designed to serve the disabled community. Toyota, Cruise, and Waymo are also working on solutions for how to transport riders with different bodies and accessibility needs. And they find themselves encountering the same design hurdles as the VW team. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="From background left, Judy Arvidson and Steve Mahan of the Santa Clara Valley Blind Center check out the two-seater prototype of Google’s self-driving car at Google in Mountain View, Calif., on Wednesday, May 13, 2015.

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YIg6EP"&gt;Besides making its AV software accessible, VW is also examining seating concepts like seats facing each other for better face-to-face communication among d/Deaf passengers. This would also help passengers read the lips of someone with a speech impairment that might be difficult to understand. But it’s also a seating arrangement that may cause motion sickness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gGhbjf"&gt;“Having empathy for the challenges faced by disabled communities in mobility is only the starting point,” said Chandrika Jayant, UX researcher and design manager at Volkswagen Group of America. “We need to understand the specific needs. We need to be involved in continuous dialogue with the people who are underserved to hear from them their experiences and not simply imagine what those experiences might be. It’s a complex process that demands that we have a deep understanding... and that our ideas are future-proofed to some degree.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="rNBCQb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“we need to be involved in continuous dialogue with the people who are underserved to hear from them their experiences”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Fhd0SR"&gt;One of the most complex challenges Jayant faces is the lack of industry-wide standards for how wheelchairs can be secured in a vehicle. Jayant says that this issue requires collaboration between wheelchair makers, insurance companies, users, and governments. Even with the design obstacles, Jayant remains enthusiastic: “[Inclusive design] is very exciting to work on,” she said. “This is really groundbreaking design research.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XQrPFT"&gt;Christian Lopez, senior director of intelligent cockpit and body at VW, points out a fact so obvious that it’s easy to forget: “It is important to consider that many policies drafted to assist disabled Americans were written long before anyone seriously dreamed that self-driving mobility could happen — and, quite often, even before computers were part of our everyday lives.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sbs14U"&gt;Many of those policies came from the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which was signed into law 31 years ago. Lopez notes that insurers define wheelchair coverage as a necessity in the home, but the role of wheelchairs in AVs has never been on the radar. Precautions like crash safety and self-securement often get treated like beyond-the-scope upgrades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nZcGwE"&gt;Volkswagen isn’t the only automaker with a team working on AV accessibility. We Will Ride, a coalition of advocates dedicated to ensuring a future with accessible AVs, released its annual &lt;a href="https://www.aapd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2021-AAPD-Auto-Accessibility-Scorecard-Progress-Report-1.pdf"&gt;scorecard&lt;/a&gt; in July on the companies doing the best job of making their AVs disability-friendly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1ZidE"&gt;Toyota, long a leader among automakers in robotics and technology, got high marks from the group. This includes the creation of a fifth R&amp;amp;D department solely for AV accessibility, a $1 million contract from the US Department of Transporation to help study the impact of AVs on people with disabilities, and a slew of disability-focused programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uSIBT2"&gt;Jade Hill, Toyota’s program manager of crash avoidance and advanced technologies, is an important voice in Toyota’s inclusivity push. The company has partnered with May Mobility out of Ann Arbor, Michigan, to launch an accessible AV shuttle in Indianapolis. May Mobility also has accessible shuttle services in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Arlington, Texas, and Hiroshima, Japan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="6PE0Ad"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Toyota pulled its AVs from the Tokyo Paralympics after hitting a visually impaired athlete&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4VUiVj"&gt;But Toyota still has work to do to ensure its AVs are safe for riders as well as pedestrians. The company recently pulled its e-Palette AVs from the Tokyo Paralympics &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22644496/toyota-epalette-autonomous-shuttle-crash-halt-olympics"&gt;after hitting a visually impaired athlete&lt;/a&gt;. A day later, it reinstated the vehicles, saying that the accident occurred due to human error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xknetZ"&gt;Cruise, which is a majority-owned subsidiary of General Motors, highlighted accessibility in its most recent investor call and offered renderings as proof. Cruise has also hired a full-time accessibility program manager who can boast that part of their fleet offers driverless rides to disabled individuals around San Francisco. Cruise built its AV, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3E7p4S_1m4"&gt;the Origin&lt;/a&gt;, with modularity in mind. From the low floor and high roof to the double-wide doors and removable seats, Cruise views the Origin as a blank canvas that it can modify with customer feedback. The Origin is scheduled for release in 2023 alongside an accessible variant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CNoqoJ"&gt;But the Origin is still years away from service, and Cruise is facing challenges around its lack of accessibility right now. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/san-francisco-agency-opposes-cruise-robotaxi-application-citing-safety-2021-12-01/"&gt;The company was recently accused&lt;/a&gt; by the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Authority and several other government agencies of failing to offer service in low-income and minority areas or accommodate people using wheelchairs. The company defended itself by arguing that it was following the law. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="GM’s Cruise Reveals First Vehicle Made To Run Without Driver" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FHIsqLhkpXwNEa2y8Li1-7UiHoI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098699/1195279026.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Cruise Origin is the company’s next-generation autonomous shuttle. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="M02KmZ"&gt;Zoox, a California-based company recently acquired by Amazon, has engaged with major disability advocacy groups. Zoox has Braille on its vehicles’ internal emergency button, innovative uses of light and sound to communicate with riders and road users, and large visual displays inside the vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nzGVsN"&gt;AV operators aren’t only thinking about the people who use their vehicles. A major concern among disabled people is getting hit by a car, and people like Anne Marie Lewis, AV safety regulatory lead at Argo, are making sure those accidents never happen. Argo, which is backed by Ford and VW, believes that &lt;a href="https://groundtruthautonomy.com/the-secret-to-scaling-self-driving-technology-testing-in-multiple-cities/"&gt;geographical diversity&lt;/a&gt; will prepare its technology for complex scenarios. The company’s 3D maps are so detailed that Argo not only knows the locations of avenues but also where crosswalks are, abandoned signs, and even local regulations and the differences in pedestrian behavior depending on the city. And the maps will continue to stay current and detailed the more its software is used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RCpJ6o"&gt;One of the problems faced by disabled people is an AI that identifies different body types and shapes. Argo has answers for that, too: “This [diverse] learning includes training our perception system with a wide array of people and their movement, including those using wheelchairs, so that we’re able to identify, classify, track and predict their behavior,” a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “If the self-driving system observes a three-headed monster (on Halloween, for example), it may not know what it is, but the perception system can still report that it sees an unknown object at a particular position and moving at a particular speed in a particular direction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="vrMgSU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One of the problems faced by disabled people is an AI that identifies different body types and shapes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kOYFfL"&gt;Waymo released a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/3/29/2910196/google-self-driving-car-video"&gt;video nearly a decade ago&lt;/a&gt; of one of its cars ferrying a man that lost 95 percent of his sight. The company followed that up with a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArYTxDZzQOM&amp;amp;t=2s"&gt;2015 video&lt;/a&gt; of the same man by himself in a Waymo AV — before many inclusive teams even started. The company’s ride-hailing service has conducted driverless rides since October 2020 in Phoenix, Arizona, including those with different accessibility needs. However, the company does not keep track of how many disabled riders it has served.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jf55io"&gt;With all that feedback, as well as help from Google’s accessibility team, Waymo has created an app that follows WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines), supporting screen readers and high contrast modes. The app can minimize your walking time to your ride, remotely honk the vehicle’s horn for low vision riders, and there is an option to choose what side of the street you get picked up on for those with mobility issues. While in the car, low vision riders can listen to detailed audio of key events on their trip. And through the DOT’s Inclusive Design Challenge, Waymo plans to integrate more inclusive features to its app, like haptic cues to navigate to your ride, headlight flashes to locate a vehicle, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="TczgN6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Waymo plans to integrate more inclusive features to its app&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="b0DVII"&gt;In late August, Waymo opened its ride-sharing service to “Trusted Testers” in San Francisco. Compared to the flat, open, and dry terrain of Arizona, the rides through the hilly, foggy, claustrophobic streets of San Francisco are sure to test the limits of Waymo’s technology. Waymo specifically stated that the Trusted Tester program is a “research-focused” effort with an aim to gather information related to accessibility. Those observations have caveats, though, because Waymo’s fleet consists of Jaguar I-Paces, which are not wheelchair-accessible. A spokesman says the company is working with a partner to provide WAVs to the Trusted Testers and plan to expand as they add riders.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xTgh8Q"&gt;A 2017 report from the &lt;a href="https://rudermanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Self-Driving-Cars-The-Impact-on-People-with-Disabilities_FINAL.pdf"&gt;Rudderman Family Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, an institution focusing on disability issues, concluded that autonomous cars could open up job opportunities for 2 million disabled people. The report also insisted that $19 billion would be saved on health care costs because disabled people would have dependable access to medical care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FV7ikQ"&gt;Rory Cooper, a Paralympian in 1988 who has written three books and has 25 patents to his name, is the director of the University of Pittsburgh’s Human Engineering and Research Lab and is renowned in the disability community. Right now, he is an advisor for autonomous vehicle company Merlin Mobility and is also leading a study by the University Transportation Center to advise and learn from various AV companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wD8su3"&gt;For those reasons, Cooper doesn’t share the impatience expressed by disability rights lawyer Haben Girma and others in the disabled community. He thinks the future for disabled people looks brighter with more autonomous technology on the horizon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="PK5xy3"&gt;“There is still much to be learned and to be done,” he said, “but at least the process seems to have started to move in an inclusive and accessible direction, which is extremely important as transportation is both life-sustaining and enabling for people with disabilities.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s HomePod Mini is $20 off today at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MtUMK7ahZKQSZS71DLjRnha1M7A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70296851/jtuohy_211102_4860_0024_cropped.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r9Nnw2"&gt;Apple’s short, stout HomePod Mini usually costs $99.99, but Best Buy is offering a $20 discount today on the smart speaker. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgfi5O0cHlY" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;You can snag one for $79.99&lt;/a&gt;, which is the retailer’s lowest price yet, in addition to one of the best deals we’ve seen for it. If you’re in Apple’s ecosystem of products, there aren’t many other choices for buying a smart speaker that’s fully compatible with the Siri voice assistant, or HomeKit, for commanding certain smart home tech via the speaker. Still, it’s a great speaker that offers good sound quality for its size, and unlike the discontinued HomePod, this one’s compact enough to fit almost anywhere near a wall outlet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sqN51s"&gt;This deal is available on most of Apple’s vibrant colorways for the HomePod Mini, including blue, white, and black, but excluding yellow and orange. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GGYkZU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10883175"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IGtJac"&gt;If you’re in the market for an affordable, lightweight (just 66 grams), and fully featured wireless gaming mouse, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgfjmZTFOCP" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy’s $59.99 deal&lt;/a&gt; on the SteelSeries Aerox 3 mouse is tough to beat. This mouse usually costs $99.99 (you’ll see the price drop when you’re signed in with your free My Best Buy account), and it’s available in black or white. This model supports 2.4GHz wireless via its USB-C wireless receiver or Bluetooth and can last up to 200 hours on a charge. Not for nothing, this mouse has an IP54 rating, giving it a fighting chance of survival against water and lots of dust. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21538891/steelseries-aerox-3-gaming-mouse-wireless-lightweight-honeycomb-water-resistant-usb-c" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more coverage here.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

These normally cost $149.99, and they’re an especially appealing deal today if you want noise-canceling earbuds that are comfy to wear, with Android support and USB-C charging, to boot. Per our review, $100 seems like a good price to pay considering the perks and cons of the Studio Buds. You’ll get good sound quality, but their noise cancellation and mic performance likely won’t impress you all that much. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22532970/beats-studio-buds-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="fsDp6g"&gt;Were you one of the people who picked up a digital copy of&lt;em&gt; Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; as a PS Plus perk several months ago? You may remember, then, that Square Enix wouldn’t allow those free copies to be upgraded to the faster, prettier PS5 version of the game. Well, ’tis the season of giving, and starting Wednesday, December 22nd, you’ll be able to upgrade your digital PS4 copy to the PS5 version for no extra cost. This is great if you purchased a PS5 since the game was handed out back in March 2021. Stay tuned for details on exactly how to run through the process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DgoR8p"&gt;Also on December 22nd, &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade&lt;/em&gt;’s Yuffie DLC will be 25 percent off, letting you pick up the expansion at a discount.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LG Gram 17 is pictured here, but the Gram 16 looks identical, just a smidge smaller.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nuB0KU"&gt;If you’re a Costco member, you can get a stellar deal on LG’s Gram 16 laptop (model 16T90P) that has a 16-inch IPS display, a capable Intel Core i7-1165G7 processor, a touchscreen, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. It costs $1,746.99 at Amazon, &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/lg-gram-16-2-in-1-touchscreen-intel-evo-platform-laptop---11th-gen-intel-core-i7-1165g7---wqxga---2560-x-1600-display---windows-11.product.100794354.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;but Costco members can get it for just $1,199.99&lt;/a&gt;. This deal was picked up by &lt;a href="https://slickdeals.net/f/15514858-lg-gram-16-2-in-1-touchscreen-intel-evo-platform-laptop-11th-gen-intel-core-i7-1165g7-wqxga-2560-x-1600-display-windows-11-1199-99?src=popular_recombee" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slickdeals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, this deal isn’t available for non-members, like some of Costco’s products are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mrxIJM"&gt;I reviewed the LG Gram 17 for 2021, and it’s essentially a must-buy laptop if you want a big but lightweight and quiet Windows machine and surprisingly long-lasting battery life. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22364183/lg-gram-17-2021-intel-11th-gen-iris-xe-graphics-performance-battery-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We haven’t tested this model yet, but it seems like a decent deal if you want an affordable Windows laptop.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Taco Bell had beef with Beyond Meat’s fake carne asada</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Taco Bell Struggles With Ingredients Shortage Due To Supply Transport Issues" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d8Y8jxPMTW2awMwnx0zT9qcX3NM=/0x0:6240x4160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70252679/1329911498.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2hUjQZ"&gt;Taco Bell, the restaurant known for having ground beef that's utterly indescribable, reportedly told Beyond Meat that its version of carne asada wasn’t good enough to serve. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-09/taco-bell-abandoned-plan-to-test-beyond-meat-s-carne-asada?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the chain canceled a test product that featured Beyond’s plant-based steak after samples failed to live up to its standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jiMfHU"&gt;Beyond Meat denies the report — Shira Zackai, head of communications at the company told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email that “the test between Beyond Meat and Taco Bell was not canceled. Our partnership is strong, and we are actively working together to create a plant-based protein that’s completely new to the national QSR (quick serve restaurant) space. We look forward to sharing more details on what Beyond Meat and Taco Bell have planned in the coming months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fx3q8s"&gt;The report doesn’t make it clear what the company wasn’t fond of — was it the texture? The taste? Was it just too high-end for Taco Bell, seeming more like something you’d find at a Chipotle rather than the restaurant known as the place you drunkenly get 2 AM takeout and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319868/taco-bell-nfts-gif-tacos-sell"&gt;NFTs&lt;/a&gt;? Whatever the case, people on Twitter have been having an absolute field day with the news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jTXvu1"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="yDTmqi"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;lol how bad did it taste for taco bell to say 'that's gonna be a no from us, dawg'? &lt;a href="https://t.co/4Pnzq8T3ej"&gt;https://t.co/4Pnzq8T3ej&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Fidel Martinez (@fidmart85) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fidmart85/status/1469075289560928258?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="pTEtco"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;That's a bummer but also wouldn't be that big of a deal if they actually subbed out the meat for black beans with 100% accuracy when I ask.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My good Taco Bell is at about 85% and my bad one is at about 50%. &lt;a href="https://t.co/NUO1IWUvoQ"&gt;https://t.co/NUO1IWUvoQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ring My Bell (@RingMyBellPod) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RingMyBellPod/status/1469067305300598787?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cShyL2"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, the two companies are still planning on working together to add plant-based meat to the menu, promising that it’d be something “entirely new.” Taco Bell is also testing out its own plant-based protein similar to its ground beef at some restaurants, &lt;a href="https://thebeet.com/taco-bell-is-testing-vegan-meat-at-nearly-100-us-locations/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Beet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (though &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/review-taco-bell-new-plant-based-meat-cravetarian-2021-4"&gt;one writer from &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; described it as “very disappointing”) . Beyond Meat did, however, reportedly let go of two employees who worked on the carne asada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n0OQRX"&gt;A few other restaurants are currently trialing Beyond Meat products — the most notable is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728805/mcdonalds-mcplant-beyond-meat-burger-test"&gt;the McPlant from McDonalds&lt;/a&gt;, but Panda Express and KFC are also working on chicken-like products with Beyond as well. While some may read Taco Bell’s trial cancelation as bad news for vegetarians, the chain already sells the perfect meatless fast-food dish: the spicy potato taco, which makes up a far larger percentage of my diet than I’d care to admit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nhcnH1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 20th, 9:30AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added statement from Beyond Meat denying &lt;/em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;em&gt;’s report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sen. Warren and Rep. AOC demand answers from Amazon after warehouse deaths</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Roof Collapse At Amazon Facility Following Deadly Tornadoes" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8EjehmIZruleslw5UorqUqA3l7s=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70296648/1237190049.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Six people were killed when an Amazon warehouse in Illinois was struck by a tornado&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L9HN3w"&gt;A group of progressive Democratic lawmakers, led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Reps. Cori Bush and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is demanding answers from Amazon after six people were killed in a tornado strike at one of its warehouses in Illinois. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hxRpyq"&gt;A letter sent Monday to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy and founder Jeff Bezos says the events that happened on December 10th at the Edwardsville facility “fit a larger pattern: Amazon puts worker safety at risk in everyday situations and emergencies alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dO9Ugc"&gt;“As we work to ensure that tragedies such as this one are not repeated, we seek answers about what happened at your Edwardsville warehouse,” the letter continues, “and whether your policies may have contributed to this tragedy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N3C2iO"&gt;The tornado was part of a complex of extreme weather centered in western Kentucky on December 10th, leaving at least 58 dead over more than 150 miles. The path of destruction included Amazon’s fulfillment center in Edwardsville, which was entirely destroyed by the strike. In the aftermath of the building collapse, reports emerged that workers at the warehouse didn’t receive proper safety training, and an overall &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22836393/amazon-warehouse-tornado-collapse-illinois-disaster"&gt;lack of preparedness by Amazon&lt;/a&gt; left workers in harm’s way, despite weather warnings that tornadoes were likely that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZCrXQ8"&gt;Warren said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that the circumstances in Edwardsville served as “another reminder that Amazon’s anti-worker and anti-union practices put their workers directly in harm’s way. Putting corporate profits above the health and safety of workers is unacceptable.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GDUndC"&gt;In addition to Rep. Cori Bush (D-MO), the letter is also signed by Democratic Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Ron Wyden (D-OR), and Ed Markey (D-MA) and Reps. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), Jesus Garcia (D-IL), Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), Mondaire Jones (D-NY), Barbara Lee (D-CA), Jerry McNerny (D-CA), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Donald M. Payne, Jr. (D-NJ), Paul D. Tonko (D-NY), Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-NJ), and Andy Levin (D-MI). It takes issue with a long list of problems at Amazon facilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DO2MG5"&gt;The letter includes a list of questions for Amazon to answer by January 3rd. In particular, the lawmakers ask who was working at the Edwardsville warehouse on December 10th and what safety policies Amazon had in place, as well as whether Amazon required workers at the plant to remain at work despite the tornado warning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iSxRvl"&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/17/22841667/amazon-delivery-driver-illinois-tornado-warehouse-destruction"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that a nearby driver was instructed to continue deliveries just 90 minutes before the tornado strike, being told by their dispatcher that the storm sirens were “just a warning.” Amazon is investigating the incident and has said that the dispatcher “should have immediately directed the driver to seek shelter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="QCk8hn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How Amazon warehouse policies put workers at risk","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22836393/amazon-warehouse-tornado-collapse-illinois-disaster"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="LbYNR6"&gt;The lawmakers also write they are “deeply concerned” about reports that Amazon plans to reinstate its mobile phone ban, which it paused in 2020 because of COVID. However, Amazon spokesperson Alisa Carroll told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;last week that the company had updated its cell phone policy. “All reporting that it’s been rolled back to pre-COVID is simply not true and factually incorrect,” Carroll said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iBN8it"&gt;Two of the people killed in the Edwardsville warehouse collapse were constituents of Rep. Bush, who represents a district in St. Louis. She said in a statement that “Amazon’s profits should never come at the cost of our community’s lives, health, and safety. This cannot become the cost of doing business in America.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Picking what the James Webb Space Telescope will do in its first year of life&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="VwXW2C"&gt;In late March, Grant Tremblay was sitting at his computer at his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, listening in on a Zoom meeting, when he saw a string of emails pop up in his inbox. The title of each email read: “Cycle 1 JWST Notification Letter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7oxNi6"&gt;He knew immediately that this was the day he and his colleagues in the astronomy community had been eagerly awaiting: it was Blacker Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MUJSB6"&gt;Blacker Friday, to be clear, didn’t have anything to do with discounts, or Fridays. (It was a Tuesday.) It was the day that Tremblay, an astrophysicist at the Harvard and Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, and other astronomers around the world, would learn if they would receive a small amount of time to use the James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST, one of the most powerful space telescopes ever created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="kgiKny"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We wanted to answer fundamental questions that cannot be answered any other way.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mcZXvw"&gt;Blacker Friday is named after Brett Blacker, who co-runs the science policies group at the Space Telescope Science Institute, or STScI. Each year, the institute is responsible for selecting which astronomers will get time to use NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope. And each year, after a lengthy decision-making process, Blacker would send out a flurry of emails to hopeful astronomers, all on the same day at the same time, informing them if their proposals to use the telescope had been accepted or rejected. Thus, Blacker Friday — also sometimes known as the Blacker Apocalypse — was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JGCyi5"&gt;This year the stakes were even higher on Blacker Friday because, for the first time ever, astronomers were being informed if they would get time with JWST, a brand-new space observatory that is significantly larger and more powerful than Hubble. Set to launch to deep space at the end of December, the nearly $10 billion NASA-built telescope promises the ability to peer into the recesses of the Universe like never before. Ahead of JWST’s launch, STScI had the daunting task of figuring out which of the 1,173 proposals for the observatory’s first year of life — known as Cycle 1 — should get time with the telescope. How do you prioritize what the most advanced piece of space equipment in the world should do when it first turns on? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x7wDss"&gt;Well, the science has to be nothing short of revolutionary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MJ4XJB"&gt;“What is deemed most interesting is science that is considered transformational — that will change our view of the universe,” Klaus Pontoppidan, an astronomer and JWST project scientist at STScI, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We don’t want the observatory to do things a little better than what has been done before. We wanted to answer fundamental questions that cannot be answered any other way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xLoMYk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Power of JWST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IsLFtu"&gt;NASA plans to launch JWST the day before Christmas. But for the astronomy community, the launch is the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; holiday. JWST is one of the most anticipated space science missions of the 21st century, as it has the ability to reshape astronomy and astrophysics as we know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oACDt9"&gt;That’s because the telescope is the closest thing we have to a time machine. Sporting a 21-foot-wide gold-plated mirror, JWST will be able to see in the infrared with incredible sensitivity. It’ll be able to see objects that are 10 to 100 times fainter than what the Hubble Space Telescope can see, and it’ll be capable of seeing things in 10 times better detail. It will gather light from stars and galaxies located up to 13.6 billion light-years away — light that has taken 13.6 billion years to reach the telescope’s mirrors. Since the Universe is thought to be roughly 13.8 billion years old, the galaxies that JWST will be observing likely formed just 100 to 250 million years after the Big Bang. Our Universe was in its infancy then, and JWST will be providing us with the baby photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ua0sAD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Nearly every area of astronomy that you can think of will be addressed.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Lv9qov"&gt;In addition to peering back in time, the telescope will help us understand the large-scale structure of the Universe, and perhaps tell us if it will go on expanding forever. It will peer into the centers of galaxies, finding supermassive black holes and helping astronomers learn how these enigmatic objects have evolved over time. It will observe the births and deaths of stars. It will even look back at our own Solar System to study the faintest objects at the edge of our cosmic neighborhood. And it will be able to look at the edges of worlds orbiting around distant stars. “Nearly every area of astronomy that you can think of will be addressed,” Christine Chen, an associate astronomer at STScI, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An artistic rendering of JWST completely unfurled in space&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IVyi6p"&gt;The promise of JWST has always been just over the horizon. Since an iteration of the telescope was first conceived in 1989, the road to the launchpad has been paved with cost overruns and technical issues. Naively, NASA originally envisioned a launch &lt;a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-20-224.pdf"&gt;between 2007 and 2011&lt;/a&gt;, for a total cost between $1 billion and $3.5 billion. But JWST continued to miss one target launch date after next, &lt;a href="https://www.planetary.org/articles/cost-of-the-jwst"&gt;while its total cost ballooned to $9.7 billion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PyPLcz"&gt;As everyone waited for JWST to materialize, the world of astronomy blossomed. An entirely new field has emerged since the 1990s, one that revolves around the study of planets outside our Solar System, or exoplanets. Since the &lt;a href="https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/alien-worlds/historic-timeline/#first-planetary-disk-observed"&gt;first detection of an exoplanet was confirmed in 1992&lt;/a&gt;, we’ve discovered thousands of these far-off worlds orbiting alien stars. In 2017, astronomers shocked the world when they announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/22/14674088/7-planet-solar-system-discovered-conditions-for-life-water-nature-nasa"&gt;the discovery of an entire alien solar system&lt;/a&gt;, consisting of seven planets roughly the size of Earth all orbiting around a dwarf star. And three of the seven planets, known as the TRAPPIST-1 system, sit in the star’s habitable zone, where temperatures are thought to be just right so that water can pool on a planet’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wzorTn"&gt;After discovering such a bounty of exoplanets, astronomers are now eager to find what is referred to as Earth 2.0: a planet that’s the size of our world, orbiting a star like our Sun at the right distance for liquid water to form. But exoplanets are incredibly faint, and traditional methods for detecting them — like watching stars dim ever so slightly as planets pass in front of them — can’t tell us what might be lurking on their surfaces. JWST, however, is powerful enough that it may be able to detect light passing directly through the atmospheres of some alien worlds and use that light to say what kinds of chemicals are present in the atmosphere. Perhaps, it could even detect signs of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="NBJOqv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“All of our transformational leaps in observational astronomy are enabled by making ever larger pieces of glass.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jKLch1"&gt;It’s a capability no one really envisioned when JWST was first being designed, but now it’s considered one of the more exciting areas of science that the telescope will touch upon. It also means there are even more people who are very eager to get just a few hours with the most advanced space telescope over built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N4d6jv"&gt;“All of our transformational leaps in observational astronomy are enabled by making ever larger pieces of glass, right?” says Tremblay. “And when you make a damn piece of glass that’s large enough — and especially when you launch it into space — the discovery space for that observatory grows with time. It doesn’t diminish.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6JJTyc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choosing the Science&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5yVfy"&gt;While JWST is ultimately a NASA mission, it’s the Space Telescope Science Institute’s job to determine what JWST actually &lt;em&gt;does &lt;/em&gt;in space. “You can think of us as sort of the software part of the observatory,” Pontoppidan says, “whereas NASA is the hardware part.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oCDLXs"&gt;However, STScI had to wait a long time before figuring out the schedule for JWST’s first year, and there were a few false starts along the way. When it seemed like the telescope would be ready to launch in 2019, the Institute called on astronomers to submit their proposals by March 2018. Then just a week before the deadline, NASA announced that the telescope wouldn’t launch until 2020 at the earliest. STScI abruptly postponed the deadline until a more concrete launch date was determined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M1AHa1"&gt;Another postponement came again in March 2020, due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, astronomers turned in their proposals by November 24th, 2020, two days before Thanksgiving. Then it was time for STScI to sift through the more than 1,000 ideas that had been submitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="86Rc6F"&gt;STScI knew that it couldn’t handle this process alone. The Institute created a Time Allocation Committee including astronomers and astrophysicists from around the world. They were separated into 18 panels, each one consisting of about 10 people tasked with looking over proposals for different areas of space science and ranking them based on three important criteria: how much the proposal will impact knowledge within a subfield, how much it will advance astronomy in general, and whether the proposed idea requires the unique capabilities of JWST to be successful. Given just how many people want to use JWST, the Institute didn’t want to allot time to an observation that could be done with any of the other telescopes currently online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Blk2KZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We regret to inform you...” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gCHgDW"&gt;With all of these benchmarks in mind, the committee got to work evaluating all of the proposals. To try to eliminate as much bias as possible from the selection process, the process was “dual anonymous.” That means that the people writing the proposals had no idea who would be evaluating them, and the people on the committee had no idea whose proposals they were analyzing. As a result, 30 percent of the winning proposals are helmed by women, and scientists studying for their PhDs also saw more success in getting their ideas approved. “Now since nobody knows who wrote the proposal, students can be just as successful as their mentors,” Chen says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QjOzn5p20Gf7oTMGxJIqWW9SyP4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23114554/cosmos_webb_comparision_with_cosmos_hubble_acs.png"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZIeBSU"&gt;After painstaking debate, the committee selected the proposals it found to be the most transformative. It then gave each proposal a certain number of hours of observation time. Ultimately, &lt;a href="https://www.stsci.edu/contents/news/jwst/2021/stsci-announces-the-jwst-cycle-1-general-observer-program#:~:text=The%20Cycle%201%20GO%20program,broad%2C%20worldwide%20community%20of%20observers."&gt;STScI selected a total of 266 proposals&lt;/a&gt;, submitted by scientists from 41 countries around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UfbXX3"&gt;Tremblay, the Harvard astrophysicist, had submitted nine proposals for JWST’s first year. On Blacker Friday, nine new emails sat in his inbox. (The emails don’t come from Blacker anymore but from the Science Mission Office at STScI). He quickly clicked through them and read one after the next:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sPhyZ"&gt;“Dear Dr. Tremblay,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fes324"&gt;We regret to inform you...”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WyKQ1i"&gt;He read the phrase nine times in total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYSVZ0"&gt;It was a disappointment but definitely not a shock. “I wasn’t broken up by not getting time this year,” Tremblay tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I knew it would be immensely, immensely competitive for Cycle 1, as it should be. And it’s okay. We’ll resubmit again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kauov3"&gt;Nearly 2,000 miles away, Caitlin Casey, an astronomer at the University of Texas, was having a very different kind of Blacker Friday. She was at home in Austin, holding her sleeping two-month-old baby in her lap, while scrolling her phone. That’s when she saw the email pop up in her inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Lxrq"&gt;“Dear Dr. Casey,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fz85kM"&gt;We are pleased to inform you...”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FrSGk1"&gt;The ambitious project she had proposed, called Cosmos Webb, had just been approved. And the Institute was giving Casey a whopping 208 hours with JWST to fulfill her project, the most of anyone who had submitted proposals. The project will stare at a particularly large patch of sky the size of three full Moons, an area that spans up to 63 million light years across. Doing so will create a portrait of the young universe similar to the Hubble’s iconic Hubble Deep Field, which showcased some of the earliest galaxies we could observe at the time. With JWST’s enhanced capability, the team will be imaging galaxies that are even older at even greater levels of detail. “If the Hubble Deep Field were printed on an eight-and-a-half by 11 sheet of paper, Cosmos Webb would be like a 16-foot by 16-foot mural on the side of a building,” says Casey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="02Q5rg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“All I had to say was, ‘We got it.’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OxiSui"&gt;Staying silent so as not to wake her sleeping child, Casey jubilantly logged into Slack and messaged her colleague on the project, Jeyhan Kartaltepe, an astrophysicist at the Rochester Institute of Technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bgFKFv"&gt;“All I had to say was, ‘We got it,’” Casey tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “She was dumbfounded, too. And I think for the rest of that day, both her and I, we could not even [focus]. It was a flurry of excitement and just overwhelmed with that news.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wzDtpeFO5N5Dt1xzG1j4FEmenCs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23114556/2981_PIA22093_NASA.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image:&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;NASA/JPL-Caltech&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An artistic illustration of what the planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system could look like.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cxMaJQ"&gt;Aside from Cosmos Webb, the seven-planet TRAPPIST-1 system will be getting a lot of attention during JWST’s first year, with up to seven different programs dedicated to studying this strange cluster of worlds. JWST will be looking in the atmospheres of these planets, as well as dozens more we’ve found throughout the Universe, hoping to determine if these places might be suitable for life as we know it. And there are hundreds more targets that JWST will observe, including galaxies, quasars, black holes, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="87foMl"&gt;While the committee tried to be as logical as possible with their final decisions, everyone agrees that serendipity does come into play. “Probably there were a lot of amazing programs similar to ours that were also up for consideration,” says Casey. “There’s always a little element of luck in the final selection process. Maybe someone on the panel just liked the specific way we presented some information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zgyYgI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The First Year&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NkyztC"&gt;Roughly 10,000 hours of observing time is allotted to different groups for JWST’s first year of life. About 6,000 hours were given to the scientists who submitted proposals around the world, while nearly 4,000 hours were already set aside for scientists who helped design and build JWST and its instruments. The STScI also has about 460 hours of discretionary time which have been allotted for what is known as “Early Release Observations.” Data from these hours, scheduled to be done in the first five months of science, will become public immediately, so that anyone — even those who did not get time with the telescope — can analyze the observations and write their own studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zdmrrj"&gt;Anyone who does the math will realize that 10,000 hours is actually more than the number of hours in a calendar year. STScI purposefully overprescribed JWST’s time to account for any snafus. STScI will be scheduling JWST’s observations in two-week increments, during which time the observatory will point at its intended targets autonomously. However, it’s possible that JWST will fail to execute some commands properly from time to time. If that happens, JWST will simply go on to the next observation. And the Institute wants to make sure the telescope has fallback plans when such errors occur. “We don’t want to get to the end of the year, and then run out of observations,” Pontoppidan says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t06tsCTbiHkEPGwXGsANicdycIg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23114561/52682_1536x1024.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: ESA/M.Pedoussaut&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The James Webb Space Telescope folded up ahead of encapsulation on top of its rocket.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SPiBGM"&gt;STScI is also planning to carve out time for targets we don’t know about yet. These are events like the explosive destruction of a star, known as a supernova, or when two particularly dense stars come together in a cataclysmic merger, known as a kilonova. If astronomers spot a particularly juicy supernova occurring in the sky, JWST’s operators are prepared to reorient the schedule so that they can quickly observe the aftermath of the eruptive event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FgB7KU"&gt;The prioritization of JWST’s observations will be determined by the time of the year, and where things are positioned in the sky. But as for the very first observation the telescope will do, NASA knows what it is — but won’t tell. It’s supposed to be a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3DcfL5"&gt;While flexibility is going to be key for JWST Cycle 1, STScI guarantees that all the proposals that have been approved &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; occur. Because each target in the sky is in JWST’s view twice a year, if for some reason a target is missed, there is a second opportunity to observe it six months later. If a target isn’t observed in the first year, it might simply bleed over into next year. “Basically, everything that gets through the committee — recommended and approved — will execute on the telescope,” Chen says, “as long as the telescope, you know, works.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="chGur2"&gt;If everything goes well with the telescope’s launch, NASA plans to conduct at least five and a half years of science with it, and hopefully up to 10 years. Ultimately, the observatory’s lifetime is dictated by its limited fuel reserves, which are needed to help reorient JWST in space. Whenever that fuel runs out, JWST’s mission will end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="MQiebM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“the community has immense demand for the telescope. And I think it’s a great thing.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d3MWcA"&gt;That finality is still quite a ways off. First, JWST must launch and actually survive its trip through space. Once it reaches its final home 1 million miles from Earth, JWST will undergo six months of commissioning — when scientists meticulously test out the instruments on board — before the real science begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OAh6Wn"&gt;And then, after a period of transformational science has passed, it’ll be time to submit another round of proposals. Though Tremblay will be involved with one JWST proposal for Cycle 1 as a collaborator rather than the principal investigator, he does plan to submit his ideas again for Cycle 2. And he’ll understand if it doesn’t get accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RTu0r"&gt;“As an astronomer we get professionally used to rejections; I could wallpaper my hallway with rejections that I’ve received,” Tremblay says. “It’s just a reflection of the fact that the community has immense demand for the telescope. And I think it’s a great thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5w40dL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CT05Ui"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk says he’ll pay over $11 billion in taxes this year</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rs8zWG"&gt;Elon Musk expects to pay over $11 billion in taxes in 2021, the Tesla CEO &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1472754632325795843"&gt;said in a tweet&lt;/a&gt;. The figure is roughly in line with &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/12/15/elon-musk-to-pay-record-high-12-billion-tax-bill.html"&gt;a report from CNBC&lt;/a&gt; last week, when it estimated that Musk has already paid $7 billion in state and federal taxes this year, and will pay a further $5 billion by January 1st. CNBC said the figures could represent “the single largest tax bill ever.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AHGaiJ"&gt;The disclosure comes as Musk and other billionaires are facing increasing scrutiny over the amount of tax they pay. As &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/20/elon-musk-says-he-will-pay-over-11-billion-in-taxes-this-year.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC &lt;/em&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;, Musk doesn’t take a salary or cash bonus in his role as Tesla CEO, and instead is compensated in stock awards. When he needs money, he’s able to borrow it using his stock holdings as collateral, which doesn’t carry the same tax obligations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="G5NBCj"&gt;The big difference this year is that in early November Musk started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22775485/elon-musk-twitter-poll-tesla-stock-option-sold-taxes"&gt;selling off billions worth of Tesla shares&lt;/a&gt;, which involves paying a combined tax rate of over 53 percent &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/12/15/elon-musk-to-pay-record-high-12-billion-tax-bill.html"&gt;according to CNBC&lt;/a&gt;. The decision was ostensibly the result of a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1457064697782489088"&gt;Twitter poll conducted in November&lt;/a&gt;, in which users voted for Musk to sell off 10 percent of his Tesla stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wBHlcd"&gt;But observers have noted that Musk would have had to pay a large tax bill on stock options expiring next year regardless. And by choosing to exercise the stock options now rather than waiting until August 2022, Musk might avoid higher tax rates introduced under Democrat’s Build Back Better bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l8eD0v"&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ProPublica&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that Musk paid zero federal income tax in 2018, and only paid $455 million in taxes in the previous four years despite his wealth growing by $13.9 billion. Speaking at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22698563/elon-musk-code-conference-liveblog"&gt;this year’s Code Conference&lt;/a&gt;, Musk said his taxes were zero in 2018 because he overpaid the year before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="40bsCc"&gt;While Musk appears to be making good on his claim that he’ll pay “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1470898920146542592"&gt;more taxes than any American in history&lt;/a&gt;” in 2021, this shouldn’t come as much of a surprise given that he’s reported to be the world’s richest person by quite some margin. Musk’s net wealth is currently estimated to sit at around $243 billion, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Billionaires Index&lt;/a&gt;, almost $50 billion more than Amazon founder Jeff Bezos with a reported $195 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s ‘first gaming laptop’ has an RTX 3080 and 11th Gen Intel CPU</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t1nmexUaylYsa2wJQh-7QgRHy7M=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70296146/LG_UltraGear_Gaming_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The laptop features an RGB keyboard.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4yDZdI"&gt;LG has announced what it’s calling its “first gaming laptop,” the UltraGear 17G90Q. The 17-inch laptop is powered by a combination of an 11th Gen Intel Tiger Lake H CPU and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Max-Q graphics card, and can be configured with up to 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wqCALl"&gt;The company is no stranger to making laptops, but the focus of its previous models has generally been on office productivity rather than offering a top-of-the-line gaming experience. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22364183/lg-gram-17-2021-intel-11th-gen-iris-xe-graphics-performance-battery-review"&gt;LG Gram 17&lt;/a&gt; we reviewed earlier this year, for example, was a great lightweight work machine, but its lack of a beefy dedicated GPU meant it definitely wasn’t a gaming machine. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iSVdkI4A_ebFvDUBEhDztGUksgg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23114486/LG_UltraGear_Gaming_002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Four ports are hidden on the rear of the machine, including HDMI and Ethernet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gG4K88"&gt;LG lists two laptops on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fus%2Flaptops&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F20%2F22846139%2Flg-ultragear-17g90q-rtx-3080-gpu-11th-gen-intel-cpu-storage-gaming-laptop" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;its site&lt;/a&gt; equipped with Nvidia GPUs, but both have the lower-powered GTX 1650. In contrast, the RTX 3080 found inside the new UltraGear 17G90Q is the fastest GPU Nvidia currently offers for laptops. Other specs include a 1080p IPS display with a 300Hz refresh rate, a 93Wh battery, an RGB keyboard, a fingerprint sensor on the power button, and a 1080p webcam. Its casing is made from aluminum, and the laptop comes in a fetching purple gray color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wg0amL"&gt;Although the LG UltraGear 17G90Q is meant for gaming, it’s still equipped with a bevy of physical ports. There are two USB-C ports (including one USB 4), two USB-A ports, a headphone jack, HDMI port, Ethernet, and there’s even a microSD card slot for good measure. Charging is handled via a dedicated DC input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8HEPOl"&gt;Pricing for the 17G90Q is yet to be announced, but LG says it’ll be announcing more details at CES on January 4th. It’ll be released first in the US and South Korea starting in  early 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tom Brady’s best throw of the night destroys Microsoft tablet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TyTgnOcUxWut3Ckn3bV8IYgUYts=/47x0:553x337/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70296124/brady_vs_microsoft_surface.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom Brady rage quitting Microsoft Surface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S3Er4z"&gt;After throwing a fourth-quarter interception to seal a 9-0 loss against the Saints on Sunday night, Tampa Bay quarterback Tom Brady managed to connect with a Microsoft Surface tablet, absolutely destroying it. The defeat was &lt;a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/tom-brady-gets-shut-out-for-first-time-in-15-years-vs-saints-keeping-a-drew-brees-nfl-record-safe/"&gt;Brady’s first shutout in 15 years&lt;/a&gt;, according to CBS Sports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ehReaz"&gt;Brady joins an illustrious group of Surface abusers that include &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/11/8/9693380/the-packers-are-terrible-aaron-rodgers-surface"&gt;Aaron Rogers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SN_Ohio/status/691374430728130560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;Johnny Manziel&lt;/a&gt;, and former boss Bill “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/18/13320664/bill-belichick-patriots-microsoft-surface-tablet-nfl"&gt;I just can’t take it anymore”&lt;/a&gt; Belichick, to name just a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P0kiYq"&gt;Surface tablets have suffered regular abuse since &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/12/9/7359503/microsoft-surface-nfl-demo-hands-on"&gt;their introduction in the 2014 NFL season&lt;/a&gt; after Microsoft became the official provider of tablet-based image reviews for teams during games, replacing the black-and-white photographs that had been in use for decades. The tablets were frequently called “iPads” in early post-game interviews despite Microsoft paying millions to the NFL for the exclusive advertising and equipment rights. And early &lt;a href="http://www.technobuffalo.com/2016/01/25/microsoft-surface-tablets-blamed-after-nfl-breakdown/"&gt;technical and usability issues&lt;/a&gt; often caused the Surface tablets to become high-speed projectiles in the hands of athletes prone to favoring human growth hormone injections over vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
