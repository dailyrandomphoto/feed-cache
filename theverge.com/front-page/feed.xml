    <title>A teenager on TikTok disrupted thousands of scientific studies with a single video</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Researchers were caught by surprise after a short video sent a flood of new users to a survey platform&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="lhMlad"&gt;Thousands of scientific studies had to toss out weeks of data because of a 56-second TikTok video by a teenager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NQ03zy"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sarahndom/video/6988270489290411269?lang=en&amp;amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1"&gt;July 23rd video&lt;/a&gt; is short and simple. It opens with recent Florida high school graduate and self-described “teen author” Sarah Frank sitting in her bedroom and smiling at the camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iw051M"&gt;“Welcome to side hustles I recommend trying — part one,” she says in the video, pointing users to the website Prolific.co. “Basically, it’s a bunch of surveys for different amounts of money and different amounts of time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CI6Grs"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@sarahndom/video/6988270489290411269" data-video-id="6988270489290411269" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@sarahndom" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sarahndom"&gt;@sarahndom&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;i’m excited for this series!! &lt;a title="sidehustles" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/sidehustles"&gt;#sidehustles&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="sarahssidehustles" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/sarahssidehustles"&gt;#sarahssidehustles&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="prolific" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/prolific"&gt;#prolific&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="makingmoney" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/makingmoney"&gt;#makingmoney&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="sidehustleideas" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/sidehustleideas"&gt;#sidehustleideas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - sarah :)" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-6988270314086419206"&gt;♬ original sound - sarah :)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JdvMcE"&gt;That video got 4.1 million views in the month after it was posted and sent tens of thousands of new users flooding to the Prolific platform. Prolific, a tool for scientists conducting behavioral research, had no screening tools in place to make sure that it delivered representative population samples to each study. Suddenly, scientists used to getting a wide mix of subjects for their Prolific studies saw their surveys flooded with responses from young women around Frank’s age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XjSPES"&gt;For researchers who rely on representative samples of the US population, that demographic shift was a major problem with no obvious cause and no immediately clear way to fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KOAnOS"&gt;Doing science on the internet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7ZsZ0t"&gt;Though not particularly well known, Prolific is part of a small collection of online tools that have transformed the way corporations and scientists study the way people think and act. The first and largest of these research platforms is Amazon-owned Mechanical Turk, which was released in 2005 as a general-purpose platform for crowdsourcing work on repetitive tasks. Soon after it was released, behavioral scientists realized its potential value for their research, and it quickly revolutionized several research fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OAZCLY"&gt;“Before Mechanical Turk existed, all social science research had to happen in the laboratory. You’d need to bring in college sophomores and put them through questionnaires and surveys and whatnot,” said Nicholas Hall, director of the Behavioral Lab at the Stanford School of Business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jd3RqL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Online research makes it so much easier. You program a survey... you put it online, and within a day, you have 1,000 responses.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TgeU1c"&gt;“That’s an enormous time- and labor-intensive endeavor. Online research makes it so much easier. You program a survey... you put it online, and within a day, you have 1,000 responses,” Hall told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “That changed the face of social science.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FGSfA7"&gt;The Behavioral Lab at Stanford mainly uses the newer, smaller Prolific platform for online studies these days, Hall said. While many Mechanical Turk customers are big businesses conducting corporate research, Prolific gears its product to scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XF5vPK"&gt;The smaller platform offers more transparency, promises to treat survey participants more ethically, and promises higher-quality research subjects than alternative platforms like Mechanical Turk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o8VxLU"&gt;Scientists doing this sort of research in the United States generally want a pool of subjects who speak English as a first language, are not too practiced at taking psychological surveys, and together make up a reasonably representative demographic sample of the American population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z0FMaE"&gt;Prolific, most agreed, did a good job providing high-quality subjects. The sudden change in the platform’s demographics threatened to upend that reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lFmKlc"&gt;TikTok aftermath&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="iBgKO3"&gt;In the days and weeks after Frank posted her video, researchers scrambled to figure out what was happening to their studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="a4zk7D"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Analyzing N=300 Prolific study. Very generic title &amp;amp; description. Survey questions mostly about social comparisons &amp;amp; money&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;91% of respondents are female, 7% are male. Don't think I've miscoded anything, and no unusual survey restrictions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How does that happen?&lt;/p&gt;— Sebastian Deri (@SebastianDeri) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SebastianDeri/status/1423768044610854913?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ESocS2"&gt;A member of the Stanford Behavioral Laboratory &lt;a href="https://community.prolific.co/t/studies-80-90-women-age-21-could-be-from-viral-tiktok-about-prolific/4266"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; on a Prolific forum, “We have noticed a huge leap in the number of participants on the platform in the US Pool, from 40k to 80k. Which is great, however, now a lot of our studies have a gender skew where maybe 85% of participants are women. Plus the age has been averaging around 21.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F3FmgW"&gt;Wayne State psychologist Hannah Schechter seems to have been the first person to crack the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kPSEmp"&gt;“This may be far-fetched,” she tweeted, linking to Frank’s video, “but given the timing, virality of the video, and the user’s follower demographics....”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lWNyp9"&gt;Long-standing Prolific survey-takers &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProlificAc/comments/oyff92/prolific_went_viral_on_tiktok/"&gt;complained on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; that Frank had made it difficult to find paid surveys to take on the overrun platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XaNIz9"&gt;“Now it’s just another bullshit site to spend hours and make pennies on,” wrote one user, who said they had previously made $30 a week on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="KI0PVP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Now it’s just another bullshit site to spend hours and make pennies on.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3wl6I9"&gt;Frank, who “guesstimated” she had made a total of about $80 taking surveys on Prolific before her video, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; she also noticed a difference on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SzPB4Y"&gt;“Less studies have been available for me and everyone else,” she told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I’ve received some really mean comments accusing me of single-handedly ruining the site and being selfish — even though I received no compensation for that video.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rIzI3b"&gt;She added that she hoped Prolific would be able to set up a system to deal with its changed demographics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PtehqZ"&gt;“I also predict that a lot of people who signed up after seeing my video will forget about it, and the surge will die down,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z08lSt"&gt;Prolific co-founder and CTO Phelim Bradley told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that many of the new users do seem to be dropping off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rgAfn9"&gt;“Prior to Tiktok, about 50% of the responses on our platform came from women,” he wrote in an email. “The surge knocked this up as high as 75% for a few days, but since then, this number has been trending down, and we’re currently back to ~60% of responses being from women.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;A chart showing the increase in female users over time. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MJbCfW"&gt;According to Bradley, about 4,600 studies were disrupted by Frank’s TikTok, around a third of the total that were active on the platform during the surge. Of those, he said, the vast majority should be salvageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yT2T2y"&gt;Prolific has refunded researchers whose studies were significantly impacted by the surge in women survey takers and introduced a new suite of demographic screening tools. The company announced these steps a month after Frank posted her video. The company has now re-organized, putting a team in charge of demographic balancing in order to more quickly recognize and respond to this sort of problem in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lWSOFT"&gt;“Honestly, we were somewhat caught by surprise, and we didn’t predict how large the impact was going to be,” Bradley said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ycRVqu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Young women who enjoy TikTok are people too.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5tqL1v"&gt;The surge isn’t all bad. Refreshing the pool of survey takers probably has long-term benefits, says Vlad Chituk, a Yale graduate student in psychology who was running several pilot studies on Prolific when the surge hit. When subjects take lots of psychological surveys, they learn the tricks scientists use to gather data, and that can impact the way they respond to future survey questions. Fresh subjects provide higher-quality data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y61usw"&gt;“Young women who enjoy TikTok are people too,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rm2HT4"&gt;As for Frank, she says that her side hustle video is now the most popular TikTok she’s ever posted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g0ViTN"&gt;“It definitely didn’t occur to me that the video would blow up. I just posted it for my friends and followers, not for the reach it ended up getting,” she said. “I think it blew up because the site is genuinely so cool, and people love efficient ways to make money.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="l1Ku3W"&gt;For the time being, Frank has paused most of her own side hustles as she settles into her freshman year at Brown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ruy31r"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HmQiCt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon is reportedly working on an Alexa-powered soundbar and wall-mounted Echo</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9S-QcSYi3a5irWJpWuudJbjPZHE=/0x25:1404x961/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69902557/alexa_widgets.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m4i6Rk"&gt;What’s next for Amazon’s family of Alexa-powered devices? A little bit of everything, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-24/amazon-working-on-large-wall-echo-sound-bar-and-new-auto-device?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;a new report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which has a great overview of products the company is reportedly working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d3VsO6"&gt;The e-commerce giant has never been afraid of throwing products at the wall to see what sticks, and its plans certainly seem to follow this ideology. Indeed, they even include a new big-screen Echo device that can be mounted on walls. Very appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y27k2Y"&gt;Here’s what Amazon has in the hopper, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="7cPjeE"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Wall-mounted Echo:&lt;/strong&gt; Following the launch of the display-equipped Echo Show line, Amazon is supersizing the screen with a “roughly 15-inch display.” The device is designed to be either mounted on the wall or placed on a stand and would serve all the usual Echo functions, as well as acting as a control panel for smart home devices. It’s also reportedly going to be kitchen-friendly — for watching recipes or Netflix while you cook. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TKvhTA"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Alexa-powered soundbars:&lt;/strong&gt; Amazon has reportedly been working on an Alexa-equipped soundbar with an integrated camera, designed to make video calls easier in the home, as with Facebook’s Portal devices. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5JE7KF"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Second-generation Echo Auto&lt;/strong&gt;. Not many details here, but &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; says an updated Echo Auto “will have a new design and may be able to charge a user’s device with inductive technology.” We were not fans of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/6/20754404/amazon-echo-auto-review-alexa-car-price-specs-features"&gt;original Echo Auto&lt;/a&gt;, which was a better Bluetooth adapter and speakerphone than it was an actual navigation tool. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LEBbzQ"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Echo robot woes: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/23/17270002/amazon-robot-home-alexa-echo"&gt;first to report&lt;/a&gt; that Amazon was working on a mobile Echo device with a display that is supposed to follow users around the home. But it seems the product’s future is in jeopardy. “The robot has drawn concerns over its viability from staff,” says &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. A report earlier this year from &lt;em&gt;Insider &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22322813/amazon-home-robot-vesta-alexa-project-rumors-specs-report"&gt;noted similar issues&lt;/a&gt;. “People are very skeptical — we’re worried it could turn into another Fire Phone,” said one source. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yBb7N8"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Karaoke with Alexa:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m including this one, but it unfortunately seems like it’s not a goer. “The company has explored building an Alexa-powered karaoke microphone codenamed Jackson and planned to release the device this year. But the team working on that product has been disbanded,” said &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. For shame.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="biZFN5"&gt;As ever with rumors like these, any or all of these products could fail to make it out the door, but &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s rumor roundup certainly seems plausible, not least because of Amazon’s eclectic approach to new products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2YBSeX"&gt;Remember that the company sells not only its mainstream Echo and Echo Dot devices, but also various Echo Show units (with screens), the Echo Studio (better sound), the Echo Spot (an alarm clock), and oddities like the Ring Always Home Cam — a security drone that flies around your house (though this has yet to be released after it was announced last year). A soundbar or larger screen sound quite tepid by comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The M1 MacBook Air is $150 off at multiple retailers right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Laptops 2020: Apple MacBook Air" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YRKwSIANGg4EOrY4-BVQokTLpIg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69902495/vpavic_4291_20201113_0411.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The M1 MacBook Air, our current pick for the best laptop, is on sale for its best price to date.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o7xXOT"&gt;There’s no shortage of accolades for the latest MacBook Air with its vaunted M1 CPU. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;Our review&lt;/a&gt; last November simply stated that “the new MacBook Air with Apple’s M1 chip is a triumph.” And right now, both the 256GB and 512GB configurations are available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08N5LNQCX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfD0FhN1THh#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $150 off, their largest discount to date. This version of the MacBook Air marks some of the most profound improvements to Apple’s hardware architecture and specs. Whisper-quiet operation, a faster processor, and extensive battery life make the 2020 Air the perfect travel companion, even for Windows die-hards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D0lZEN"&gt;This deal must be popular, as most configurations are backordered until mid-October currently. Some are available sooner; make sure to check both retailers before you buy the one you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7PeD9C"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wCuDBq"&gt;If you’re a mobile gamer, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21285073/razer-kishi-review-game-controller-phone-price-nintendo-switch-stadia" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer Kishi&lt;/a&gt; is a must-own accessory. This snappy Android controller is currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Kishi-Controller-Android-Passthrough-Thumbsticks/dp/B086X8DHN2/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Amazon for $55&lt;/a&gt; — down from $70 — and is a great way to elevate your mobile gaming experience, especially if you subscribe to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. The controller expands to snugly fit around your phone, providing you with a more traditional and comfortable control scheme. Besides freeing up screen space that would otherwise be occupied by your thumbs, the dual analog sticks allow for far more precise control. Understandably, the Razer Kishi isn’t compatible with all devices and will have difficulty accommodating phones with bulky cases, so make sure to consult the &lt;a href="https://mysupport.razer.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/4097/~/which-smartphones-are-supported-by-the-razer-kishi%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;official list at Razer&lt;/a&gt; for more information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ug9B0O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10228224"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i847H3"&gt;The high-end gaming laptops manufactured by the industry veterans at Alienware have never been considered by anyone to be cheap. However, right now, you can &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfDXfMBxEsZ#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;save a cool $200 on the Alienware M15 R4&lt;/a&gt;, bringing it down to $1,900. This 15-inch version of the latest Alienware laptop comes equipped with an RTX 3070, as well as a 10th Gen Core i7 processor. It also comes packed with 16GB RAM and a 512GB SSD. The 1080p display features a 300Hz refresh rate, too, allowing you to get the most out of this performance powerhouse. The M15 R4 even has a Thunderbolt 3 port, allowing you to dock it and use it as a de-facto desktop or just transfer data very quickly through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="adyhPQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best gaming laptops of 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="zhclBi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10769311"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pvVvHy"&gt;Anyone looking to up their monitor game should pay attention to this deal on the Dell U2720Q, which is &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeWOYDBrandonWidder052821/https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-ultrasharp-27-4k-usb-c-monitor-u2720q/apd/210-avjv/monitors-monitor-accessories" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for a limited time at Dell for just $540&lt;/a&gt;. This 4K monitor has received &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/dell-ultrasharp-27-4k-usb-c-monitor-u2720q" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;accolades from &lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-27-inch-monitor/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wirecutter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, to name a few, and is a favorite among some &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;staffers for good reason. The bright, 27-inch IPS panel features HDMI and DisplayPort inputs, a swiveling stand, and USB-C connectivity, meaning it plays well with laptops. If you’re tired of squinting at your laptop screen, this monitor is a great way to scale up your home office setup. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="iwjgAf"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/1/16587340/roku-streaming-stick-plus-2017-4k-hdr-review-price-relase" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Roku Streaming Stick Plus&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most convenient ways to access all of your favorite shows and channels — and one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21375098/best-streaming-device" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best streaming devices&lt;/a&gt; you can own, in general. No larger than a pack of gum, the 4K streaming device offers quick performance and support for Dolby Atmos, HDR, and AirPlay 2, the latter of which gives you a quick way to wirelessly cast content from a variety of Apple devices.

    <title>How to buy the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone 13" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rKF7xFC4hTYRm-7tz1b73WWCeWk=/0x0:1959x1306/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69857848/iphone13mini.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of the colors of the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini.&lt;/em&gt; | Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YIBU9V"&gt;Apple announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;a fleet of new products at its “California Streaming” event&lt;/a&gt;. Chief among them — you guessed it — was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22430843"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;. This one is coming in various sizes and colors, but with smaller notches, the new A15 Bionic chipset, and with redesigned and improved cameras located around the back. Going from smallest to largest, Apple will soon release the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22430843"&gt;iPhone 13 Mini&lt;/a&gt;, iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro, and finally the iPhone 13 Pro Max. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666884/iphone-13-pro-max-specs-price-release-date-cameras"&gt;With the Pro and Pro Max&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll be able to get the first iPhone to ship with 1TB of storage, along with 120Hz refresh rate displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1YGEt"&gt;If you’re looking forward to ordering any of the four iPhone 13 models, the good news is you no longer need to preorder and wait around. If you haven’t already ordered one, there’s a good chance you pick one up from your local Apple store, or from your carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oIozlV"&gt;If you’re curious about all of the options and how much it’ll all cost, we’ve listed all of that info below for buying unlocked. All of the carrier-specific promos, including trade-in deals, are listed at the bottom of the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="h7zyyJ"&gt;How to buy the iPhone 13 Mini&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7E96Ug"&gt;The iPhone 13 Mini is the 2021 iteration on the Mini phone form factor with a 5.4-inch OLED screen. Apple says that this newer version should get better battery life than the previous model. Battery life was one of the few disappointments in the iPhone 12 Mini, so it’s good that Apple seems to have made improvements here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ytXyfk"&gt;Apple sells the iPhone 13 Mini starting with &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB of storage for $729&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll be able to opt for more storage with the &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB&lt;/a&gt; versions for $829 or $1,029, respectively. If you purchase through a carrier via Apple’s site, the starting price of each configuration drops $30, starting at $699. If you want to trade in your phone, &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Ftrade-in" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;check for its value right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nPdN53"&gt;How to order the iPhone 13&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="DVnDHN"&gt;Apple’s new iPhone 13 has a 6.1-inch OLED display, the same size as last year’s model. Like other models this year, Apple upgraded the internal chipset to the A15 Bionic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8NHlw2"&gt;Buying them unlocked will cost you $30 more than buying through a carrier, &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starting at $829 for the 128GB version&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$929 for the 256GB version&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,129 for the 512GB version&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CGvHEm"&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Ftrade-in" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;find out your phone’s value at Apple&lt;/a&gt;, if you want to trade it in for credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BaJlBq"&gt;How to buy the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eBv8ru"&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max are the biggest and most capable models coming out of Apple in 2021. The iPhone 13 Pro has a 6.1-inch OLED display with an A15 Bionic chipset, while the Pro Max has a bigger 6.7-inch OLED. Both support up to 120Hz refresh rate, which is an improvement that’s long been anticipated. However, you’ll also pay a lot more for this model than the base iPhone 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fAUxcl"&gt;At Apple, the &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB version&lt;/a&gt; of the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max models start at $999 and $1,099, respectively. The &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB iPhone 13 Pro&lt;/a&gt; will run you $1,099, while the &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pro Max&lt;/a&gt; will cost $1,199. The &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB configuration&lt;/a&gt; of either model will also cost an extra $200, with the &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB iPhone 13 Pro&lt;/a&gt; retailing for $1,499 and the &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pro Max&lt;/a&gt; retailing for $1,599. Unlike the iPhone 13 Mini and standard iPhone 13, there’s no $30 price difference if you choose to purchase the Pro line unlocked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FHpfYv"&gt;As mentioned before, &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/974136/7613?subId1=VergeiPhone13091621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Ftrade-in" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s site can tell you how much your current phone is worth&lt;/a&gt;, if you want to trade it in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wmtN87"&gt;iPhone 13 lineup carrier deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3Jzmr1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verizon carrier deal:&lt;/strong&gt; Current and new Verizon users can save on any of the iPhone 13 models with a trade-in if you’re on certain unlimited plans, billed back to you in monthly credits over the course of 24 or 30 months. New customers can get an additional $500 worth in credits by switching carriers to Verizon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O74PqP"&gt;How much you’ll get in trade-in credit varies depending on the phone you want, with up to $1,000 back in billing credits if you buy the iPhone 13 Pro Max and have an unlimited plan. If you’re after the 128GB iPhone 13 Pro that usually costs $999, trading in select phones can make it free after you’ve received billing credits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n71NlO"&gt;If you want the iPhone 13, Verizon will offer those on an unlimited plan up to $800 for a trade-in, and you’ll get reimbursed via billing credits. For an iPhone 13 Mini, trade in values cap at $700.  &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeiPhone13091621/https://www.verizon.com/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visit Verizon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iKEbcd"&gt;According to a Verizon spokesperson, these are the phones that will get the most amount of trade-in value (though the carrier will accept most phones in any condition, but battery damage is a deal-breaker): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="vp61Ou"&gt;iPhone 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max, iPhone 12 Pro, 12 Pro Max&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="R3SAWq"&gt;These are the mid-tier devices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="xce8xP"&gt;Apple: iPhone X and up &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="u4VbAe"&gt;Samsung: GS9 and Note 9 and up &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OSmNtc"&gt;Google: Pixel 4A and up &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Lcmacj"&gt;Kyocera: DuraForce Ultra &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5PQFGX"&gt;LG: V50 ThinQ and up &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3IkQLY"&gt;Motorola: Moto One 5G, RAZR, Edge Plus &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FgPHff"&gt;Nokia: 8 V 5G &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="a1j0LX"&gt;OnePlus: 7 and up &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UxtFME"&gt;Sony: Xperia 1 and up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="jp0kUn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T-Mobile carrier deal:&lt;/strong&gt; New and existing T-Mobile users can get up to $800 in trade-in credit toward an iPhone 13 series phone. This deal is available for customers on the Max plan, and you’ll get the credit paid back to you in 30 monthly bill credits. T-Mobile’s “Forever Upgrade” initiative will let Max plan holders get up to $800 in trade-in credit for future trade-ins, including this one. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-iphone-deals%2Fupgrade-benefits&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22665165%2Fapple-iphone-13-preorder-how-to-buy-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visit T-Mobile.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nQiuJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AT&amp;amp;T carrier deal:&lt;/strong&gt; New and current AT&amp;amp;T subscribers on an unlimited plan who trade in a phone, then purchase an iPhone 13 series phone on an installment plan can get a good deal after all of the billing credits have come in. You can get up to $1,000 in billing credits if you trade in a phone that’s worth $180 or higher, making the iPhone 13 Pro Max a better deal. &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeiPhone13091621/https://www.att.com/buy/phones/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-128gb-silver.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visit AT&amp;amp;T.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Someone is using old Jawbone patents to sue Apple and Google</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Jawbone Up hands-on pictures (2012)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MbFw6EXUFgunBve-hce0e2rfupA=/4x0:1021x678/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69902309/DSC_3053-hero.1353975716.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jawbone is best known for its fitness trackers, but the recent lawsuits focus on noise-isolation tech used in its earphones.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IaIozz"&gt;Wearables company Jawbone is long-dead — it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/6/15931080/jawbone-going-out-of-business-report"&gt;went out of business&lt;/a&gt; in 2017 — but its patents live on, and someone is using them to sue Apple and Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XU1dh5"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-23/jawbone-ghost-rises-to-sue-google-apple-over-ear-pods-phones?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;first reported&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt;, an entity named Jawbone Innovations LLC filed lawsuits against the two tech giants this week in federal court in Waco, Texas. The suits allege that Apple and Google infringed eight patents previously belonging to Jawbone and focused around noise-isolation algorithms originally developed for DARPA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z8Q2uT"&gt;The suit against Apple names the infringing devices as “all versions and variants of Apple iPhone, iPad, AirPods Pro, and HomePod products,” while the suit against Google is similarly broad, naming “all versions and variants of Google smartphones [...] tablets and/or notebooks [...], earbuds [...] smart home devices [...] and other Android Devices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fepgoo"&gt;Both suits demand a preliminary injunction against the companies to stop them from selling the allegedly infringing products, and future royalties for the use of these patents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="E9JK7f"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Who is behind the lawsuits is unclear&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qEeawd"&gt;If all this seems like a little bit of legal skulduggery, well, who are we to disagree. As &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes, exactly who or what is behind the lawsuits is unclear, but it’s not the first time Jawbone Innovations LLC has made such claims. The same entity — which does not appear to be contiguous in any meaningful way with the original Jawbone, apart from owning the latter’s intellectual property — &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/jawbone-samsung-patent-infringement-lawsuit"&gt;sued Samsung&lt;/a&gt; in June for similar infringements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="epE8Rd"&gt;And, as &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/jawbone-samsung-patent-infringement-lawsuit"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; in its reporting of that case, the manager of Jawbone Innovations LLC, one &lt;a href="https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_tx/0803920236"&gt;York Eggleston&lt;/a&gt;, also seems to have prior form, with an individual of that name also managing other LLCs that were &lt;a href="https://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/patent/968064/additional-former-ibm-patents-move-from-daedalus-to-another-npe"&gt;assigned old IBM patents&lt;/a&gt; before suing Lyft and Uber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DIxmUO"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;notes, filing such lawsuits in Waco, Texas makes sense, as it’s “a district that’s the most popular in the nation for its patent-friendly judge and juries.” Though even the patent-friendly might reject these particular claims. A spokesperson for Google told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg: “&lt;/em&gt;We dispute the claims, and will defend ourselves vigorously.” We’ve reached out to Apple for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KVKAQu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA: Update your new iPhones and iPads to avoid Apple Music bug</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YFhpQs54LkPY18tEIBEcAT9nbDc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69902301/acastro_180927_1777_apple_music_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dwikbh"&gt;If you’re an Apple Music user and recently bought a new iPhone 13 model, new ninth-generation iPad, or a sixth-generation iPad Mini, there’s an important update to download to avoid an annoying bug. A new &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212822"&gt;Apple support document&lt;/a&gt; says a bug affecting those devices restored from a backup can prevent users from accessing the Apple Music catalog, Apple Music settings, or using the services’s Sync Library feature. My colleague Chris Welch reports that he ran into this bug on iOS 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DYGNZS"&gt;Thankfully, the fix is very simple, according to Apple. Just head into the “General” section of the “Settings” app, select the “Software Update” option and hit “Install Now,” to get the update. &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/23/apple-music-backup-restore-bug/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that its release notes don’t explicitly mention the Apple Music bug, but this is presumably the update Apple’s support page is referencing. Apple says applying the update should resolve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to get the free Windows 11 upgrade early</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kuexuS3tdILel6QsbPxWyf94V2c=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69902174/Hero_Bloom_Logo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qc41qW"&gt;After months of testing, Microsoft is releasing the final version of Windows 11 to its Release Preview channel today. It’s the final step before it’s released more broadly to existing devices on October 5th. If you don’t want to wait until October 5th, you can switch to the Release Preview in Windows 10 today and get the free Windows 11 upgrade early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="seL7Yf"&gt;Here’s how to upgrade to Windows 11 early:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="tki1pi"&gt;Check to see if your PC is compatible with Windows 11, using Microsoft’s PC Health App (&lt;a href="https://aka.ms/GetPCHealthCheckApp"&gt;download here&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="d07Te4"&gt;If your PC is supported, you’ll need to register as a &lt;a href="https://insider.windows.com/en-us/getting-started"&gt;Windows Insider over at Microsoft’s site&lt;/a&gt; to get the Windows 11 upgrade early.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TtonC8"&gt;On your existing Windows 10 PC, head into Settings &amp;gt; Update &amp;amp; Security &amp;gt; Windows Insider Program&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QFowqgwCK6TNPmHcRdoTsorn4oE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22872725/M4GiWlG.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Windows Insider section in Windows 10.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="hnsMCq"&gt;Click the Get Started button and link the Microsoft account you used to sign up to be a Windows Insider.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bpcvQT"&gt;When prompted to pick your Insider settings, select the Release Preview ring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="i02slx"&gt;Confirm and agree to Microsoft’s terms, and then reboot your PC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UdTF9I"&gt;Head back into Settings &amp;gt; Update &amp;amp; Security, and you should see a new banner with the optional update to Windows 11.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mOHqA3"&gt;Click the download and install option and follow the prompts to get Windows 11 early.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qJUgOTVRh6o3NBHKXGFsg01pWrY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22872727/Lori_Gamblin_0_1630372025525.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Windows 11 upgrade prompt for Release Preview Insiders.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jPzYFU"&gt;Once you’ve successfully upgraded to Windows 11, you can then head into Settings &amp;gt; Windows Update and select “Stop getting preview builds” to unenroll from the preview updates for Windows 11 and remain on the final version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="41Rd9T"&gt;Microsoft has also released ISO files for the final version of Windows 11, build 22000.194. You can download the ISO file, which will allow you to clean install Windows 11, from &lt;a href="https://aka.ms/wipISO"&gt;Microsoft’s Windows Insider website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use Microsoft Edge’s new tab groups feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C0xDimtgkadMkv379Z9IWqXp1QE=/0x0:1145x763/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69902110/msedge_tzPx016ucL.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tab groups can be given a name and an identifying color.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qYr9cj"&gt;Microsoft Edge’s new tab grouping feature arrived this month with &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/microsoft-edge-relnote-stable-channel"&gt;version 93 of the browser&lt;/a&gt;. It was &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/09/23/our-top-new-features-are-designed-to-put-your-family-first/"&gt;officially detailed&lt;/a&gt; alongside a grab bag of new tools for September, which include new shopping and vacation planning options. Tab groups have existed in Edge for a few months as an optional feature you could manually enable in the browser’s settings, but now they’re rolling out to all users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="va2ZSb"&gt;To use the tab grouping feature, hold down Ctrl and left click all the tabs you want to group together, then right click and select “Add tabs to new group.” Tab groups can be given names and distinct colors for easy identification, and minimized to reduce clutter.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GVqJEP1f_tHTBMZQ8muqrBZZ9gw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22874572/W11_Edge_TabGroup_16x9_en_US.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grouped tabs can be minimized to reduce clutter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4BmrWo"&gt;Tab groups are handy for keeping your work and personal tabs separate, for example, or to easily distinguish the tabs you’re currently working on from the rest. Microsoft Edge is the latest browser to add support for tab groups, which are already available in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/13/21257446/google-chome-tab-grouping-feature"&gt;Google Chrome&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686070/apple-macos-safari-tab-groups-redesign-change-back"&gt;Safari&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mI63bn"&gt;As well as tab groups, Microsoft is highlighting a couple of other features new to Edge this month. These include a product reviews dropdown that can display reviews and customer ratings for products while you browse for them, and a new express checkout option that can automatically enter your payment details and try coupon codes. Edge will also offer travel advice when it spots that you’re booking flights to select locations in the US, and it’ll remember your previously-entered flight preferences as you hop between different booking sites. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox gets a new Edge browser that can play Stadia games, access Discord, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3XBirsRqNnTCa9XnPB67EvPdoSw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69901977/acastro_190530_1777_xbox_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fYXloA"&gt;Microsoft is rolling out a new Xbox dashboard that includes an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22359838/microsoft-xbox-new-edge-browser-stadia-discord-support-features"&gt;updated version of the Edge browser&lt;/a&gt;. After six months of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22318050/microsoft-edge-xbox-chromium-browser-testing"&gt;testing&lt;/a&gt;, the Chromium version of Edge is now available to all existing Xbox One and Xbox Series S / X consoles, and the new capabilities allow Xbox owners to stream Google Stadia games, access Discord on the web, and lots more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vWO0Wz"&gt;The Xbox version of Edge looks almost identical to the version available on PC or Mac. It even includes features like vertical tabs and Collections. Like Edge on PC and mobile, the Xbox version also syncs all your settings, favorites, tabs, and web history. The only feature it’s really missing is extensions, and the ability to switch into developer mode to alter User Agent strings or access a console.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/txuhj8xX0w1InqAN3lWUQlnpFk0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22410205/Xbox_Series_X___Xbox_Series_X_2021_03_31_11_23_32.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Edge browser on Xbox.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Bi2Tmu"&gt;Edge also supports mouse and keyboard, so you can access things like Word or Excel online, or even Google Stadia games via keyboard and mouse or the Xbox controller. While Xbox doesn’t have a Discord app yet, you can access the web version with this new version of Edge. Discord will let you join voice calls and participate in text channel chats, but microphone support isn’t available, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3JAAYh"&gt;This new Edge browser is a big improvement over what existed on Xbox before, and you can even use it to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403429/microsoft-xbox-steam-games-edge-browser-mouse-keyboard-support"&gt;access Steam PC games&lt;/a&gt; or web games like &lt;a href="https://krunker.io/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Krunker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.quakejs.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quake JS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Nvidia is still, bizarrely, blocking access to its GeForce Now streaming service through Edge. We’ve asked Nvidia multiple times why it continues to block Edge in general, but the company only said in April that it’s simply “investigating Edge browser support for the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jxhE7c"&gt;The new Microsoft Edge browser for Xbox is &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/09/23/september-2021-xbox-update/"&gt;available to all Xbox consoles today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s rumored MacBook Pros could get higher resolution screens, according to beta leak</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/40xb5PsG1u-8jRMbXPaKh99SQPI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69901962/akramer_201113_4290_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s 2021 MacBook Pro with an M1 chip.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Alexander Kramer for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hwGEpi"&gt;The latest macOS Monterey beta contains clues about the resolution of Apple’s rumored 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/23/macbook-pro-2021-resolutions/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The seventh beta of the upcoming operating system contains references to “3456 x 2234 Retina” and “3024 x 1964 Retina,” which are two resolutions not supported in any of Apple’s current Macs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxCILs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; theorizes that the two new resolutions correspond to Apple’s much rumored 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros, which are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;widely expected to launch this year&lt;/a&gt; with new designs and a new Arm-based Apple processor called the M1X. For reference, the current 16-inch MacBook Pro has a resolution of 3072 x 1920, while the current 13-inch MacBook Pro’s display sits at 2560 x 1600. If the new resolutions are accurate, both laptops should see an increase in pixel density as well as screen resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8vPIvM"&gt;As well as the improved screen resolutions, both laptops are rumored to feature a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;revived magnetic MagSafe laptop charger&lt;/a&gt; and the return of useful &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-18/apple-readies-macbook-pro-macbook-air-revamps-with-faster-chips?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;ports like an SD card slot and HDMI&lt;/a&gt;. The widely disliked OLED Touch Bar is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;reportedly on the way out&lt;/a&gt;. The new laptops are expected to be announced at an Apple event this year, although an exact date is yet to be made public. &lt;/p&gt;
