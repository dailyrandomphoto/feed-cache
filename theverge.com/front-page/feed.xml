    <title>ESPN Plus is getting its second price hike of 2021 </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Disney Plus ESPN Plus Hulu bundle" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pdBrJqiEvkQnOePHxnYYjONej7c=/0x27:1396x958/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69573508/disney_plus.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RiSPvS"&gt;ESPN Plus monthly and annual subscription costs will go up beginning August 13th, the second price increase for the service in 2021. The new price hike has made the service’s annual plan increase by about $20 this year alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RgBBD2"&gt;A spokesperson for ESPN Plus confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the service will hike from $6 to $7, while the annual cost will jump from $60 to $70. Notably, there will be no price increase to the Disney bundle, which costs $13 and includes sister services Disney+ and Hulu. There will also be no change in the cost of UFC pay-per-view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="13dflw"&gt;Disney Plus and ESPN Plus have both gotten price increases in 2021. The sports streaming service’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/30/22207151/espn-plus-annual-subscription-price-hike-disney-ufc"&gt;annual subscription cost increased&lt;/a&gt; to $60 per year from $50 in January. The company attributed the most recent price increase to increased value to consumers, specifically citing its live sports coverage, original programming, and expanded editorial analysis from industry experts. The service reported having nearly 14 million subscribers as of April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t5Hyy8"&gt;Disney’s marquee streaming service, meanwhile, also got a little pricier in 2021. In March, Disney Plus increased to $8 per month or $80 annually, arguably still a fantastic value for the quality of content being produced and certainly accounting for the fact that Disney’s new releases typically arrive on the service at no additional cost a few months after their Premier Access debuts. &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;, for example, will be free to stream on the service beginning October 6th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google shares transition plans for unified desktop file syncing Drive app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T0ywiaJyQPHnVKXb4ekdOMBKg_M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69573184/acastro_180427_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xxV1mf"&gt;Google announced its plans to transition users of its consumer file syncing desktop service, Backup and Sync, onto &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/drive/drive-for-desktop/"&gt;a new unified app&lt;/a&gt; that both consumers and business clients can use called Drive for desktop. Google plans to start &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/07/google-drive-backup-and-sync-transition.html"&gt;onboarding users next week on July 19th, 2021&lt;/a&gt;, and encourages people who used Backup and Sync to make the switch by the end of September, before getting locked out on October 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1LcKT3"&gt;Backup and Sync users will have to transition to the new app (&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleone/answer/10309431#zippy=%2Csee-the-full-list-of-features%2Cwhy-are-you-making-this-change%2Ci-use-drive-file-stream-how-will-this-affect-me%2Ci-am-a-workspace-admin-and-my-organization-uses-drive-file-stream-im-concerned-about-these-new-features-what-can-i-do"&gt;a renamed version&lt;/a&gt; of Google’s enterprise file syncing software), but business clients who are already using Drive File Stream (aka Drive for desktop) should be good to go, Google says. The goal with consolidating the apps, Google says, is to create “a powerful and unified sync client” with the best features from both consumer and enterprise services that should be more straightforward to use and easier for IT teams to manage. Notably, it’s also a reversal of Google’s confusing decision to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/7/16267624/google-drive-desktop-app-shutdown"&gt;split up Google Drive on desktop&lt;/a&gt; into two apps in 2017.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UWxHSx37nP4tZcFbWkoEKDPlIR0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22713290/image1_iF7NAcN.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s new Drive for desktop client&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dokMkN"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/drive/drive-for-desktop/"&gt;Google’s blog post&lt;/a&gt; explaining the desktop Drive client, the app should be pretty familiar to anyone who used Google’s previous services. Drive will offer easy access to files and photos stored in the cloud, and sync whatever files you choose in the background so they’re always up to date. Google says the app can sync external storage devices like flash drives to Drive, mirror files between Drive and local files on your desktop computer, and let you choose whether you store individual photos and videos in Drive or Google Photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dqPSHb"&gt;Google will begin transitioning users of Backup and Sync next Monday, July 19th. Here’s the following transition timeline for users, from Google:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="BqNeD8"&gt;July 19th, 2021: Backup and Sync will support a guided flow to help users transition on to Drive for desktop&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6BSTf2"&gt;August 18th, 2021: Any users still on Backup and Sync will start to receive in-product notifications prompting them to transition to Drive for desktop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PIR1uV"&gt;October 1st, 2021:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Any users still on Backup and Sync after that point will no longer be able to sign in to Backup and Sync. To continue syncing with Drive and/or Google Photos, users will need to transition to Drive for desktop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="TZPcJ2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0OaYSF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon’s new filter blocks spoofed phone numbers that are too close to yours</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zmeq82VnnfNfhyIc8T3ld_6wExA=/98x0:1133x690/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69572851/Call_Filter_Hero_image_0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verizon rolls out new Neighborhood Filter tool to help curb spoofed calls.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Verizon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PDSTGH"&gt;Verizon wants to help curb those obnoxious “spoofing” calls from similar area codes to your own with a new tool called Neighborhood Filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LtWjZ6"&gt;Spoofing is the method used by spammers to make a number appear similar to your own so you’re more likely to answer the call. Verizon’s new Neighborhood Filter will allow Verizon customers to send these calls directly to voicemail, as well as any other prefix and area code combinations that the company thinks might be suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OOjJ2x"&gt;The tool is available to Call Filter Free and Call Filter Plus customers through the company’s separate &lt;a href="https://myvpostpay.verizon.com/ui/acct/secure/productApps/downloads/sfo120005"&gt;Call Filter&lt;/a&gt; app. Call Filter Free costs nothing to enroll and offers basic filtering from those dreaded and persistent spam calls. Call Filter Plus, which costs an additional $3 per month per line (or $8 per month for three or more lines), comes with additional tools like access to a database of over 100 million spam numbers, a personal block list, and a spam risk meter for real-time call assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eFCXkL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The tool should help make spam calls a little less painful&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qk1jOD"&gt;To activate the Neighborhood Filter for blocking spoofed calls, head to the Call Filter app on your mobile device. (If you’re on iOS, you’ll need to toggle on filtering from your Call Blocking and Identification in your Phone settings.) From the lower navigation menu on the main screen in the app, select Management. From this menu, select Other Filters. Here, you should see the Neighborhood Filter, which will prompt you to enter a six-digit prefix and area code similar to your number. Make sure to toggle it on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wwHfDi"&gt;Verizon launched a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/28/18285643/verizon-spam-calls-robocalls-blocking-identifying-service"&gt;free version&lt;/a&gt; of its call filtering tool in 2019. Prior to that, it charged $3 per month for its call filtering tools, even while those services were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/30/15906800/verizon-anti-spam-robocall-call-blocking-att-t-mobile"&gt;available for free&lt;/a&gt; through some of its competitors T-Mobile and AT&amp;amp;T. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wWFAlX"&gt;From your Spam Filter settings in the Call Filter app — whether you’re paying for it or not — you’ll be able to determine how you want spam calls to be filtered. Blocked calls can either be terminated or sent to voicemail based on your selection. This menu will also let you determine how you want calls flagged based on a perceived level of risk. The Call Filter &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/solutions-and-services/call-filter/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;app is available&lt;/a&gt; both on iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Secretly throttling is never okay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The whole camera system on the OnePlus 9 Pro is solid, but has room to improve" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Oqj0MakQBtEkdeVeOgoGtaFWenI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69572807/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0053_Edit_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wBrVTC"&gt;Last Tuesday, &lt;em&gt;AnandTech&lt;/em&gt; caught OnePlus doing the previously unthinkable — throttling the performance of its new flagship smartphone, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. Seeing “inexplicable” slowdown, &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16794/oneplus-9-performance-examination/"&gt;the publication discovered&lt;/a&gt; the phone was diverting a laundry list of popular apps &lt;em&gt;away&lt;/em&gt; from its Snapdragon 888’s high-performance cores. The company’s excuse? &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22568107/oneplus-9-pro-battery-life-app-throttling-benchmarks"&gt;It was all an attempt to save battery life&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ORRG0g"&gt;Today, OnePlus is doubling down on that earlier statement &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/insight-into-oneplus-9-series-processor-and-app-optimization.1467338/"&gt;with a longer forum post&lt;/a&gt;, where the company’s argument sounds downright reasonable. “In recent years, the performance of smartphone SoCs has reached a point where their power is often overkill in certain scenarios,” writes OnePlus, blaming Qualcomm for essentially being &lt;em&gt;too good at its job&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CuAIgh"&gt;“With this in mind, our team has shifted its attention from simply providing sheer performance to providing the performance you expect from our devices while reducing power consumption and heat dissipation,” adds OnePlus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aNk5S7"&gt;That sounds good! Now, here are three problems with that seemingly cogent argument:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4PMaSz"&gt;First, OnePlus has sold devices based on raw speed for years now, and despite the OnePlus 9 Pro’s focus on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22340406/oneplus-9-phone-price-release-date-availability"&gt;Hasselblad-branded cameras&lt;/a&gt;, it’s no exception. The company’s entire tagline is “Never Settle,” and the company promised a “flawlessly ‘Fast and Smooth’ experience” from the OnePlus 9 Pro. “You’ll be one step ahead of the curve,” the company assured users during its launch presentation, calling the phone’s Snapdragon 888 “the best there is of all the dragons in the kingdom.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IC6-rrkCrnPY-qasvzsjznDRshQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22713252/oneplus_888.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro promises “ultimate performance” from its new Snapdragon chip.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ktjxPR"&gt;Second, if &lt;em&gt;AnandTech&lt;/em&gt; is right, you do appear to be settling here. The publication found the phone less responsive than a Galaxy S21 Ultra in side by side tests, despite having worse battery life, even though both use the same chips and same screen technology. The slowdown “applies to pretty much everything that has any level of popularity in the Play Store,” too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PhN03b"&gt;Third and most importantly, OnePlus &lt;em&gt;didn’t tell anyone. &lt;/em&gt;And now, the company’s trying to make it sound like the practice of secretly throttling a device could somehow ever be okay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="meuPOl"&gt;This is a dangerous idea. If we establish that a phonemaker can quietly throttle on a user’s behalf, what’s to keep them from doing that whenever they like? For years, conspiracy theories have swirled about how gadget makers slow down or otherwise cripple devices to force their users to upgrade, and many of them were dismissed as just that — conspiracy theories — until it was revealed that Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/28/16827248/apple-iphone-battery-replacement-price-slow-down-apology"&gt;actually did something of the sort&lt;/a&gt; in 2017. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uUVfRp"&gt;Back then, Apple also had a good excuse about how its throttling was saving your phone’s battery, but it didn’t change the fact that the company hid it from users, causing an unknown number of them to upgrade their phones earlier than they might have needed to. The company settled twice (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161271/apple-settlement-500-million-throttling-batterygate-class-action-lawsuit"&gt;once for $500 million&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573710/apple-battery-gate-throttle-iphones-settlement-amount"&gt;once for $113 million&lt;/a&gt;) and added the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/7/16984234/how-to-iphone-throttling-ios-11-3"&gt;turn off throttling&lt;/a&gt;, but Apple still largely normalized the idea that its actions were okay, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/31/18047174/iphone-x-8-plus-performance-throttling-battery-management-ios-12-1-update"&gt;brought the controversial processor throttling feature to later phones&lt;/a&gt; as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3p1zFV"&gt;When OnePlus realized that it wanted to shift its focus away from “simply providing sheer performance,” the time to tell us would have been on stage, before people purchased the phone, and it should have been packaged as a feature that you can turn on and off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vo1rHt"&gt;That’s the kind of relationship the company’s power-user fans expect to have with OnePlus. That’s the brand OnePlus built. Now, it’s at risk of erosion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XWjTA5"&gt;Let’s not pretend this is normal or acceptable for OnePlus, or any other manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Galaxy Z Fold 3 will support the S Pen Pro, according to FCC filings</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NBcIorRIvoOCJq93AWxdQ-MK6HE=/400x0:4720x2880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69572527/Screen_Shot_2021_07_12_at_11.56.01_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s S Pen and S Pen Pro.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Dj1Cqq"&gt;After many teases, it seems as if a Samsung foldable is finally going to get support for an S Pen stylus. &lt;a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&amp;amp;RequestTimeout=500&amp;amp;calledFromFrame=N&amp;amp;application_id=PQFsmd5Fd6mroqLRXdITpA%3D%3D&amp;amp;fcc_id=A3LEJP5450"&gt;FCC filings for the S Pen Pro&lt;/a&gt;, a bigger version of the S Pen with Bluetooth connectivity that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22226594/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-s-pen-stylus-support-price-unpacked-event"&gt;Samsung announced in January&lt;/a&gt;, have been made public, and &lt;a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/eas/GetApplicationAttachment.html?id=5331981"&gt;one document (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; reveals that the upcoming stylus will work with the unannounced Galaxy Z Fold 3 (which is presumably the next device in the Z Fold lineup). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfEzjv"&gt;And it’s not just the Z Fold 3 — the stylus, which doesn’t have a release date but is set to hit this year, will apparently support the S21 Ultra, the Note 20 lineup, and more. You can see the full list of devices that the S Pen Pro will support in this image from the filing:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ou0zA8U1fDyJWAS7ubIY3cv4br4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22713180/Screen_Shot_2021_07_12_at_12.09.13_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://apps.fcc.gov/eas/GetApplicationAttachment.html?id=5331981" target="_blank"&gt;FCC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The list of devices the S Pen Pro will support.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8fgNuC"&gt;The S Pen Pro’s support for the Z Fold 3 isn’t a major surprise — the company has been hinting toward some sort of S Pen support for the foldable for some time. During last year’s Unpacked event, Samsung’s president of mobile TM Roh said in a Q&amp;amp;A that the company has been “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22231677/samsung-s-pen-foldable-support-additional-device-categories"&gt;happy to hear&lt;/a&gt;” that people want the S Pen to work with the Fold. In a December blog, he said that the company was looking to bring some of the Galaxy Note’s “most well-loved features” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22175769/samsung-stylus-galaxy-phones-s21-foldable"&gt;to other devices&lt;/a&gt; — which seems likely to be a wink toward stylus support, one of the hallmarks of the Note line. And in January, Roh was even more explicit, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22231677/samsung-s-pen-foldable-support-additional-device-categories"&gt;saying that&lt;/a&gt; the company plans to “expand the S Pen experience across additional device categories in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kiKSNl"&gt;A detailed leak has already shown the unannounced phone with a stylus: a render shared by noted leaker Evan Blass depicts &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549038/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-leak-image-foldable"&gt;what appears to be the Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt; with a new “Fold Edition” S Pen propped up next to it. Perhaps the Z Fold 3 will come with the Fold Edition stylus in the box while the S Pen Pro will be sold separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxbKF5"&gt;FCC documents becoming public can indicate that a product may be announced soon after they are published. In this case, an official announcement for the S Pen sometime soon would make sense, as Samsung has held summer Unpacked events in early August for the past few years. Blass has also already stated that this year’s event is scheduled for August 11th, alongside revealing a bunch of other devices that are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572858/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2021-leak-evan-blass-galaxy-z-fold-flip-3-s21-fe-watch-4-buds-2-date"&gt;expected to be revealed at the show&lt;/a&gt;, including the Z Fold 3, the Z Flip 3, two new Galaxy Watches, and new Galaxy Buds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6pbj0l"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks for the tip, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/smartvenkat95/status/1414632885521321986"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Venkatesh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Black players on England football team bombarded with racist abuse on social media</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vfqd8X"&gt;Social media platforms have been inundated with racist messages and posts directed at three Black players on England’s football team, following a tough loss to Italy on Sunday in the UEFA Euro 2020 championship match. The two teams played to a 1-1 tie, and Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, and Bukayo Saka were among England’s players to participate in a penalty shootout to decide the winner of the match and the tournament. All three missed their shots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rKeD5w"&gt;After the game ended, the players’ social media accounts, including Facebook-owned Instagram and Twitter, were filled with racist comments and messages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WAeZnC"&gt;In an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Monday, a Twitter spokesperson said the “abhorrent, racist abuse directed at England players” had no place on the platform. Since the end of Sunday’s game, Twitter removed more than 1,000 tweets and permanently suspended a number of accounts — the spokesperson did not say how many — for violating its rules &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/abusive-behavior"&gt;against harassment&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/hateful-conduct-policy"&gt;hateful content&lt;/a&gt;. “We have proactively engaged and continue to collaborate with our partners across the football community to identify ways to tackle this issue collectively and will continue to play our part in curbing this unacceptable behaviour — both online and offline,” the spokesperson said.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ri1xVL"&gt;A Facebook spokesperson said the company didn’t have numbers to share, but said the platform “quickly removed comments and accounts directing abuse at England’s footballers last night and we’ll continue to take action against those that break our rules.” The spokesperson added that the company had encouraged all players to turn on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22394611/instagram-tool-filter-abusive-direct-messages-harassment"&gt;Instagram’s hidden words tool&lt;/a&gt;, which prevents abuse or comments from being visible in direct messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3xt6dM"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dbkzk/marcus-rashford-jadon-sancho-bukayo-saka-suffer-racist-abuse-and-death-threats-after-england-euro-2020-final-defeat"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; reported that even more extreme abuse&lt;/a&gt;, including threats against the players, was turning up on white supremacist channels on Telegram, which has much looser moderation policies than Twitter or Facebook. Telegram didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment Monday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OT5jVD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Social media companies “need to step up and take accountability,” the Football Association said&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XRYi2N"&gt;England’s Football Association &lt;a href="https://www.thefa.com/news/2021/jul/12/20210712-statement-online-abuse-of-england-players#main-content"&gt;said in a statement Monday&lt;/a&gt; that it was “appalled by the online racism that has been aimed at some of our England players on social media.” Anyone behind the “disgusting” behavior is not welcome as a fan, the FA said, adding it was supporting the players “while urging the toughest punishments possible for anyone responsible.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hL10NH"&gt;The FA statement added that social media companies “need to step up and take accountability and action to ban abusers from their platforms, gather evidence that can lead to prosecution and support making the platforms free from this type of abhorrent abuse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m0zffm"&gt;England’s players were &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jun/13/england-players-take-knee-wembley-euro-2020-boos-applause"&gt;frequently booed by fans at Wembley Stadium&lt;/a&gt; during the tournament when the players kneeled on the field before matches as an anti-racism gesture. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/italy-wins-european-soccer-championship-3-2-penalty-shootout-n1273643"&gt;Both teams kneeled&lt;/a&gt; before the start of Sunday’s match, as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Q5Yni"&gt;UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was criticized for previously &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jun/07/boris-johnson-refuses-to-condemn-fans-booing-england-taking-the-knee"&gt;failing to defend the players&lt;/a&gt; who kneeled before games, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1414465103374729220?"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; Monday that the players “deserve to be lauded as heroes, not racially abused on social media.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="dqm9vi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"SB Nation: The racism aimed at Bukayo Saka, Jadon Sancho, and Marcus Rashford was not a surprise","url":"https://theshortfuse.sbnation.com/2021/7/12/22574036/bukayo-saka-marcus-rashford-jadon-sancho-england-racism-euro-2020"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T removes high-speed data throttling from its most expensive unlimited plan</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iqLROxVNJSTHin7-Ar9XuTBo30Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69572265/acastro_180322_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s Unlimited Elite plan will remain $85 per month for a single line, but it gets a few more perks.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a2tf3k"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T is adding a few more benefits to its $85-per-month top-tier unlimited plan at no added cost. Unlimited Elite subscribers will now truly have access to unlimited high-speed data and will no longer be subject to deprioritization after hitting 100GB of data per month. Customers will also get a bump from 30GB of monthly hotspot data up to 40GB as well as up to 4K video streaming — boosted from a maximum of 1080p. The new plan features will be added automatically for all current subscribers starting this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u12QBY"&gt;If this all sounds familiar, that’s because &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295466/t-mobile-magenta-max-unlimited-data-5g-4k-video-announced"&gt;T-Mobile did more or less the same thing earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, AT&amp;amp;T’s Unlimited Elite now matches T-Mobile’s Magenta Max nearly feature-by-feature. Both start at $85 per line (including autopay discounts) and include the same 40GB hotspot data, 4K streaming, and (actually) unlimited high-speed data plan features. AT&amp;amp;T includes HBO Max on its plan whereas T-Mobile offers Netflix, but otherwise, they’re broadly similar. The “Un-carrier” T-Mobile is looking an awful lot like a regular carrier these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Abmx0D"&gt;Most unlimited phone plans &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360228/unlimited-plan-verizon-att-t-mobile-premium-data-tethering-limits"&gt;include data deprioritization in the fine print&lt;/a&gt;, meaning after a certain threshold of monthly data is reached, your account is subject to slowdowns when the network is busy. In this case, T-Mobile’s move to do away with this practice for its highest-paying customers appears to have put pressure on its competitors to do the same. There’s just the slight issue of providing high-speed 5G data that’s worth getting excited about, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/22/18277484/att-fake-5g-e-network-lte-study"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T has struggled to do&lt;/a&gt; over the past couple of years, but things will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;likely improve in the near future&lt;/a&gt;. Until then, it’s your move, Verizon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Thiel associate launches Arizona Senate campaign</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-OlzP7nhZB7grK6K78foo2Oniyk=/200x0:1721x1014/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69572206/Screen_Shot_2021_07_12_at_3.02.44_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sdjIZw"&gt;Blake Masters, a close ally to billionaire Peter Thiel and current Thiel Capital executive, launched a bid for the Arizona Senate Monday. As a Republican, he’ll be seeking to take on Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ). Masters joins a growing pool of Republican candidates, including Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich and solar power executive Jim Lamon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1zKOPt"&gt;On his campaign website, Masters champions a total ban on illegal immigration, calling for the government to use “physical walls, surveillance technology, thousands more border patrol agents, and mandatory E-Verify for employers” along the US-Mexico border. Thiel’s Founder’s Fund invested in the border and military surveillance company Anduril, valuing the company &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-01/anduril-startup-backed-by-peter-thiel-is-valued-at-1-9-billion?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;at $1 billion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mqoqk1"&gt;Masters’ website also vows to “take on the ‘big tech’ platforms — the new public square where free speech is constantly under attack.” However, no clear policy solutions are listed on the site.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Arizona is expected to &lt;a href="https://www.abc15.com/news/state/tucson-native-blake-masters-enters-senate-race"&gt;become a key battleground state&lt;/a&gt; for both Republicans and Democrats in the 2022 midterms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6T8Jer"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Masters’ website also vows to “take on the ‘big tech’ platforms”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T8NY56"&gt;A 34-year-old Tucson resident, Masters rose to prominence by co-authoring &lt;em&gt;Zero to One&lt;/em&gt; alongside Thiel in 2014 and serving as an executive in a number of Thiel’s companies. In April, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403518/peter-thiel-pac-arizona-senate-donation-mark-kelly"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Politico &lt;/em&gt;reported that Thiel created&lt;/a&gt; the new Saving Arizona PAC in support of Masters’ anticipated Senate run, donating $10 million to fund the PAC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DyQE1x"&gt;Thiel has emerged as one of the biggest donors leading up to the 2022 midterm election cycle. In March, Thiel donated $10 million in support of &lt;em&gt;Hillbilly Elegy&lt;/em&gt; author J.D. Vance’s campaign for Ohio Senate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="niTH6E"&gt;Since 2016, Thiel has supported a number of Republican political candidates, including former President Donald Trump. Thiel has been a longtime critic of Democrats and has donated thousands in support of Republican politicians like former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach and Missouri’s Sen. Josh Hawley. Thiel was one of the earliest investors in Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk has a ticket to ride on Richard Branson’s spaceplane</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y5mHkTHBLusEajRAE41cd-6Nydw=/0x0:743x495/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69572198/E6A_2GfVEAESZrr.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Richard Branson and a barefoot Elon Musk hang out on the morning of Branson’s launch to space. | Richard Branson’s Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HIiABT"&gt;Space billionaire Elon Musk bought a ticket to space from fellow space billionaire Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic, &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-has-a-ticket-to-space-too-with-richard-bransons-virgin-11626012705"&gt;cites&lt;/a&gt; a company spokesperson as saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1rBQsM"&gt;Musk, CEO and founder of SpaceX, had the Virgin Galactic ticket before Branson’s flight to space on Sunday, a person familiar with the purchase tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. It’s unclear where Musk stands in Virgin Galactic’s line of about 600 other prospective SpaceShipTwo passengers, but the ticket itself is an extension of his apparent friendship with Branson that contrasts with all of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22570287/space-tourism-virgin-galactic-branson-blue-origin-bezos"&gt;sass and pettiness&lt;/a&gt; this month from Blue Origin, the other top space company founded by the space industry’s other super-rich billionaire, Jeff Bezos. It’s also seen as a friendly endorsement of Virgin Galactic’s rocket-powered plane. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kDeb97"&gt;Branson flew to space on Sunday aboard his company’s SpaceShipTwo spaceplane in a ridiculously extravagant test flight that featured elaborately produced video segments, a concert, and celebrity appearances from Stephen Colbert and astronaut Chris Hadfield. After a successful midair launch, Branson and three other Virgin Galactic employees briefly floated around the spaceplane’s cabin in microgravity before heading back toward the ground a few minutes later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sGgRh4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Billionaire space pals&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n8p5VK"&gt;Musk’s SpaceX has been mostly focused on government contracts to ferry astronauts and cargo into space, but it has its first private astronaut mission teed up for September. That mission will be a longer (and far more expensive) trip into orbit, not just a few minutes above the edge of Earth’s atmosphere like Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="euxV6j"&gt;Musk and Branson are good pals. The Tesla CEO watched Branson’s takeoff in person from Spaceport America on Sunday. “Thanks for being so typically supportive and such a good friend, Elon,” Branson tweeted before the flight. Branson spent his pre-dawn morning before liftoff with Musk. “Great to start the morning with a friend,” he said in another &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/richardbranson/status/1414199651037716485?s=20"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;. “Feeling good, feeling excited, feeling ready.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LtXvOy"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Thanks for being so typically supportive and such a good friend, Elon. Great to be opening up space for all - safe travels and see you at Spaceport America! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Unity22?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Unity22&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/virgingalactic?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@virgingalactic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/fLCoeJOPJJ"&gt;https://t.co/fLCoeJOPJJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Richard Branson (@richardbranson) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/richardbranson/status/1413886033330982915?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j5MXrQ"&gt;SpaceShipTwo is the rocket-plane that stands at the center of Virgin Galactic’s nascent space tourism business. Each ticket for one of the plane’s six seats sells for roughly $250K, and the company has booked over 600 passengers so far, including celebrities like Justin Bieber and Leonardo DiCaprio. Bezos’ Blue Origin is most competitive with Virgin for a slice of the space tourism pie, aiming to launch customers to a slightly higher altitude on a totally different system: the suborbital New Shepard rocket. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eilazM"&gt;Bezos’ own show-and-tell with New Shepard is scheduled for July 20th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Formula E nearly turned a profit during the pandemic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u6aRPV6FM3EGEY78P9SKciex2yw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69572160/formula_e_7045.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a7si2l"&gt;All-electric racing series Formula E very nearly turned its first profit during the 2019–2020 season, its sixth, despite canceling nine of the 14 races originally scheduled in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Six of those races were eventually made up at a single track in Berlin, Germany, which — along with other internal changes — ultimately helped bring the series’s total costs down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kKQD9b"&gt;All told, Formula E lost just €38,514 before taxes during its sixth season, down from a €10.6 million &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/15/21257563/formula-e-loss-revenue-season-five-attendance"&gt;loss in season five&lt;/a&gt; (about $45,700 and $11.6 million, respectively), according to a &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22712991/formula_e_operations_limited_season_six.pdf"&gt;new filing&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/08412477/filing-history"&gt;UK’s Companies House Registry&lt;/a&gt;. That’s despite the series bringing in less money — revenue dropped to €143 million down from €161.5 million in season five ($169.6 million and $177.6 million, respectively), thanks to lost ticket sales and other moneymaking sponsorship agreements tied to the canceled races. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hxVfzd"&gt;It was the first time ever that Formula E generated less revenue than in the prior season — in fact, through season four, the series had nearly doubled the amount of revenue it generated each year, as it locked down bigger deals with race sponsors and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/11/20960013/uber-saudi-arabia-jamal-khashoggi-lucid-motors-virgin-hyperloop-formula-e-dara-khosrowshahi"&gt;host countries like Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt;. But while the pandemic caused millions of people around the world to lose their jobs, Formula E actually increased the number of people it employed during season six to 97, up from 89 in season five.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="njj5um"&gt;It’s a remarkable testament to the success of the young series, which was widely teased when it launched in 2014 but now features more manufacturers than any other motorsport in the world. Automakers like Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Nissan, and Jaguar have flocked to the series because of its relative low cost (especially when compared to something like Formula One) and because it’s an attractive way to promote their electrification efforts. In fact, despite BMW and Audi announcing that they will leave Formula E at the end of the seventh season, Formula E will still feature more automakers than other racing series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7No0Zw"&gt;Formula E said in the filing that it expects to be able to generate increasing amounts of revenue now that it has protocols in place to deal with the pandemic and is back to putting on races in front of fans. (The series just put on two races in New York City this past weekend, and is slated to wrap up season seven in August.) Though, if it struggles to do that, the series has built out a bit more of a safety net. According to the filing, Formula E dramatically increased its cash buffer in season six, ending the 2020 fiscal year with nearly €83 million in the bank, up from just €8.3 million in season five ($98.4 million and $9.8 million, respectively). &lt;/p&gt;
