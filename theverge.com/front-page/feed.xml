    <title>The iconic silver bullet Airstream camping trailer has returned as a remote-controlled EV</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Airstream eStream concept by Thor Industries — being towed by a Tesla Model X | Image: Thor Industries&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="krXCFd"&gt;Recreational vehicle manufacturer Thor Industries &lt;a href="https://www.thorindustries.com/innovation-estream"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; last week an electric tow assisted “eStream” trailer concept under its Airstream brand and also a battery-powered RV with a range of up to 300 miles (&lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2022/01/19/electric-airstream-concept-is-the-rv-industrys-iphone-moment/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;via Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0m9xkS"&gt;The Airstream eStream trailer could be like any other camper that you tow — but this one can be detached and remotely moved around a campsite. That could make maneuvering easier and improve safety. While it may seem similar to such gimmicks as a Tesla’s remote parking feature, the eStream’s electric propulsion enables other advances, such as the ability to synchronize with a towing vehicle to help increase range between recharging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wWPJ65"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rUvIpUygzaY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5RGw7S"&gt;Nowadays, electric vehicles have expanded range capabilities, but if you’ve ever tried towing a trailer behind a Tesla, you might find it to lose a &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/2021-tesla-model-y-long-term-update-range-towing/"&gt;significant&lt;/a&gt; amount of range. The eStream could be a stark improvement for those seeking an all-electric lifestyle out on the open road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MrFlhf"&gt;Many campsites offer 240-volt service, where the eStream and an additional EV could be recharged. When not plugged in, the eStream also has solar panels that can regain power to the camper’s 80 kWh battery system (no more diesel generators powering campers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oLAbXO"&gt;Thor industries also &lt;a href="https://www.thorindustries.com/innovation-vision-vehicle"&gt;introduced&lt;/a&gt; the Thor Vision Vehicle concept — a Ford Transit van converted to an EV with a futuristic tech-filled interior plus a large tablet-style infotainment system with trip planning and other internet-connected features seen in many modern electric cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDQSsR"&gt;The Thor Vision also has solar panels, but its surprise power source is a fuel cell that can charge the batteries for extended dry camping periods. Other features include voice control using Alexa, which can do anything from giving a charge status to adjusting lighting and temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Fw0j58"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uWDImj5YJJo?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7MN0B4"&gt;Winnebago is another company working on a fully outfitted electric RV van (built on a Ford Transit as well). And although this concept seems realistically ready for production, its 125 miles of range seems ever so anemic for the use-case compared to the Thor Vision’s 300 miles target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7prPZM"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Winnebago's new Transit-based EV camper has a range of 125 miles. Research suggests 54% of new RV buyers prefer to stay within 200 miles. Still, is that enough? &lt;a href="https://t.co/QAnvKAmFdK"&gt;https://t.co/QAnvKAmFdK&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/eNhQhDVnCq"&gt;pic.twitter.com/eNhQhDVnCq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Autoblog (@therealautoblog) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/therealautoblog/status/1483888742683213829?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 19, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TcSxKD"&gt;As with all concepts, it remains to be seen when and if the eStream camper and the Thor Vision vehicle reach production — so don’t get too hyped about having that all-electric off-grid lifestyle just yet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PG&amp;E’s criminal probation is ending, but the company remains a ‘menace to California’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Dixie Fire Nearly Contained After Burning Almost One Million Acres" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cCVUKyVtS0ia6Cwy_hAgQZEudiw=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70427061/1342338699.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QbyQtV"&gt;Embattled California utility PG&amp;amp;E ends a five-year felony probation period tomorrow that failed to rehabilitate the company, according to the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;US District Court judge that oversaw the probation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Em68Z"&gt;“In these five years, PG&amp;amp;E has gone on a crime spree and will emerge from probation as a continuing menace to California,” US District Judge William Alsup wrote in a scathing &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fdocument%2F553884499%2FUS-v-PG-E&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F24%2F22899095%2Fpge-menace-california-wildfires-probation-lifts" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; released days ahead of the probationary period that lifts at midnight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="M8Lmqq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“PG&amp;amp;E has gone on a crime spree”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HZggD3"&gt;The company was &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/01/26/pge-gets-maximum-sentence-for-san-bruno-crimes/"&gt;placed on probation&lt;/a&gt; in 2017 when it was convicted of six felony crimes connected to one of its natural gas pipelines that exploded in 2010, killing eight people. Since a company can’t go to prison for committing a crime, PG&amp;amp;E faced a $3 million fine and the maximum length of probation.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZlA3yM"&gt;Since then, PG&amp;amp;E has caused even more devastation, Alsup writes. While on probation, according to Alsup’s report, PG&amp;amp;E was responsible for at least 31 blazes that killed 113 people and scorched 23,956 homes and buildings. The &lt;a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/media/lbfd0m2f/top20_deadliest.pdf"&gt;deadliest&lt;/a&gt; and most &lt;a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/media/t1rdhizr/top20_destruction.pdf"&gt;destructive&lt;/a&gt; was the 2018 Camp Fire, which burned the town of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21300937/coronavirus-pandemic-california-wildfires-high-school-paradise-climate-change-graduation"&gt;Paradise&lt;/a&gt; to the ground and for which PG&amp;amp;E &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/16/879008760/pg-e-pleads-guilty-on-2018-california-camp-fire-our-equipment-started-that-fire#:~:text=Pacific%20Gas%20%26%20Electric%20pleaded%20guilty,of%20Paradise%20in%20Northern%20California."&gt;pleaded guilty&lt;/a&gt; to 84 involuntary manslaughter charges. PG&amp;amp;E faces dozens more charges for other blazes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s249CB"&gt;Systemic problems at PG&amp;amp;E are to blame for the devastation, according to Alsup, who described how the utility neglects to clear hazardous trees and vegetation near its power lines. “Virtually all” of the wildfires caused by PG&amp;amp;E distribution lines involved such trees, which the California Public Resource Code mandates that PG&amp;amp;E manage. The terms of PG&amp;amp;E’s probation also included removing or trimming trees that might come in contact with its equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4rhvwX"&gt;While Alsup described PG&amp;amp;E’s backlog of hazardous trees and vegetation as “staggering at the outset of probation,” even now, the utility is seven years behind on maintenance. The company relies on outside contractors to do the job of clearing dangerous vegetation away from its power lines, then points the finger at those contractors when problems occur. Alsup posits that PG&amp;amp;E’s use of contractors helps the company cut costs while also allowing PG&amp;amp;E “to manufacture a strategic defense in wildfire litigation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FsWN4j"&gt;The company needs to hire and train its own staff arborists, the judge added, expressing his “regret” that the court only required PG&amp;amp;E to hire 30 vegetation inspectors while it was under probation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="grNWQi"&gt;As a result of PG&amp;amp;E’s equipment triggering blazes, in 2019, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/10/20908434/california-blackouts-utilities-fires-lawsuits-san-francisco-bay-area-pge-pacific-gas-electric"&gt;started to implement preemptive blackouts&lt;/a&gt;. But while these outages prevent fires, they also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20932780/california-blackout-healthcare-electricity-fires"&gt;cause other problems&lt;/a&gt; for residents left in the dark. Since facing pressure from the court to begin implementing preemptive power outages several years ago, Alsup says the company has “watered down” its criteria for cutting off power ahead of windstorms and is reluctant to do so even when hazardous conditions pose major fire risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eomQbh"&gt;The Dixie fire that raged through northern California last year, ultimately becoming the &lt;a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/media/4jandlhh/top20_acres.pdf"&gt;second largest&lt;/a&gt; in state history, was a stunning example of both problems. PG&amp;amp;E moved slowly to de-energize a circuit, even though there were signs that its distribution line was in trouble before employees&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;arrived to figure out what was wrong. It turned out that a tree was leaning on an energized line; it overheated and burst into the first flames of the Dixie fire. State firefighting agency Cal Fire &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22868298/pge-utility-power-line-responsible-dixie-fire"&gt;found PG&amp;amp;E at fault&lt;/a&gt; for the conflagration in an investigation completed earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="moYDxv"&gt;“We acknowledge that we have more work to do,” PG&amp;amp;E spokesperson James Noonan said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; today. But Noonan added that the utility has become a “fundamentally safer company”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;over the course of its probation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VMhx5h"&gt;Alsup feels differently. “We remain trapped in a tragic era of PG&amp;amp;E wildfires,” the judge wrote in his report. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cracking a $2 million crypto wallet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CHGRGn_01TqvxpLIlKO9mwgOUxk=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70427037/VRG_ILLO_4975_K_Radtke_Crypto_Wallet_Crack.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Kristen Radtke / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;First, he forgot his PIN — then he started looking for hackers&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="cDWu6J"&gt;In early 2018, Dan Reich and a friend decided to spend $50,000 in Bitcoin on a batch of Theta tokens, a new cryptocurrency then worth just 21 cents apiece. At first, they held the tokens with an exchange based in China, but within weeks, a broad crackdown on cryptocurrency by the Chinese government meant they would soon lose access to the exchange, so they had to transfer everything to a hardware wallet. Reich and his friend chose a Trezor One hardware wallet, set up a PIN, and then got busy with life and forgot about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u4pzzb"&gt;By the end of that year, the token had sunk to less than a quarter of its value, come back up, and then crashed again. Reich decided he wanted to cash out, but his friend had lost the paper where he’d written the PIN and couldn’t remember the digits. They tried guessing what they thought was a four-digit PIN (it was actually five), but after each failed attempt, the wallet doubled the wait time before they could guess again. After 16 guesses, the &lt;a href="https://wiki.trezor.io/Security:Threats"&gt;data on the wallet would automatically erase&lt;/a&gt;. When they reached a dozen tries, they stopped, afraid to go further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LRIj4H"&gt;Reich gave up and wrote off the money in his mind. He was willing to take the loss — until the price started to rise again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wK6TUX"&gt;From a low of around $12,000, the value of their tokens started to skyrocket. By the end of 2020, it would be worth more than $400,000, rising briefly to over $3 million. It would be hard to get into the wallet without the PIN — but it wasn’t impossible. And with potentially millions on the line, Reich and his friend vowed to find a way inside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="K045NU"&gt;
&lt;p id="yPQ8rA"&gt;The only way to own cryptocurrency on the blockchain is to have sole possession of a private key associated with a block of currency — but managing those keys has been a, sometimes high-stakes, challenge from the beginning. You can’t sell or spend your currency without the key (or the string of words used to derive the key, also called the seed) — but if anyone else gets hold of it, they can grab your coins in a single anonymous transaction from anywhere in the world. You can store your key in a software wallet on an exchange service’s server or in a software wallet on your own computer or mobile phone — but those are vulnerable to remote attack if anyone on the internet is able to get your key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SHhRie"&gt;Hardware wallets, the size of a USB stick, are meant to solve that problem, storing the key locally, off the internet, and signing transactions inside the secure wallet when you insert the device into a computer and enter the PIN. But if you forget the PIN and don’t have the key written down, you’re generally out of luck and can no longer access your currency on the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="M2T0dY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;more than 3.7 million Bitcoins are lost to owners&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OmN6ug"&gt;This happens more often than you might think. The cryptocurrency data firm Chainalysis estimates that more than 3.7 million Bitcoins worth $66.5 billion are likely lost to owners. Currency can be lost for many reasons: the computer or phone storing a software wallet is stolen or crashes and the wallet is unrecoverable; the owner inadvertently throws their hardware wallet away; or the owner forgets their PIN or dies without passing it to family members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ukQmt"&gt;As the value of their inaccessible tokens rapidly rose in 2020, Reich and his friend were desperate to crack their wallet. They searched online until they found a 2018 conference talk from three hardware experts who discovered a way to access the key in a Trezor wallet without knowing the PIN. The engineers declined to help them, but it gave Reich hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5SgWaB"&gt;“We at least knew that it was possible and had some directional idea of how it could be done,” Reich says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jCvykw"&gt;Then they found a financier in Switzerland who claimed he had associates in France who could crack the wallet in a lab. But there was a catch: Reich couldn’t know their names or go to the lab. He’d have to hand off his wallet to the financier in Switzerland, who would take it to his French associates. It was a crazy idea with a lot of risks, but Reich and his friend were desperate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u2J5Hs"&gt;COVID and lockdowns slowed their plans in 2020, but in February 2021, with the value of their tokens now $2.5 million, Reich was making plans to fly to Europe, when suddenly they found a better option: a hardware hacker in the US named Joe Grand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yyjomb"&gt;Grand is an &lt;a href="http://www.grandideastudio.com/"&gt;electrical engineer and inventor&lt;/a&gt; who has been hacking hardware since he was 10. Known by the hacker handle “Kingpin,” he was part of the famed L0pht hacker collective that, in 1998, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVJldn_MmMY"&gt;testified to the US Senate&lt;/a&gt; about a vulnerability that could be used to take down the internet or allow an intelligence agency to &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2008/08/revealed-the-in/"&gt;spy on traffic&lt;/a&gt;. In 2008, he co-hosted the Discovery Channel’s “Prototype This” show and currently teaches hardware hacking to organizations and companies that design complex systems and want to understand how hackers can attack their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WmYvXv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If he screwed something up, there was a good shot that it would never be able to be recovered”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7U6wEq"&gt;Reich, an electrical engineer himself who owns a software company, had a better ability than most to assess if Grand had the skills to pull off the hack. After a single conversation, he knew they’d found the right person. “I remember thinking, ‘Wow, this is perhaps one of the brightest electrical engineers I’ve ever met,’” he recalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aqxAKV"&gt;Grand, who has a custom lab in his family’s Portland backyard, purchased several identical wallets to the one Reich and his friend owned and installed the same version of firmware on them. Then he spent three months doing research and attacking his practice wallets with various techniques. They agreed that Reich, who lives in New Jersey, wouldn’t fly out to Portland with his wallet until Grand succeeded to crack three wallets using the same technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ReWpvG"&gt;“If he screwed something up, there was a good shot that it would never be able to be recovered,” says Reich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kJHX5y"&gt;Luckily for Grand, there was previous research to guide him. In 2017, a 15-year-old hardware hacker in the UK named Saleem Rashid had developed a method to successfully unlock a Trezor wallet belonging to tech journalist Mark Frauenfelder and helped him &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/i-forgot-my-pin-an-epic-tale-of-losing-dollar30000-in-bitcoin/"&gt;free $30,000 in Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="O2ijXx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;a fault-injection method — also known as glitching&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FgOvA7"&gt;Rashid found that when the Trezor wallet was turned on, it made a copy of the PIN and key that was stored in the wallet’s secured flash memory and placed the copy in RAM. A vulnerability in the wallet allowed him to put the wallet into firmware update mode and install his own unauthorized code on the device, which let him read the PIN and key where it was in RAM. But the installation of his code caused the PIN and key stored in long-term flash memory to erase, leaving only the copy in RAM. This made it a risky technique for Grand to use; if he inadvertently erased the RAM before he could read the data, the key would be unrecoverable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bWR3nZ"&gt;In any case, Trezor had altered its wallets since then so that the PIN and key that got copied to RAM during boot-up got erased from RAM when the device was put into firmware update mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jA172U"&gt;So Grand looked instead to the method used in the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1OBIGslgGM"&gt;2018 conference talk&lt;/a&gt; that Reich had also examined previously. The researchers in this case found that despite Trezor removing the PIN and key that got copied to RAM during boot-up, the PIN and key were showing up in RAM during another stage. They found that at some point during the firmware update mode, the PIN and key were being temporarily &lt;em&gt;moved&lt;/em&gt; to RAM — to prevent the new firmware from writing over the PIN and key — then &lt;em&gt;moved&lt;/em&gt; back to flash once the firmware was installed. So they devised a technique dubbed “wallet.fail.” This attack used a fault-injection method — also known as glitching — to undermine security protecting the RAM and allow them to read the PIN and key when they were briefly in RAM.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Five electronic devices sit on a whiteboard, with diagram lines connecting them in an outline of Grand’s proposed hack: the CW 1200 sites on top, then a second row including the PhyWhisperer, the Trezor, an interface chipboard, and the J-link probe, from left to right." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zx07hojJNbdx3bAvla3Vd7iO264=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23191888/Screen_Shot_2022_01_24_at_2.53.21_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Grand’s setup for defeating the Trezor wallet &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;amp;v=dT9y-KQbqi4" target="_blank"&gt;as seen in his video&lt;/a&gt;, including a &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.newae.com/chipwhisperer" target="_blank"&gt;ChipWhisperer CW 1200&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/newae/phywhisperer-usb" target="_blank"&gt;PhyWhisperer-USB&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/" target="_blank"&gt;J-Link debug probe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kaH7AO"&gt;There are three levels of security available for the microcontroller used in Trezor wallets — RDP2, the most secure, which doesn’t let you read the RAM, and RDP1 and RDP0, which do. Trezor wallets are configured to use RDP2 to prevent someone from reading the RAM, among other things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="17F3O8"&gt;But by doing a fault injection attack against the chip — which affects voltage going to the microcontroller — the wallet.fail team found they could downgrade the security from RDP2 to RDP1. They could then force the wallet into firmware update mode, sending the PIN and key into RAM, and read them. It was similar to Rashid’s attack, except the fault injection got them access to RAM without needing to exploit code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K0WQPc"&gt;The technique was great for a research project but risky for Reich’s wallet. Because the PIN and key were &lt;em&gt;moved&lt;/em&gt; to RAM during the firmware update and not just copied, there was only one version on the wallet during this period. Do something wrong, and Grand could inadvertently wipe the RAM, along with the key and PIN. As it was, each time he glitched his practice wallets, they froze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="RvVCXO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;After nearly three and a half hours, the computer finally called out&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EqjgdY"&gt;But while trying to troubleshoot the problem, Grand stumbled on a better solution. He found that in the version of firmware installed on Reich’s wallet, the key and PIN still got copied to RAM when the device was powered on. If Grand glitched the device at the right moment, he could downgrade the security to RDP1 and read RAM. And because the key and PIN were merely copied to RAM at this point and not moved, unlike the wallet.fail scenario, this meant they still existed in flash if Grand inadvertently wiped the RAM. It was a much safer solution that elegantly borrowed from both prior attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RzuEpq"&gt;The only problem was the glitching required thousands of tries — powering up the wallet repeatedly and using different parameters to affect the voltage to the microcontroller each time, in an attempt to hit the exact moment that would let him downgrade the microcontroller’s security. It took three to four hours using an automated script, and there was no guarantee it would work on Reich’s wallet, even if it worked on the practice wallets. Reich likened the excruciating wait to sitting through a stakeout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6OScQV"&gt;Grand designed his program so that if and when the glitch worked, his computer would call out: “Hack the planet!” — a nod to the 1995 film &lt;em&gt;Hackers&lt;/em&gt;. When the time came to do the hack for real last May, Reich flew to Portland for two days. They spent the first day getting everything set up — they &lt;a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9y-KQbqi4"&gt;filmed the hack with a professional crew&lt;/a&gt; — and the next day, Grand launched his script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VxK4G3"&gt;Then they waited. And waited some more. Then they ate pizza and waited some more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hFAg1P"&gt;After nearly three and a half hours, the computer finally called out: “Hack the planet!” On Grand’s screen, he could see the key and five-digit PIN. Reich and his friend were now $2 million richer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t4PxUG"&gt;He immediately moved the Theta tokens out of their account and sent a percentage of the booty to Grand for his services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n2rJLn"&gt;It was a thrilling moment for Grand — and not just because of the money that was at stake. “It kind of reinvigorated me… and helped me decide what I should be doing with my skills,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="QlCl27"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“with enough time and effort and resources, anything is hackable”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1lUmUo"&gt;Since last May, he’s been speaking with others who lost access to their funds, with the hope of helping more people crack their wallets. This includes James Howells in Wales, who &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/12/13/half-a-billion-in-bitcoin-lost-in-the-dump"&gt;inadvertently threw his hardware wallet in the trash&lt;/a&gt; in 2013 and lost access to Bitcoin now worth half a billion dollars. He’s been trying for years to convince his local council to let him dig through the dump. The city tracks where residential trash is buried and told him there’s a good chance they could locate the area where his wallet might be but have so far refused his request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="le7RMx"&gt;Grand has also been speaking with someone whose wallet is on a broken phone, which would require forensic repair techniques and a couple who lost the password to a software wallet stored on their computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MyzO1U"&gt;But Grand doesn’t want to just crack wallets — he also wants to help make them more secure. He plans to report vulnerabilities he finds to the vendor when they’re patchable, so they can’t be exploited by criminals or others who might seize an owner’s wallet. Does this mean he’ll run out of vulnerabilities to hack at some point?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YYqeHl"&gt;Grand doesn’t think so. There will always be people with older unpatched versions of firmware on their wallets — like Reich — and he’s confident newer devices will still be vulnerable in different ways even if they’re patched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3PjPT9"&gt;“It depends on the design, but with enough time and effort and resources, anything is hackable,” he notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Etj76"&gt;Trezor already fixed part of the problem Grand exploited in later versions of its firmware. The wallets no longer copy or move the key and PIN into RAM at all. Pavol Rusnak, co-founder and CTO of SatoshiLabs, which makes Trezor wallets, said it now stores them in a protected part of flash that isn’t affected during firmware upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hs4tKL"&gt;But a core issue with the chip that allows fault injection still exists and can only be fixed by the chip maker — which the maker has declined to do — or by using a more secure chip. Rusnak says his team explored the latter, but more secure chips generally require vendors to sign an NDA, something his team opposes. Trezor uses open-source software for transparency, and when Rusnak’s team discovered a flaw in one secure chip they considered using, the chip maker invoked the NDA to prevent them from talking about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OukR3d"&gt;This means Trezor wallets may continue to be vulnerable to other hacking techniques. Grand is already working on one new method for hacking the STM32 microcontroller used in the wallets. It will work even on wallets with the newest, more protected firmware. He says he won’t release the details publicly, however, because the ramifications go beyond wallets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="raKkW9"&gt;“The STM32 is used in billions of devices around the world,” he says, and the issue he found can’t be patched. “Which is both awesome and scary.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok is feeling emotional damage over the market crash</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="Tessellated TikTok logos against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aJt13Yw7D0SpyAQw8i5uLAT4fok=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70426891/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kZXUp3"&gt;My TikTok For You page is generally a wonderland of soothing cooking videos, lesbian carpentry, dieticians frothing at the mouth at fitness scams, and whatever it is &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@yoleendadong?lang=en"&gt;@yoleendadong&lt;/a&gt; is up to. But every so often, my FYP will land me in FinanceTok and CryptoTok. And buddy, I do not think everyone there is OK. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UA23Ok"&gt;I’ve never turned down a chance to leap down the TikTok rabbit hole, and perusing the #marketcrash2022 and #cryptocrash2022 tags is truly tragic. There’s &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/foryou?amp%3Bis_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;amp%3Blang=en&amp;amp;amp%3Bq=stock%20market%20crash%202022&amp;amp;amp%3Bt=1643043336608&amp;amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;item_id=7055695869743467823#/@lamafole2/video/7055695869743467823"&gt;this baby&lt;/a&gt; going through a rollercoaster of emotions watching stocks go up and down. There’s also this grown adult man &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@market_moves/video/7055037785132240175?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESPgo8tzApyaJisKgrLs2oWjQ7aPT7OOzNmlX%2BguuBi1346pSwV9vzQs2ErtxXk8YenuHYm0n%2BVerAP17DNQhwGgA%3D&amp;amp;checksum=85a9018a6a1f3c8651a680360e48a9ee6370967c230d5fe11ecc76f785b48eb5&amp;amp;language=en&amp;amp;preview_pb=0&amp;amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAA-g6EtWefuLvM-Iw7GeZ9YqcbXkX0GvOYNInEH77mgv_N28jxqV6yfWtQ_hRxTnJK&amp;amp;share_app_id=1233&amp;amp;share_item_id=7055037785132240175&amp;amp;share_link_id=667327A8-509F-4FA0-BA17-A49DFA0FA1D4&amp;amp;source=h5_m&amp;amp;timestamp=1643042272&amp;amp;tt_from=copy&amp;amp;u_code=d3eib1bcahliii&amp;amp;user_id=6632321522571935749&amp;amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;amp;utm_source=copy&amp;amp;_r=1"&gt;doing the same thing&lt;/a&gt;, set to the Emotional Damage vs. Pompeii by William Li sound. Actually, it seems like a lot of &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@j0nasr_/video/7056040047933443333?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;q=market%20crash%202022&amp;amp;t=1643044079639"&gt;grown men&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@hustlewithuli/video/7056339694291782914?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;lang=en&amp;amp;q=market%20crash%202022&amp;amp;t=1643043811510"&gt;are&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@online_income_streams/video/7056046432410668294?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;q=market%20crash%202022&amp;amp;t=1643044079639"&gt;crying&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@itscashflow/video/7056039826751032582?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;q=market%20crash%202022&amp;amp;t=1643044079639"&gt;about their&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cryptobound/video/7056411862644215086?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;q=crypto%20crash%202022&amp;amp;t=1643044421695"&gt;cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@doge2m00n/video/7051732911904574725?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;q=market%20crash%202022&amp;amp;t=1643051289291"&gt;and investment&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@master23mind/video/7055841071619837230?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;q=crypto%20crash%202022&amp;amp;t=1643044421695"&gt;portfolios&lt;/a&gt; tanking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gpDPpj"&gt;Those are just the tip of the iceberg. FinanceTok is a menagerie of self-proclaimed money experts telling you which stocks to buy and sell. It seems they’ve all read &lt;em&gt;Rich Dad Poor Dad&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;I Will Teach You to Be Rich &lt;/em&gt;but come to very different conclusions about what the lessons ought to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cr2hxy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;But once a crash actually happens, so do new types of videos&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CwLVZO"&gt;But once a crash actually happens, so do new types of videos. There are the self-satisfied creators who &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cloud9.crypto/video/7055711262109404418?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;q=crypto%20crash%202022&amp;amp;t=1643046535014"&gt;called the crash several months ago&lt;/a&gt; and are using that as clout so you’ll “hit plus for more.” Then there are the &lt;a href="https://vm.tiktok.com/TTPdhLQgg1/"&gt;smug creators&lt;/a&gt; opining about why they’re “not worried about the crash” because “historically markets always rise after a crash.” An absurd number are obsessed with that &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@studentloanmillionaire/video/7056766134342667525?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;q=crypto%20crash%202022%20fearful%20greedy&amp;amp;t=1643046158131"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@victor_patino11/video/7055512940711005486?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;q=fearful%20greedy%20waren%20buffet&amp;amp;t=1643046272366"&gt;Warren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@realcryptooverkill/video/7052011707979369775?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;q=fearful%20greedy%20waren%20buffet&amp;amp;t=1643046272366"&gt;Buffet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@newmoneyclips/video/7055215462124244229?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;q=marketcrash%202022&amp;amp;t=1643046350648"&gt;quote&lt;/a&gt;, “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” It’s used to justify either &lt;a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/12/meaning-of-hodl-and-btfd-bitcoin-terms-defined.html"&gt;HODLing&lt;/a&gt; (that is, continuing to hold) or going on a crypto buying spree when the market is down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hmBzsC"&gt;Meanwhile, a TikTok astrologer who &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/06/13/maren-altman-tiktok-astrology-bitcoin/"&gt;pivoted to cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt; has over a million followers. One of her latest YouTube videos, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjslGHW3TKE"&gt;a 22-minute&lt;/a&gt; clip about how Pluto returning to the US’s second house of finance hints at economic malaise (and a good time to invest in crypto), has more than 36,000 views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VhgBRO"&gt;Even the real estate TikTokkers are joining in, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@inthisjennaration/video/7049912573029944622?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;q=market%20crash%202022&amp;amp;t=1643046768211"&gt;sighing at the discourse&lt;/a&gt; about whether this is exactly like 2008. Others are keen to explain why or why not a housing crash is also on &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@reitv_/video/7019771127497067782?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;q=market%20crash%202022&amp;amp;t=1643046768211"&gt;the way&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mrjebsmith/video/7049877566286630190?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;q=market%20crash%202022&amp;amp;t=1643046768211"&gt;because the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sam_jarman/video/7051678632372194607?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;q=real%20estate%202022&amp;amp;t=1643046674094"&gt;Fed is going&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@gavinjlarnard/video/7046560694598143278?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;q=market%20crash%202022&amp;amp;t=1643046768211"&gt;raise&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@the_genz_realtor/video/7054670122849586478?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;q=market%20crash%202022&amp;amp;t=1643046768211"&gt;interest rates&lt;/a&gt;. It all sounds plausible when you see it on TikTok. Housing markets usually cool off when interest rates go up — and the Fed plans on raising interest rates this year — but there are usually &lt;a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/housing_bubble.asp"&gt;way more factors&lt;/a&gt; that go into housing busts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EUsJiw"&gt;If you’re trying to find an idea of who in these videos is worth trusting — I recommend closing the TikTok app and sticking your head out the window for some fresh air. Finance is labyrinthine. Entertaining snippets on TikTok and other social media are digestible. Occasionally, you scroll away knowing something you didn’t beforehand. But as confusing as investing can be, going off “advice” you saw on TikTok (or r/wallstreetbets) might not be the best idea. That’s how that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;GameStop chaos&lt;/a&gt; happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pGlVNA"&gt;It’s all good fun, but some of us are actually using these platforms for investing advice. Just as influencers and social media helped drive the market up, it’s possible they can also inadvertently shepherd it in the other direction. Sure, many influencers are urging us to HODL and see slumping prices as an opportunity. But it only takes a few scared folks in an echo chamber to spark panic selling. This is how memes end up in the back of people’s minds as they make real-life decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OVAZ08"&gt;Stocks can go up or down, but FinanceTok has just made an important discovery: markets going up&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;down provide good fodder for the content mill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IY0yUj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZwxE30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wjAwPB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter suspends Wordle-ruining bot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EdX8yAbYICN_dd1xar17w0mXygg=/89x0:1265x784/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70426860/Screen_Shot_2022_01_24_at_10.33.22.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wordlinator account tweeted rude messages with spoilers at people posting results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Abv3Um"&gt;Twitter has banned @wordlinator, a bot that replied to people’s Wordle posts with rude messages that include spoilers for the next day’s game. The account’s spoilers appeared to be accurate (the key is easily accessible in the game’s code, so it’s not necessarily a surprise), which could end up ruining the game for anyone who sees them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tiKeZV"&gt;For anyone who’s managed to avoid it, Wordle is a game where you get six chances to guess a five-letter word — if you’re interested, you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22892044/wordle-free-game-online-how-to-puzzle"&gt;learn how to play it here&lt;/a&gt;. The answer is the same for everyone playing, and it only changes once a day. The game also has an interesting sharing mechanic, where you can copy and paste a series of emoji to let people know how easy or hard it was for you to guess the word of the day. If you’ve seen a ton of yellow, gray, and green squares on Twitter, they’re probably either Wordle results or a joke about Wordle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PoQtqn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Note: if you like tweeting your wordIe scores, someone’s made a bot you should block as it auto-responds with tomorrows answer &lt;a href="https://t.co/u62kBaTivn"&gt;pic.twitter.com/u62kBaTivn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— dan nguyen (@dancow) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dancow/status/1485660308622528513?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 24, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cxqjWV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The bot wasn’t well-received by Wordle fans.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GF0r0D"&gt;Given that the game is about guessing a word, knowing what the next one will be can ruin the entire point. It’s also one of those things that’s almost impossible to put out of your head — when you’ve seen what the next word is, you probably won’t be able to forget it no matter how hard you try. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Spxb8W"&gt;While this particular bot is gone, Twitter could become a dangerous place for people who want to post their Wordle results — the internet has already figured out &lt;a href="https://reichel.dev/blog/reverse-engineering-wordle.html"&gt;how to predict what the next word will be&lt;/a&gt;, and someone else could make another bot to do the same thing as Wordlinator. (If you do end up seeing a new version of the bot, it’s best to block it to keep it from spoiling you and your followers.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oi2QzT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Wordle code has already been cracked&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7q7QOy"&gt;Before Wordlinator was banned, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to Twitter to ask if it was in violation of the platform’s rules. The company didn’t immediately reply, but the bot seemed to break at least one of the standards laid out on &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-automation"&gt;Twitter’s Automation Rules page&lt;/a&gt;. Under the word “Don’t!” it lists “spam or bother users, or otherwise send them unsolicited messages.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3I9Ldg"&gt;If you’re tired of seeing Wordle tweets and want to know how to mute them, we’ve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22878708/twitter-mute-tweets-word-name-tag-how-to"&gt;got a how-to for that as well&lt;/a&gt;. I recommend taking that route over trying to make people feel bad for enjoying things.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google could bring the fight to Roku and Amazon with an even cheaper Chromecast</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/06B6rCXbQAgQ3Ap_JlhOHso9hq8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70426801/DSCF2108.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EHELU6"&gt;Google is working on a lower-end Chromecast with Google TV that would slot in below its current model in price — and also video resolution. According to &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/entertainment/google-chromecast-hd-boreal-1080p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protocol’s&lt;/em&gt; Janko Roettgers&lt;/a&gt;, the upcoming, cheaper Chromecast will run the same Google TV software as the existing hardware and will still include a remote control. But it will be limited to a maximum of 1080p video quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CRwOB1"&gt;Playing to that limitation, &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; believes Google might market the device as “Chromecast HD with Google TV,” similar to the branding of Apple’s Apple TV HD. The product would be marketed towards consumers with 1080p TVs who don’t necessarily care about having the very best picture quality. Other specs mentioned in the report include a maximum of 2GB RAM and 60fps frame rate and confirmation that the hardware would be capable of decoding Google’s preferred AV1 codec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHBWCG"&gt;With the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;2020 Chromecast with Google TV&lt;/a&gt; priced at $49.99, potential price points for the HD version could range anywhere from $19.99 to $39.99. The entry-level streaming hardware market is fiercely competitive, with multiple models to choose between from Amazon and Roku alone; clearly, Google wants in on that pool of potential customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T8lDhu"&gt;The only thing that would give me pause about a lower-end Chromecast with Google TV would be performance. The current model can already get bogged down from time to time, so, hopefully, Google can deliver a device that sacrifices resolution without ruining the day-to-day experience of browsing streaming recommendations and apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ktfzVd"&gt;This new Chromecast HD with Google TV would likely replace the aging, older-generation Chromecast that Google &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/chromecast?hl=en-US"&gt;continues to sell&lt;/a&gt; for $29.99 — despite it coming without any built-in entertainment apps or a remote. Like its predecessors, the standard Chromecast relies on users to stream content from another device like their smartphone or PC to the HDMI dongle. Google TV is a much simpler approach that offers a vast app store, voice search, Google Assistant integration, and more. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It’s 2022, and the Surface Duo is finally getting Android 11 </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nMessnesE1lF-i5Ll_UiG-dAeOI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70426723/vpavic_4176_20200905_0142.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Duo is getting Android 11 at last.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a5fKdZ"&gt;At the beginning of this month, my colleague Monica Chin published an article with the headline “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/1/22862649/microsoft-surface-duo-android-11-missed-update"&gt;It’s 2022, and the Surface Duo still doesn’t have Android 11&lt;/a&gt;,” pointing out that Microsoft hadn’t brought Android 11 to the dual-screen phone despite &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690003/microsoft-surface-duo-android-11-update-release-date"&gt;having said in September&lt;/a&gt; that it was working on delivering the by the end of 2021. That’s finally changing, as Microsoft has begun to roll out Android 11 for unlocked Surface Duos in North America and Europe, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/01/24/surface-duo-android-11-ota/"&gt;as reported by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3WUrd"&gt;Not every Surface Duo will be getting the update right away; if you have a Surface Duo that’s tied to AT&amp;amp;T, it sounds like you’re going to have to wait just a bit longer. “For locked or unlocked AT&amp;amp;T Surface Duos, we are testing this release and it is pending final validation,” according to &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/surface-duo-update-history-fe857377-c3ae-12f6-98e9-32982b5665f1"&gt;Microsoft’s page about the update&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VpTWVW"&gt;Now, the wait begins for Android 12 — which still hasn’t arrived on the Surface Duo 2. However, &lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-fails-deliver-android-11-surface-duo-end-2021"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Windows Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft apparently plans to bring Android 12L, which is designed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22824287/google-android-12-beta-1-release-large-screen-devices-tablet-pixel"&gt;improve the Android 12 experience on bigger screens&lt;/a&gt;, to Surface Duo devices at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA’s revolutionary James Webb Space Telescope reaches final orbit in space</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9Th29BuWF7nJLQiMNgVYQaHDiGc=/0x59:1060x766/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70426687/webb_artists_conception.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d8Kd2l"&gt;After traveling hundreds of thousands of miles through space over the last month, NASA’s revolutionary new James Webb Space Telescope &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2022/01/24/orbital-insertion-burn-a-success-webb-arrives-at-l2/"&gt;performed its last big course correction maneuver&lt;/a&gt; this afternoon, putting itself into its final resting place in space. Now, the observatory will live in perpetuity at a distance of roughly 1 million miles from the Earth, giving the vehicle a front-row view of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22789561/nasa-jwst-james-webb-space-telescope-priorities-astronomy-astrophysics-exoplanets"&gt;most ancient stars and galaxies of the Universe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jJnvM2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/25/22850167/james-webb-space-telescope-jwst-launch-mission-success"&gt;Launched on Christmas Day&lt;/a&gt;, NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST, has had a wild ride to its destination. Too enormous to fly to space in its final form, the telescope had to launch folded up inside its rocket. Once it reached space, JWST began an extremely complex routine of shape-shifting and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22857571/nasa-jwst-space-telescope-sunshield-deployment-success"&gt;unfurling&lt;/a&gt;, a type of choreography that no spacecraft had ever performed before. Yet JWST performed every step flawlessly, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/8/22873592/james-webb-telescope-final-mirror-deployment-conclusion"&gt;completing its major deployments on January 8th&lt;/a&gt; and blossoming into its full configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="opfX0v"&gt;&lt;q&gt;live in perpetuity at roughly 1 million miles from the Earth&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hGKC4k"&gt;Plenty of anxiety surrounded those deployments, as they &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to work as planned; one failure could have jeopardized JWST’s entire mission. But the mission team’s unease didn’t end when unfurling was complete. JWST still had to get into its final position in space in order to do its job properly. If the observatory didn’t slow down just right today, the vehicle ran the risk of getting into the wrong orbit or missing its target trajectory completely. Such a failure could have complicated the mission’s future, making it incredibly difficult for scientists to communicate with the nearly $10 billion space observatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jSFfty"&gt;Fortunately, JWST performed this last maneuver flawlessly. “During the past month, JWST has achieved amazing success and is a tribute to all the folks who spent many years and even decades to ensure mission success,” Bill Ochs, the JWST project manager at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IfdppA"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6cUe4oMk69E?rel=0&amp;amp;list=TLGG8tIphgpDAHkyNDAxMjAyMg" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zpYFeZ"&gt;Though it’s been a month getting to this point, it didn’t take long for JWST to put itself into its final destination this afternoon. At around 2PM ET, JWST fired its onboard thrusters for roughly 5 minutes. It was the last of three course correction burns that JWST has done, slowing the spacecraft down enough to put it into a very precise orbit in space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ctkr8k"&gt;JWST is now orbiting around an invisible point in space known as an Earth-Sun Lagrange point. It’s a somewhat mystical area of space where the gravity and centripetal forces of the Sun and the Earth are just right, allowing objects to remain in a relatively “stable” position. “There’s a little tug of war going on where [gravity] balances out perfectly,” Jean-Paul Pinaud, the ground operations delta-V lead at Northrop Grumman, the primary contractor of JWST, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “So nobody wins that tug of war.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="uTckvj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s a little tug of war going on where [gravity] balances out perfectly.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vD8CnX"&gt;The Sun and the Earth share five of these Lagrange points, peppered around our planet. There’s one directly in between the Earth and the Sun and one on the opposite side of our star from us. JWST is orbiting around one Lagrangian point located on the far side of the Earth further from the Sun, called L2. In this position, as Earth moves around the star, JWST will follow the planet almost in lockstep, like a constant companion always in the same location in relation to our planet. No matter where Earth is on its course around the Sun, JWST is guaranteed to be about 1 million miles away from us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8G8ypI"&gt;The track that JWST is taking around L2 is actually fairly wide, stretching roughly the distance between the Earth and the Moon. But the observatory can’t stay on that trajectory forever without some help. L2 is what’s known as “pseudo” stable, meaning objects that orbit this location will have a tendency to drift away in one direction. “It’s like sitting on a saddle of a horse,” Pinaud says. “On a saddle of a horse, you’re kind of stable. Imagine yourself as being a marble... from head to tail, you’ll probably roll down to the center, but then once you go to either side of the saddle, you’re just gonna fall to the ground.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TN24dnCbn2cdMC2N8C5QgBXoAWQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23191693/754_990528.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ead6Ry"&gt;So JWST will have to make small adjustments to its path over its lifetime. Every 20 days or so, the telescope will fire its thrusters for two to three minutes at a time to ensure that it stays on track in its orbit. Ultimately, these adjustments will determine how long JWST can stay active in space. When the propellant runs out in the next 10 to 20 years, that’s when the observatory’s mission will end. (Luckily, JWST’s ride to space, the Ariane 5 rocket, put it on such a great trajectory that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/29/22858406/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-mission"&gt;the telescope’s lifespan will last way longer than originally predicted&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FuB9Hm"&gt;It may seem like a complicated position, with a lot of extra effort needed to keep JWST stable. But L2 is a pretty attractive place for this observatory for a variety of reasons. Perhaps the biggest advantage is how far away it is from both the Earth and the Sun. JWST was made to collect infrared light, a type of light that is associated with heat. Because of this design choice, the telescope must remain extremely cold at all times. That’s why it’s equipped with a sunshield that will always be facing the Sun, a protective umbrella that will reflect the star’s heat and keep the telescope extra frigid. Still, any nearby object emitting heat and infrared light could muck up JWST’s observations if NASA isn’t careful. By putting the telescope nearly 1 million miles away from our planet, NASA is guaranteeing that the infrared light coming from the Earth and the Moon will not interfere or heat up the telescope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="agzTg2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;L2 is a pretty attractive place for this observatory&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kfQtkV"&gt;L2 is also great from a power standpoint because one side of JWST will always be facing the Sun. On that heated side, the telescope has a solar panel that is constantly gathering sunlight for power. Other spacecraft, such as the Hubble Space Telescope in orbit around Earth, don’t have that luxury. Whenever Hubble orbits on the nightside of Earth, it loses the view of the Sun and must store power in its batteries. That will never be the case for JWST. “We have basically limitless power for mission operations, and we don’t have to worry about any eclipses,” Kyle Hott, the mission systems engineering lead for JWST at Northrop Grumman, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y6sb6b"&gt;There are also some downsides of constantly switching between day and night when orbiting the Earth; the extreme fluctuations in temperature can jostle and vibrate a spacecraft, causing its instruments to degrade over time. JWST will operate at roughly the same temperatures all throughout its lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hxGWdP"&gt;And then there is the benefit of continuous communication. With L2 always in the same position relative to Earth, JWST will be a set distance away from our planet at all times. That means we can be in constant contact with the observatory. “We can sort of be tugged along at L2 by the Earth-Sun system, such that we have that nice convenient constant communications with the vehicle,” says Hott. “And so that simplifies just a lot of the mission operations as well.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="16PFKg"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="How the James Webb Space Telescope will revolutionize astrophysics|105132" data-volume-uuid="10e6068e6" data-volume-id="105132" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-939" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gOeFPL"&gt;This crucial finale caps off the observatory’s risky journey through the cosmos, paving the way for the science to finally begin. We still have to wait some more for JWST’s observations to get underway, though. Scientists and engineers will soon start aligning the telescope’s mirrors ever so precisely before commissioning the observatory, testing out all of its instruments to make sure they’re ready to collect the first extraordinary images of the most ancient stars and galaxies in the Universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wJ1cMm"&gt;That process will take many months, but if it goes well, the first historical images captured by JWST could be beamed back to Earth as soon as this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla Cybertruck walkaround video shows the absurdly huge windshield wiper in detail</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MPqXh-zvhT2qar2CEj4vgr-sF9M=/0x40:1429x993/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70426636/Tesla_Cybertruck_leak_photo.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even in handheld video, the truck looks a little unreal.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Cybertruck Owners Club&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F4INAK"&gt;We got the closest look yet at an alleged prototype of the Tesla Cybertruck, thanks to a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHT040_Pt3w"&gt;walkaround video&lt;/a&gt; posted to the &lt;a href="https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/forum/threads/cybertruck-photos-leaked-%F0%9F%93%B8-added-video-showing-whole-truck-rear-bed.4660/"&gt;Cybertruck Owners Club forum&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2022/01/24/tesla-cybertruck-prototype-shown-in-detail-in-new-leaked-walkaround-video/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). We get to see a good deal of the vehicle, including its giant windshield and wiper. You can watch the whole thing below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BXb84A"&gt;We &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828220/tesla-cybertruck-prototype-drone-shot-windshield-wiper-elon-musk"&gt;saw the wiper last month&lt;/a&gt; when a drone video captured a Cybertruck doing laps on the company’s test track in Fremont, California. Tesla CEO Elon Musk commented on the wiper at the time, saying that it troubled him and that a wiper you could stow away in the front trunk would be “ideal, but complex.” (Is getting out in the rain, sleet, or snow to put on your windshield wiper &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;ideal, though?)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YD8MRP79jMfagBqU1Lh-7ak4QLw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23191536/Screen_Shot_2022_01_24_at_09.55.31.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: CybertruckOwnersClub.com&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The person in the video seems to express doubt that it can clean the entire windshield but is assured it can.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bgIGP6"&gt;The video shows the rest of the truck as the person walks around it, giving us a look at the wheels, tailgate, and bed. It’s been said before, but the Cybertruck still looks a little unreal to me with its stainless steel finish and trapezoidal shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bWFAOK"&gt;Unlike the version shown off during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20975475/tesla-cybertruck-announcement-musk-electric-truck-pickup-features-range-price-release-date"&gt;Tesla’s 2019 announcement event&lt;/a&gt;, this version of the truck doesn’t have any door handles. How to open the doors was a topic of discussion while the video was being filmed, according to the subtitles. (The actual audio isn’t included, so it’s not clear if that’s actually what’s being said.) It seems to be explained that you can tap your phone or a keycard on a specific sensor, and the door will open. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zPPZeKpUJTyCViclvWPJvPS4lHk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23191540/Screen_Shot_2022_01_24_at_09.56.47.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: CybertruckOwnersClub.com&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The rear quarter-panel shot. Earlier in the video, you can see that this particular truck has a hitch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lFmDxK"&gt;The subtitles also indicate that the truck is a “concept,” so the version that actually ends up going out to consumers may be different. The subtitles also capture a funny comment from someone present: “Man, tell Elon he doing too much,” going on to compare the truck to a stainless steel fridge that you’d “put your produce” in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aaygwj"&gt;The Cybertruck was supposed to start shipping this year but has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/13/22881646/tesla-cybertruck-production-date-2022-removed-website"&gt;reportedly been delayed until early 2023&lt;/a&gt; — those reports are backed up by the fact that Tesla removed references to 2022 from the Cybertruck’s webpage. In theory, an official timeline should be coming soon as Elon Musk has promised to share a “product roadmap update” on Wednesday’s earnings call.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T’s new 5-gig and 2-gig fiber internet is here, starting at $110 a month</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K66hn1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://about.att.com/aboutus/pressrelease/2022/fastest-major-internet-provider.html"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T is rolling out 2Gbps and 5Gbps&lt;/a&gt; speed tiers for its &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.att.com/internet/fiber/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fiber-optic internet option&lt;/a&gt;. The company made the announcement to kick off its Life Gigified event, where it said new and existing AT&amp;amp;T Fiber customers will soon be able to take advantage of these multi-gig connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xUOSaz"&gt;If you don’t know what multi-gig is, it means a single connection that offers speeds higher than 1Gbps. And because it’s a fiber-optic connection, this speed goes both ways. “It’s symmetrical; your upload and download speeds are the same.” Chris Sambar, AT&amp;amp;T’s executive vice president of technology operations said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rQf68L"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s new multi-gig speeds need Wi-Fi 6 technology for “optimal” performance, which means you’ll probably want to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21283756/arris-surfboard-max-pro-wi-fi-6-mesh-router-review-price-specs-features"&gt;upgrade your router&lt;/a&gt;. But Sambar told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it will supply customers with its multi-gig and Wi-Fi 6 capable &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.att.com/support/article/u-verse-high-speed-internet/KM1395833/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BGW320 gateway&lt;/a&gt; when you sign up for its fiber-optic service, so you won’t have to buy any new equipment. AT&amp;amp;T may offer even faster speeds eventually; the company says it reached speeds of 10Gbps in a lab environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="58w0YC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The 2Gbps plan will cost $110 / month, while the 5Gbps plan is priced at $180 / month&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qlytlu"&gt;The 2Gbps plan will cost $110 / month, while the 5Gbps plan is priced at $180 / month. Business plans will cost a bit more, however, at $225 / month for 2Gbps and $395 / month for 5Gbps. AT&amp;amp;T is also introducing “straightforward pricing” for all of its Fiber plans, which it says will eliminate equipment fees, annual contracts, data caps, and 12-month price increases for new customers. Its new plans come with a free HBO Max subscription as well as &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.att.com/security/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ActiveArmor&lt;/a&gt;, AT&amp;amp;T’s cybersecurity service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBVu5e"&gt;These new speed tiers will be available in over 70 metro areas, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Dallas. AT&amp;amp;T &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.att.com/internet/gigapower/coverage-map/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently offers its fiber-optic network&lt;/a&gt; near cities spread out across the Southern, Midwestern, and Western portions of the US, but it plans to expand its service network to 30 million customers by 2025. Sambar says the locations that support multi-gig speeds will have access to both 2Gbps and 5Gbps plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1nA9Q5"&gt;Previously, AT&amp;amp;T’s fiber-optic speeds ranged from 300Mbps to 1Gbps. Its move into multi-gig territory follows &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21437958/google-fiber-2-gig-gbps-internet-nashville-huntsville-speed-webpass-pilot"&gt;Google Fiber’s 2Gbps rollout&lt;/a&gt; in 2020 as well as Comcast’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xfinity.com%2Flearn%2Foffers%2Fdetails%3FofferId%3D9626100376&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F24%2F22898876%2Fatt-fiber-multi-gig-connections-speeds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;3Gbps offering for $299 / month&lt;/a&gt;. AT&amp;amp;T offers more information about the new speeds &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/http://att.com/hypergig" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on its site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LSi9Mk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 24th 1:20PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to add a statement and additional context from Chris Sambar, executive vice president of AT&amp;amp;T’s technology operations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
