    <title>Withings’ latest hybrid smartwatch poses as a luxury dive watch</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Withings ScanWatch Horizon showing SpO2&amp;nbsp;oxygen saturation.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Withings&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="l1ktWe"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.withings.com%2Fnl%2Fen%2Fscanwatch-horizon&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F29%2F22697955%2Fwithings-scanwatch-horizon-sleep-apnea-afib-smartwatch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ScanWatch Horizon&lt;/a&gt; is Withings’ latest hybrid smartwatch to combine a digital display with a traditional mechanical format. You buy a Withings because you hate the look of typical health-focused wearables and abhor the bombardment of notifications that plague other smartwatches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PJ9ugj"&gt;Withings says it took design inspiration for the ScanWatch Horizon from “luxury dive watches” like the &lt;a href="https://www.rolex.com/watches/submariner.html"&gt;Submariner&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.omegawatches.com/watches/seamaster/diver-300-m/gents-collection/product"&gt;Seamaster&lt;/a&gt; — influences that can be seen in the reflection-free sapphire-glass casing with titanium finish, a stainless-steel rotating bezel, and &lt;a href="https://image-cache.withings.com/site/media/wi_products/scanwatch-horizon-43b-luminova.png?&amp;amp;h=1000"&gt;luminescent watch hands and indicators&lt;/a&gt; for visibility in low light. Its water resistance is only rated at 10 ATM, however, making it ill-suited for deep dives. But it should be fine for swimming, surfing, snorkeling, and other water activities above 100 meters (330 feet). Dive watches from Rolex and Omega are typically waterproof at a depth of up to 300 meters (980 feet).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H3e64K5Qtb34lNwHsy35b35-V2o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884156/WiThings_Horizon_Retouch_AQUA_SILICONE_GREEN_CALORIES_FR.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ScanWatch Horizon in green. Though inspired by dive watches, it’s not waterproof enough for diving.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oIIdbk"&gt;As a fitness tracker, the ScanWatch Horizon can automatically recognize and track more than 30 activities, including walking, running, swimming, and cycling. It’s fitted with Bluetooth to use your phone’s GPS to track your routes, with a battery that can last up to 30 days before needing a recharge. Collected data is synced back to the Withings Health Mate (&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id542701020?pt=131936"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.withings.wiscale2"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;) app on your phone, where performance can be monitored or linked to Apple Health, Google Fit, Strava, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nmTVXj4y-VQxD9bFnvXuvKsM-1E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22886964/scanwatch_horizon_43b_lifestyle_side.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Withings ScanWatch Horizon from the side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3pubN2"&gt;The watch comes slathered in sensors to measure heart rate and blood oxygen to assess your estimated VO2 Max fitness level. It can also prompt a wearer to record a 30-second “medical grade” ECG when it detects signs of an irregular heart rhythm. The ScanWatch Horizon also tracks sleep. And like the original ScanWatch announced last year, the Horizon can detect and warn wearers of possible disorders that might indicate sleep apnea, a condition where breathing stops during sleep. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TCZPV8"&gt;Notably, the ECG claims are holding up both the ScanWatch and ScanWatch Horizon from going on sale in the US since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/13/17855006/apple-watch-series-4-ekg-fda-approved-vs-cleared-meaning-safe"&gt;FDA Clearance&lt;/a&gt; is required. Withings initially expected clearance in 2020, but these “unusual times” have created a delay, according to the company. Withings says that it’s in regular contact with the FDA and now expects approval “within weeks.” It already has &lt;a href="https://support.withings.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013982637"&gt;regulatory approval in Europe, Australia, and the UK&lt;/a&gt;, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AVD3Rm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ibF7ki"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tc67Zd"&gt;Remember, as we said in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21455863/withings-scanwatch-review-health-sleep-features-price"&gt;science-based review of the Withings ScanWatch hybrid&lt;/a&gt;, doctors don’t trust smartwatches alone to detect sleep apnea&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; and neither should you. And while blood oxygen is an important metric to monitor patients with COVID-19, wrist-worn sensors like this lack the accuracy of pulse oximeters that take measurements on a finger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X7cJcP"&gt;The ScanWatch Horizon is available today in the UK, France, and Germany for €499.95/£499.95. Withings says it should be available in the US sometime in Q4 2021, by which time it expects to have FDA Clearance.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPhone 13 ‘unlock with Apple Watch’ bug fixed in iOS beta</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The buttons are unchanged on the Apple Watch Series 6" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v2L1cr9xo_3HsyPQNPHTY9v9Cs8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69924432/vpavic_200929_4216_0111.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cYRrZl"&gt;Apple has reportedly fixed the issue that broke the “unlock with Apple Watch” feature on iPhone 13 models. The feature, which lets Apple Watch users unlock their iPhones without a password when wearing a mask, now works again as of the second iOS 15.1 beta, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/28/ios-15-1-beta-2-fixes-unlock-with-apple-watch-bug-for-iphone-13-users/"&gt;as reported by &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yH0EIC"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/26/22694679/apple-fix-issue-unlock-apple-watch-feature-iphone-13"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; on its support page a few days ago that it was working on this problem. I’ve run into the issue myself on my personal iPhone 13 Pro and can confirm that it’s been pretty annoying after having gotten used to the feature since it was introduced earlier this year. Newer iPhones don’t have fingerprint readers, so the only way to unlock them when your mask interferes with Face ID is by using a password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ftf1oh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iOS 15 is here, but we’re still waiting on a few new features","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684483/ios-15-announced-features-shareplay-airpods-universal-control"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="PWIhrY"&gt;There’s no word on when iOS 15.1 will be released to the public, but it’ll likely contain more than just this fix. SharePlay, one of the most vaunted new additions to the OS back when it was announced at WWDC in June, missed the original iOS 15 release but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686897/ios-15-1-beta-shareplay-feature-announced-removed-coming-soon-vaccine-card"&gt;appeared in the first 15.1 beta&lt;/a&gt;. The feature lets you share music and video content over a FaceTime call. iOS 15.1 also looks set to allow you to add proof of vaccination status to the Wallet app.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Astro is ‘terrible’ and will ‘throw itself down’ stairs, developers reportedly claim</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZsjNiQvHf2kpkkqJrR1eXOb2pKU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69923157/amazon_astro_home_robot_4773_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When you see a flight of stairs.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xaEiqf"&gt;Some of the people building Amazon’s Astro home robot are not impressed with it, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93ypp8/leaked-documents-amazon-astro-surveillance-robot-tracking"&gt;according to a report by &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. One person who worked on the robot, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22697244/amazon-astro-home-robot-hands-on-features-price"&gt;was announced today&lt;/a&gt;, reportedly called it a “disaster that’s not ready for release,” while another said it was “terrible,” and the idea that it’d be a useful accessibility device (part of Amazon’s pitch is that Astro can help with elder care) was “absurdist nonsense.” The sources also mentioned that the bot doesn’t handle stairs well, with one even saying that it would “throw itself down” them “if presented the opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0wMrR"&gt;To make matters worse, &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; also reports that the robot is fragile and that several devices had broken. That’s not great news for a $1,000 (or $1,449) robot that lives on the floor, where it’s prone to being stepped on by children, kicked by inattentive adults, or attacked by pets displeased with its presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2dtkw"&gt;After the publication of this article, Amazon sent a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; and suggested the documents cited in the story were outdated and that the characterizations don’t reflect how well Astro works today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7Mz2z9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Astro is always watching&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sJBBVd"&gt;Leaked documents and videos of developer meetings obtained by &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; also show that Astro is doing a lot of surveillance with its facial recognition systems, and the feature where it follows people around if it doesn’t recognize them. &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;’s sources say that it’s not great at actually figuring out who people are, which could lead to Astro annoyingly nipping at the heels of people it should know. One of the people who worked on it called its data collection “a privacy nightmare.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KGxqWN"&gt;Here is Amazon’s statement in response to this story:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="9Oqq9N"&gt;&lt;em&gt;These characterizations of Astro’s performance, mast, and safety systems are simply inaccurate. Astro went through rigorous testing on both quality and safety, including tens of thousands of hours of testing with beta participants. This includes comprehensive testing on Astro’s advanced safety system, which is designed to avoid objects, detect stairs, and stop the device where and when necessary.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="aXU5Uq"&gt; It’s not necessarily surprising that Astro is always watching, though — it comes with a Ring Protect Pro subscription, and Amazon’s own marketing for the robot shows off that it can be used as a security device (but in the context of wild animals entering your home rather than people). The most surprising thing is that we’re seeing leaked documents, videos, and hearing from grudging developers on the&lt;em&gt; same day &lt;/em&gt;the device was announced. Someone, or multiple someones, inside Amazon must not be swayed by the robot’s charms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Gib41L"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sj1t3msy8dc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yizb2o"&gt;The leak also somewhat recontextualizes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22698401/amazon-astro-invite-preorder-how-to-info-early-access-price"&gt;Amazon’s invite-based rollout&lt;/a&gt;. You currently can’t just buy the robot, you have to request an invite, a process which requires filling out a survey to indicate whether your house would be a good fit for Astro (which includes a question about what style stairs you have). It’s possible Amazon is trying to put these bots into the best case scenario, to see if they can even survive that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5dWF3A"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 10:10PM ET, Sept 28th: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated with statement from Amazon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Was Elizabeth Holmes like Steve Jobs? Her emails say no</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Theranos Trial" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BDmWnAddAH3ty131inBf-can1eU=/0x0:3909x2606/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69923754/1341968233.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Jane Tyska/Digital First Media/The Mercury News via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A Steve Jobs biography makes an appearance in court — but it doesn’t explain Theranos’ problems&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="0kcX9n"&gt;Lance Wade didn’t say “snitches get stitches” out loud, but with his behavior in the courtroom today he didn’t have to. It’s the most aggressive performance we’ve seen so far from Elizabeth Holmes’ defense attorney, and that’s probably because the latest testimony is &lt;em&gt;just that bad&lt;/em&gt; for Holmes’ case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RCnvlC"&gt;On the stand today was former Theranos lab director Adam Rosendorff, who was responsible for the lab where patient results were processed. In his opening statement, Wade was clear that he was prepared to blame Theranos lab directors — including Rosendorff — for many of the company’s problems. His questioning of Rosendorff drew two successful objections from the government, for argumentativeness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="T9TxGi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Had Rosendorff been coached by the government on his answers?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HW6lX1"&gt;Until now, the defense used a softer approach. Faced with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676789/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-wire-fraud-erika-cheung-whistleblower"&gt;whistleblower Erika Cheung&lt;/a&gt;, Holmes’ lawyers didn’t try to demolish her credibility. Wade was solicitous, even kind — and used her to introduce some documents and testimony that would bolster his client’s case. With Surekha Gangakhedkar, who worked in R&amp;amp;D and helped develop many of the company’s tests, Wade &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22687026/theranos-patient-bad-test-miscarriage-pregnancy"&gt;introduced evidence suggesting that Holmes was a thoughtful boss&lt;/a&gt;, one who even tried to talk Gangakhedkar out of quitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fkrO2E"&gt;But today, Wade appeared trapped from the beginning of his cross-examination. Rosendorff’s testimony earlier in the day had brought into evidence emails that looked awful for Holmes, who is on trial for wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. They showed Rosendorff getting increasingly frustrated with the tests, management, and Holmes’ brother, Christian, who’d been inserted between Rosendorff and complaining doctors. Perhaps that’s why Wade began by aggressively attacking Rosendorff’s credibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H0zyyS"&gt;Wade listed a number of federal agents — with the FBI, the Postal Service, and the FDA — that Rosendorff had been in a room with, and seemed consternated that Rosendorff didn’t remember all their names. (In some cases, Rosendorff testified, those agents hadn’t even spoken to him.) Had Rosendorff been coached by the government on his answers? Wade demanded, nearly shouting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HpmVsH"&gt;Wade did manage to score some points, like when he got Rosendorff to say that Holmes never told him to report an inaccurate result. He showed that Rosendorff had previously answered a question about why he’d left Theranos slightly differently while under oath two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oeRJa1"&gt;Wade also got Rosendorff to say that the patient launch we’d heard about last week — the one Rosendorff wanted to delay — was for friends and family only. I’m not sure that soft launch testimony helped Wade, though. After all, wouldn’t friends and family be &lt;em&gt;more &lt;/em&gt;understanding if the company needed extra time to get things right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="1O35dF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Wade held up Walter Isaacson’s biography of Jobs as he asked questions&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XzyOqP"&gt;The tone shifted after we returned from a brief break. (Lawyers often read reporters’ live-tweets of their trials, as well as our stories. Hi, Lance!)  Wade began to portray Holmes as a Steve Jobs-like marketing genius. Noticeably quieter and friendlier to Rosendorff, he got the former lab director to say part of the reason he’d joined Theranos was because he thought it would be the next Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jpj4nx"&gt;Wade held up Walter Isaacson’s biography of Jobs, which Rosendorff said he’d read, as he asked questions. Part of Apple’s success was its intense focus on marketing, right? (Chiat Day, which later worked with Theranos, came up with Apple’s “Think different.”) And Apple was crazy-focused on secrecy, right? Judge Edward Davila interrupted this line of questioning to say “this isn’t the time for a book report,” but by that point Wade had hit the highlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HfMipR"&gt;There was, however, a &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; problem for the Steve Jobs metaphor: Elizabeth Holmes’ brother, Christian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="RxxB87"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You handled this excellently,” Holmes wrote to her brother&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rRvc0R"&gt;In one email chain, Christian — who had no medical or scientific background — appeared to be usurping Rosendorff’s role as lab director when a customer service rep asked &lt;em&gt;Christian&lt;/em&gt;, not Rosendorff, whether to approve a second draw for a failed test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ocUyy"&gt;In another email chain, a doctor wrote that a cholesterol test didn’t add up. Rosendorff wrote to Christian that something was wrong with the test. In response, Christian gave Rosendorff a paragraph of explanation to give to the doctor. Rosendorff rejected it, saying he wouldn’t defend the test. In response, Christian chastised him — and received an “attaboy!” email from his sister. “You handled this excellently,” Holmes wrote to her brother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VByMxW"&gt;Thanks to this meddling, Rosendorff seemed like he was at the end of his rope: “100% honesty and transparency to the patient is essential,” he wrote to Christian. “My first duty is not to Theranos but to the patient as per my Hippocratic oath ‘premium non nocere.’” Christian forwarded this to Holmes and Sunny Balwani, Holmes’ co-defendant who is being tried separately. Rosendorff ended up sparing the patient from another Theranos fingerprick and using an FDA-approved venous draw test instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y7jWut"&gt;In another set of emails, Rosendorff said he felt out of the loop on what the company was doing. He asked to be taken off the lab’s license. “I am feeling pressured to vouch for results I cannot be confident in,” he wrote to Holmes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yweg6V"&gt;In response, she wrote, “How sad and disappointing to see this from you.” She said he hadn’t raised his concerns before — not true, as we’ve seen emails of him doing it and cc’ing her in. Rosendorff also testified Friday to meeting with Holmes about his concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="i89RKM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Are you both comfortable with this?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="llF1dU"&gt;It wasn’t just a few bad tests that needed to be kept quiet. Theranos appeared secretive to the point of fooling public health officials — with Holmes’ blessing. When auditors from the California Department of Public Health were scheduled to visit the lab, Holmes emailed Rosendorff and Balwani, among others, to find out where they’d be walking. The day of the inspection, no one was to go into or out of Normandy, the lab where the Edison machines were kept, Rosendorff testified. To his knowledge, the auditors didn’t see an Edison device that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w6k0U4"&gt;Legally, labs are required to do proficiency testing, which is meant to ensure accurate results. Rosendorff “felt management was paying lip service to this issue,” he said. He testified that he received no resources or support for his proficiency testing plans. Nothing changed by the time he left, either. Rosendorff forwarded an email about this to his Gmail account, in case he might need it later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xlhfp0"&gt;Eventually, he found another job and gave notice, staying on for a while so they could find another lab director. During that time, in November 2014, there was another bad test result. Rosendorff was blunt, telling Holmes and Balwani that the test’s accuracy was in question. “Are you both comfortable with this?” he wrote in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RYWaD0"&gt;In response, Balwani essentially dismissed Rosendorff’s concerns. Rosendorff forwarded that response to Holmes, writing, “I find Sunny’s response offensive and disingenuous. He should apologize.” Holmes then forwarded that email to Balwani, saying that they should “cut him Monday,” which Rosendorff interpreted to mean that they should fire him rather than let him serve out his last few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KePKq5"&gt;Sure, Rosendorff talked to the feds and knew roughly what questions he’d be asked. Yes, the launch Rosendorff had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22692600/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-bad-tests-complaints"&gt;testified to on Friday&lt;/a&gt; was a “soft launch.” But that doesn’t speak to email after email of patient complaints, or to Rosendorff’s increasingly blunt efforts to address bad tests. It certainly doesn’t explain Christian Holmes’ involvement, or why his sister was praising him for slapping down Rosendorff, her lab director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="40my6Z"&gt;Rosendorff’s cross-examination will continue tomorrow. But so far, not much has been produced to undermine him — and the emails that have been introduced bolster him. They also raise a lot of questions about Elizabeth Holmes’ credibility, and that’s going to be hard to explain away.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can change your Nest doorbell ringtone starting next month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ohtAG343In_ivBv5sb0gLJu1Ms0=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69923440/dseifert_4748_nest_doorbell_cam_battery_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can soon set your Nest doorbell to cackle at your visitors.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZnkQBc"&gt;Google Nest is bringing back seasonal ringtones for its video doorbells, which now include the Nest Doorbell (wired) — previously known as Nest Hello — and the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22609444/google-nest-cam-indoor-floodlight-doorbell-price-specs-news"&gt;Nest Doorbell (battery)&lt;/a&gt;. First up are Halloween-inspired tones, which will stick around through October, then the winter holiday-themed options arrive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PJAZfl"&gt;For the past three years Nest has offered them, the ringtones have disappeared following the holidays, leaving you with the standard ding dong. But this year, the new Nest Doorbell will also get six “evergreen” ringtones that are usable year-round. They will arrive with the Halloween options, but Google tells me they aren’t coming to the older Nest Doorbell (wired).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="54xcii"&gt;The spooky-themed ringtones should arrive on October 1st and will be available on both buzzers through October 31st. Fortunately, you don’t need a paid Nest Aware subscription to greet your guests with one of the tones, which include an evil laugh, a skeleton dance, a spooky raven, a boo from a ghost, a howling werewolf, a cackling witch, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J3ZfUV"&gt;The tones will ring both from the doorbell itself and on any Google Nest speakers or smart displays you have in your home. You can select the ringtone you want in the settings of the Google Home App for Nest Doorbell (battery) or the Nest App for the Nest Doorbell (wired). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="CaDgnv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10779176"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8JpkVl"&gt;If you want to get spookier, Google Nest speakers and displays can also play an hour-long playlist of Halloween-themed sounds and music. Just say, “Hey Google, let’s get spooky.” And you can play a Halloween-themed game on a Nest Hub or Nest Hub Max. Say, “Hey Google, tell me a Halloween riddle,” and enter a Riddle Room adventure with a spooky twist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CXhxtL"&gt;After Halloween is over on November 1st, your doorbell will automatically go back to the default tone. You can go into the app and choose a new seasonal theme until the end of December, or if you have the Nest Hello (battery) you can pick one of the new year-round options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2HI8as"&gt;Last year the holiday-themed options included a dozen or so tones related to Christmas, Hanukkah, New Year’s, and Kwanzaa. It seems likely that we can expect to see similar options this year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Astro cannot fetch your beer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0wQtqw77VyCBXI2s38ZOMEWlO2E=/300x16:1790x1009/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69923391/Capto_Capture_2021_09_28_06_31_38_PM.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Astro did not put that beer there!&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6EZDmO"&gt;Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22697244/amazon-astro-home-robot-hands-on-features-price"&gt;introduced a new robot today&lt;/a&gt; with the face of an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review"&gt;Echo Show&lt;/a&gt;, the sensor-laden body of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22617175/starship-technologies-delivery-robots-college-campuses"&gt;Panera Bread delivery bot&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj1t3msy8dc"&gt;pair of cupholders for a trunk&lt;/a&gt;. The instant it was announced, people clamored for a reason for its existence beyond “mobile camera with a cute face” and “potentially invasive surveillance drone.” Most seemed to settle on “beer fetcher.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ApQR9f"&gt;But friend, a pair of cupholders does not a robowaiter make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iWsRrv"&gt;While the $1,000 Astro could very well have a wide variety of capabilities beyond home surveillance, it’s not gonna be fetching you anything. For one, it reportedly sucks. “Astro is terrible and will almost certainly throw itself down a flight of stairs if presented the opportunity,” &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93ypp8/leaked-documents-amazon-astro-surveillance-robot-tracking"&gt;a source who claimed to work on the project told Vice&lt;/a&gt;. Another source told Vice “it’s a disaster that’s not ready for release.” A robot more prone to tossing itself into the void than performing expected functions is not gonna be grabbing that Heineken from the fridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PKXcFi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The real problem is the robot has no arms&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w4SF9R"&gt;It’s also unclear how well it can see anything. Google and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22642017/snapchat-scan-feature-ar-camera-visual-search"&gt;Snapchat&lt;/a&gt; have both heavily invested in creating a way for computers to interpret the real world without guideposts like bar codes. Amazon has not. It might be the maker of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18197137/amazon-rekognition-facial-recognition-bias-race-gender"&gt;Rekognition&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/10/21287101/amazon-rekognition-facial-recognition-police-ban-one-year-ai-racial-bias"&gt;controversial facial recognition service&lt;/a&gt;, but its Ring ecosystem only got the ability to recognize packages... &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22691923/ring-video-doorbell-package-alerts-amazon-event"&gt;today&lt;/a&gt;. How long would it take Astro to recognize a beer? And what happens when that beer recognition technology fails? You could find yourself with a refreshing bottle of ranch dressing instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lVjW3j"&gt;But the biggest problem isn’t the reports that it sucks, or the failure to prove it can distinguish between the various contents of your fridge. The real problem is the robot has no arms!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QdXtcC"&gt;There is no way for it to open a fridge, freezer, or even a Yeti cooler. It can’t even open a door. It certainly cannot reach into a crowded fridge and pull out a cold one. I fear people assume it's got some Doc Ock arms tucked away behind its face or are hoping those two cupholders rise out of the robot to open the fridge via suction. They’ve seen the cupholders and assumed there is a way to get things into them that don’t involve someone in the other room helping out.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A view of the Astro robot approaching a woman. A beer rests in its cupholder." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2_C405yax8mfTzzbgpHb_FKA9oQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22886050/Capto_Capture_2021_09_28_06_21_08_PM.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who gave you that beer, Astro?!?!?!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vB5Nt6"&gt;But there isn’t. Currently, there appear to be no plans to build it a pair of grabbers — or even a single appendage. The payload area the cupholders occupy &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; have a USB-C port, though! Theoretically, someone could build an arm. That arm could replace the cupholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="umYNa9"&gt;But that arm does not yet exist. Unless you want to be shouting to housemates to stick a beer in your bot, the Astro will not be fetching you any kind of beverage. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk slams Biden as ‘not the friendliest’ after White House EV summit snub</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="biden (flickr)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D6Fgh09AQkJKm04XS-C6V1026uM=/1x0:1024x682/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69923202/biden.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="E7YdLQ"&gt;Tesla and SpaceX boss Elon Musk criticized President Joe Biden as “not the friendliest administration” after the White House snubbed his company last month. Musk’s comments came &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22698563/elon-musk-code-conference-liveblog"&gt;during a Code Conference interview&lt;/a&gt; and followed a tweet in which the Tesla CEO mocked Biden using similar insults as former President Donald Trump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="plBtCg"&gt;The Biden administration invited auto executives to the &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/08/05/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-steps-to-drive-american-leadership-forward-on-clean-cars-and-trucks/"&gt;White House last month&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the shared goal of increasing the production of electric vehicles. Top officials from Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis were invited. But Tesla, which is the largest EV maker in the world, was not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="P0nG0N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Controlled by the unions”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bDxax7"&gt;One potential reason that Tesla wasn’t invited is that its factory workforce is not unionized, while Biden is a big supporter of unions. During the Code interview, Musk went a step further, claiming that Biden’s administration was “controlled by the unions.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ifUYr2"&gt;Tesla has been actively fighting against an attempt to organize Tesla workers at the company’s Fremont, Calif. plant. Musk himself was found to have &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/9/30/20891314/elon-musk-tesla-labor-violation-nlrb"&gt;violated labor law&lt;/a&gt; when he tweeted anti-union comments in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="leVCqV"&gt;Musk has been tweaking Biden on Twitter for weeks. Last week, when asked why Biden didn’t issue a statement about SpaceX’s recent rocket launch, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1439665626914635783?s=20"&gt;Musk tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, “He’s still sleeping,” echoing a Trump nickname for Biden, “Sleepy Joe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T1i8Lp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 28th, 7:15PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BRBEzv"&gt;On Twitter, a top United Auto Workers official responded to Musk’s comments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3Vy4bn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;He needs to stop whining and just admit that workers should not have to punch out of democracy when they punch into work! Good leaders aren’t afraid of smart workers but embrace them!&lt;/p&gt;— Cindy Estrada (@CindyEstrada174) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CindyEstrada174/status/1442989024067657730?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk: ‘we probably don’t need’ NDAs for Tesla’s ‘Full Self-Driving’ beta</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a_Z6z5d9DFZt6KLos-ohsHk1hFQ=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69923196/REC_ASA3_CODE21_20210928_143813_0138.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Asa Mathat&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yhPZrE"&gt;Tesla has been making participants in the “Full Self-Driving” beta test &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7ezxq/how-teslas-self-driving-beta-testers-protect-the-company-from-critics"&gt;sign non-disclosure agreements&lt;/a&gt;, but CEO Elon Musk said Tuesday “we probably don’t need” them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84zWsv"&gt;The reason? “There’s a lot of videos” being shared of the beta software in action, Musk said on Tuesday during the 2021 Code Conference. “People don’t seem to listen to me” and are “just ignoring it anyway.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JGLfO4"&gt;“I don’t know why there’s an NDA,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o82iUX"&gt;Tesla has had a small group of owners testing out the beta version of its “Full Self-Driving” software — which, despite the name, does not make the company’s cars fully autonomous — on public roads for about a year now. But this week, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7ezxq/how-teslas-self-driving-beta-testers-protect-the-company-from-critics"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that the company makes participants in the program sign NDAs. These agreements even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22696463/tesla-fsd-beta-nda-video-clips-controversy-full-self-driving"&gt;discourage people from sharing footage&lt;/a&gt; of the beta software performing poorly because “there are a lot of people that want Tesla to fail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="a8cuDD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Tesla asks owners to share fewer clips of ‘Full Self-Driving’ beta mistakes","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22696463/tesla-fsd-beta-nda-video-clips-controversy-full-self-driving"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="B6eRsp"&gt;The details about the NDA — and Musk’s apparent reversal on using them — come as Tesla is set to rapidly expand the number of people who have access to the software, despite a recent warning for caution from the head of the National Transportation Safety Board. Musk and his company say that they are using the sensors in Tesla’s cars to make sure only safe drivers enter the program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cqdcae"&gt;“The transition period to new technology is always a little bumpy,” he said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iqtq22"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s research on kids even considered turning playdates into growth drivers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="facebook stock art" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XkF-lCaeg_52AmHx1o5Yy5Yzv1I=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69923121/acastro_180928_1777_facebook_hack_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="W1p7gL"&gt;Facebook’s interest in understanding and eventually acquiring younger users extends well beyond &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230822/facebook-messenger-kids-international-expansion-group-settings-friend-requests-supervised-friending"&gt;Messenger Kids&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696039/facebook-instagram-kids-app-pause-development-criticism"&gt;currently paused plans for a child-friendly Instagram&lt;/a&gt;. A new report in &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s series on Facebook’s internal research &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-instagram-kids-tweens-attract-11632849667"&gt;shows the company’s focus on kids goes much deeper&lt;/a&gt;, including studying children younger than four years old in the hopes of better designing future products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i6n5cm"&gt;The company’s child research is primarily motivated by the success of apps like TikTok and Snapchat in attracting younger users. “With the ubiquity of tablets and phones, kids are getting on the internet as young as six years old. We can’t ignore this and we have a responsibility to figure it out,” a confidential Facebook document viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reads. Another possible cause for concern: the &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;writes that the number of teenagers using Facebook daily has fallen 19 percent in the last two years and could drop an additional 45 percent by 2023, according to a document the publication saw. Suddenly, the directive to “imagine a Facebook experience designed for youth” makes more sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aENaAv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Children could be converted to Instagram and Facebook users down the road&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CpzZ5c"&gt;Facebook’s child research has led it down several paths. The company reportedly explored encouraging children to use Messenger Kids in person, according to a presentation the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; viewed called “Exploring playdates as a growth lever.” Facebook researchers have also tried to introduce a more holistic understanding of childhood by breaking things down into six age brackets: “adults, late teens ages 16 to maturity, teens ages 13 to 15, tweens ages 10 to 12, children ages 5 to 9 and young kids ages zero to four,” a slide mentioned in the report reads. One presentation set a goal of transitioning younger users from Instagram to the original Facebook, or the “Life Coach for Adulting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZmONm5"&gt;The idea that Facebook might consider newborns in its product decisions is an admittedly odd one. That the company has children in mind at all isn’t, though. As Instagram head Adam Mosseri notes in a statement included in &lt;em&gt;The Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s reporting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Vw4Vbf"&gt;It’s not new and it’s not a secret that social-media companies try to understand how teens and preteens use technology. Like all technology companies, of course, we want to appeal to the next generation, but that’s entirely different from the false assertion that we knowingly attempt to recruit people who aren’t old enough to use our apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="uilmzD"&gt;Facebook responded to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s reporting &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/explaining-research-to-support-families/"&gt;in a blog post published late Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, the company states that its age brackets are a taxonomy used by the “Age Appropriate Design Code and other policy experts” and that the “playdate” language it used was “an insensitive way to pose a serious question” and “doesn’t reflect its approach to building the app.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2g40JO"&gt;The possible effects Facebook’s products have on younger users are now coming to light. Earlier reporting on Facebook’s research shows that Instagram &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675130/facebook-instagram-teens-mental-health-damage-internal-research"&gt;can have negative impacts on younger users’ body image&lt;/a&gt;. Concern over how the app could potentially harm children is great enough that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675802/facebook-instagram-teens-harm-blumenthal-blackburn-markey-kids"&gt;Congress is getting involved&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696698/facebook-instagram-for-kids-mosseri-markey-blumenthal-blackburn-pause"&gt;Facebook representatives are slated to testify&lt;/a&gt; at a hearing this Thursday. Clearly, the social network will have plenty to answer for soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lcMDKR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 28th, 7:57PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added Facebook’s response to &lt;/em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;em&gt;report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk to Jeff Bezos: ‘you cannot sue your way to the Moon’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ThZhFqH38qPCftOp0eIwHCLtL2c=/36x0:2016x1320/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69923005/FAZxtkCVgAEXlov.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LtVatt"&gt;Elon Musk isn’t happy that fellow mega-billionaire Jeff Bezos keeps suing to stop SpaceX’s projects, and he shared a message for the Amazon founder during the 2021 Code Conference on Tuesday: “you cannot sue your way to the Moon, no matter how good your lawyers are.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DNScTE"&gt;Musk was responding to a question from journalist Kara Swisher about how Bezos’ space company, Blue Origin, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22623022/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-sue-nasa-lawsuit-hls-lunar-lander"&gt;recently sued to block a contract NASA gave SpaceX&lt;/a&gt; to develop a lunar lander. Amazon has also protested SpaceX’s Starlink internet satellites with the Federal Communications Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3r11gL"&gt;Swisher asked Musk Tuesday if he has spoken to Bezos about the legal fights. “Not verbally, just... subtweets,” Musk said. (In August, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22644158/elon-musk-jeff-bezos-spacex-blue-origin-lawsuits-complaints-starlink-tweet"&gt;Musk tweeted&lt;/a&gt;: “Turns out Besos [sic] retired in order to pursue a full-time job filing lawsuits against SpaceX …”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aUPdVe"&gt;Musk wasn’t all vinegar with regards to his billionaire space race cohort. When Swisher asked him about the suborbital flights that Bezos and Richard Branson recently took with their own companies, Musk said he “thought it was cool that they’re spending money on the advancement of space.” But, he was sure to point out, “suborbital is [just] a step in the direction of orbit.” &lt;/p&gt;
