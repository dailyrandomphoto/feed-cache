    <title>Apple’s concessions in China reportedly include a secret $275 billion deal and one odd change in Maps</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uuy4e9"&gt;Tim Cook has pushed Apple’s value within close range of $3 trillion, and a lot of that has to do with the former operations lead’s ability to manage a relationship with China, where many of its products are made and, increasingly, many of them are sold. A report this week from &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facing-hostile-chinese-authorities-apple-ceo-signed-275-billion-deal-with-them"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; relies on unnamed sources and internal documents to peel back some of the details about Apple’s ties with China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="tTir7D"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A 1,250-word MOU between Apple and China’s National Development and Reform Commission reportedly runs for five years and accounted for $275 billion in spending&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w1kBY4"&gt;That includes a request Apple reportedly received in 2014 or 2015 about &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senkaku_Islands"&gt;a small group of uninhabited islands&lt;/a&gt; that China and Japan apparently have a dispute over in terms of who owns them. Going by either the Senkaku Islands or the Diaoyu Islands, depending on which side of the argument you’re taking, they inspired a request from China to members of the Maps team to make them appear larger, even when viewers are zoomed out on the map. According to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;, not only did Apple eventually make the change, but even today, for viewers using its map from within China, the islands are still shown at a larger scale than the territories around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Satellite views of the Senkaku Islands" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MYck_ik3Kilhuzno12VIIj354wg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23080195/588404986.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A satellite image of the Senkaku Islands located in the East of China on April 01, 2016 in Japan. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cVgQYI"&gt;The report also details disputes over everything from iTunes and iCloud to Apple Pay. The figure that looms over everything is a 1,250-word memorandum of understanding that &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; says Tim Cook signed during a publicized trip to China in 2016. The way it’s laid out, Cook went to China because of repeated regulatory actions affecting Apple’s business. By signing a five-year agreement (with an option to extend to a sixth year) promising investments, business deals, and training in China, worth an estimated $275 billion, the aim was to avoid further disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hj5SPP"&gt;And as &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; has confirmed from its sources, that seems to have mostly held true. The report points out &lt;a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/apple-becomes-largest-smartphone-brand-china-october-2021/"&gt;data from the analysts at Counterpoint Research&lt;/a&gt; who said that in October, Apple became the largest smartphone brand in China, a title it hadn’t held in six years. Meanwhile, Apple has built new R&amp;amp;D centers in the country and started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/18/17587304/apple-icloud-china-user-data-state-run-telecom-privacy-security"&gt;storing iCloud data for Chinese users there&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QWxick"&gt;However, that relationship also has downsides, with critics &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/25/18020508/how-china-complicates-apples-chest-thumping-about-privacy"&gt;questioning the company’s commitment to privacy&lt;/a&gt; — its Private Relay feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523871/china-private-relay-regulatory-reasons-not-launching-great-firewall-internet-censorship"&gt;will not be available in China&lt;/a&gt; — and business dealings with companies accused of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428899/apple-suppliers-china-uyghur-forced-labor-report"&gt;links to Uyghur forced labor&lt;/a&gt;. That’s before we mention the other visible concessions that harken back to that decision about the disputed islands, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632029/apple-engraving-filter-censorship-keyword-china-hong-kong-taiwan"&gt;the numbers Apple won’t let you engrave on an iPad in China&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728257/apple-quran-majeed-app-removed-china"&gt;takedowns of certain apps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lFqi7c"&gt;After the report surfaced, the &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-war/article/3159087/apples-reported-us275-billion-china-investment-questioned-state-media"&gt;&lt;em&gt;South China Morning Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports (via &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/12/09/chinese-media-downplaying-apples-reported-275b-deal-with-the-country"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) that a state-run tabloid in China referred to it as “McCarthyism,” claiming it was an attack “clearly driven by the ‘political correctness’ of Sinophobia.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Kindle deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sDw2s8nxtbi_zO0noojtecgfitM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67715739/akrales_190408_3351_0016.7.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fourth-gen Kindle might not be Amazon’s latest e-reader, but it’s down to just $55 right now.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AZCNr8"&gt;When it comes to finding a device to use to read your ebooks, you have a few options to choose from. You can always buy a tablet or use your smartphone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doom-scrolling on Twitter. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while niche, are designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with limited functionality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDKHVT"&gt;Amazon, one of the pioneers of the e-reader, has dominated the space for years with its Kindle lineup, which consists of several unique models with their own pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2UeWxe"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each model currently available for purchase. Sometimes, there isn’t a deal for one, or any, of the products, which is why we’ve mentioned the most recent sale price in those instances. Additionally, while newer models like the 2021 Kindle Paperwhite are currently only available for full price, the retailer also offers 20 percent off all of its Kindles when you trade in select devices, so there are still other ways to save money when none of the models are available at a discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="U51BKy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"},{"title":"Here are the best Amazon Echo deals right now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21546591/best-amazon-echo-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="r36wrm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10741941"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jqPttv"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/4/10/18302177/amazon-kindle-base-model-low-resolution-screen-backlight-review"&gt;Kindle (10th-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="mXAcFi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10363966"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hfprjz"&gt;This is Amazon’s most affordable e-reader, and as such, it usually retails for $89.99. Released in 2019, the base Kindle includes a front light, 8GB of storage, and comes with or without ad support. Despite including the same 167ppi resolution as its predecessors, the latest base Kindle features a slightly higher contrast than earlier models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIAlEv"&gt;Right now, you can buy a 10th-gen Kindle with lock screen ads for $54.99 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VT322X/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1221005/2092?subId1=VergeBestKindleDeals121021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-kindle-8gb-now-with-a-built-in-front-light-8211-black%2F-%2FA-79804909%2F"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfxG6j9qO2d" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, which knocks $35 off the original MSRP. If you want one without ads, you can grab it for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VZV5VB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$74.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. If you buy either Kindle model at Amazon, you’ll also receive three months of Kindle Unlimited at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTnhuW"&gt;If you want to save some money on additional accessories for the e-reader, Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Essentials-including-Amazon-Printed-Adapter/dp/B08C6NDPFM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Essentials Bundle&lt;/a&gt; is $84.97 ($50 off its usual price) at Amazon; it includes an ad-supported Kindle in either black or white, one of three printed covers, and a power adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RkX3DN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ze80m8"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/7/20902588/kindle-kids-edition-amazon-bundle-young-e-reader-case-replacement-program-freetime" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Kids Edition (2019)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JypT34"&gt;The entry-level Kindle and Oasis models were not the only ones that received a refresh in 2019. Amazon also announced and released a Kindle Kids Edition Bundle, which provides age-appropriate content for younger readers who prefer digital books for $109.99 ($20 more than the base Kindle at standard MSRP). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LlYfl"&gt;The Kindle Kids Edition consists of five items: the device, a case, a two-year extended replacement guarantee (in the event the device breaks), and one year of Amazon Kids Plus service. The latter is the biggest selling point of the device aside from the kid-friendly patterns, as it allows parents to grant their kids access to a digital library of kid-friendly books like &lt;em&gt;Percy Jackson&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit &lt;/em&gt;at no additional cost. Right now it’s only available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NMY72SC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1746224890339507137" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $109.99, the full retail price, though we did see it drop to $60 last month during Black Friday and Cyber Month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3DEvBp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552664"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="0EetaF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our over 40,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="t6m9om"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22745670/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2021-review-usb-c-signature-edition-display-e-reader-books" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Paperwhite (2021)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="deHMlR"&gt;Amazon’s latest Kindle Paperwhite is its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22684801/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-features-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;11th-gen model&lt;/a&gt;, which comes with USB-C support, longer battery life, and a larger, 6.8-inch display. Given just how recently the new e-reader launched, however, we haven’t seen a ton of discounts yet. Thankfully, you can still pick up the last-gen model, which is frequently available for far less than the standard retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FkwzBt"&gt;The 2021 Kindle Paperwhite comes in three main configurations: an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KTZ8249/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB model with ads for $139.99&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N38WQSH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB without ads for $159.99&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08B495319/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB Signature Edition for $189.99&lt;/a&gt;. The latter is identical to the standard Paperwhite, except it also features Qi wireless charging and a sensor that will automatically adjust the backlight when needed. Amazon has also rolled out a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WPB8PW9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Paperwhite Kids Edition for $159.99&lt;/a&gt;, which comes bundled with a kid-friendly cover, a two-year extended replacement guarantee, and a year of Amazon Kids Plus, much like the aforementioned Kindle Kids Edition. All 2021 models are also similar to the 2018 model in that they feature a waterproof design and Audible audiobook support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rrLCU1"&gt;Currently, both the ad-supported and ad-free configurations of the base Kindle Paperwhite are only available from Amazon starting at $139.99, their full retail price. The 32GB, ad-free Signature Edition is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09FNY4RRP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available as part of a discounted bundle for $249.97&lt;/a&gt;, however, which also includes a “cork” cover and a wireless charging dock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XEYFbp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10765216"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="S8bhtR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10913659"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="iorwh0"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/7/18065960/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2018-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Paperwhite (2018)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UaH6Zy"&gt;While there currently are no price breaks on the 2021 Kindle Paperwhite — save for the 20 percent off you can get with an eligible trade-in — Best Buy has lowered the price of the last-gen model. Currently, the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfxHjGSDlV6" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;retailer is offering the 8GB Kindle Paperwhite&lt;/a&gt; with ad support for $89.99, a cool $40 off the original list price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Emeowb"&gt;If you don’t mind paying for a leather case and a power adapter, Amazon is also currently discounting its Kindle Paperwhite Essentials Bundle, which includes either the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084LN58ZH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB e-reader with ads for $159.97&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084LMT23Z/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB reader with ads for $189.97&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re a fan of Suzanne Collins’ Hunger Games trilogy, Amazon also offers a bundle that includes a Kindle Paperwhite, a power adapter, and a Mockingjay-emblazoned cover. It’s currently available in two ad-supported configurations and colors: an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Bundle-including-Ad-Supported/dp/B087NMH2F7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB version for $159.97&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Bundle-including-Ad-Supported/dp/B087NM77FC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB variant for $189.97&lt;/a&gt;, both of which save you $20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vOUHwk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552401"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="X5jbTU"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707619/amazon-kindle-oasis-2019-e-reader-review-price-specs-features-display" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Oasis (third-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IByP4u"&gt;The Kindle Oasis is the most expensive of the lineup, starting at $250. The device comes in two storage configurations, 8GB or 32GB, and like the other models, you can get it with or without ads on the lock screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1AvXZM"&gt;The 2019 Kindle Oasis looks very similar to the previous model. It retains its waterproof, 7-inch, 300ppi E Ink display and supports Audible audiobooks via Bluetooth. However, unlike previous models, it can adjust the color temperature to a yellow-toned display, making it easier to read at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxP7sb"&gt;In the past, we’ve seen the 8GB Kindle Oasis drop to as low as $174.99, which is the lowest it has ever been for that configuration to date. While there are currently no deals on just the Oasis itself, configurations start at $249.99 at Amazon and include three free months of Kindle Unlimited. The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHV8D7P?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB, ad-supported Oasis&lt;/a&gt; is $249.99 and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VDMJJLG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one without ads is $269.99&lt;/a&gt;. If you need more storage, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VCMJSLB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB version is $279.99 with ads&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VGTRMFS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$299.99 without&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XuGlPY"&gt;Amazon is currently offering an Essentials Bundle for $30 off its normal list price, too. You can get either the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RSVGLKV/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB, ad-supported configuration for as low as $279.97&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RW2K1MD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB variant for $309.97&lt;/a&gt;, both of which come with a leather cover, a power adapter, and three months of Kindle Unlimited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hPPu8s"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552599"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="bGvy8i"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10913792"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="4mZNi9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>OnePlus pulls buggy OxygenOS 12 update</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="The OnePlus 9 Pro (top) and OnePlus 9" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M31-04wWUoaXVvNyhSg3Q7dQpVM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70257148/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0061_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HA9atD"&gt;OnePlus released the Android 12-based OxygenOS 12 to the OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro this week, but the company has already pulled it following reports of bugs and issues from users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dOxakL"&gt;“We are aware of the issues caused by the OxygenOS 12 update and our software team is fixing them,” OnePlus said &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/oneplus-is-pulling-its-oxygenos-12-update-for-the-op-9-and-9-pro/"&gt;in a statement to &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “We will suspend this software update and roll out a new iteration as soon as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AS0CyB"&gt;The release has been widely panned. &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; called it &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/oxygen-os12-oneplus-9-awful/"&gt;“just awful,”&lt;/a&gt; highlighting the need to toggle settings to get the 120Hz display to work again and that some menus “straight-up crash” as examples of issues. &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; agreed: “For a so-called ‘stable’ release, OxygenOS 12 is riddled with bugs and issues that honestly make it very hard to suggest that you update and install on your eligible OnePlus phone,” the &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/12/10/oxygenos-12-review-unsettling-ui-alterations-video/"&gt;publication said&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; even put out a PSA recommending that you &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/factory-reset-oneplus-9-series-improve-experience-oxygenos-12/"&gt;factory reset your OnePlus 9 or 9 Pro&lt;/a&gt; to try to improve things — which, as &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; noted, isn’t something you should need to do after a software update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZSiYCD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Not that you should ever have to do this, but I factory reset my OnePlus 9 Pro just now after updating to Android 12. It is so, so, so much better. This is much more usable. &lt;a href="https://t.co/b7lXxieJHn"&gt;https://t.co/b7lXxieJHn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Adam Conway (@AdamConwayIE) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AdamConwayIE/status/1468912672049618948?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C7KqKD"&gt;It’s apparently not just OnePlus that has had a rough rollout of an Android 12-based OS. Samsung’s Android 12-based One UI 4 began rolling out to the Galaxy Z Flip 3 and Z Fold 3 this week, but it is &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-z-flip-3-fold-3-android-12-problems-issues-update-postponed/"&gt;reportedly quite buggy&lt;/a&gt;. Google’s own Pixel phones haven’t been squeaky clean, either, as users have reported &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/pixel-6-connectivity-issues/"&gt;connectivity issues&lt;/a&gt; seemingly caused by a bug in Android 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MngGJH"&gt;It’s unclear when OnePlus’ revised OxygenOS 12 update will hit. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony was bringing PlayStation Now to mobile phones, according to a confidential Apple presentation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="PS2" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CpfySOJughyosDwe9Z5uaGatSjQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70257065/vpavic_191126_untitled_0011_2_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cB1Lly"&gt;In 2017 — long before Apple declared that cloud gaming could only exist on the iPhone if it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/20912689/apple-cloud-gaming-streaming-xcloud-stadia-app-store-guidelines-rules"&gt;jumped through gigantic hoops&lt;/a&gt; — Sony was preparing to launch its PlayStation Now cloud gaming service on mobile phones, a confidential document reveals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ocH39i"&gt;It could have been the single biggest expansion of Sony’s PS Now game service in years. Originally, the service streamed PS2 and PS3 games to smart TVs, Blu-ray players, and the PS3 and PS Vita, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/15/14626676/playstation-now-discontinued-ps3-vita-smart-tvs"&gt;cut off all those original platforms in late 2017&lt;/a&gt; (coincidence?) to focus on the PlayStation 4 and Windows PC instead. While it recently added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397555/playstation-now-1080p-streaming-support-resolution"&gt;1080p streaming&lt;/a&gt; and a PS5 client, it’s never been offered on Android, iOS, or Mac. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwJK83"&gt;But according to a confidential document unearthed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; from the&lt;em&gt; Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial, Apple had insider knowledge of Sony’s upcoming launch. Apple had heard about a “[not-yet-announced] mobile extension of an existing streaming service for PlayStation users, streaming access to over 450+ PS3 games to start, with PS4 games to follow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iNqD5z"&gt;A handful of PS4 games launched on PlayStation Now in July 2017, but the presentation notes that the service is “only PS3 games right now,” suggesting Apple got tipped off about more than just the move to mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aQIpa4A3pK-VvvsiYvmq1HnKaDA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23080005/ps_now_mobile.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;PlayStation Now is listed as a “mobile” subscription&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;in a document labeled “HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL — ATTORNEY’S EYES ONLY”.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iINjJs"&gt;Why did Apple bring this up? It’s smack dab in the middle of an explanation of Apple’s plans to launch its own game subscription service, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22370217/apple-arcade-fantasian-nba2k-wonderbox-classics-netflix"&gt;Apple Arcade&lt;/a&gt;, which wouldn’t be announced until two years later. At the time, Apple was preparing to target 30 top game studios and ask for as many as “a few hundred titles” to add.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qmpcx0LbKMEsJ6luj_yXTZMCeag=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23080073/apple_games_subs.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple describes its “game subscription service,” which would launch as Apple Arcade&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Eqhn65"&gt;In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20993828/sony-playstation-now-cloud-gaming-gaikai-onlive-google-stadia-25th-anniversary"&gt;I wrote that Sony squandered the opportunity to be a leader in cloud gaming&lt;/a&gt;, despite being the first major company to recognize its potential, buying &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; of the early startups (Gaikai and OnLive) that proved out the idea. But despite Apple’s resistance to cloud gaming on the App Store — read &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826297/microsoft-xbox-xcloud-streaming-exclusives-iphone-ipad-gamepas"&gt;my new story about what happened with Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; — there’s an intriguing possibility that Sony isn’t giving up yet. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22816087/sony-playstation-5-game-subscription-service-xbox-games-pass-now-spartacus"&gt;Sony reportedly now has a Project Spartacus&lt;/a&gt; that would bundle its cloud gaming service with a PlayStation Plus subscription, and it would bring original PS1 games and “eventually” PS5 games to the service too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TRSIgj"&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-03/playstation-plans-new-service-to-take-on-xbox-game-pass?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;Jason Schreier’s scoop for &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t mention mobile phones at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mmK2x1"&gt;While it’s possible Sony read the room and decided it wasn’t worth fighting Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/24/17392470/apple-rejects-valve-steam-link-app-store-ios-game-steaming"&gt;the way Steam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421290/microsoft-apple-xcloud-ios-shadow-cloud-gaming-removal-app-store"&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft, and Google did for mobile access, it might also be that Sony decided to focus on selling more consoles instead — if you do have a PS4 or PS5 in your house, the company’s PS Remote Play app already lets you stream it (perhaps even &lt;a href="https://toucharcade.com/2021/09/14/ps4-remote-play-ps5-games-over-mobile-data-update-download-broadcast-ios-android-iphone/"&gt;over cellular&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22429291/sony-ps5-remote-play-dualsense-apple-mac-iphone-ipod-ipad-apple-tv"&gt;to a wide array of Apple devices&lt;/a&gt;, as well as Android. You can even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21556803/sony-ps5-remote-play-ps4-app-streaming-games"&gt;stream a new PS5 to your old PS4&lt;/a&gt;, giving it a new lease on life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j5t8Yy"&gt;Sony wouldn’t comment to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this story explaining in detail the scary Teams bug that blocked a 911 call</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tVIDy3"&gt;Sometimes when technology bugs out, I like a good and heavy analysis on why something didn’t work as intended. Mishaal Rahman, former editor in chief at &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;, wrote an excellent explainer on why a 911 call on a Google Pixel 3 with Microsoft Teams failed during a real emergency — aptly titled: “&lt;a href="https://medium.com/@mmrahman123/how-a-bug-in-android-and-microsoft-teams-could-have-caused-this-users-911-call-to-fail-6525f9ba5e63"&gt;How a bug in Android and Microsoft Teams could have caused this user’s 911 call to fail&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vACzdj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/@mmrahman123/how-a-bug-in-android-and-microsoft-teams-could-have-caused-this-users-911-call-to-fail-6525f9ba5e63"&gt;Rahman’s story&lt;/a&gt; explains the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826272/911-failure-google-android-microsoft-teams-bug"&gt;recent situation&lt;/a&gt; of a Pixel 3 user frantically trying to call 911 but attempts kept freezing the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pt0THx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;New: How a bug in Android and Microsoft Teams could have caused this user’s 911 call to fail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a high-level technical analysis explaining that weird Android 911/Microsoft Teams bug.&lt;a href="https://t.co/hjFIm7GGn3"&gt;https://t.co/hjFIm7GGn3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tip &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Techmeme?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Techmeme&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mishaal Rahman (@MishaalRahman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1469373893534232584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zKkJ0I"&gt;Even if you start &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@mmrahman123/how-a-bug-in-android-and-microsoft-teams-could-have-caused-this-users-911-call-to-fail-6525f9ba5e63"&gt;reading the article&lt;/a&gt; from the middle — or even skim it — you still get a fascinating look on how the Android OS interfaces with apps like Teams that have phone call features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="UuDWnI"&gt;Even without analyzing the decompiled code of the Microsoft Teams app, it’s easy to confirm that there’s a bug in the app that results in the excessive registration of PhoneAccount instances. Whenever the Microsoft Teams app is installed but the user has not signed in, &lt;strong&gt;every cold launch of the app results in the creation of another PhoneAccount instance&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ur8wB9"&gt;If you have an app like Teams on your Android phone that can make “phone calls” (looks kind of like a regular cellular call), &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@mmrahman123/how-a-bug-in-android-and-microsoft-teams-could-have-caused-this-users-911-call-to-fail-6525f9ba5e63"&gt;the article explains in depth&lt;/a&gt; how an app will add itself to a list of “PhoneAccounts” that the system can use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W02SDv"&gt;If you’re someone who’s interested in the inner workings of Android — specifically how the OS can fumble emergency phone calls (and where Microsoft went wrong), then you really should &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@mmrahman123/how-a-bug-in-android-and-microsoft-teams-could-have-caused-this-users-911-call-to-fail-6525f9ba5e63"&gt;go read this article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google tells employees it won’t raise everyone’s wages to keep up with inflation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FP6ocuot_mboi7QV0UpoREBwlWw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70256811/acastro_180427_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The company won’t be doing a company-wide pay raise to match rising prices.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="syF3q2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22747193/google-q3-2021-earnings-record-revenue-profit"&gt;Google parent company Alphabet announced&lt;/a&gt; its fifth quarter in a row of record profits ($18.9 billion) and second straight quarter of record revenue ($65.1 billion) in October, but a company executive told employees that Google wouldn’t automatically adjust their salaries to account for inflation. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/09/google-execs-tell-employees-they-wont-raise-pay-to-match-inflation.html"&gt;According to CNBC&lt;/a&gt;, Google’s VP of compensation Frank Wagner told employees at a company all-hands meeting on December 7th that Google doesn’t “have any plans to do any type of across-the-board type adjustment” when asked about the &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/coming-up-u-s-consumer-price-index-for-november-11639142278"&gt;inflation rate in the US&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IWkJwm"&gt;Wagner did hint that the company’s compensation budgets “reflected” the higher cost of labor that comes with increased prices, according to CNBC. However, he said that the company would rather pay any increased wages based on performance rather than do an increase across the board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZnzjKp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google says it would rather adjust pay by performance than give “smaller increments to everybody”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dcAvSk"&gt;While rewarding the top-performing employees more makes intuitive sense, it could also end up reinforcing people’s rankings — having to worry less about money means you can concentrate more on your work and even afford better quality time off to recharge. That rings especially true as &lt;a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/life-at-google/hybrid-approach-work/"&gt;Google expects 80 percent of its employees&lt;/a&gt; to spend at least some time in its offices (often &lt;a href="https://about.google/locations/?region=north-america&amp;amp;office=mountain-view"&gt;located in cities&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/080916/top-10-most-expensive-cities-us.asp"&gt;higher-than-average costs of living&lt;/a&gt; like Austin, New York, or San Francisco) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22814879/google-return-to-office-covid-omicron-hybrid-work-plans-2022"&gt;when they end up returning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aGRrPf"&gt;Google declined to provide an on-the-record comment to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, but told CNBC that base salary is just one part of its employees’ compensation, which also includes bonuses and stock. CNBC says the company also reiterated Wagner’s comments about pay increases being tied to performance.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>My quest to find the ‘alligator brides’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M4wz5r1dcGzgNg36XncrnX0pq6g=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70256745/alligator_bride__1_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6kz0s7"&gt;Last night’s Game Awards had some really cool surprises. We got &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22827225/alan-wake-2-confirmed-trailer-release-date"&gt;a new &lt;em&gt;Alan Wake&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;announcement, we got the slit scared out of us by &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/EyUGYL9aSww"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slitterhead&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and an adorable pot friend (like an actual friend in a pot, not a cannabis companion) &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/K_03kFqWfqs"&gt;dropped some &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt; lore&lt;/a&gt; on us. But there was one surprise that left me and my colleagues at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; confused, curious, and breathless for more: what game has alligator brides in it and how can we get our hands on it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RVGv0x"&gt;Ming-Na Wen, savior of China and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700329/disney-plus-the-book-of-boba-fett-star-wars-release-date"&gt;Boba Fett’s right hand&lt;/a&gt;, appeared during the Game Awards to present the award for Best Narrative (which, by the way, went to the very well-deserving &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22747428/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-review-ps5-square-enix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). During her speech, she mentioned that as the mother of a gaming-obsessed kid, she enjoys when games are more than just, “blowing up grenade factories and yelling obscenities at your alligator brides.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HEhZgE"&gt;At her mention of “alligator brides,” everyone paused, took a moment to assess if that was truly what she said, and then wracked their brains to figure out just what the hell she was talking about. After turning on captions and running the video back, Wen did in fact say “alligator brides,” so it wasn’t a misunderstanding. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bvhXucJS9GUZTo9MFluA8K0n7tc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23079781/Screenshot_2021_12_10_153229.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’d be forgiven for thinking this is just YouTube’s caption service being its normal weird self, but she actually said “alligator brides.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zqj0mp"&gt;I asked my colleagues what game could she be talking about, but nobody could think of anything. Dieter Bohn did find &lt;em&gt;an&lt;/em&gt; “Alligator Bride” in the form of &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/04/04/599400803/songs-we-love-howlin-rain-alligator-bride"&gt;a song by blues-rock band Howlin’ Rain&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;but I don’t think these folks were &lt;em&gt;the &lt;/em&gt;saurian spouses to which Wen was referring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XOSbmv"&gt;On Twitter, people were just as enthusiastic about the idea of alligator brides as we were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="2RnhAk"&gt;Still, with no information on this elusive game forthcoming, I decided to go to the source. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lo4NlF"&gt;I asked Ms. Wen herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IoxVTr"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MingNa?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@MingNa&lt;/a&gt; Hi! My name is Ash and I'm a video game reporter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/verge?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@verge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;As me and my colleagues watched your presentation during the game awards, we were really curious when you mentioned your son yelling obscenities at his alligator brides. What game was that? We want to play too!&lt;/p&gt;— Ash Parrish (@adashtra) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adashtra/status/1469345193425969152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XeN2eE"&gt;I even decided to tap subject matter expert &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GatorsDaily"&gt;@GatorsDaily&lt;/a&gt; to see what they might know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kjoih2"&gt;I haven’t gotten a response from either yet. But the more I think about it, the more I’m convinced that this “alligator brides” game isn’t some obscure indie title in which you’re presented with a roster of sentient, sexy, anthropomorphized reptiles to date, woo, and eventually marry (although that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a game I would play) but something far more mundane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cDh4y6"&gt;It’s &lt;em&gt;Skyrim.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GDx6Q6"&gt;Y’know, that Bethesda RPG that released &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/the-elder-scrolls-5-skyrim/1789"&gt;100 years ago&lt;/a&gt; and also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22633130/skyrim-next-gen-upgrade-update-anniversary-special-edition-bethesda"&gt;this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Su4Zv6"&gt;Or if not &lt;em&gt;Skyrim&lt;/em&gt; specifically, one of the other &lt;em&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/em&gt; games&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;To the uninitiated, the &lt;em&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/em&gt; universe is populated by humans, cat-folk, and a race of upright reptilian peoples called Argonians. &lt;em&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/em&gt; games let you marry these humans, cat-folk, and upright reptilian Argonians. As the mystery of alligator brides continues, my best guess is that Wen’s son is an avid &lt;em&gt;Skyrim&lt;/em&gt; player and lover of a &lt;a href="https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/The_Lusty_Argonian_Maid"&gt;lusty Argonian maid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TKjzOo"&gt;If this is in fact true, I hope that we as a community adopt the practice of calling &lt;em&gt;Skyrim&lt;/em&gt; the “alligator bride” game.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo will sell you the Switch OLED’s dock with built-in ethernet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bn7gz4Dz1w0cPL1WqUpAl5BNxTQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70256611/cfaulkner_210921_4751_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can now get the Switch OLED dock without the Switch OLED&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LHwZYN"&gt;If you’ve wanted to get your hands on the Nintendo Switch OLED’s dock, you’re in luck — Nintendo is now &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/dock-oled-model-white.html"&gt;selling it on its online store for $70&lt;/a&gt;, $10 more than &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/dock.html"&gt;the original dock&lt;/a&gt;. The newer version of the dock has a slightly more rounded design, comes in white, and (most importantly for some gamers) &lt;a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/55834/~/nintendo-switch-%E2%80%93-oled-model-overview-and-faq#s2q1"&gt;trades one of its USB 2.0 ports&lt;/a&gt; for an ethernet jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QjbsBB"&gt;It’s nice to have the option to buy a second dock for your Switch OLED, should you need an extra or a replacement. You could also pick one up if you’ve got a non-OLED Switch and your dock is getting to the point where it needs a replacement. &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/switch/faq/"&gt;Nintendo’s own FAQ says&lt;/a&gt; the OLED’s dock is compatible with the regular Switch, though you may need to do a software update to get full functionality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gB2y74"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If you want LAN, this is probably the dock to get&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f3GkR1"&gt;If you’re in need of a dock and you were planning on adding a LAN port anyway, going with the OLED dock seems like a no-brainer. Nintendo &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/wired-internet-lan-adapter.html"&gt;sells its first-party ethernet adapter&lt;/a&gt; for $30 on its own, and while you can find ones &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083ZLPJMW/ref=emc_b_5_t?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;around the $10 mark&lt;/a&gt;, having an integrated one is certainly a cleaner solution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GlG7U3"&gt;If you need a dock and are looking to save a buck, you can grab a &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/dock-refurbished.html"&gt;refurbished original model&lt;/a&gt; for a cool $40. Nintendo also sells a refurb of &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/dock-animal-crossing-refurbished-card.html"&gt;the Animal Crossing-themed dock&lt;/a&gt; for the same price if you’re feeling in the island mood. While these won’t include the LAN port, they are still compatible with the Switch OLED if you’re looking to pick up an extra dock for a secondary TV and don’t want to splurge on the version that came in the box.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>‘Extremely bad’ vulnerability found in widely used logging system</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6ABUgFuk3c-LaqDF9AH6d0Qa2JA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70256587/acastro_170621_1777_0006_v4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wjC5m2"&gt;Security teams at companies large and small are scrambling to patch a previously unknown vulnerability called Log4Shell, which has the potential to let hackers compromise millions of devices across the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DoWHXK"&gt;If exploited, the vulnerability allows remote code execution on vulnerable servers, giving an attacker the ability to import malware that would completely compromise machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xo2XhJ"&gt;The vulnerability is found in log4j, an open-source logging library used by apps and services across the internet. Logging is a process where applications keep a running list of activities they have performed which can later be reviewed in case of error. Nearly every network security system runs some kind of logging process, which gives popular libraries like log4j an enormous reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="t91xx5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“When I look back over the last 10 years, there are only two other exploits I can think of with a similar severity”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BpiHi4"&gt;Marcus Hutchins, a prominent security researcher best known for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/13/15635050/wannacry-ransomware-kill-switch-protect-nhs-attack"&gt;halting the global WannaCry malware attack&lt;/a&gt;, noted online that millions of applications would be affected. “Millions of applications use Log4j for logging, and all the attacker needs to do is get the app to log a special string,” Hutchins &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MalwareTechBlog/status/1469289471463944198"&gt;said in a tweet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vDGiX1"&gt;The exploit was &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/12/minecraft-and-other-apps-face-serious-threat-from-new-code-execution-bug/"&gt;first seen on sites hosting &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; servers&lt;/a&gt;, which discovered that attackers could trigger the vulnerability by posting chat messages. A &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GreyNoiseIO/status/1469326260803416073"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; from security analysis company GreyNoise reported that the company has already detected numerous servers searching the internet for machines vulnerable to the exploit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rQgc9p"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; from application security company LunaSec claimed that gaming platform Steam and Apple’s iCloud had already been found to be vulnerable. Neither Valve nor Apple immediately responded to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3l9FSp"&gt;To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker has to cause the application to save a special string of characters in the log. Since applications routinely log a wide range of events — such as messages sent and received by users, or the details of system errors — the vulnerability is unusually easy to exploit and can be triggered in a variety of ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vX0x16"&gt;“This is a very serious vulnerability because of the widespread use of Java and this package log4j,” Cloudflare CTO John Graham-Cumming told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “There’s a tremendous amount of Java software connected to the internet and in back-end systems. When I look back over the last 10 years, there are only two other exploits I can think of with a similar severity: Heartbleed, which allowed you to get information from servers that should have been secure, and Shellshock, which allowed you to run code on a remote machine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UpKPyu"&gt;However, the diversity of applications vulnerable to the exploit, and range of possible delivery mechanisms, mean that firewall protection alone does not eliminate risk. Theoretically, the exploit could even be carried out physically by hiding the attack string in a QR code that was scanned by a package delivery company, making its way into the system without having been sent directly over the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="payGPR"&gt;An &lt;a href="https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html"&gt;update to the log4j library&lt;/a&gt; has already been released to mitigate against the vulnerability, but given the time taken to ensure that all vulnerable machines are updated, Log4Shell remains a pressing threat.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford reportedly delays Explorer EV in favor of Mustang Mach-E</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KVBazmUGUSY0I5LLn_mf7vsP43w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70256548/acastro_200406_1777_ford_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vnUiXK"&gt;Ford is delaying the launch of its forthcoming all-electric Explorer SUV from mid-2023 to at least December 2024, according to &lt;a href="https://www.autonews.com/cars-concepts/ford-delays-explorer-aviator-evs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Automotive News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The rollout of an all-electric Lincoln Aviator built on the same shared Ford EV platform is also being delayed along that same timeframe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VHkNhI"&gt;Ford also no longer plans to build the two EVs at its factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico, where it makes the Mustang Mach-E, according to the report. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454728/ford-plus-pro-electric-explorer-suv-investment"&gt;confirmed the vehicles in May&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJFsKD"&gt;Emma Bergg, Ford’s director of EV communications, declined to confirm the delay but said that Ford now plans to use the entire plant in Cuautitlan for Mach-E production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l9Pplj"&gt;“We have unprecedented demand for Mustang Mach-E and we are going to scale production quickly to meet demand. We are now planning to utilize the entire Cuautitlan plant for production of Mach-E,” Bergg wrote in an email. She added that Ford now plans to make as many as 200,000 Mach-Es per year by 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2YAim7"&gt;The delay means that it now may be a &lt;em&gt;while &lt;/em&gt;before there’s a third electric vehicle in Ford’s North American lineup, following the Mach-E and the F-150 Lightning. CEO Jim Farley has hinted at all-electric versions of &lt;a href="https://insideevs.com/news/506699/ford-farley-hint-bronco-ev/"&gt;the new Bronco SUV and Maverick compact pickup&lt;/a&gt;, though the company hasn’t said when those would be built. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9HTdqN"&gt;Ford’s EV ambitions haven’t dampened, though. The company recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826469/ford-f150-lightning-ev-deposits-reservations-closed"&gt;ramped up the number of F-150 Lightnings it plans to make&lt;/a&gt; in the coming years. It’s also hiring extra workers to handle the demand for the electric pickup truck. The automaker has said it wants to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/18/ford-plans-to-increase-ev-production-to-600000-vehicles-in-2023.html"&gt;make 600,000 EVs worldwide by 2023&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8VWltX"&gt;“Our goal is to become the clear No. 2 electric vehicle maker in North America within the next couple years and then challenge for No. 1,” Bergg wrote in the email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fI2iap"&gt;Ford’s Explorer SUV is one of its most popular vehicles outside of the F-Series lineup of trucks. The Explorer is also one of the driving forces of the company’s dominance in the police and security vehicle market. With the Biden administration incentivizing government fleets to go electric, that means Ford may have to focus on introducing pursuit-rated versions of its other EVs while the Explorer waits in the wings. And, in fact, it’s already doing this — the &lt;a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/09/24/tough-enough-for-law-enforcement-mustang-mach-e.html"&gt;Mustang Mach-E passed Michigan state police tests in September&lt;/a&gt; and will get &lt;a href="https://fordauthority.com/2021/12/ford-mustang-mach-e-to-join-dhs-as-part-of-field-testing-operation/"&gt;tested by the Department of Homeland Security in 2022&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2YE4Y"&gt;Lincoln is &lt;a href="https://www.autonews.com/future-product/ford-lincoln-ready-new-midsize-ev-crossovers"&gt;rumored&lt;/a&gt; to be working on electric versions of the smaller Nautilus and Corsair EVs that could hit the market before the delayed Aviator. Lincoln previously canceled an EV it was co-developing with Rivian in 2020. Ford, which owns roughly 12 percent of Rivian, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791984/ford-rivian-ev-canceled-investment-ipo-jim-farley"&gt;also dropped a project with the EV startup&lt;/a&gt; in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IKoKXR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: This story previously stated Ford was working on a mid-size electric SUV similar to the Edge based on a 2019 report, but that vehicle wound up being the Explorer EV. We’ve removed the reference to the Edge and regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
