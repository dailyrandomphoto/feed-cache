    <title>Discovery Plus is available on Roku and Fire TV at launch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xNhQtM3VQOm7p_4F0PPKHB5keko=/24x0:1077x702/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68616484/discovery_plus.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.discoveryplus.com/?xp=dsc_nav_streamnow" target="_blank"&gt;Discovery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RYiAQ6"&gt;Discovery Plus, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22018581/discovery-streaming-service-launch-date-price-shark-week-hgtv-food-network"&gt;new streaming channel from Discovery&lt;/a&gt;, launches today and does so on both Roku and Amazon’s Fire TV. That means it’s avoiding the confusion that ensued when HBO Max and Peacock streaming channels launched in 2020 without initial Roku and Fire TV options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3XXFC7"&gt;“As we go live with Discovery+ today in the US, we are thrilled to be working with best-in-class partners to make it available everywhere our fans are,” David Zaslav, president and CEO of Discovery Inc., &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/discovery-inc-launches-discovery-in-the-us-and-announces-new-distribution-and-platform-agreements-301200168.html"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FQKJA8"&gt;Roku is an important partner for new streamers, which brings its audience of approximately 46 million active accounts. WarnerMedia finally reached terms to bring its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/21272058/hbo-max-roku-watch-wonder-woman-1984-movies-amazon-fire-stream-comcast-warnermedia"&gt;HBO Max streaming channel to Roku in December&lt;/a&gt; after a months-long standoff over Roku’s fees and just ahead of the launch of &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt;, which debuted on HBO Max and in theaters on Christmas Day. Peacock launched in July and reached an agreement with Roku in September. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21569441/hbo-max-amazon-fire-tv-tablets-roku-prime-video-channel-membership"&gt;HBO Max came to Fire TV devices&lt;/a&gt; in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vM4bG1"&gt;Discovery Plus will include several shows spun off from Discovery channel stalwarts, like &lt;em&gt;90 Day Fiancé,&lt;/em&gt; as well as new versions of old favorites. The lineup will include new &lt;em&gt;House Hunters&lt;/em&gt; series; a new travel and food series from Bobby Flay and Giada de Laurentiis of the Food Network; a new &lt;em&gt;Long Island Medium&lt;/em&gt; series; and a new series from Magnolia Network’s Chip and Joanna Gaines, hosts of the &lt;em&gt;Fixer Uppe&lt;/em&gt;r home repair series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H1XSOH"&gt;In addition to Roku and Amazon Fire TV, Discovery Plus is fully integrated with the Apple TV app and is available across iOS devices; Google and Android platforms, including Chromecast; Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and Series S; as well as on 2017 and newer Samsung smart TVs. It’s not yet available for PlayStation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EzK7ht"&gt;Discovery Plus will start at $4.99 per month for the ad-supported version, and an ad-free version is available for $6.99 a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QHctlf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBSMKM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CnQh91"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Amazon Echo deals right now </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mj7LGifJ1euP-dbrplwPMhD36I4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67781485/dseifert_191123_3810_0012.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TNieh7"&gt;When it comes to the Echo smart speakers, Amazon has a slew of devices to choose from. With so many Echo devices currently available, there is a device for every occasion. Maybe you simply want to add Alexa to a room, or you are looking for an Echo device that will allow you to easily manage your other smart home products. Regardless of the reason, these are the best Echo deals currently available right now. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CJm2GwlbGF56gpDmNhJwIgppWKg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989898/dseifert_201025_4263_0002.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon Echo Dot with LED display&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zNwIju"&gt;Echo Dot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="maQ5h0"&gt;Last year, Amazon released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;4th generation of the Echo dot&lt;/a&gt;, which looks more like a sphere than an actual dot. But if you prefer the previous design, don’t worry — Amazon has not discontinued the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;3rd-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which still retains the familiar dot shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KKAXTh"&gt;Currently, the 3rd-gen Echo Dot gets frequent price drops, and right now, you can get it for $25 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot/dp/B07FZ8S74R/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=1760a049c05833dc1017f6d4057815bf&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725321348360875873" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-3rd-generation%2F-%2FA-54148143&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyVkKL"&gt;During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we saw the 4th-gen Echo Dot go down to its lowest price of $30. That deal is still available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Echo-Dot-4th-Gen/dp/B08LX6M79Q/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=2437a501e22872097e2f2ce286c01eb0&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724598862588130784" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-smart-speaker-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795702&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. If you buy the fourth-gen Echo Dot at Amazon, you get six months of Amazon Music Unlimited at no extra cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QG96M6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zX6pQw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;Echo Dot Kids Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LzhwpX"&gt;The 4th-gen Echo Dot Kids Edition is as spherical as its adult version but is designed to look like a tiger or panda. The device also comes with a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which provides access to a slew of kid-friendly content, like audiobooks and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmKSqg"&gt;Right now, you can get this device for $40 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LY7VXZM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=3799c464c93a5518a928cb97bc4e8bd6&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725323423176814123" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-kids-edition-with-parental-controls%2F-%2FA-81795703%3Fpreselect%3D81502548%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. If you purchase it on Amazon, you can also get six months of Amazon Music Unlimited at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MJlccr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9574374"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon Echo Dot (left) and Echo (right)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3GbSWO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review"&gt;Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wOHvPj"&gt;The 4th-gen Amazon Echo smart home hub has also gotten an updated look. Like the 4th-gen Echo Dot, the 2020 Amazon Echo also includes a sphere-shaped design, but it’s noticeably bigger than the Echo Dot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JjodUT"&gt;If you are looking for just one Amazon Echo, it is down to its lowest price ever of $70 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085HK4KL6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=2dfe20818827f68bbc17c1bb24f2a7a8&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724598980020491868" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-4th-gen-smart-home-hub-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795705%3Fpreselect%3D80770247%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. If you buy the Echo from Amazon, you also get six months of Amazon Music Unlimited for free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9HtqAa"&gt;If you are looking for two Amazon Echo devices, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589613981487950" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is currently selling an Amazon Echo two-pack for $140&lt;/a&gt;, which knocks $60 off its normal retail price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xR7jKq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508352"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Echo Show 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oiVOWB"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18714432/amazon-echo-show-5-alexa-smart-alarm-display-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WiqTO4"&gt;If you are looking for an Echo device that functions more as a smart clock than an entertainment speaker, the Echo Show 5 is one of two smart displays to consider. The Echo Show 5 includes a 5.5-inch display, making it easy to fit just about anywhere inside your home. Not only does the device include a built-in camera, but there’s also a physical shutter on the device, allowing you to block the camera’s view while keeping the always-on microphone active. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wsps6q"&gt;The Echo Show 5 usually costs $90, but right now, you can buy the device at its best-ever price of $45 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HZLHPKP/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=d1731cf9b61b13aa734867a184283f9a&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589653641321861" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-5-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-77282772%3Fpreselect%3D76612867%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wwkfpq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513095"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Echo Show 8&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GGyBnu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20983661/amazon-echo-show-8-review-alexa-smart-display-price-specs-features"&gt;Echo Show 8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="efoU4U"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Show 8 features an eight-inch display; it costs $40 more than the Echo Show 5. When stacked up against the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price"&gt;Google Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;, which is its closest competitor in terms of price and functionality, the Echo Show 8 is the better option for a few reasons: it has a slightly larger display, better speakers, and a camera, allowing you to use it as a video chatting device, this includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available"&gt;Zoom calls&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcMAEq"&gt;Normally, this device costs $130, but it has seen some good price reductions in the past. We have seen the device go down as low as $65. But if you are looking to buy the device now, you can get it for just $80 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PF1Y28C/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=9dd29d118d711aac9ce70db04cc48e45&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589734209430134" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-8-hd-8in-smart-display%2F-%2FA-81795783%3Fpreselect%3D78656158%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="TQX4oe"&gt;In 2019, Amazon released its first pair of true wireless earbuds: the Echo Buds. The Echo Buds offer superb sound quality, a comfy fit, and Bose’s noise reduction features. And, of course, they also include Alexa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="itnaQP"&gt;Right now, you can get the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LYZJ868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=7a3a6a70299a70204dd9500a48735759&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Buds, plus six months free of Amazon Music Unlimited, for just $80 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="cZGT85"&gt;If you’re interested in an Alexa smart speaker with better audio quality and Dolby Atmos support, the Echo Studio is the Amazon product you may want to purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8dmbf"&gt;There are no active deals right now for a new Echo Studio, but you can get it right now for its usual price of $200 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Studio/dp/B07G9Y3ZMC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725325990660946512" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. There is, however, a deal on a bundle at Best Buy, which includes an &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725326053000014488" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Studio and a Fire TV Stick 4K for $240&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hisense’s huge 85-inch 4K TV is only $1,000 at Best Buy today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Hisense 4K TV" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/agiUlotK4-8XwxG9M55VBu9AdyU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68616303/hisense85.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bjuJLN"&gt;Now that we’re past the winter holidays, deals are a little slower than usual. Still, we found a few promos worth telling you about today. One is on Hisense’s 85-inch 4K LED TV (model 85H6510G) at Best Buy. Normally $1,700, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1728478272466577053" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s just $1,000&lt;/a&gt;. This television’s sheer size is what makes this a good deal, especially if you want a big screen to watch the upcoming Super Bowl on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DQkdGG"&gt;It has some other fine traits as well, like its built-in Android TV software with Chromecast screen mirroring and support for all major streaming apps (aside from Apple TV, which is set to arrive early this year). This Hisense TV has four HDMI ports, and the panel supports Dolby Vision, HDR 10, and HLG standards of HDR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GvGqxw"&gt;I’ve come to rely on review site Rtings.com for its in-depth testing of televisions. &lt;a href="https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/hisense/h6510g"&gt;For this model’s review&lt;/a&gt;, it says the H6510G model is a Black Friday variant of Hisense’s H6570G that is sold exclusively at Best Buy. Despite this, the site says it’s better at displaying native 4K content and has a better contrast ratio than the H6570G. But it noted that this model has narrow viewing angles and its color accuracy isn’t great out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4CtKrt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10265690"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M6PBqW"&gt;Samsung’s last-gen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/8/20903452/samsung-galaxy-watch-active-2-review-fitness-tizen-apps-features-android-price"&gt;Galaxy Watch Active 2&lt;/a&gt; (44mm) is steeply discounted at Amazon. Normally floating around $330, it’s $250 for the first time. It’s certainly not a bad price considering the larger case size with unlocked LTE compatibility. At the time of publishing, both the gold and black colorways of this smartwatch are $250. Strangely, the smaller 40mm size costs at least $310 at Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PktMQd"&gt;Don’t be confused by Best Buy’s prices for this model. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1728478741001565891" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It’s selling the 40mm model for $250&lt;/a&gt; and the 44mm for $270, but those aren’t LTE-ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N7KyyN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10265721"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OF2ZC4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22018581/discovery-streaming-service-launch-date-price-shark-week-hgtv-food-network"&gt;Discovery Plus&lt;/a&gt;, the Discovery Channel’s paid streaming service, launched today. Verizon announced that both new and existing customers (on Play More Unlimited or Get more Unlimited plans) can get up to a free year of the new service as a complimentary perk. Per &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2F12-months-discovery-no-additional-cost&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F1%2F4%2F22212972%2Fhisense-4k-tv-samsung-galaxy-watch-active-lte-best-buy-amazon-deal-sale#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon’s press release&lt;/a&gt;, you can see if you’re eligible by opening the My Verizon app, then tap the “More” menu icon. Afterward, tap “Add-ons &amp;amp; Apps,” followed by “Entertainment,” then finally select “Learn more” under where Discovery Plus is listed. Then, you’ll need to create an account for the service to redeem the offer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus teases launch of first fitness tracker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JTcBmlsMJ0171IE4h7kvLcERZW4=/0x0:1800x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68616285/Eq3k9VkVkAELKeE.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A teaser image from OnePlus India suggests it has a fitness tracker on the way soon.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: OnePlus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7OJL8H"&gt;OnePlus’ Indian Twitter account is teasing what appears to be the company’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OnePlus_IN/status/1345962495731585030?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1345962495731585030%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xda-developers.com%2Foneplus-band-teaser-fitness-tracker-sleep-monitoring-support%2F"&gt;first wearable fitness band&lt;/a&gt;. The company claims that the device, which &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-will-release-40-fitness-band-similar-xiaomi-mi-band-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Central &lt;/em&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt; will be called the OnePlus Band, will “help you achieve all your fitness goals and make your life easier.” It also suggested in a subsequent tweet that the band could &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OnePlus_IN/status/1345980626667638785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1345980626667638785%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xda-developers.com%2Foneplus-band-teaser-fitness-tracker-sleep-monitoring-support%2F"&gt;track sleep&lt;/a&gt;. OnePlus’ tweet links to a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.in/b?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=22828478031&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;page on Amazon India&lt;/a&gt; which says the device will feature a real-time heart rate tracker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eBD9sk"&gt;In a tweet, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ishanagarwal24/status/1345983613158920192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1345983613158920192%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xda-developers.com%2Foneplus-band-teaser-fitness-tracker-sleep-monitoring-support%2F"&gt;tipster Ishan Agarwal&lt;/a&gt; subsequently shared some rumored specs for the unannounced device. He claims the OnePlus Band will feature 24/7 heart rate and blood oxygen monitoring, sleep tracking, and will have 13 built-in exercise modes. In terms of specs, it’ll come equipped with a 1.1-inch OLED display, an IP68 water resistance rating, and up to 14 days of battery life. It’ll cost ₹2,499 (around $35) and will launch in India in a week’s time, Agarwal says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VsYWrX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This year, we are here to help you achieve all your fitness goals and make your life easier.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SmartEverywear?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#SmartEverywear&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Head to the link to get notified: &lt;a href="https://t.co/LUCWvulREa"&gt;https://t.co/LUCWvulREa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/ynLzgyFxku"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ynLzgyFxku&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— OnePlus India (@OnePlus_IN) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OnePlus_IN/status/1345962495731585030?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OoQ2bk"&gt;While OnePlus’ teaser images don’t show the wearable very clearly, a leak from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stufflistings/status/1344477104671318017"&gt;@stufflistings&lt;/a&gt; last month showed off what it could look like, with a rectangular display and rubber watch strap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rYuOAw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Exclusive: This is the OnePlus Band.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OnePlus?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#OnePlus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OnePlusBand?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#OnePlusBand&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/JxYoSMxxTn"&gt;pic.twitter.com/JxYoSMxxTn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mukul Sharma (@stufflistings) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stufflistings/status/1344477104671318017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 31, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PsOXHr"&gt;OnePlus already produces phones, headphones, and even TVs in some markets, but the company confirmed it was looking to move into new product categories &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/WmYoNo6tmho?t=552"&gt;during its OnePlus 8T launch event last year&lt;/a&gt;. OnePlus CEO Pete Lau has confirmed that the company also &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1341392977973960707"&gt;plans to launch a smartwatch early this year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KO4jbg"&gt;Although OnePlus sells phones around the globe, it’s notable that both teases for its fitness tracker came from its Indian Twitter account, indicating that the OnePlus Band could be focused on the Indian market, at least initially.&lt;/p&gt;

Our team is investigating and we will follow up with more information as soon as we have it. We apologize for any disruption caused.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3gbrDr"&gt;The company is reporting issues with connecting to the service and messaging.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 480 heralds a new wave of budget 5G phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uh5htUR1gWkX6EVd7L8XZl-6h3s=/0x0:2064x1376/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68615978/Snapdragon_480_5G_Mobile_Platform___Logo___Outdoors.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="46aLPh"&gt;Qualcomm has officially announced the Snapdragon 480 5G, the company’s latest 5G-capable processor and the first in its Snapdragon 4-series of chips which power budget Android devices that tend to be far cheaper than most of Qualcomm’s 5G efforts to date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aP6m1c"&gt;The news of a 4-series chip with 5G was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21409504/qualcomm-snapdragon-4-series-budget-4-phones-ifa-2020"&gt;originally teased&lt;/a&gt; at IFA 2020, but today’s announcement marks the first real details for the new processor. The Snapdragon 480 features an integrated Snapdragon X51 modem with support for both mmWave and sub-6GHz networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2kCqz5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Qualcomm’s next budget Snapdragon 4-series chips could take 5G mainstream in 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21409504/qualcomm-snapdragon-4-series-budget-4-phones-ifa-2020"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="8dpblm"&gt;The addition of 5G to the 4-series could be one of the biggest factors yet in making the next-generation networking standard more accessible to users around the world. Right now, most 5G phones tend to cost upward of $500 — the technology is generally limited to mid-tier and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21678359/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-processor-first-look-5g-performance-ai-photography"&gt;flagship phones&lt;/a&gt;. But by adding it to the Snapdragon 4-series lineup, Qualcomm is making it possible for manufacturers to easily add 5G to their cheapest phones in the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cristianoamon/status/1301584443090464768"&gt;$125 to $250 range&lt;/a&gt;. That means that 2021 may be the year that truly budget 5G phones arrive. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SIzQQvZyb9mawQ-0RuOa6fEbSEY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22211637/Snapdragon_480_5G_Mobile_Platform___Logo___Vertical___English.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fw1JRY"&gt;But the Snapdragon 480 isn’t just interesting because of its 5G support — it also promises to offer a massive leap in performance compared to its predecessor, the Snapdragon 460. Specifically, Qualcomm says that the Snapdragon 480 should offer twice the performance of the old model for both the CPU and GPU, with a 70 percent improvement for AI tasks. (Specifically, through new Adreno 619 GPU, Kryo 460 CPU, and Qualcomm Hexagon 686 chipsets.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kMBm4H"&gt;There are also several features that have trickled down from past premium Snapdragon products, making their debut on the budget line for the first time. The Snapdragon 480 is the first 4-series chip to use an 8nm process, the first to support &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2018/02/23/how-can-quick-charge-4-turbocharge-your-mobile-device"&gt;Quick Charge 4 Plus&lt;/a&gt;, the first to support 120fps FHD+ panels, the first to offer 64-megapixel still images, and the first to offer a triple ISP for triple camera integration that can shoot up to three photos at once. Again, none of these are new features, but they should vastly expand what budget-priced phones will be able to do — especially when combined with the performance improvements coming to the CPU and GPU. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="3yvgSK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 888 processor will power the Android flagships of 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21678359/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-processor-first-look-5g-performance-ai-photography"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="V05kq9"&gt;The first phones featuring the Snapdragon 480 are expected to arrive in Q1 2021. Vivo, Oppo, Xiaomi, Motorola, and HMD’s Nokia are among the major companies that are expected to release phones powered by the new chip in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HcCrIB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2020’s best epic was the X-Men’s struggle to build a better world</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mioGMUjo7Lq0V1-IggvhldfzyX0=/0x630:1280x1483/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68615776/801294._SX1280_QL80_TTD_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Marvel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p8DxIa"&gt;For the first time in what feels like ages, the entertainment I looked forward to most was a handful of monthly comic books about the X-Men. Week after week this fall — a time absolutely &lt;em&gt;lousy&lt;/em&gt; with great books, movies, TV, and video games — what I really wanted most was to pour over words and pictures about Marvel Comics’ deep roster of mutants, and a story about them unlike any I’ve seen before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="na73Oa"&gt;It can’t be understated how bold and interesting X-Men comics are right now. Following a soft reboot in the twin 2019 miniseries written by Jonathan Hickman with art by R.B. Silva and Pepe Larraz, &lt;em&gt;House of X &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Powers of X &lt;/em&gt;(the best place to start reading), the mutants of the Marvel Universe have banded together to form the mutant nation of Krakoa. They have decided they are tired waiting for humanity at large to accept their existence and will instead build a place for themselves, whether or not humanity at large likes it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zxyUlV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Did you honestly think that we were going to sit around forever and just take it?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1h8igv"&gt;These mutants — former heroes of the X-Men superhero team and their former adversaries alike — have banded together on the terrain of a living island (also named Krakoa) to begin the messy business of building a nation. There is a new language, new rituals, new creeds — the building blocks of a culture are being made in real time. The results have been among the best comics of the year, full of political intrigue, love stories unfolding across millennia, and yeah, even a whole series (&lt;em&gt;Maruaders&lt;/em&gt; by Gerry Duggan and a lineup of killer artists) about pirates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eV5AEc"&gt;This messy, complicated new status quo is comics at its best, rich with possibility and things to daydream about. It even made a 22-part crossover — the absolute worst stunt that modern superhero comics love to pull — utterly compelling. &lt;em&gt;X of Swords&lt;/em&gt;, as this crossover was called, swept this newfound nation into a magical struggle in an unknown world, as the X-Men were forced into a tournament where they had to fight challengers with swords. This was the premise that was supposed to fuel &lt;em&gt;twenty-two whole comic books,&lt;/em&gt; and they absolutely did it, subverting every expectation about what a story like that could entail along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B8SoMN"&gt;Most of the fun of these comics comes from seeing how the wider world reacts to Krakoa’s existence, and some of the conflicts are &lt;em&gt;wild&lt;/em&gt;. In one early &lt;em&gt;X-Men&lt;/em&gt; story, Krakoa is invaded by an elderly trio of radical super-botanists named Hordeculture (seriously). In &lt;em&gt;X-Men #4&lt;/em&gt; — one of the first and very best comics released in 2020 — the leaders of Krakoa go to Davos and dress down the economic leaders of the world over dinner. In the more action-oriented &lt;em&gt;X-Force&lt;/em&gt;, Krakoa is threatened by international black ops squads sent by people who see Krakoa as a ticking time bomb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="L0AH4r"&gt;&lt;q&gt;For this moment, they just feel like stories made for anyone curious enough to read them&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CRnXQv"&gt;But mostly, in a year full of news that was a nonstop assault for anyone but a few — mostly white, mostly wealthy — X-Men comics were a joy, simply because they’re a story about characters who, by definition (every big X-Men story must note how they are hated and feared), are always &lt;em&gt;losing&lt;/em&gt; and finally showed them refusing to play the same broken game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IPffCL"&gt;“The world has told me that I was less when I knew that I was more,” Cyclops says, early on in &lt;em&gt;House of X&lt;/em&gt;. “Did you honestly think that we were going to sit around forever and just take it?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2hxmZK"&gt;Part of what makes the X-Men endure is that there’s a certain malleability to the mutant metaphor. For years, fans and writers have compared the X-Men to the struggle for Civil Rights; more recently, the metaphor has been embraced as an exploration of queerness. No matter how you read them, if you’re from &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; kind of marginalized group, it’s easy to identify with the seemingly futile struggle of having to advocate for yourself and others in spaces hostile to you, spaces you should belong in if it weren’t for systemic injustices that have shut you out. I have tired of the fight for diversity in spaces that are only interested in the optics of diversity. There is something cathartic and beautiful in a story where Cyclops — the face of the X-Men for just about all 60 years of their existence — says we’re all done taking it. He’s found an answer he believes in, and he’s going to do the work to make it real. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PgYOlg"&gt;It also helps that, currently, the X-Men are a comics-only concern. Sure, they’re still owned by Disney and since &lt;em&gt;The New Mutants &lt;/em&gt;came out this year, their previous film franchise is not even that far in the rearview. But they’re also not yet a slide on some presentation about the next four years of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, at least for a little while. They’re not a reminder of their owner’s stranglehold on the wider entertainment industry. For this moment, they just feel like stories made for anyone curious enough to read them. Stories for people trying to find an answer that they believe in, to build a world they want to make real.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, MTV, and more ViacomCBS channels coming to Hulu with Live TV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Spongebob Squarepants" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QUui6bRt6IaFw9nkUCDJBy4L84k=/16x0:622x404/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68615772/Spongebob_Squarepants.1419965039.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Spongebob Squarepants&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tmZGom"&gt;More than 14 ViacomCBS networks, including Nickelodeon, BET, MTV, and Comedy Central are coming to &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;offerid=763711.113&amp;amp;type=3&amp;amp;subid=0&amp;amp;u1=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Hulu with Live TV&lt;/a&gt;, the company announced today. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;offerid=763711.10&amp;amp;type=3&amp;amp;subid=0&amp;amp;u1=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Hulu&lt;/a&gt; is not announcing a price hike with the new additions at this time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ThTAl1"&gt;This marks the first time that many of ViacomCBS’s networks are being made available to Hulu with Live TV subscribers. Other networks that come with the package include Paramount Network, VH1, CMT, Nick Jr., TV Land, BET Her, MTV2, NickToons, TeenNick, and MTV Classic. The multiyear expanded deal also ensures that Hulu with Live TV customers can retain access to CBS Sports Network, Pop TV, Smithsonian Channel, The CW, and Showtime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X9YF9B"&gt;“Hulu continues to be a great partner, and this agreement ensures that Hulu + Live TV subscribers are now able to enjoy the full breadth of our leading content across news, sports and entertainment for the first time,” said Ray Hopkins, president of US networks distribution at ViacomCBS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="35uASf"&gt;Prior to ViacomCBS and Hulu’s partnership, ViacomCBS made a deal with YouTube for its live TV offering, YouTube TV, to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21249931/viacomcbs-youtubetv-nickelodeon-mtv-comedy-central-streaming"&gt;carry the same suite of networks&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, the addition led some industry insiders to believe a price hike for YouTube TV was likely imminent. History certainly set the precedent: YouTube TV saw a $5 price increase in 2018 (from $35 to $40 a month) after Turner networks (TNT, TBS, CNN, truTV, Cartoon Network, and Adult Swim) &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/last-chance-for-35-youtube-tv-price-jumps-on-tuesday/"&gt;were added&lt;/a&gt;. YouTube TV was hit with price hikes once again (an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/10/18304871/youtube-tv-april-2019-price-increase-discovery-hgtv"&gt;additional $10 to $50 a month&lt;/a&gt;) not long after adding a number of Discovery channels and local feeds from four major broadcasters in April 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JPt9kz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cord cutting — once designed as the cheaper and better option — is becoming more expensive&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DryUIl"&gt;Those concerns turned out to be true. Not long after YouTube TV started carrying ViacomCBS channels, the service’s monthly cost &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308449/youtube-tv-price-increase-64-99-viacom-hbo-new-channels"&gt;sharply rose to $65 a month&lt;/a&gt;. Expecting a Hulu with Live TV price hike in the near future isn’t too out of left field. The only saving grace is that Hulu with Live TV already saw a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570259/hulu-live-tv-price-increase-cable-sports-news-virtual-bundle-disney"&gt;price hike in late 2020&lt;/a&gt; (going from $55 a month to $65, on par with YouTube TV). Still, annual price hikes for virtual live TV services have become par for the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CKw6tE"&gt;That’s especially true when said virtual TV providers are growing. Hulu with Live TV has more than 4 million subscribers and is tied into Disney’s growing suite of streaming services. CEO Bob Chapek spoke about Disney’s commitment to Hulu with Live TV on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562796/disney-plus-one-year-earnings-q4-mandalorian-streaming-subscribers-theaters"&gt;recent earnings call&lt;/a&gt;, and the Hulu team laid out plans for its future &lt;a href="https://tvrev.com/disney-investor-day-shows-path-to-put-all-content-under-one-umbrella/"&gt;at Disney’s big investor day&lt;/a&gt; in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ciIYew"&gt;While Disney executives continue to reiterate their commitment to Hulu’s live TV offering, there’s no question that cord cutting — once designed as the cheaper and better option — is becoming more expensive with each passing year. Still, being able to cancel and being able to switch services whenever might be more appealing to some customers than being caught in cable’s messy web.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Pro leak in hands-on video</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/32kh87K34j9HQYjCG41FR3ifgjk=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68615536/maxresdefault.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAGUMP0xsio" target="_blank"&gt;Digital Slang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UXMsiQ"&gt;Samsung’s upcoming true wireless earbuds, the Galaxy Buds Pro, have leaked again in a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAGUMP0xsio&amp;amp;feature=emb_logo"&gt;hands on video from YouTuber Digital Slang&lt;/a&gt;. As well as confirming the earbuds’ specs, and giving us an idea of how they look in the real word, the video also delivers some first impressions on how they perform. The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/digital_slang/status/1345407016832008192"&gt;YouTuber said&lt;/a&gt; he obtained the unannounced earbuds via a seller on Facebook, where &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/not-out-yet-someone-selling-galaxy-buds-pro-facebook/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SamMobile &lt;/em&gt;has reported&lt;/a&gt; others have also been selling them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="09HL7R"&gt;Echoing previous reports, Digital Slang says that the earbuds have a dust and water resistance rating of IPX7, support wireless charging, and feature active noise-cancellation. There’s also a transparency mode which allows the wearer to hear what’s going on around them while wearing the earbuds. According to Digital Slang, the earbuds’ transparency mode is among the best he’s heard from a pair of earbuds, but the noise-cancellation falls short of what’s offered by Apple’s AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a5eeW0Rv_eAmcUQ5r5MVu2dPZ7M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22195070/Ep7qr_SUYAIMGqR.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/_h0x0d_/status/1341767829926768643" target="_blank"&gt;WalkingCat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A spec sheet for the earbuds recently leaked, showing their specs in comparison to Samsung’s other buds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IPTa1k"&gt;The hands on video adds to a host of details that have leaked about the earbuds over the past month. We’ve seen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22054757/galaxy-buds-pro-leaked-images-renders-rounded-design-case"&gt;renders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22180111/galaxy-buds-pro-360-view-samsung-wireless"&gt;3D animations&lt;/a&gt;, and even a reported $199 price tag thanks to a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_h0x0d_/status/1341767829926768643"&gt;spec sheet leaked by WalkingCat&lt;/a&gt;. Battery life will apparently sit at up to 8 hours from the earbuds themselves, rising to 28 hours when paired with the charging case, putting them in a similar ballpark to the specs of Samsung’s previous true wireless earbuds, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price"&gt;Galaxy Buds Live&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t9ZESs"&gt;All signs point towards the Galaxy Buds Pro being unveiled at Samsung’s next Unpacked event, which is now officially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/3/22206649/samsung-officially-confirms-galaxy-s21-event-on-january-14th"&gt;due to take place on January 14th&lt;/a&gt;. Other devices expected at the event include the Galaxy S21 lineup of smartphones, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/1/22209216/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-tile-item-tracker-leak"&gt;Samsung’s Tile-like tracking devices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Images of Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra’s optional stylus and compatible case leak early</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sdequBrQeAgmHk1V9hBD7cXTy7w=/0x0:2250x1500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68615395/Samsung_Galaxy_S21_Ultra_S_Pen_Cover_1609725103_0_0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A case for the S21 Ultra with space for an optional  S Pen.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,120358.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="le0KRq"&gt;Images of what appears to be an S Pen stylus and carrying case for Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S21 Ultra have leaked online, &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120358.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. They show a stylus that looks similar in appearance to Samsung’s previous S Pens, as well as a phone case that’s a little wider than the handset itself to allow space for the optional accessory. &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; reports that the stylus will be sold separately from the phone for just under €40 (around $49). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBEhCB"&gt;This phone case is necessary because the S21 Ultra is rumored to support the S Pen but &lt;a href="https://winfuture.mobi/news/119995"&gt;reportedly won’t have a dedicated slot&lt;/a&gt; to store it unlike Samsung’s Note devices. The stylus is reportedly an optional accessory for the S21 Ultra, rather than something that comes in the box like with the Note phones. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qhnR3BnQbLiQ8g-kvF9TL0B_UBs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22212392/Samsung_Galaxy_S21_Ultra_S_Pen_Cover_1609725152_0_0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,120358.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The stylus accessory looks a lot like Samsung’s previous S Pens.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tJ1Syy"&gt;Rumors that the Galaxy S21 Ultra will work with the S Pen have been around for at least a month, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22175769/samsung-stylus-galaxy-phones-s21-foldable"&gt;Samsung itself&lt;/a&gt; even hinted that support was on the way when its president of mobile TM Roh said the company would add some of the Galaxy Note’s “most well-loved features” to other devices in its lineup. At the end of last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22196897/s-pen-uwb-comfirm-galaxy-s21-ultra-fcc"&gt;an FCC filing&lt;/a&gt; all-but-confirmed that stylus support was on the way for the upcoming phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6aTQQ2"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;, the S21 Ultra will support many of the same S Pen features as previous Note devices. It will reportedly have a pressure-sensitive tip, gesture controls via an accelerometer, and controls for playing and pausing videos or remotely taking photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R6tt9p"&gt;Reports of stylus support coming to the S21 Ultra have coincided with rumors that Samsung was preparing to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21754983/samsung-galaxy-note-21-2021-smartphone-discontinued-stylus-s21-foldable-rumor"&gt;discontinue its Note lineup&lt;/a&gt;, which counts stylus support among its defining features. However, this has reportedly been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22177972/galaxy-note-21-still-happening-yonhap"&gt;disputed by one Samsung official&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8BqgnK"&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra is expected to be one of three devices that’ll make up the S21 lineup, alongside the Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus. Beyond its stylus support, other reports have claimed the Galaxy S21 Ultra’s rear camera array will include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189305/samsung-s21-ultra-spec-leak-cameras"&gt;two telephoto cameras&lt;/a&gt; as well as a main 108-megapixel camera. Leaked video teasers suggest it’ll have a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/12/8/22163632/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-5g-teaser-video-leak"&gt;curved screen&lt;/a&gt; (compared to flat screens for the other two S21 handsets) and redesigned camera bump compared to the previous generation S20 Ultra, and &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120117.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; previously reported&lt;/a&gt; it’ll have a 6.8-inch 120Hz display, and a 5,000 mAh battery with support for 45W fast charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gt7Jux"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/3/22206649/samsung-officially-confirms-galaxy-s21-event-on-january-14th"&gt;Samsung has confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that its next Unpacked launch event will take place on January 14th, during which it’s expected to announce the new Galaxy S21 range and possibly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/1/22209216/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-tile-item-tracker-leak"&gt;a new Tile competitor&lt;/a&gt; alongside the heavily leaked &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22180111/galaxy-buds-pro-360-view-samsung-wireless"&gt;Galaxy Buds Pro wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
