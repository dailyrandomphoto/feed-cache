    <title>The GameStop stock roller coaster has come to the dip</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jw82xSwkSVKVbtxGqKKUfAJ689k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68760120/slack_imgs.com.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zbFmvo"&gt;It hasn’t been a good day for WallStreetBets, as GameStop’s stock has plummeted today. AMC, the community’s other bet, dropped as well. But unlike previous dips, the stocks don’t appear to be rallying. Prices stayed low for the entire trading day, something that hasn’t happened since WallStreetBets became a household name one week ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sNIMZV"&gt;When the market closed today, the price of GameStop was $90 even, an 81 percent drop from GameStop’s peak at $483, and a 58 percent drop from its price of $218 on Friday evening. AMC is down too, closing today at $7.82, which is a 61 percent drop from its peak at $19.88. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDB84w"&gt;It’s hard to believe that in August of last year, GameStop was trading at $4.50. Between then and last week, some investors bet that the stock was undervalued, driving it up to around $30 a share. Then, the WallStreetBets subreddit decided &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;it would take the stock to the moon&lt;/a&gt;, punishing those betting against it and attempting to make money in the process. The idea of buying at $4 a share and selling for $400 obviously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22261036/wallstreet-bets-movie-adaptation-deals-netflix-mgm"&gt;captured the public’s imagination&lt;/a&gt;, and millions rushed to give trading a try as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252864/wallstreetbets-stocks-memes-broker-outages-limits-amc-gamestop"&gt;the GameStop meme&lt;/a&gt; went mainstream — taking AMC and others along for the ride as investors realized they could pump those stocks too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Chart: Apple Stocks&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;GameStop’s stock over the past week, with a big ‘ol dip today. If this was a roller coaster track, it’d be a lot of fun.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A graph of AMC’s stock price over the past week" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bRv75OA9UEH9RShZWeVscrNyOXg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22277377/Screen_Shot_2021_02_02_at_3.57.16_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Chart: Apple Stocks&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;No, it’s not the same picture, just the same shape.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="T82PDq"&gt;As to whether this is the end of GameStop’s wild ride, it’s almost impossible to tell. The past week’s peaks, dips, and drops have been detached from the underlying businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TfZbAJ"&gt;Part of that is the culture of WallStreetBets itself. Praising people for not selling their stocks, and ridiculing those that do is a recipe for a community that’s going to be stubborn. And now it’s started telling itself that the drop is &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lax4z8/hardcore_laddering/"&gt;due to hedge fund market manipulation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="owGj8F"&gt;If this news has made you feel like reading about other stock market shenanigans, &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt; has an article &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/02/as-gamestop-plunges-volkswagens-2008-short-squeeze-gives-an-idea-of-how-painful-it-will-get.html"&gt;that compares what’s happening now to the 2008 Volkswagen short squeeze&lt;/a&gt;, and Vox’s &lt;em&gt;Recode&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22262271/gamestop-bubble-robinhood-henry-blodget-interview"&gt;has an interview with Henry Blodget&lt;/a&gt;, who was involved with the Dotcom bubble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2TWQ7E"&gt;As for the people who have deep losses from today’s dive? They’re hoping for a rally, so they can at least sell for what they bought in for. Some, like Dutch student Evan Oosterink, are counting on it — he bet about $10,000, which represented “years of savings from his parents and some government college loans,” &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/02/gamestop-stock-plunge-losers/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;reported.&lt;/a&gt; He lost about $9,000 today, but is still holding the stock in the hope that he can recoup his loss. “Being a part of WallStreetBets, it’s like a religion you’re devoted to,” he said to &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VfUu0E"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It was lovely reading those stories on Reddit about how GameStop stock changed their lives and will help them pay medical bills, save pets etc and I really, really, really hope they sold &lt;a href="https://t.co/Kcjwf4NNnN"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Kcjwf4NNnN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jason Schreier (@jasonschreier) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1356615785280602119?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Apple’s next macOS Big Sur update should make iPad apps look less awkward on the Mac</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eiVcuQ_-cPPj7W5HLErWfl5YFQE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68760005/akramer_201113_4290_0023.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Alexander Kramer for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CEfu9W"&gt;Apple just yesterday released its latest update for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21564490/macos-big-sur-review-apple-macbook-pro-air-mac-ipad-m1"&gt;macOS Big Sur&lt;/a&gt; with improved Bluetooth reliability and a handful of bug fixes. And today, it’s rolling out the first beta of macOS Big Sur 11.3, which will bring further refinements to Safari, Reminders, Apple Music, Apple News, and other apps. This update will also try to improve the experience of running iPhone and iPad apps on M1 Macs, which can still be a little awkward at this early stage (and without a touchscreen display). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WxHDgd"&gt;iPadOS apps will now appear larger than before — if your screen size allows for it — and beta testers will find a new preference pane for iPhone and iPad apps that’ll let them better personalize the “touch alternatives” keyboard commands. Touch alternatives allow for “keyboard alternatives for tap, swipe, and drag gestures, and enables multi-finger gestures using the option key and a trackpad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="c8j3Kj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"macOS 11 Big Sur review: a long time coming","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21564490/macos-big-sur-review-apple-macbook-pro-air-mac-ipad-m1"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="TPnC0Y"&gt;Big Sur 11.3 will make Safari’s start page more customizable, letting you rearrange the different sections (favorites, Reading List, Siri suggestions, etc.) to your own liking. Developers will gain the ability to make extensions that run on the new tab page, and they can also take advantage of a new web speech API to integrate speech recognition on their web pages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ASHWiF"&gt;As for the Reminders app, you’ll be able to sort your reminders based on title, due date, priority, or creation date. And with this update, Apple will let you easily &lt;em&gt;print&lt;/em&gt; your reminders if a paper copy might prove helpful when running to the store or completing other tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b3YSYK"&gt;Apple Music gets small tweaks like a shortcut to your “Made for You” personalized playlists and mixes. Live and upcoming special events will be highlighted in the For You tab, as well. The Apple News app is undergoing some design improvements in the Apple News Plus tab to make your magazines and newspapers easier to reach (and download). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GMd199"&gt;And like the upcoming iOS 14.5 update, macOS Big Sur 11.3 adds support for the latest Xbox and PlayStation DualSense controllers; the same compatibility is coming to Apple’s mobile devices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260671/ios-14-5-ps5-dualsense-xbox-series-x-controller-support"&gt;as part of iOS 14.5&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Another SpaceX Starship nails clean test flight, but explodes on landing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_8npTmWOZcXIP4itqoW_RehdKC4=/45x0:435x260/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68759903/spaceship_crash_space_x.5.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NofPJn"&gt;SpaceX’s latest Starship prototype launched on Tuesday, soaring miles above its South Texas facilities in a successful flight demonstration before exploding during the landing attempt. It’s the second failed landing in a row, after a previous prototype, SN8, launched and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22030125/spacex-starship-prototype-flight-test-12-5-kilometer-launch"&gt;failed to stick the landing in December.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5wSAQ"&gt;This week’s launch demo — one of many in the books already — follows weeks of tension between SpaceX and the Federal Aviation Administration, which approves test launches like this one. During its high-altitude test launch with SN8 two months ago, the company violated its FAA launch license. This triggered an investigation that held up today’s SN9 flight and frustrated SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256657/spacex-launch-violation-explosive-starship-faa-investigation-elon-musk"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="a7ctV8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;SpaceX launched the thing anyway&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9UKOxg"&gt;In a statement Tuesday morning announcing SN9 was clear to fly, the FAA confirmed the previous violation: Before SN8 launched, the agency had denied a request from SpaceX to waive public safety limits associated with the flight, but SpaceX launched the thing anyway. It’s still unclear what safety limits SpaceX wanted to waive in connection with the launch. The FAA declined to specify and SpaceX has yet to respond for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LeUvD1"&gt;On Tuesday, with fresh FAA approval for a flight plan that “complies with all safety and related federal regulations,” the 16-story-tall rocket lifted off from SpaceX’s Boca Chica, Texas test facilities around 3:30PM ET under clear skies, reaching an altitude of 6.2 miles (10km) — a bit shorter than SN8’s target altitude of 7.7 miles. After that, SN9 shut down its three engines to begin a free-falling dance back to Earth, tilting on its side to test new aerodynamic flaps and attempt a “belly flop” maneuver. If all had gone well, the rocket would have landed vertically. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8lto3dKdhzczNI3XoXx12q_ZheY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22277204/Screen_Shot_2021_02_02_at_3.31.59_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;SpaceX&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;SN9 just before it’s untimely end.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Otrm3I"&gt;Instead, SN9 slammed into the ground at a roughly 45-degree angle, perishing in an explosive fireball just like SN8. “We had another great flight up to the 10km apogee... we’ve just gotta work on that landing a little bit,” said SpaceX engineer John Insprucker, who usually only narrates the company’s live video feeds for routine Falcon 9 launches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fwpek7"&gt;The FAA opened an investigation into the SN9 landing explosion, it said in a statement Tuesday night, adding that “although this was an uncrewed test flight, the investigation will identify the root cause of today’s mishap and possible opportunities to further enhance safety as the program develops.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Vv6h8"&gt;The landing explosion sprayed debris on SN10, another Starship prototype that stood ready for SpaceX’s next test flight. The company wheeled SN10 out of its towering, rocket-shaped facilities last Friday night to make room for future prototype construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UAqbfO"&gt;On the live stream, Insprucker reminded SpaceX’s audience that the SN9 flight, though it ended in a dramatic explosion, was a test, and a number of test objectives were met. It was the “second time we’ve flown Starship in this configuration, we’ve got a lot of good data, and the primary objective to demonstrate control of the vehicle in the subsonic re-entry looked to be very good. And we will take a lot out of that,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The iCloud for Windows version that let you sync Apple passwords is no longer available</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ENAPCS-OGtplT01iFYBniRzXrSI=/0x191:1646x1288/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68759891/Screen_Shot_2021_02_02_at_2.06.23_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aRJcj0"&gt;Apple’s rocky rollout of iCloud password sync on Windows has hit another bump: you can no longer download the version of the app that allowed syncing passwords from your Apple devices with your Chrome web browser on a Windows PC (&lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/apple-pulls-update-supports-icloud-keychain-windows-10?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+wmexperts+%28Windows+Central%29"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Windows Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Version 12 of Apple’s iCloud for Windows app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252825/apple-icloud-keychain-windows-google-chrome"&gt;released last week with supposed support for the feature&lt;/a&gt;, but the Chrome extension to make it work &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/31/22259720/apple-icloud-passwords-chrome-browser-extension-released"&gt;wasn’t available until two days ago&lt;/a&gt;. Now, version 12 is gone from the Windows Store, with version 11.6 taking its place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8zfrDY"&gt;Weirdly, the changelog on the Windows Store still says that the password syncing functionality is present. However, upon downloading, the app shows the version as 11.6 in the top right. We verified this for ourselves, and you can see there’s no password sync option in our first screenshot below.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C7oNrUboWdOSOEC6x_1IIm2O0NM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22277292/icloud_11_6_windows_store.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The version of the app we downloaded today, 11.6.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Image of the iCloud for Windows screen, with the new Passwords option" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r_KytxKImNL0D4_h7hiRU8q4Gms=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22263753/IMAGE_2021_01_27_11_57_45.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Version 12 of the app with the passwords option, downloaded January 27.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YwPEQX"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://the8-bit.com/apple-pulls-icloud-12-icloud-passwords-update/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 8-Bit&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;, the late-to-the-party Chrome Extension is still available on the Chrome Web Store, at least for now. Anyone still on version 11 of the iCloud for Windows app, though, won’t be able to upgrade and take advantage of the extension anyhow. But if you currently have version 12 on your computer, Windows won’t make you downgrade to the previous version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rpQ4mX"&gt;It’s unclear why Apple pulled the update — the &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/icloud-passwords/pejdijmoenmkgeppbflobdenhhabjlaj/"&gt;reviews for the Chrome extension&lt;/a&gt; aren’t good, but many of them are users reporting that it doesn’t work on Mac, which it’s not designed for. Whatever the reason, this has been one of the messier rollouts I’ve seen from Apple in recent memory. The story, it seems, is the same as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252825/apple-icloud-keychain-windows-google-chrome"&gt;the last time I wrote about iCloud Passwords for Windows&lt;/a&gt;: if you want them, you’ll have to wait a bit longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="38qlEt"&gt;Apple was didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram is stopping some people from posting feed photos to stories</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ScEb4_-npAzLyPdoND6uGBMCPqo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68759782/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kQe0RZ"&gt;Instagram is disabling the ability to share (and reshare) posts from your feed to stories as part of a test to see how it changes engagement with the popular feature. The company announced the change in a notification banner sent to users in “select countries” where the test is being conducted, &lt;a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/instagram-tests-removing-the-option-to-share-feed-posts-within-stories/594255/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Social Media Today&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;writes. We’ve reached out to Instagram for specifics on exactly which countries are participating and will update if we hear more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bvh9UE"&gt;“We hear from our community that they want to see fewer posts in Stories,” the notification starts. “During this test, you won’t be able to add a feed post to your Story.” Resharing posts to stories is a fairly common practice, though it does create situations where you’ll see a post in your feed and then immediately see that post duplicated in your friend’s stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xEelxU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;instagram users: I wish people stopped sharing so many feed posts to their Stories&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;instagram: &lt;a href="https://t.co/KQkBbVY45v"&gt;pic.twitter.com/KQkBbVY45v&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Matt Navarra (@MattNavarra) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1355090232316743685?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6l7VZq"&gt;However annoying this situation may be, it’s worth noting that sharing posts to stories is how many artists, businesses, and organizations get in front of users, due to Instagram’s algorithm favoring friends and family. For example, shoving feed posts in stories opens up the opportunity for the mutual aid organization in your neighborhood to get more donations. Taking away the ability to reshare is responding to a behavior Facebook and Instagram encouraged in the first place by placing stories so prominently in the app and offering the ability to share them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pWIPWw"&gt;For now, disabling reshares remains a test, much like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/14/20964865/instagram-test-hide-like-counts-expands-us-globally"&gt;the changes to likes&lt;/a&gt; the company considered and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/9/10/21429144/instagram-redesign-test-reels-shopping-adam-mosseri-interview"&gt;the variety of new app layouts it has prototyped&lt;/a&gt;. But the timing is a bit ironic: Twitter is currently &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1337111365757100033?s=20"&gt;testing the ability to share tweets to Instagram stories&lt;/a&gt; as stickers. So you might start seeing a lot more reshares in your stories from an entirely different social media platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="P7UHfl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;For some of you on iOS, we’ll be testing sharing a Tweet as a sticker to Instagram too! Tap the Instagram icon in the Tweet share menu to add the Tweet as a sticker in a Story.&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1337111365757100033?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 10, 2020&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>TikTok reduces India staff after long-standing countrywide ban</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="TikTok Banned In India" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pcO9_NPjD5NuV6g52bSKM1wjps0=/0x104:5035x3461/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68759734/1223851409.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KWGo7c"&gt;More than seven months after India issued a countrywide ban on TikTok, the app is significantly reducing its staffing in the country. On Tuesday, &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/China-tech/TikTok-gives-up-on-India-months-after-government-ban"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei Asia&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that TikTok was “essentially withdrawing” from India, citing sources familiar with the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="arbpl7"&gt;Reached for comment, a TikTok spokesperson confirmed that it was reducing its workforce in India but disputed the details of &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;’s report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yzDLQ6"&gt;In a statement, a TikTok spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge: “&lt;/em&gt;Given the lack of feedback from the government about how to resolve this issue in the subsequent seven months, it is with deep sadness that we have decided to reduce our workforce in India... [We] hope to get the chance to relaunch TikTok in India to support the hundreds of millions of users, artists, story-tellers, educators and performers there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vVevEC"&gt;It’s unclear how many employees TikTok will retain. &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; reported that “most” local employees were set to be laid off. Pressed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, the company did not clarify how many India-based employees will remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ahfgGs"&gt;India was previously a large market for TikTok, which is owned by the Beijing-based firm ByteDance: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21307014/india-ban-tiktok-wechat-china-apps"&gt;30 percent&lt;/a&gt; of TikTok’s downloads came from India as of April 2020. As of June, the app had about 167 million users in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="I21jbv"&gt;&lt;q&gt; “It is with deep sadness that we have decided to reduce our workforce in India”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eRDN0q"&gt;TikTok has been banned in India since June 29th. In its &lt;a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetailm.aspx?PRID=1635206#"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;, the country’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology stated that the apps were “engaged in activities which is prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Htorks"&gt;ByteDance, at the time, did not indicate plans to pull out. Following the announcement, the head of TikTok India issued a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TikTok_IN/status/1277811841364668416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1277811841364668416%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F6%2F29%2F21307014%2Findia-ban-tiktok-wechat-china-apps"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; claiming that the company had not shared Indian users’ information with the Chinese government and that its practices were in compliance with India’s data privacy and security requirements. “We have been invited to meet with concerned government stakeholders for an opportunity to respond and submit clarifications,” the statement read. “We place the highest importance on user privacy and integrity.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmDoKm"&gt;That wasn’t TikTok’s first quarrel with the Indian government. Indian lawmakers, including the information technology minister of Tamil Nadu, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/13/18223590/tiktok-india-ban-legislation-government-teens"&gt;called for the app to be banned&lt;/a&gt; in early 2019, citing concerns about the behavior of teens and young adults on the service. Apple and Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/16/18411013/tiktok-india-google-play-block-apple-app-store-bytedance"&gt;pulled the app&lt;/a&gt; from their respective stores in India in mid-April, following a state court request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JDDObX"&gt;That ban was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/24/18515035/tiktok-is-no-longer-banned-in-india"&gt;lifted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/24/18515035/tiktok-is-no-longer-banned-in-india"&gt;j&lt;/a&gt;ust over a week later, and didn’t impact folks who were already using TikTok; it merely prevented new downloads. Even so, TikTok claimed that it suffered up to $500,000 in losses each day the ban was in effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zsl3EM"&gt;“We are committed to continuously enhancing our safety features as a testament to our ongoing commitment to our users in India,” ByteDance said, following the lift of the ban. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YN5itf"&gt;Other countries have long-running security concerns with TikTok as well. The Trump administration &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22160239/tiktok-ban-judge-trump-administration-us-commerce-department"&gt;attempted&lt;/a&gt; to block transactions between ByteDance and US companies last year but was blocked from doing so by the courts. Several &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21150667/tsa-tiktok-employee-ban-bytedance-chuck-schumer-homeland-security"&gt;US government agencies&lt;/a&gt; have banned the use of the app on government-issued devices. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Meet’s new ‘green room’ lets you do an audio / video pre-check</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zjBTZJXtkpf0gYvpC_GINLgTbEY=/0x178:934x801/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68759687/Screen_Shot_2021_02_02_at_10.15.30_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wVCcNH"&gt;It can be difficult to figure out how you’re coming across in a videoconference, especially if you want to make sure everything works before you start the meeting. How is your lighting? Are you sitting too close or too far from the camera? Is your audio okay, are you accidentally muted, or do you sound as if you’re in an echo chamber? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8826Jd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/02/check-video-and-peripheral-device-quality-with-google-meet-self-check.html"&gt;Google has now made it easier&lt;/a&gt; to check your appearance and your tech &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; a Meet conference with its new “green room” feature (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/02/google-meet-preview-video/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). When you start or prepare to join a meeting, in the usual “Ready to join?” window that first appears, you will now also see a small button below your video that says “Check your audio and video.” Just click on that button, and a pop-up window will not only show your video image, but allow you to see (and change) which microphone, speaker, and camera is currently live.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google Meet’s “green room” lets you check your audio and video." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0QXn3yWmxmE4kLfrAp0HLZ4T6xw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22277054/Screen_Shot_2021_02_02_at_10.14.05_AM__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Meet’s “green room” lets you check your audio and video.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="F35CO0"&gt;A “Next” button on that pop-up window then lets you record a short 6-second video sample, allowing you to see how you will look and sound to the others in your meeting. According to Google, the clip is private to you and will not be saved. Your mic, speaker, camera, and connection are also checked by the system and get green checkmarks if they seem to be working. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J1e35T"&gt;While previously you could see how you appeared in the initial “Ready to join?” window, Meet’s new “green room” can be even more helpful. For example, you can test various forms of lighting, test whether your laptop’s audio is better or worse than your headset’s, and make sure that you’re looking good before your meeting — with colleagues, friends, or family — starts.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vuve0j"&gt;Google Meet’s new “green room” feature is available now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pYrizG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apex Legends is finally coming to the Nintendo Switch on March 9th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p4zxOen3TvaYO7Ws3tOaXQC0eQE=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68759650/ss_8616ccdae08da0793a2f1d9b52997170eb0a1e25.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4cOIKF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt; is coming to the Nintendo Switch very soon. Today, &lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/switch-launch-march-2021"&gt;EA announced&lt;/a&gt; that the portable version of its sci-fi battle royale will debut on Nintendo’s tablet on March 9th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ped5Yk"&gt;Chad Grenier, &lt;em&gt;Apex&lt;/em&gt;’s game director, says the new version will include “cross-platform play, our latest seasonal content, and full feature parity with the other versions of the game.” &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt; originally launched in early 2019, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296353/ea-apex-legends-switch-steam-crossplay-titanfall-2-sims-4-way-out"&gt;a Switch version was announced last June&lt;/a&gt;. It’s developed by Respawn, the studio behind games like &lt;em&gt;Titanfall&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/15/20965741/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review-xbox-ps4-pc-respawn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eXOx5A"&gt;The Switch version launches not long after the game’s eighth season, which launches today. To make up for the difference, EA says that “since we’re launching a few weeks after the start of season eight, Switch players will be granted 30 free levels for their season eight battle pass. For the first two weeks after launch, playing on Switch will also earn you double XP.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zeTfvA"&gt;Nintendo’s device is steadily becoming a great portable option for some of the biggest free-to-play multiplayer games around, with &lt;em&gt;Apex&lt;/em&gt; joining titles like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Spellbreak.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The rise of the GOP Poster’s Caucus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Opening Day Of The 117th Congress On Capitol Hill" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GIdb283-6eEn6LyN9l7JLks9eaU=/36x0:5877x3894/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68759553/1230412906.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7crxcI"&gt;It was September 2018, while Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was testifying before Congress for the first time, when sitting lawmakers had their first confrontation with the wild nature of the online right. Nearly 90 minutes after the hearing began, Laura Loomer, a far-right internet celebrity, stood up from the committee audience. “Please help us Mr. President before it is too late,” Loomer yelled, selfie stick in hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8xALHs"&gt;She said something about “censoring” and then something about “shadowbanning,” although it was hard to make out the argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X0WI06"&gt;“What is she trying to say?” Rep. Billy Long (R-MO) asked, before pretending to lead a live auction, imitating an auctioneer’s call to drown out Loomer’s voice and forcing her out the hearing room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bQWHFl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Alt-Right conspiracy theory peddler Laura Loomer just crashed Jack Dorsey's Congressional testimony.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/USRepLong?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@USRepLong&lt;/a&gt; began mocking her &lt;a href="https://t.co/aQiAwnmeoE"&gt;pic.twitter.com/aQiAwnmeoE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— jordan (@JordanUhl) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JordanUhl/status/1037414684994007040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 5, 2018&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WMNZTz"&gt;It was a jarring moment, but as Republicans struggle with the rise of QAnon — and, more specifically, the bizarre conspiracies spread by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) — the moment may have had more to say about the party’s future than anyone realized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b8hU9o"&gt;Since 2016, the Republican Party has gone from nearly getting into fistfights &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/9/5/17823322/alex-jones-info-wars-senate-intelligence-committee"&gt;with conspiracy posters like Alex Jones&lt;/a&gt; to sharing offices next door to them on the Capitol grounds. Republicans have dipped in and out of the conservative internet ecosystem, one concentrated with misinformation and conspiracy, at times that were most politically expedient for them and their party. But Greene’s new spot in Congress is showing how powerful that ecosystem is and how difficult it will be for the party to shed. For a growing portion of the Republican Party, governance is now secondary to content, and the challenges of holding office aren’t so different from the hustle of a popular YouTube channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T4I5jm"&gt;While far-right conspiracy theorists trolled Congress in 2018, Greene was building her own facsimile of a following online. That same year, Greene posted to Facebook suggesting that the Parkland, Florida, school shooting, which left 17 people dead, was a “false flag” operation, a classic falsehood peddled by people like Jones online. It was this post, first reported &lt;a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/false-flag-conspiracy-theory/rep-marjorie-taylor-greene-facebook-2018-parkland-school-shooting-was"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;Media Matters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;paired with a new report &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/26/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-democrats-violence/index.html"&gt;from CNN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that uncovered messages from Greene supporting the execution of prominent Democrats that forced Republicans to finally address her online history, something broadly known for months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vGXlqh"&gt;Greene’s first few weeks in Congress have led to more content than compromise. She’s introduced dead-on-arrival articles of impeachment against President Joe Biden and was &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/17/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-twitter/index.html"&gt;already suspended from Twitter&lt;/a&gt; for violating the platform’s rules on election misinformation after posting that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/insurrection-at-the-capitol/2021/01/17/957891462/twitter-suspends-rep-marjorie-taylor-greene-s-account-temporarily"&gt;some races across the country&lt;/a&gt; were falsely called for Biden. Rep. Cori Bush (D-MO) announced last week that she would be moving her office farther away from Greene and described an altercation the two had in the hall over masks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0MESpR"&gt;Later that week, Greene put out a video of the incident where she wasn’t wearing a mask properly, mirroring the look and behavior of right-wing provocateurs like Loomer or disgraced former Staten Island congressional candidate and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/11/20689402/joey-salads-youtube-campaign-congress-trump-republican-political-bias"&gt;YouTube prankster Joey Salads&lt;/a&gt;; the camera was shaky, held vertically, and pointed at her face as she talked about her day in Congress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XoeqE2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;To Greene, this content and its consequences are their own kind of success&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5NHISu"&gt;To Greene, this content and its consequences are their own kind of success — something far more valuable than a co-sponsored bill or a spot on a powerful committee. After Democrats called to expel her last week, Greene said she raised &lt;a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-says-she-raised-16-million-after-calls-for-her-expulsion/DOPUOGZ66FGV5CUGHATP2RXRFY/"&gt;over $1.6 million&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mtgreenee/status/1355263214020419586?s=20"&gt;In a statement Friday&lt;/a&gt;, Greene said, “I will never back down. I will never give up. Because I am one of you. And I will always represent you.” She continued, “I knew this day would come, it was only a question of when.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9iIIfM"&gt;If that sounds like the kind of non-apology you’d hear from a teenage YouTuber, it’s no coincidence. For Greene, governing &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;posting. Her meteoric rise from Facebook influencer to congressperson is a symptom of the algorithm-based social media feeds of our time. In 2017, Greene first posted about QAnon. “Have you guys been following 4chan? Q? Any of that stuff?” Greene said &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rtYok4fdbQ"&gt;in a video&lt;/a&gt;. “Q is a patriot, we know that for sure.” Greene makes increasingly more outlandish claims for the same reason prank YouTubers and their stunts become even more dangerous: the more controversy she generates, the larger her audience becomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ArO1j"&gt;Greene has become the face of the Republican Party’s “Poster’s Caucus,” where messaging and content reigns supreme over policy. Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-NC) said &lt;a href="https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/new-republican-congressman-prioritizes-punditry-over-policy-n1255967"&gt;in a letter to colleagues last week&lt;/a&gt; that he would be focusing on communications over legislation as well — and for good reason. Cawthorn’s biggest wins have been &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/11/03/madison-cawthorn-reacts-winning-seat-congress-cry-more-lib/6155257002/"&gt;tweets&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://madison-cawthorn.myshopify.com/"&gt;merch drops&lt;/a&gt;. That’s simply what his audience expects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dNyrA1"&gt;If Republicans have largely remained silent over Greene’s bizarre approach to politics, it’s because they understand the value of Greene’s connection with her audience. It’s a more extreme version of a game conservative lawmakers have been playing with the online right for years. In an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;last year, conservative YouTuber Dave Rubin made a similar observation, saying that lawmakers needed him more than he needed them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r1bSwN"&gt;“It was Dan Crenshaw who reached out to me. It was the Ted Cruz people who reached out to me. It was Rand Paul people who reached out to me,” Rubin told &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21489979/biden-trump-presidential-dabate-election-youtube-ben-shapiro-dave-rubin"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “They clearly see the seas changing in terms of where people are getting their news, and that they need an opportunity to have their ideas heard.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DqN5hV"&gt;Political parties have long struggled with their base, and courting media figures has often been a part of it — from Walter Winchell to Rush Limbaugh. But the novel dynamics of the internet have made the base more extreme and alienated it from the conventional dynamics of government. While lawmakers focus on stimulus checks and a second Trump impeachment, online channels are talking about pedophilia rings and antifa super-soldiers, creating a bizarre alternate reality with no meaningful connection to the actual functions of Congress. Using open platforms and independent companies, the usual moderating forces — like corporate standards departments or advertiser boycotts — just aren’t a factor. For figures like Alex Jones or Laura Loomer, there’s simply no reason to reengage with reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2RKkd5"&gt;With Greene, that kind of logic is now part of the Republican House delegation, and it’s still hard to say how party leaders will respond to this new force. House Democrats are pushing hard to marginalize Greene, pointing to her unhinged and often anti-Semitic statements. While some Senate Republicans like Mitch McConnell (R-KY) condemned Greene, calling her embrace of conspiracy theories a “cancer for the Republican party,” others have been quiet. House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) said he would talk to Greene about her social media posts last week, but it’s not clear when that meeting will take place, as of publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GxbRzw"&gt;It’s easy to see why McConnell is scared. This delay from Republicans and McCarthy is only providing Democrats &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/01/democrats-marjorie-taylor-greene-ultimatum-464382"&gt;with more ammo for future elections&lt;/a&gt;, tying the GOP with QAnon or any other conspiracy they grab on to before November 2022. That shell game might be good for subscriber numbers, but it’s bad for the GOP — and if leaders aren’t careful, they may end up the party of Alex Jones instead of the party of Marco Rubio.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s latest earnings cap off a sterling 2020, despite the pandemic</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Dg1Jn6"&gt;Amazon founder and soon-to-be-former CEO Jeff Bezos &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22263039/amazon-new-ceo-jeff-bezos-andy-jassy-executive-chair-board-q3-2021"&gt;is stepping down from his role&lt;/a&gt;, making way for Amazon Web Services CEO Andy Jassy to take his place, and the company couldn’t be in better shape financially for the big transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="spBgp0"&gt;Despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Amazon has kept growing bigger during times that have strained many other businesses. In its Q4 2020 earnings release this afternoon, the company reported net income more than doubling to $7.2 billion for the quarter, compared to $3.3 billion for the same period in 2019. Amazon’s full-year 2020 net sales were up 38 percent, to $386.1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fYQ0pE"&gt;There’s a little more to unpack in these Q4 earnings than one might usually see. For 2020, Amazon shifted its Prime Day shopping event from the middle of summer to mid-October, which likely gave its numbers a big boost. And in doing so, it basically kicked off the holiday shopping season earlier than ever, with more people at home shopping exclusively online to avoid in-person gifting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2F7I0g"&gt;Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://ir.aboutamazon.com/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/Amazon-Q4-2020-Earnings-Release.pdf"&gt;latest earnings release&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t feature a lengthy statement from Bezos, who more recently had reserved this spot for announcing the company would commit huge amounts of money toward COVID-19 research and prevention. Instead, Bezos used it as a place to rattle off Amazon’s biggest inventions that have grown in popularity under his control, capping off his era as the CEO of the largest, most profitable company on the planet. He’ll remain CEO until Q3 2021, when Andy Jassy will take over.&lt;/p&gt;
