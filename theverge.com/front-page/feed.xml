    <title>Facebook and Instagram are down</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wz0tme"&gt;Facebook and Instagram were down on Thursday afternoon. The outage appeared to start around 5:30PM ET, with several thousand people &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/instagram/"&gt;reporting outages&lt;/a&gt; on DownDetector. The outage is the second one in less than a month from the social media giant; an outage on March 19th took its sites &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22340405/instagram-whatsapp-facebook-messenger-down-outage"&gt;offline for several hours&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook returned a “sorry something went wrong” error message:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CTq9ijhz8IEIlwKkaVsxK-QcP1Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430835/image__5_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dySLEl"&gt;The company didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on the cause of the outage; it’s unclear at this time when service will be fully restored. In addition to WhatsApp and Messenger, the outage appeared to affect Facebook’s internal websites as well, first noted in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1380274375757242368"&gt;tweet from develope&lt;/a&gt;r Jane Wong. Even Facebook’s &lt;a href="https://developers.facebook.com/status/dashboard/"&gt;outage dashboard&lt;/a&gt; appeared to be having problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HdjHJs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTuber records himself trespassing at SpaceX’s Starship facilities</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A man standing in front of a large silver rocket" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b8n23QGGLXjhirjnZoKVdUiE9f0=/143x0:2624x1654/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69098076/Screen_Shot_2021_04_08_at_3.26.23_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A still from the video originally uploaded to the YouTube channel Loco VlogS.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Loco VlogS&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bdr6ac"&gt;A YouTuber recorded himself entering SpaceX’s Starship rocket facilities in south Texas last month, freely sauntering on site. No security stopped him from wandering around the underside of SN11, the 16-story-tall rocket prototype that would launch and explode just a few days later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tV3xxY"&gt;The video was posted to a small YouTube channel called Loco VlogS, which is run by “Caesar.” Caesar did not respond to multiple emails and DMs asking for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EXLcrC"&gt;For space enthusiasts, SpaceX’s sprawling rocket campus in Texas just a few miles north of the Rio Grande is a tantalizing museum of rocketry just laying out in the open, housing millions of dollars worth of tech — some of which SpaceX has pitched to the Air Force and NASA. It doesn’t have the towering walls or advanced security one might expect a company to have for safeguarding sensitive (and potentially dangerous) rocket hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cd3Uwy"&gt;Development of Starship, the centerpiece of Elon Musk’s goal to ferry humans and cargo to the Moon and Mars, is aided in part by a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21242837/nasa-spacex-blue-origin-dynetics-human-lunar-landers"&gt;$135 million NASA contract&lt;/a&gt; to help mature its design under the agency’s Human Lunar Landing system program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imwjhq"&gt;“NASA takes safety and security very seriously,” said Monica Witt, spokeswoman for the agency. “The Human Landing System contracts include requirements for the contractors to appropriately safeguard information, software, and hardware. SpaceX notified NASA that they investigated this incident.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zD4X3E"&gt;Caesar entered the rocket site and seemingly moved around SpaceX hardware and equipment with ease, recording closeups of Starship SN11’s Raptor engines. The video garnered 5 likes and at least 100 dislikes, as well as a barrage of comments from pissed-off SpaceX fans, before he deleted it, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-QKLgcN0ig"&gt;different YouTube account&lt;/a&gt; that archived the video. In a classic YouTube move, Caesar posted an apology video a few days later on April 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yU2nP9"&gt;“Yes it was wrong, yes it was illegal,” he said &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKOldPkX9MY"&gt;in the apology video&lt;/a&gt;. “But in my eyes, in that time of moment, I didn’t really think about that... What went through my mind was, ‘Okay, I’m never gonna get this opportunity again.’ So I went for it. And, well, this happened.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wcnmSt"&gt;The Federal Aviation Administration, which regulates launches and launch infrastructure for the sake of public safety, said it was aware of the video and brought it to SpaceX’s attention&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;“Maintaining the physical security of a launch facility is an important aspect of ensuring public safety,” a spokesman said. SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W65wM2"&gt;The site has had similar security issues before. In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/spacex-fan-jailed-cameron-county-texas-boca-chica-launch-site-2019-10"&gt;a SpaceX fan was arrested&lt;/a&gt; after posting pictures of himself near another Starship prototype to social media.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children is getting a 4K HDR remaster on June 8th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UOd67LbMoTWJDQSGudCFiuz7tHc=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69097953/mibynf2blvdbb3jl13d1.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YwabFK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children&lt;/em&gt; — the 2005 CGI spinoff film that dared to ask “What if the already incredible, intricate story of&lt;em&gt; Final Fantasy VII&lt;/em&gt; was made even more confusing?” — &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B091NQGL8X?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is getting a 4K HDR remaster&lt;/a&gt; this summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GLwbMF"&gt;The newly updated version of the film is due to arrive on June 8th, setting up a week of narrative whiplash for &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; fans who will also get to enjoy the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22274549/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-ps5-update-graphics-expansion"&gt;PS5 upgrade of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Intergrade&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on June 10th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CYBxOS"&gt;One might think &lt;em&gt;Advent Children&lt;/em&gt; would be a good next step for fans who have only played the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21207441/final-fantasy-7-remake-ff7-review-ps4"&gt;modern &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Remake&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as a way of preparing for future remade installments. That instinct, I can assure you, would be wrong. The film is actually a pseudo-sequel to the &lt;em&gt;original&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII&lt;/em&gt; game’s epic and occasionally bewildering story, and it relies heavily on an intimate knowledge of its twists and turns. &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt;, by contrast, gives you a mere fraction of the saga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KGfwGG"&gt;For example, here’s apparently a wholly accurate description of the film’s key plot point from my colleague Nick Statt, and definitely not a series of random words that he typed into Slack: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="w9u1x0"&gt;The Sephiroth clone cloning himself into Sephiroth using Jenova, from which he is also a clone (?) makes perfect sense. Ok, like technically Sephiroth is not a clone except for he was merged with Jenova cells in the womb so you could make the argument that he’s a clone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="DUhMCO"&gt;Despite the somewhat obtuse sci-fi storytelling, &lt;em&gt;Advent Children&lt;/em&gt; was a notable jump forward for fully CGI-animated movies when it was first released in 2005. It offered fans the best look yet (at the time) at favorite characters like Cloud and Tifa in full 3D form, with designs and fight scenes that the blocky graphics and CGI of the PS1 original had only hinted at. And while the film itself has since been eclipsed by the even better-looking (and playable) &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt;, that reimagining owes plenty to the foundation that &lt;em&gt;Advent Children&lt;/em&gt; laid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PtPdpX"&gt;The upcoming re-release is part of an ongoing renaissance for the sometimes unappreciated movie. &lt;em&gt;Advent Children &lt;/em&gt;also recently got a call-out in &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;: when Cloud’s longtime nemesis Sephiroth was added as a DLC character, &lt;em&gt;Smash Bros. &lt;/em&gt;also updated Cloud’s Omnislash attack to match his multi-sword version from the movie whenever you equip him with his film-inspired outfit as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bzbZyY"&gt;Additionally, Square Enix is also working on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301961/final-fantasy-7-ever-crisis-android-ios-announced"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;a single-player mobile RPG that aims to span the entirety of the &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII &lt;/em&gt;storyline — including &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Advent Children&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Before Crisis&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Crisis Core&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Dirge of Cerberus&lt;/em&gt; — into a single, cohesive title. That will either help clear up the confusion surrounding &lt;em&gt;FF7&lt;/em&gt;... or just make it worse. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Please, I need the Robinhood S-1, my family is starving</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_6Pjhx8fmlJFma7BmNZTohRmsyA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69097947/acastro_210201_1777_robinhood_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RaeDzE"&gt;I love it when companies go public. I am never more excited than when I get to read a mandatory S-1 filing for the first time. Anything could be in there! Maybe the company has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21578491/roblox-ipo-announced-dau-increase-pandemic"&gt;&lt;em&gt;wildly &lt;/em&gt;more people using its products&lt;/a&gt; than I would have guessed. Maybe the company is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300835/coinbase-s1-bitcoin-going-public-profit-revenue-invest-crypto"&gt;surprisingly profitable&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/15/20806366/we-company-wework-ipo-adam-neumann"&gt;is WeWork&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BLvjtT"&gt;Anyway, there is a new Robinhood regulatory oopsie in the news, and it’s made me even more eager to find out what’s lurking in that document. If I do not get the Robinhood S-1 soon, I will &lt;em&gt;die.&lt;/em&gt; The company has &lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/3/23/robinhood-markets-inc-confidentially-submits-draft-registration-statement"&gt;confidentially filed to go public&lt;/a&gt;, but what fun is &lt;em&gt;confidentiality? &lt;/em&gt;There might be some juicy shit in there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jrQZ8E"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Start-up sloppiness&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YsIZtI"&gt;Here’s the shape of the new thing: Robinhood allows customers to trade fractions of a share — something that makes it easier for ordinary investors to get into high-priced stocks. The problem, however, is that Robinhood didn’t report these trades to a public data feed, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-robinhood-regulation-tradereporting-e/exclusive-robinhood-failed-to-disclose-certain-trade-executions-to-public-feed-idUSKBN2BV0FZ"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This reporting is required by both the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;the Securities and Exchange Commission. Though Robinhood launched this service in December 2019, nothing was publicly reported until January 2021, &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sJyMS2"&gt;Other brokerages have been fined for this in the past because the missing information makes it harder to price stocks. It’s not the biggest violation — an expert &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; spoke to suggested that Robinhood deserved “a parking ticket” for it — but it suggests something the other Robinhood screw-ups also hint at: start-up sloppiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p2lzbB"&gt;Robinhood is where the “move fast and break things” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287381/robinhood-citadel-financial-services-house-day-traders"&gt;tech ethos runs straight into&lt;/a&gt; the “I will kill and eat you, but in a highly regulated way” Wall Street ethos. The most obvious example is the service outages. Remember in January, when Robinhood pissed off the entire internet by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22254656/robinhood-gamestop-stonks-trade-freeze-class-action-lawsuits"&gt;limiting trades on GameStop&lt;/a&gt;? The company hadn’t planned for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;an event of the GameStop scale&lt;/a&gt; and coming up short for clearinghouse requirements. There were also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/9/21171584/robinhood-outage-week-us-stocks-third-market"&gt;three huge outages&lt;/a&gt; in March 2020, which Robinhood has said were due to “&lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2020/3/3/an-update-from-robinhoods-founders"&gt;stress on our infrastructure&lt;/a&gt;”; then, as with GameStop, it simply hadn’t planned for an outlier event. Some real fail whale stuff!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MH6cbL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new regulatory thing is small potatoes, but nonetheless illustrative&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A92Cmn"&gt;But the other interesting bit is the &lt;em&gt;regulated&lt;/em&gt; part of Wall Street. Robinhood has run into trouble there, too. For instance, the company &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/robinhood-sec-fine-65-million/"&gt;was fined $65 million&lt;/a&gt; by the SEC for deceiving its customers about “payment for order flow” (PFOF), a practice that lets market makers bundle trades. (It is controversial because, theoretically, it could let banks &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-05/robinhood-gamestop-saga-pressures-payment-for-order-flow"&gt;illegally&lt;/a&gt; front-run trades; in practice, it doesn’t seem like this would be a very good idea because the price on PFOF trades is &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; than what’s available on the market.) Also, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/robinhood-settles-claims-it-didnt-ensure-best-prices-for-customer-trades-11576776167?mod=article_inline"&gt;there’s the $1.25 million settlement&lt;/a&gt; on claims that Robinhood didn’t work hard enough to get the best price for its users. This is to say nothing of &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-15/robinhood-estimates-hackers-infiltrated-almost-2-000-accounts"&gt;2,000 hacked accounts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xrv8gc"&gt;The new regulatory thing is small potatoes by these standards, but nonetheless illustrative. It’s easier to get away with being sloppy if you’re, like, a social network and there’s no specific government or industry watchdog that’s tasked with keeping you in line. Sure, you might get bad press and a congressional scolding, but that’s about the end of it. This is part of what makes fintech so interesting: if you’re focused on making a pretty app and to hell with the rest of it, you are &lt;em&gt;in trouble.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7TC2lS"&gt;The S-1 is the moment of truth. Right now, it’s hard to tell where Robinhood stands. The flush of press earlier this year led to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/03/why-investors-were-willing-to-write-robinhood-a-3-billion-check-during-the-gamestop-chaos-.html"&gt;a bunch of new users&lt;/a&gt;. Payment for order flow means Robinhood gets paid on every trade, whether the market is going up or down. On the other hand, this company has a habit of falling afoul of regulators. (There is still an &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/massachusetts-regulators-to-file-complaint-against-robinhood-11608120003"&gt;outstanding complaint from Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJ6kJI"&gt;Anyway, if you have that S-1 filing, do me a favor and send it my way. I need it. My family is starving, and we need gossip to survive.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon is recalling 2.5 million hotspots that could overheat and cause burn or fire damage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kZ_LROeVAyQBrGge_IgPZQzhTlg=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69097923/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9uhdqQ"&gt;Verizon said Thursday it is working with the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to &lt;a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/Verizon-Recalls-2-5-Million-Ellipsis-Jetpack-Mobile-Hotspots-Imported-by-Franklin-Wireless-Due-to-Fire-and-Burn-Hazards"&gt;recall 2.5 million hotspot devices&lt;/a&gt; after an investigation found the devices’ lithium-ion batteries could overheat and pose fire and burn hazards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PLDBPL"&gt;The Ellipsis Jetpack mobile hotspot models MHS900L, MHS900LS, and MHS900LPP were imported by Franklin Wireless Corp. and sold between April 2017 and March of this year, according to the CPSC. The model numbers are all for the same device but vary depending on how the customer purchased the device — through a consumer prepaid or postpaid plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e5FsfJ"&gt;“The safety of our customers is our highest priority,” Verizon &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/about/news/statement-regarding-us-consumer-product-safety-commission-recall" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “We are taking the situation very seriously, and we are working diligently to determine the cause of the issues with the supplier and to provide replacement devices for all of our customers, free of charge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hbhcha"&gt;The CPSC bulletin indicated Verizon had received 15 reports of the devices overheating; six of the reports involved fire damage to bedding or flooring. Two incidents included minor burn injuries, the CPSC said. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recalled Ellipsis hotspot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="251h8v"&gt;A Verizon spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that about 1.3 million of the hotspot devices are currently in use by customers. The recall is focused on the entire device, not just the batteries, and customers should not try to remove the batteries themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5fVmIa"&gt;Demand for hotspots &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/hotspots-wifi-students-coronavirus-1a08db65-236b-43e8-a5e0-17429a07942a.html"&gt;increased over the past year&lt;/a&gt; during the coronavirus pandemic, with schools and libraries seeking the devices for students who didn’t have internet access at home so they could complete their schoolwork remotely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YtbQCf"&gt;Verizon has sent a software update to the affected hotspots that are powered on that should help reduce the risk of the devices overheating, as it prevents the hotspot from charging up while it’s on. The company also recommends turning off the hotspots while they’re not in use and keeping them on flat surfaces without anything covering them. It’s also not a good idea to expose the hotspot devices to extreme temperatures for long periods, Verizon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iaur3T"&gt;To request a replacement hotspot or get more information, customers can go to ellipsisjetpackrecall.expertinquiry.com or call 855-205-2627.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Public vote counting starts for Amazon union drive in Alabama</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-IT-POLITICS-LABOR-AMAZON" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3tcYY0ThZgJcjWA3AEWHjRbBJWU=/0x0:5184x3456/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69097467/1232003507.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lcYviW"&gt;The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has begun publicly tallying votes for a proposed Amazon workers’ union in Alabama, which would be the first of its kind nationwide. The count, conducted over Zoom, may not include all potentially eligible ballots, but it will offer an early look at the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3K9XGn"&gt;The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) announced yesterday that 3,215 ballots were received from the roughly 5,800 workers at BHM1, a fulfillment center located in Bessemer, Alabama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hTIPbH"&gt;Amazon workers at Bessemer cast their ballots by mail in February and March, and the official counting process began on March 30th. Representatives can challenge individual workers’ eligibility to vote, and those ballots won’t be counted during this tally — but they could be deemed eligible later and potentially affect the election’s outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LdpDQH"&gt;BHM1 opened in March of last year, and the union effort began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272213/amazon-union-bhm1-alabama-rwdsu-vote-begins"&gt;taking shape&lt;/a&gt; not long after.  Employees were frustrated with the company’s strict and automatically enforced productivity metrics, the grueling pace of work, and an atmosphere many describe as dehumanizing and disrespectful. Amazon has faced criticism over these issues nationwide. Last month, it further inflamed controversy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/3/22365330/amazon-apology-pee-bottles-worker-warehouse-union-pocan"&gt;by falsely denying&lt;/a&gt; that its workplace standards led workers to urinate in water bottles rather than take bathroom breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="16uMsM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Organizers say they’re frustrated with a dehumanizing workplace&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yyc9kF"&gt;A group &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272213/amazon-union-bhm1-alabama-rwdsu-vote-begins"&gt;reached out&lt;/a&gt; to the RWDSU, which represented workers in nearby poultry plants and other businesses. By November, organizers had gathered enough signatures to petition the NLRB for an election, which was held by mail due to the pandemic. Voting began in early February and ended Monday, March 29th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DNfX3d"&gt;Amazon has always &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/16/technology/amazon-unions-virginia.html"&gt;fiercely resisted&lt;/a&gt; unionization: &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/10/6/21502639/amazon-union-busting-tracking-memo-spoc"&gt;tracking&lt;/a&gt; workplaces for signs of organizing, contracting with union-busting consultants, and firing workers who protest working conditions. Though some of the company’s warehouses are unionized in Europe, where labor laws make organizing far easier, only one other warehouse in the US has even made it to a vote before BHM1, and that was only a small group of 30 repair technicians at a Delaware warehouse. And &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/16/business/workers-at-an-amazon-warehouse-reject-forming-a-union.html"&gt;they lost&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pkDLIG"&gt;The BHM1 drive, in contrast, is huge: about 5,800 workers. It’s not just the biggest union vote at Amazon. It would be the largest group of workers to gain representation in the US in &lt;a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bloomberg-law-analysis/analysis-a-win-at-amazon-would-be-labors-largest-in-20-years"&gt;three decades&lt;/a&gt;, a major victory for organized labor after years of decline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="u36jyw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I have never seen Amazon fight for something like this.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tSy3Pu"&gt;Amazon fought the effort aggressively, advertising heavily, holding mandatory anti-union meetings, and sending workers multiple texts per day. It argued against holding the vote by mail, and it &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/04/08/amazon-bessemer-mailbox-union/"&gt;pushed the US Postal Service&lt;/a&gt; to install a mailbox near the warehouse just before the start of voting, a move labor organizers suggest may have influenced votes and could be grounds for a challenge if they lose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4su06N"&gt;The company even had the county change the timing on a traffic light leaving the warehouse parking lot — a measure Amazon says was meant to alleviate congestion during shift change but that organizers say deprived them of an important venue for canvassing workers. “I have never seen Amazon fight for something like this. I have never seen them try to push for something this hard before,” a longtime Amazon employee previously told&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272213/amazon-union-bhm1-alabama-rwdsu-vote-begins"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="piqPfR"&gt;Amazon has opposed the Amazon union effort at every step so far, and it will have further chances to do so. Employers often stonewall in negotiations over a first contract, sometimes for years, in an attempt to outlast the employees who pushed for it and discourage others from organizing. If Amazon follows this route, organizers will likely have to use protests, political pressure, and other measures to get Amazon to negotiate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hJymTS"&gt;Attention will also turn to labor activism elsewhere in Amazon. For years, organizing at Amazon warehouses consisted primarily of informal protests. While they won occasional victories over specific issues, like altering &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/amazon-workers-who-petitioned-for-paid-time-off-claim"&gt;time-off policies&lt;/a&gt; or getting fired workers reinstated, the Bessemer vote shows that unionization offers a possible way to lock in more durable improvements. The RWDSU recently said it has been contacted by over &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-19/amazon-workers-inspired-by-alabama-weigh-union-drives-elsewhere?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;1,000 Amazon workers&lt;/a&gt; interested in unionizing since the BHM1 campaign began. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gKQbpN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FZEj3e"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6abxEm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aL3yPR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="onhs5q"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RNBvn7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MFPeMQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cycling legend Greg LeMond on his new e-bikes, his failed partnership with Trek, and the future of cycling</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5JDZTl1MJCTrOSnEcZepxP0tJ38=/0x2:8192x5463/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69097386/Greg_Prolog_Away.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Three-time Tour de France champion Greg LeMond has a new e-bike venture.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo courtesy of Greg LeMond&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;LeMond’s new e-bikes will be among the most lightweight bikes in the industry&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ice5cU"&gt;It shouldn’t come as a shock, but electric bikes can weigh a ton. It’s not uncommon for an e-bike to tip the scales at 50 pounds or more. Electric cargo bikes are even heavier, topping out at 80–90 pounds. So for anyone looking for something more in the flyweight category, here comes three-time Tour de France champion Greg LeMond with a handsome new lineup of battery-powered bikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ihmQCI"&gt;LeMond unveiled his first two models earlier this year: there’s the high-step frame Prolog and the more accessible Dutch with a step-thru frame. Both are extremely lightweight, which LeMond says comes from his desire to buck the trend of heavier (and usually more powerful) e-bikes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jEeR6Y"&gt;“I truly believe in e-bikes and how it will change people’s lives from a health perspective,” LeMond told me in an interview late last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="vujamf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I truly believe in e-bikes”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A2KTNB"&gt;The frames of both bikes are made of carbon fiber, including the forks, fenders, and seat posts. Depending on your opinion about carbon fiber, this is either really great or merely okay. Racing enthusiasts love carbon fiber bikes, while riders who use their bikes for daily transportation or off-roading tend to prefer something stronger, like aluminum or titanium. Also, carbon is more expensive to manufacture, which usually results in higher prices for consumers. But LeMond has his own carbon fiber business, LeMond Carbon, which shares some employees with his bike company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wP5VZT"&gt;LeMond’s new e-bikes are undeniably attractive — that pink paint job is so winsome, I really love it — but are probably not what many people would expect from the two-time Road Race World Championship winner (1983 and 1989) and three-time Tour de France champ (1986, 1989, and 1990). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="30F3WE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10436289"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tl3esB"&gt;For one, they’re not drop bar-sporting speedsters designed for doing circuits at the velodrome. Rather, LeMond is taking aim at urban dwellers who want a durable e-bike to help get them around a city but who also may need to carry their bike up and down a flight of steps and don’t want to get weighed down by a bulky battery and motor. These are city bikes with integrated batteries and rear-hub motors from Mahle, a German automotive supplier that also makes electric drivetrains for Specialized and a host of other bike companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F9mc90"&gt;That doesn’t mean there won’t be any racing bikes in future lineups, the cycling champ said. “We still are coming out with performance bikes,” LeMond said. “We are not getting away from my DNA, but that’s going to play probably a secondary role with our e-bikes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JZWlkt"&gt;As the only American to win the Tour de France &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/23/sports/cycling/armstrong-stripped-of-his-7-tour-de-france-titles.html"&gt;without the use of performance-enhancing drugs&lt;/a&gt;, LeMond is considered by many to be among the greatest American cyclists of all time. He is undeniably one of the great all-around cyclists of the modern era and an icon of the sport’s global popularity. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Greg LeMond and his son Geoff working on the design of their new e-bikes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iptA3x"&gt;LeMond first encountered electric bikes seven years ago when a friend from the Netherlands who works for Japanese bike manufacturer SunTour let him test out some of the company’s electric motors. The experience, he said, was “transformational.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7tbx9"&gt;“The only thing that comes close to being like a bionic person, you know,” LeMond said. “&lt;em&gt;The Six Million Dollar Man&lt;/em&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cxgHMo"&gt;The Prolog (pronounced like “prologue”) was originally slated for a February 2021 release but didn’t end up shipping until late March. At 26 pounds (11.8 kg), the Prolog finds itself in the same category as Gogoro’s similarly lightweight Eeyo 1S — and it will fall in that upper-tier price bracket as well, with a price starting at $4,500. (Like I said, carbon fiber ain’t cheap.) The Dutch, with its low-step frame and mustache-shaped handlebars, will come out later in the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8iDy2F"&gt;With the LeMond name emblazoned on the side, the performance is obviously a top consideration. The Prolog’s motor kicks out 40nm of torque, which is less than the 60nm of torque provided by the Brose S Mag motors on the similarly priced Serial 1 e-bikes from Harley-Davidson, but more than the 20nm torque provided by the Eeyo 1S’s 250W Smartwheel motor (although Gogoro claims its Smartwheel actually puts out 50nm). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Z81xS0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The bike has a top speed of 20 mph, thanks to a 36-volt / 250-watt power supply&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ql0WwO"&gt;The bike has a top speed of 20 mph, thanks to a 36-volt / 250-watt power supply, which is fed by a nonremovable 250 watt-hour battery. The amount of boost delivered can be adjusted with three levels of power assist. The cranks, derailleurs, chainrings, and brakes are from Shimano. The bikes roll on 30cm Panaracer GravelKing Slick+ tires and Token aluminum rims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ejqvQY"&gt;There is a range of add-ons that will make the bike fancier and more expensive. You can add Shimano Di2 electronic shifting ($800), LeMond carbon rims laced to Tune hubs ($1,800), a front basket ($185), a rear rack ($185), fenders ($185), and a range extender ($700).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZydAg"&gt;The bike has a very clean look, with all the wiring fed through the frame. There will be three frame sizes: small, medium, and large. And both bikes have integrated lighting in the front and rear that feed off the internal battery.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y3y4bd1nk-PdlFhuCOXathI81cE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430270/LeMond_Process_4.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I spent eight years defending myself,” LeMond said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1sg15F"&gt;LeMond launched his first bike company in 1986, and since then, his career as an entrepreneur has been a bit of a rollercoaster ride. According to &lt;em&gt;Bicycling &lt;/em&gt;magazine, this is currently the fourth iteration of LeMond Bicycles. One previous version was a licensing deal with Trek that ended poorly, with Trek asking a federal court to dissolve its partnership with LeMond citing “inconsistent business dealings.” LeMond responded by suing Trek, which the Wisconsin-based company characterized as containing false and irresponsible allegations.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;A spokesperson for Trek did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cLm0xK"&gt;For his part, LeMond claimed that Trek “literally tried to destroy my business, which they did. They put me out of business.” That said, he said he wishes he had handled the Trek partnership differently. “I spent eight years defending myself. My only regret was not cutting ties much sooner and then instead of defending myself, hoping to repair a relationship, I would have gone on my own,” he said. “Instead of being in a defensive mode, I would have been in an offensive mode, building something rather than trying to protect something that probably wasn’t going to sell anyway.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B2SXnh"&gt;He continued, “This was all a strategy for Trek to kind of basically paint me as a bad business person, and that stuck. It’s sad, but people will have their own opinion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZTdmyM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This was all a strategy for Trek to kind of basically paint me as a bad business person, and that stuck.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OxtQAE"&gt;The original plan for his new venture was to manufacture the e-bikes out of a 65,000-square-foot facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, but that plan appears to be on hold. Most e-bikes are built in China, and initially, LeMond’s bikes won’t be any different. He hopes to also add a production line in Sweden, while some of the components, like the lights, fenders, and baskets, will be manufactured in Tennessee. Eventually, the goal is to have production lines up and running in three continents: the US, Europe, and Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LrWJpu"&gt;“I don’t want to speak too quick, but we are going to bring some amazing things up in the next 12 months,” he said. “These are made by us. This is not an outsourced deal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VzVTcP"&gt;LeMond insisted that all of the speed bumps he has hit in his post-racing life have been extremely minor. “The hard part for me is I’m not just a person; I’m a business,” he said. “So there’s been some contractual disputes... and that’s it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LBSyCw"&gt;This new venture, and these new bikes, offer a chance at redemption for LeMond. His racing career is in the rearview — and e-bikes, he said, are the future of cycling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="KDlaLx"&gt;“We’re real,” he said. “For real. We’re not just marketing or graphic design, which most companies are. Some are just outsource companies. We are literally assembling things. We are making these bikes.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch Lenovo’s new gaming phone break spectacularly</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jYbUyj2JSZaG9nRAMU6Tjzpi6QQ=/1x0:1975x1316/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69097225/jerryrigeverythinglenovophoneduel2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jz_vxrm8rjM" target="_blank"&gt;JerryRigEverything&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Kdq8qN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22372613/lenovo-legion-phone-duel-2-release-date-price-specs-fans"&gt;Lenovo’s new Legion Phone Duel 2&lt;/a&gt; is a gaming phone that has two USB-C ports, a pop-up camera, and even built-in fans. There’s so much tech inside that Lenovo decided it’d be best to shove its most crucial, hard-working components into the middle of the phone, making it easier for the fans to keep it all cool during gameplay. As a result, it’s thicker in the middle, flanked by two batteries. That didn’t seem like a huge red flag at first. If anything, it seemed clever — that is, until &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Jz_vxrm8rjM"&gt;YouTuber JerryRigEverything&lt;/a&gt; got ahold of the phone (via &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/04/08/lenovos-new-gaming-phone-snaps-in-half-like-a-graham-cracker/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rj8Tmw"&gt;As part of the channel’s signature rigorous testing of durability, each device is eventually bent to see how much flex it can withstand before breaking. Most devices can hold up but usually not without some bent metal or snapped glass along the way. The Legion Phone Duel 2 didn’t take well &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt; to being flexed, not even a little bit. At around the 8:40 mark in the video, shortly after the host said “I’m not even remotely concerned about it breaking,” it satisfyingly snapped at the antenna line that meets the raised middle section, compromising the phone’s ability to power on. With little force, the host also broke the other side to illustrate the lack of structural integrity in the design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oLENnd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Two speakers, two fans, two batteries, two pieces”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1hXUCX"&gt;Lenovo’s device isn’t necessarily an outlier compared to other recent gaming phones the channel has tested. The Asus ROG Phone 5 (similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321496/asus-rog-phone-5-ultimate-review-gaming-phone-snapdragon-888-ram-specs-features"&gt;Ultimate model that I recently reviewed&lt;/a&gt;) also &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Dqi9QGyRWGk?t=456"&gt;broke during the test&lt;/a&gt;, despite having a more cohesive design. That said, it did appear to require more force to break than Lenovo’s new phone. I’m no engineer, but it seems like splitting the battery in two might be part of what’s to blame for the fragility, as this is how Asus’ latest phone is arranged internally, too.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IYwqcm"&gt;As different as the Legion Phone Duel 2 looks compared to some other gaming-centric phones, it comes at a high $950 price. And its somewhat fragile design might eventually cost you even more down the road if you need to find a replacement.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bad software is turning some Mustang Mach-Es into ‘electric bricks’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z3Sq7uCNiXxfwmun_c_z7X_ordE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69097191/sokane_210121_4386_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u1abRj"&gt;Charging is a common concern with electric vehicles. But some owners of the brand-new Mustang Mach-E have run into a peculiar problem: their electric SUVs won’t start even when the main battery pack is full. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZo9Q7"&gt;That’s because, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has learned, there’s a problem with some early Mustang Mach-E SUVs that involves how the much smaller 12-volt battery gets charged. It’s the latest in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22311594/ford-mustang-mach-e-delays-quality-free-charging-cash-back"&gt;growing&lt;/a&gt; line of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316055/ford-mustang-mach-e-recall-loose-bolt-delivery-delays"&gt;small issues&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/ford/2021/01/16/ford-mustang-mach-e-delivery-delay/4189265001/"&gt;have come to light&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356539/ford-connected-charge-station-sales-halt-issue-mustang-mach-e"&gt;rollout of Ford’s first long-range electric car&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MhWNpU"&gt;As is the case in other electric cars, the Mustang Mach-E keeps its 12-volt lead-acid battery topped up by essentially sipping power from the much larger lithium-ion battery pack. Based on owners’ accounts &lt;a href="https://www.macheforum.com/site/threads/deep-sleep-mode-12v-battery-drained-dead-update-mach-e-jump-started.3457/page-42"&gt;across&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.macheforum.com/site/threads/how-to-add-access-ports-for-lvb-connection-points.4107/"&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; forum threads, including one who spoke to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, the problem is this stops happening whenever the Mustang Mach-E is plugged in to charge up the larger battery pack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tZdiTG"&gt;That is especially an issue for owners in areas with cold weather, as Ford encourages them &lt;a href="https://owner.ford.com/support/how-tos/ev/driving-tips-to-increase-electric-vehicle-winter-range.html"&gt;to leave their Mustang Mach-Es plugged in&lt;/a&gt; so the SUVs can use power from the grid to warm up before driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YLzNZo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ford says a “small number” of vehicles are affected&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oKw3Wt"&gt;The 12-volt battery powers many of the Mustang Mach-E’s systems (since the larger battery pack is high-voltage), and so when it dies, the electric SUV cannot be started. When this happens, owners have reported the FordPass app says the vehicle is in “deep sleep” mode. Some forum members have started referring to it as the “electric brick” problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k8j5oj"&gt;Ford recently filed a technical service bulletin with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that &lt;a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/tsbs/2021/MC-10189793-0001.pdf"&gt;confirms the problem&lt;/a&gt; has to do with the software on the powertrain control module. Ford wrote that this only affects Mustang Mach-E SUVs built on or before February 3rd, meaning it’s possible that dozens are affected. (Ford would only say that a “small number” of the nearly &lt;a href="https://insideevs.com/news/498351/us-ford-mache-sales-q12021/"&gt;7,000 Mustang Mach-Es delivered in the first three months of the year&lt;/a&gt; have the issue.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K9sOnc"&gt;Right now, those owners cannot get the fix via an over-the-air update. The company said in a statement that they’ll have to bring their Mustang Mach-Es to a dealer: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="lIo2Oe"&gt;We are aware that a small number of Mustang Mach-E owners have had their 12V battery reach a low voltage condition. We proactively worked with early owners experiencing this issue to identify the root cause and a fix. In the rare instances where this still occurs, customers can now contact their local EV-certified Ford dealer to have the matter resolved.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="nCdrJF"&gt;Ford did tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the problem will be fixable via wireless update “later this year” and that Mustang Mach-Es currently coming off the line should not be affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vo9WQi"&gt;It is possible to jump the 12-volt battery, just as you would jump-start an internal combustion car. But it’s not nearly as straightforward, especially because the battery is located behind the Mustang Mach-E’s front trunk, and the hood’s electronic latch is powered by the low-voltage battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="rZxwfS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s possible to jump-start the Mustang Mach-E, but it’s not easy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GMBeD0"&gt;To first open the front trunk then, owners &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKK_Vt1m5TA&amp;amp;t=51s"&gt;have to open a panel in the front bumper&lt;/a&gt; that contains two leads, which can be used to jump the front trunk’s electronic hood latch. Then they have to pull back a panel underneath the hood to find the battery — though even at this point, some owners have had trouble accessing the leads on the 12-volt battery and have &lt;a href="https://www.macheforum.com/site/threads/how-to-add-access-ports-for-lvb-connection-points.4107/"&gt;cut through the vinyl&lt;/a&gt; to more easily jump-start the battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gxv651"&gt;Ford offers free roadside assistance with the Mustang Mach-E, too, so owners have this as an option if they need to get their electric SUVs towed to a dealer. The roadside assistance is also supposed to include 12-volt battery jump starts, &lt;a href="https://www.fordservicecontent.com/Ford_Content/Catalog/owner_information/2021-Ford-Mustang-Mach-E-Owners-Manual-version-1_om_EN-US_09_2020-1.pdf"&gt;according to the owner manual&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aRuPun"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 8th, 5:48PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clarified in the tenth paragraph that owners have discussed on Mustang Mach-E forums cutting through the trunk panels to more easily access the battery, rather than out of necessity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Take a ride on this man’s model train set</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hpAhMhDP0rV4GOmW_NY3YSVBHUk=/1009x0:4894x2590/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69096932/Screen_Shot_2021_04_08_at_9.56.23_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XZWWj9"&gt;Some people spent the pandemic writing the next &lt;em&gt;King Lear&lt;/em&gt;, others lamenting the fact that they weren’t. &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/4/17/21201878/quarantine-productivity-social-distancing-coronavirus-pandemic-covid-19-capitalism-ep-thompson"&gt;It doesn’t really matter&lt;/a&gt;. There are plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22167393/pandemic-tech-tiktok-zoom-facetime-google-2020"&gt;inspiring pandemic projects&lt;/a&gt; to go around, but one of the most striking (and brain-breaking) has to be &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQTfo32EjvY"&gt;this model train video&lt;/a&gt; created by Jason Shron of the YouTube channel &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/rapidotrains/featured"&gt;Rapido Trains&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oIr15j"&gt;Shron is a devoted train enthusiast and talented model maker. But his model train project re-creating the Canadian VIA rail line connecting Toronto to Montreal is really a treasure only a lot of time (due to COVID-19 lockdowns) and passion (from a lifetime appreciation of the rail) can create. Just look at this video:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="C0qDL5"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fQTfo32EjvY?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2fk0dq"&gt;That’s footage shot from one of Shron’s model trains, superimposed over the window of a human-scale VIA train model. It looks, concerningly, like a rail train ride. But you might now be wondering: where did Shron get a human-sized model train? Well, he built that, too — in his basement: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2ZxRCI"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YjMnWdIWjWs?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VdulKp"&gt;You have to commend the attention to detail here. Not only do the models look great — Shron sourced real train seats and other equipment for his human-sized re-creation — but the sound design really sells it. The last time I rode a train was over a year ago now, but the gentle air-conditioned hum, soft creak as the train rides the tracks, white noise of other people talking, and sudden whoosh of another train passing is unmistakable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yJ72v2"&gt;It’s almost too real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u5q8Hm"&gt;Consider the implications: if Shron can re-create a train line to almost perfect scale (and a human-sized train car for that matter), where does it stop? Why not a model home with a model train set inside? Or a model town containing the same?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jJKYa0"&gt;I’m not talking &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/20/18150216/welcome-to-marwen-review-steve-carell-robert-zemeckis"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome to Marwen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; I’m more thinking &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIizh6nYnTU&amp;amp;t=16s"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Synecdoche, New York&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe we were so focused on wringing our hands about the frankly ridiculous popularity of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/2/11837874/elon-musk-says-odds-living-in-simulation"&gt;simulation theory&lt;/a&gt; that we ignored the other kind of simulation theory. That a kind man with a deep respect for one of the greatest forms of human transportation (don’t text airplanes, my phone is off), could have built a perfect, fake world around us without us ever knowing. Because then, what’s really real, you know? Am I? Are you?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The smiling face of a brilliant hobbyist OR the man who runs our small model world? You be the judge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oryHJM"&gt;Anyway, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQTfo32EjvY"&gt;the video is very relaxing&lt;/a&gt;. You should give it a watch.&lt;/p&gt;
