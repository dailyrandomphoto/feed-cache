    <title>Microsoft starts rolling out Windows 11 to more PCs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nLXEGRVCdUgJ2tG6Ab71r6MOhCA=/0x0:1650x1100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70058311/windows11main.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PXbBCL"&gt;Microsoft is rolling out Windows 11 to more PCs this week. After an initial launch to mostly new PCs earlier this month, Microsoft is gradually making the free Windows 11 upgrade available to more existing and eligible devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E9Nx2Q"&gt;“The availability of Windows 11 has been increased and we are leveraging our latest generation machine learning model to offer the upgrade to an expanded set of eligible devices,” &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-21H2"&gt;says Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;. “We will continue to train our machine learning model throughout the phased rollout to deliver a smooth upgrade experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wAMQ8B1Ra7FuIqY7kI2RFf2-F_4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22963827/iaHrHEk.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Windows 11 upgrade prompt in Windows Update.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rRjbcg"&gt;If you’ve been waiting for the Windows 11 upgrade to appear in Windows Update, you might find the above prompt this week. Anecdotally, we’ve been offered the upgrade on a variety of devices today, including a custom gaming PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zDjSTu"&gt;Microsoft doesn’t provide a list of devices that are now being offered the Windows 11 upgrade, but you’ll only be able to obtain the update through Windows Update if your PC meets the minimum system requirements. If you still don’t see the prompt and want to skip the waiting line, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683953/windows-11-upgrade-how-to-download-install"&gt;Microsoft offers an easy way to upgrade early&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JDKToS"&gt;There are also ways to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22715331/how-to-install-windows-11-unsupported-cpu-intel-amd-registry-regedit"&gt;install Windows 11 on unsupported CPUs&lt;/a&gt;, too. Microsoft doesn’t recommend it and you might not receive security updates in the future, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22715331/how-to-install-windows-11-unsupported-cpu-intel-amd-registry-regedit"&gt;the workaround is very easy&lt;/a&gt; without having to reinstall Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Wyze’s cameras can now be a monitored home security system</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h17MIdzBtY3PeZYPXNQMGg9ArlA=/0x1:920x614/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70058301/a8Vs2OrA.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wyze is bringing more AI-powered smarts to its security cameras.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Wyze&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7veGx7"&gt;Smart home company Wyze continues its tradition of making every small to medium-sized home appliance under the sun, announcing a slew of new products this week in honor of its fourth birthday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bswAly"&gt;The most notable are a &lt;a href="https://wyze.com/wyze-light-switch.html"&gt;new smart wall switch&lt;/a&gt;, an interesting take on &lt;a href="https://wyze.com/wyze-lamp-socket.html"&gt;outdoor lighting&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://wyze.com/wyze-bulb-white.html"&gt;revamped white smart bulbs&lt;/a&gt; that can match the sun throughout the day. But what really caught my eye is a new capability coming to its cameras. Using AI, Wyze’s smart security cameras will have the ability to alert a professional monitoring service when they detect a person. That’s one simple and cheap home security system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2oSJOW"&gt;Wyze is known for its inexpensive smart home products, but what makes the company stand out is that it doesn’t skimp on the smarts to get those low prices. Its advancements in employing artificial intelligence to run your smart home have been consistently impressive, if not always totally successful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ts2RiF"&gt;This security feature, coming as part of a new &lt;a href="https://prod.services.wyze.com/detail/campluspro"&gt;Cam Plus Pro subscription service&lt;/a&gt; (no price has been announced yet), adds a lot of value to Wyze’s already good value smart home cameras (which start at $36). Essentially, it provides an all-in-one home security solution without needing a hub or a litany of sensors around your home. All you need is a Wyze Cam, which you arm or disarm in the app. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zx8zKeoMfzuQAYXopw7Z1-BqSzQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22868157/Wyze_Cam_Pan_v2_4.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wyze&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wyze hasn’t said which of its smart cameras — which include the Wyze Cam Pan — its new Cam Plus Pro security service will work with.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Mky9nr"&gt;Of course, it’s a single-point solution, more suited to a small apartment than a large, single-family home. (Wyze also offers a more traditional, sensor-based &lt;a href="https://wyze.com/wyze-hms-bundle.html"&gt;security system&lt;/a&gt; that costs $5 a month for professional monitoring.) But it points to a possible future of smart home security, one that leverages more advanced technologies than the basic Z-Wave or Zigbee sensors most systems have used for decades to keep tabs on our home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MSVOlI"&gt;Origin Wireless has another similarly innovative solution; its &lt;a href="https://myhexhome.com/"&gt;Hex Home security system&lt;/a&gt; uses Wi-Fi sensing to monitor movement in your home. All you need is two or three of its small pucks plugged into outlets around your home to know someone is creeping around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RZoFtF"&gt;Wyze hasn’t released many details around the Cam Plus Pro service yet. We’re still waiting to hear which cameras it will work with, how it will interact with Wyze’s security system, how much it will cost, and when it will be available. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KfastqXsHbt_WuLzVZpRetbzlbk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22963016/Wyze_Switch_2.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wyze&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Wyze Smart Switch doubles as a smart home controller for other Wyze products.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZhA4kH"&gt;Smart switches, bulbs, and solar panels, too&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mL0ysK"&gt;Other birthday presents from Wyze include the &lt;a href="https://wyze.com/wyze-light-switch.html"&gt;Wyze Switch&lt;/a&gt;, a smart switch that can turn both regular bulbs and Wyze bulbs on and off (but no dimming) and control other Wyze devices, such as door locks. You can set double-press, triple-press, or press-and-hold automations, turning this into a smart home controller as well as a light switch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fN5PZD"&gt;As with other smart switches, you can set a vacation mode to make it seem like someone is home and set schedules, timers, and automations in the Wyze app. The switch comes in a three-pack for $33 plus shipping, with single packs coming soon. Wyze says the switch works with Alexa, Google, and Apple voice assistants and is compatible with IFTTT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yxQ3od"&gt;A single-button, single pole switch that must be wired into your home’s electrical circuit, the Wyze smart switch works on 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, requires a neutral wire and can be installed in everything from single gang to four gang setups, but not on 3-way or 4-way circuits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dc0oT2"&gt;It works with &lt;a href="https://wyze.com/wyze-bulb-white.html"&gt;Wyze’s white smart bulbs&lt;/a&gt; (something smart switches don’t always do well), and the bulbs have been upgraded with temperature and brightness control (from the app). The 800-lumen bulbs have a temperature range of 2700K to 6500K and can go from bright white to mellow yellow. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CqywDF4Hzg3xLBryh4wdSI9HR5Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22963030/Wyze_Bulb_White_2.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wyze&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Sun Match feature coming to Wyze’s new smart bulbs can help mimic the natural circadian rhythm throughout the day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wtYVpX"&gt;A new Sun Match feature takes advantage of this range by adjusting the color temperature to match the sunlight throughout the day. They work with Alexa or Google for voice control, and the pre-order price is $32 plus shipping for a four-pack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jEtOL9"&gt;Another interesting — if not very elegant — lighting innovation is the new &lt;a href="https://wyze.com/wyze-lamp-socket.html"&gt;Wyze Lamp Socket&lt;/a&gt;. This $10 device is designed to work with the wired Wyze Cam v3 (indoor or outdoor) to make your outdoor lights smart. The socket comes with a 30-inch USB cable that connects to the Wyze Cam to provide power to the camera, and the camera’s motion sensor can be set to turn the light on whenever there’s motion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mwaex1"&gt;You can group up to five lamp sockets and set them to come on at dusk and go off at dawn, or on a schedule, alongside the motion activation. The Wyze Lamp Socket works with E26 lights and also comes bundled with a camera for $46 plus shipping.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tAt3vgDSjdyjz0w0vh_gecdJrUM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22963050/Wyze_Lamp_Socket_2.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wyze&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new innovation from Wyze, the Wyze Lamp Socket can power a Wyze Cam, and the camera can double as a motion sensor for the light.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TgNytr"&gt;Paired with the Wyze Cam Plus Pro home monitoring service, a few of these lamp modules connected to cameras around your home’s exterior makes a compelling, inexpensive security solution. I’m looking forward to testing it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gSG2Lh"&gt;There’s also a new $20 &lt;a href="https://wyze.com/wyze-solar-panel.html"&gt;Wyze Solar Panel&lt;/a&gt; to help keep the &lt;a href="https://wyze.com/wyze-cam-outdoor.html"&gt;battery-powered Wyze Outdoor Cam ($60)&lt;/a&gt; charged. It comes with a 13-foot micro-USB cable and a 360-degree mount so you can get the perfect sunny angle, regardless of where your camera is. However, it’s IP65 rated, which is weather-resistant, not weather-proof. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wNJ9m5"&gt;Finally, Wyze is bringing a much-requested feature to its users, a Camera Web View where live streams and recorded videos from Wyze Cams can be accessed from a web browser. It will require Wyze’s Cam Plus subscription. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PuzhcY"&gt;Pre-orders are open now for all new products on Wyze.com, with the company saying shipping is estimated for November and December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nYWD34"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1KXXAJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook teases ‘Project Cambria’ high-end VR / AR headset</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Project Cambria headset" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vJZ3VKyEr6aobf0Y9AmdkKACWpU=/222x0:1554x888/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70058295/Screen_Shot_2021_10_28_at_2.03.39_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A screenshot of the Project Cambria device&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hHANcB"&gt;Facebook is planning a high-end virtual and augmented reality headset codenamed “Project Cambria.” The device, which was teased briefly during Facebook’s Connect keynote, features cameras that pass high-resolution full-color video to the headset’s screens. It’s supposed to include cutting-edge features that Facebook can’t yet include in the Oculus Quest lineup, but there’s no price or exact release date yet — although Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says it’s a “completely new” product that will sit at the “high end of the price spectrum,” and we’ll apparently see the device released next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHxzFF"&gt;The device is focused on mixed reality applications and will include face and eye tracking, something Zuckerberg &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319737/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-vr-ar-face-sensors"&gt;discussed earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. It’s supposed to use optics that make it slimmer than existing headsets, as well as sensors and algorithms that help it reconstruct and augment the real world around you. The Connect keynote also offered a very brief glimpse of what it’s supposed to look like, seen above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="poiNca"&gt;Project Cambria looks like the “Oculus Pro” headset that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744959/facebook-oculus-pro-vr-leaked-setup-videos"&gt;leaked earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also conceptually similar to a rumored high-end &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346564/apple-mixed-vr-virtual-augmented-reality-headset-light-ming-chi-kuo"&gt;Apple mixed reality headset&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724876/facebook-zuckerberg-vr-prototype-photos-research-redmond-metaverse"&gt;showed off a device with “retina resolution”&lt;/a&gt; in mid-October, although he described it as a prototype. The name follows earlier Oculus codename conventions that reference California locations — the original Oculus Quest, for instance, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/12/16463844/oculus-santa-cruz-standalone-headset-prototype-hands-on"&gt;was announced as Santa Cruz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA’s Juno spacecraft finds just how deep Jupiter’s Great Red Spot goes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y4QMIUW_lO-4EUlSV2L9s0n8sBE=/0x15:1041x709/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70058216/jnce_2020154_27c00042.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jupiter’s Great Red Spot&lt;/em&gt; | Image: NASA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WggGm0"&gt;NASA’s Juno spacecraft is revealing the massive structure of Jupiter’s iconic Great Red Spot, a gargantuan storm that’s been raging on the gas giant for centuries. By passing over the circular storm a couple times, Juno helped scientists confirm that the spot doesn’t just exist on the upper surface but extends hundreds of miles into the planet itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AFRtTm"&gt;We’ve long known just how &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; the Great Red Spot is. The storm’s diameter is about 10,000 miles, or more than 16,000 kilometers, wide, meaning that our planet Earth could fit completely inside the wild tempest. But scientists never fully understood how deep the Great Red Spot was. Was it just a surface-level event, or did it reach deep into Jupiter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R53zQg"&gt;Now, thanks to two science instruments on Juno, planetary researchers have figured out a pretty solid range for the spot. They put the depth of the storm between 300 and 500 kilometers, or between 186 and 310 miles deep, according to research published in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. That may seem small compared to the width of the Great Red Spot, but the depth still makes this a very formidable weather event. “That means it’s a gigantic storm,” Yohai Kaspi, a Juno co-investigator at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “If you would put this storm on Earth, it would extend all the way to the space station. So it’s just a monster.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JvHjtR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That means it’s a gigantic storm.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s2zhUd"&gt;Up until this decade, our best way of studying anything on Jupiter was to look at it from afar. Scientists could use NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope in orbit around Earth or other ground-based telescopes to study the Great Red Spot. Those instruments helped to nail down the storm’s width, but scientists could only speculate about the spot’s overall structure. “Some of them speculated that it was going to be very, very shallow, like we’re talking tens of kilometers,” Marzia Parisi, a research scientist on the Juno science team at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “And some others, they thought, ‘Well, in theory, it could go as deep as to the core of Jupiter.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QWJBSi"&gt;Then, in 2011, NASA launched its Juno spacecraft, a probe designed to get closer to Jupiter than any previous spacecraft had before. Juno spent five years traveling through deep space, and in 2016, the vehicle inserted itself into a very wide orbit around Jupiter, one that would take Juno close to the planet every 53 days. During these close passes, or “perijoves,” Juno has collected the majority of its data about Jupiter and what might be lingering inside the gas giant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ytb7pp"&gt;Perhaps the most exciting part of Juno’s mission is that the spacecraft was the first to pass over Jupiter’s poles — areas on the planet that had never been seen before the mission began. But in 2019, Juno did a small redirect. Scientists reoriented the spacecraft to pass over the Great Red Spot twice to get a better understanding of what’s going on underneath the storm.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jN0Y3eBhOLInQP5LDhhUxgSQoxk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22962995/pia13746_43.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: NASA&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An artistic rendering of NASA’s Juno spacecraft at Jupiter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XnTuwY"&gt;During these passes, Juno measured the spot’s gravitational field in an attempt to figure out just how deep the storm goes. The Great Red Spot is so large that the Juno spacecraft can actually feel the small perturbations in gravity produced by the storm. Ultimately, the gravity signal revealed that the storm did not extend farther than 500 kilometers deep. Scientists then combined this info with &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/nasas-juno-probes-the-depths-of-jupiters-great-red-spot"&gt;previous microwave measurements taken by Juno back in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, which found that the storm extends at &lt;em&gt;least&lt;/em&gt; as far as 300 kilometers deep. Those measurements put a pretty good maximum and minimum limit on the storm’s depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2uo5tR"&gt;They’re the best measurements we’ve got by far of the Great Red Spot’s structure. But they also open up some questions. For one thing, the storm is deep, but not nearly as deep as some of the surrounding jet streams, which extend up to 1,800 miles, or 3,000 kilometers, into the planet. Juno also helped to pinpoint those measurements, and scientists aren’t sure why there’s a discrepancy there. “It’s surprising that it goes so deep... but it’s also surprising that it doesn’t go as deep as the jets,” Parisi says. “So something is happening at 500 kilometers that is basically dampening the Great Red Spot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N2E6vj"&gt;That means there’s more still to learn about how things are churning away inside Jupiter. But thanks to Juno, scientists have a much more complete picture of the planet and its most famous storm than ever before. “Before, we just had this 2D view, just looking from the outside,” Kaspi says. “And now we have a complete three-dimensional view.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Twitter Spaces recording option.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MB0Y8P"&gt;Twitter is now allowing hosts of Twitter Spaces chats to record and share their broadcasts. The feature is starting to roll out to a limited number of Twitter Spaces hosts on iOS and should be available to all hosts “within a few weeks.” The feature lets hosts record a Twitter Spaces conversation and share the recording in a tweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VppbXd"&gt;The new functionality also means that anyone who was late to a Twitter Spaces broadcast will now be able to replay the broadcast once it’s finished if a host has enabled recording. That means tweets that are typically shared to promote Twitter Spaces broadcasts will now include a link to a recording, rather than a note that the Spaces broadcast has ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e9glJX"&gt;Participants will be notified with a new icon that a recording is taking place when they join a live Twitter Spaces broadcast. Hosts will then have access to recordings for 30 days after the broadcast for sharing purposes, or they can decide to delete a Spaces recording at any time. &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/spaces"&gt;Twitter says&lt;/a&gt; it will keep recordings up to 120 days to check for any abusive or hateful content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sb6rlq"&gt;The new recording option comes just a week after Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22739249/twitter-finally-letting-everyone-create-spaces"&gt;opened up Spaces to all iOS and Android users&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter is also testing a new Spaces tab for its Clubhouse competitor, has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724450/twitter-spaces-accelerator-spark-clubhouse-creators"&gt;created a fund&lt;/a&gt; for creators, and is even piloting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22644283/twitter-ticketed-spaces-live-audio-test"&gt;ticketed Spaces audio rooms&lt;/a&gt; that you pay a fee to participate in.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is coming to Oculus Quest 2</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Grand Theft Auto San Andreas Oculus Quest 2" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2vHSnzQW8pFHvVXXMArsyj0kCW4=/202x0:2353x1434/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70058091/image.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Behold, one of many strange screenshots you may see at Facebook Connect 2021.&lt;/em&gt; | Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Lve6TU"&gt;During Facebook Connect 2021, Mark Zuckerberg announced that &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&lt;/em&gt; is in development for the Oculus Quest 2 virtual reality headset. No other details, like price, release date, or even a brief snippet of the game running, were shown during the event. There’s a &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Fgames-at-connect-2021%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtw%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3D1-aw-facebookconnect-20211028%26utm_term%3D1%26utm_content%3Dquest" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;blog post up at Oculus’ site&lt;/a&gt; that confirms that the game is coming. It says, “This is a project many years in the making, and we can’t wait to show you more of it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mYgaBz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&lt;/em&gt;, along with &lt;em&gt;GTA III&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Vice City&lt;/em&gt; are being remastered, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/22/22739195/remastered-grand-theft-auto-trilogy-release-date-november-11th-gta3-vice-city-san-andreas"&gt;and that collection is releasing on November 11th for several platforms&lt;/a&gt;. The company didn’t share if the VR version of San Andreas is based on the remastered assets or the classic PS2 assets (hopefully the former, not the latter), but we’ve reached out to Oculus for more details on this release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z0upxj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&lt;/em&gt; is yet another classic game being retro-fitted for VR. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22726158/resident-evil-4-vr-capcom-oculus-quest-2-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt; for VR was recently released&lt;/a&gt;, and my colleague Adi Robertson thought the new adaptation worked better than they imagined it would.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Active Pack accessories prepare your Oculus Quest 2 for sweaty VR workouts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kFenxBtPkeByiLWL2mHM5cpzugg=/367x0:2326x1306/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70058029/Screen_Shot_2021_10_28_at_10.29.10.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uTRitL"&gt;Facebook has announced the Active Pack, a set of fitness-focused accessories for the Oculus Quest 2 that are designed to help turn the VR headset into a piece of gym equipment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IwCRDn"&gt;Included in the Active Pack are a set of grips designed to keep the Touch controllers from flying out of your hands when you’re, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746070/supernatural-vr-workout-app-adds-boxing-oculus-quest"&gt;doing a boxing workout in Supernatural&lt;/a&gt;. There’s also an easy-to-clean face pad, so you don’t have to gunk up your normal foam one if you use your Quest 2 for both exercise and entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6XEe1W"&gt;The Active Pack will ship “next year,” according to Facebook. While Facebook is clearly making it for those who have been turning to VR for their workouts during the pandemic, it’s also easy to imagine this could be popular with businesses and gyms once shared VR headsets become acceptable and safe again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MEZxVY"&gt;If a gym offered in-person VR classes, or a museum offered a VR experience, I’d feel much better trying it out if I knew that the surfaces touching my hands and face were meant to be easily cleaned.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mercedes-Benz cars are getting Dolby Atmos in 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WpVxK_Cb_8yVJ5hYaRHkmnjX04c=/544x0:6418x3916/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70057979/405297_Dolby_Atmos_16zu9_0cdd0f_original_1635406513.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Daimler AG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1M1hNF"&gt;Mercedes-Benz is the latest car company looking to bolster its audio systems with Dolby Atmos. The luxury vehicle company is planning to add support for the 3D sound standard through its optional Burmester stereo add-on for high-end models starting in summer 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nFgEP"&gt;Mercedes-Benz isn’t the first car company to offer Atmos; that honor goes to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336339/lucid-air-electric-car-dolby-atmos-sxsw"&gt;the Lucid Air electric sedan&lt;/a&gt;, which just started shipping and is the first car to support Dolby Atmos thanks to its 21 speaker “Surreal Sound” system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="w2EKjn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The cheapest S-Class with Atmos will start at $117,580&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mftvQf"&gt;But Mercedes-Benz’s implementation of Atmos looks to go even further, with a whopping 31 speakers scattered around the car (a list that includes six 3D speakers above passengers, four “near-ear” speakers for the two front seats, and an 18.5-liter subwoofer). Each seat also features two hidden &lt;a href="https://www.daytonaudio.com/topic/excitersbuyerguide"&gt;exciters&lt;/a&gt; apiece (for a total of eight in the car), and everything is powered by two amplifiers with a total of 1,750 watts of power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SkCVou"&gt;To start, Mercedes is offering Atmos in its top-of-the-line Maybach model, followed later by its S-Class cars featuring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21316700/mercedes-benz-mbux-second-generation-infotainment-system-touchscreen-hey-mercedes"&gt;its new MBUX infotainment system&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, given the price of both the Mercedes Maybach and S-Class cars, having the hardware to get the full Atmos experience won’t be cheap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lq4bcA"&gt;The entry-level S-Class vehicle, a 2021 S 500 4Matic sedan, starts at $110,850, and the Burmester 4D surround sound add-on that’s necessary for Atmos is an additional $6,730. Customers of the top-of-the-line Maybach model won’t have to worry, though — the upgraded sound system is already included in the base $185,950 price tag. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oculus users are getting a new metaverse home</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Horizon Home in an Oculus VR headset" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AEcGHAWuXtTIVtKjHBK5PBAPgRA=/499x0:2827x1552/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70057957/Screen_Shot_2021_10_28_at_12.11.35_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yHLWqo"&gt;Facebook is announcing a new, “more social” home space for Oculus users. Called Horizon Home, it looks a lot like the virtual home that people already have in their virtual reality headsets. But users will be able to invite friends to hang out and watch videos or start multiplayer games together, and they’ll eventually be able to customize their space, although that’s “a little further out.” Horizon Home will launch in an Oculus update soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1wofn8"&gt;Home joins Horizon Worlds and Horizon Workrooms — as well as events app Horizon Venues, previously known as Venues — as part of Facebook’s “metaverse” hub. A video shows users getting pop-up messages inside VR games, as well as on their phones outside VR, then popping into the same virtual space. In addition to the Home update, Facebook is adding Messenger audio calls to VR, supplementing the text-only option it started supporting earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Slack and Dropbox are coming to Oculus Quest</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Oculus Quest 2D Apps" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dKhEJ-Ra8RycDCTd1Pnhzlwlb_I=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70057955/2D_apps_in_Home.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook Reality Labs&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eovF8M"&gt;Facebook is adding 2D apps from third-party developers to its Oculus Quest virtual reality platform. The new feature is aimed at giving people more tools to work in VR using the Progressive Web App (PWA) framework. It’s starting with Facebook, Instagram, collaboration app Smartsheet, and email client Spike, then adding Dropbox, Monday.com, Mural, My5, Pluto TV, and Slack in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8k7MTi"&gt;Oculus has supported a 2D browser (which opens as a flat window in virtual space) for some time, and you could sideload 2D apps on the Quest, which runs a version of Android. Some Oculus apps also blur the line between VR and 2D apps: Horizon Workrooms, for instance, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Fzoom-meets-virtual-reality-announcing-zooms-collaboration-with-horizon-workrooms%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;will support Zoom calls in the future&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook Messenger &lt;a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/oculus-quest-2-update-facebook-messenger/"&gt;launched on Quest&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. This update marks a larger-scale rollout of non-VR apps inside the headset. The PWA-based framework means developers don’t need to build fully custom VR versions of an app, although it looks like they’ll still need to go through the normal Oculus developer channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JAuYoN"&gt;These 2D apps are launching on the Oculus Store alongside a larger revamp of Facebook’s VR work strategy. Where earlier Oculus Quest business headsets were a distinct product, Facebook is now introducing a suite of apps called Quest for Business that will run on ordinary Quest hardware. This means companies can use Quest headsets to run consumer-focused apps as well, while users will log in with a new system called Work Accounts that’s administered by businesses instead of a personal Facebook account. Corporate IT departments will be able to manage the devices remotely, with support for Microsoft Intune, VMware Workspace ONE, and Ivanti UEM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qxSYF9"&gt;Facebook will begin testing Quest for Business and Work Accounts in a closed beta later this year, aiming to launch a full version in 2023. It will wind down the existing Oculus for Business program later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7wMEQu"&gt;Work is a key part of Facebook’s vision for a VR and AR-oriented “metaverse” internet. While much of that involves creating a sense that you’re physically in a workspace with your colleagues, it also requires incorporating the tools people already use — even if they’re in 2D.&lt;/p&gt;
