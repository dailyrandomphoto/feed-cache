    <title>Today I learned about the attempts to make goldfish mech suits</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hQ5KbAnVjEnvfFp_g7naq4TydCA=/0x98:1302x966/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70347062/Screen_Shot_2022_01_03_at_17.19.53.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This robot follows the fish.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/ronen_segev" target="_blank"&gt;@ronen_segev&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f3SbqE"&gt;Something interesting swam across my Twitter feed recently: a video of a goldfish that seemed to be controlling a robotic fish tank with wheels, with the contraption following the direction the fish was swimming. “Oh no,” I thought. “They gave this goldfish a robot, and now it’s unstoppable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Thfc6R"&gt;Thankfully, it doesn’t seem like it was done as a part of some evil plot. The goldfish mech suit was posted by Ronen Segev, a researcher on a team that was looking into how animals navigate. Helpfully, Segev links to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0166432821005994?dgcid=author#fig0005"&gt;a full research paper&lt;/a&gt; in the Twitter thread, which should offer more insight into the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0uInJa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The fish were tasked to “drive” the vehicle towards a visual target in the terrestrial environment, which was observable through the walls of the tank. Indeed, the goldfish were able to explore the terrestrial environment, all while avoiding dead-ends and correcting inaccuracies. &lt;a href="https://t.co/RxPuzFbxkE"&gt;pic.twitter.com/RxPuzFbxkE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ronen Segev (@ronen_segev) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ronen_segev/status/1477889613045940224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 3, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g6c2Zu"&gt;The paper is officially titled “From fish out of water to new insights on navigation mechanisms in animals,” and its abstract describes why the researchers “trained goldfish to use a Fish Operated Vehicle (FOV).” They wanted to test its ability to do something familiar, navigating towards a target in an unfamiliar environment — in this case, land. To do this, the researchers tracked the fish’s movements with LIDAR, which let it “drive” towards a target that it could see outside of its tank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VWqIPg"&gt;Returning to the Twitter thread, though, a comment caught my eye — no, not &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sandipb/status/1477982557388038144?s=20"&gt;the joke about &lt;em&gt;The Umbrella Academy&lt;/em&gt;’s Carmichael&lt;/a&gt;, though it did get a laugh out of me. It was a comment about how someone else had built a very similar contraption. In 2014, Studio diip &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbNmL6hSNKw"&gt;released a video called Fish on Wheels&lt;/a&gt;, which was &lt;a href="https://www.studiodiip.com/portfolio-item/fish-on-wheels-2/"&gt;meant to show off computer vision tech&lt;/a&gt;. If you’ve watched Segev’s video, Fish on Wheels will seem pretty familiar; there’s a fish tank on wheels with a sensor that tracks the fish’s movement to steer the vehicle. (Can we call it a vehicle? Sure, why not.) Basically, Fish on Wheels is the same idea but built for a different reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9PsYA"&gt;That’s when I started falling down the rabbit hole. Looking into Fish on Wheels led me to a third goldfish Gundam, this one made as part of Carnegie Mellon University’s Build18 engineering festival, according to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GDgmP1ac_A"&gt;a video posted of the project&lt;/a&gt; in 2017. &lt;a href="https://interestingengineering.com/video/this-goldfish-controls-a-robotic-tank-with-its-movement"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Interesting Engineering&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the robot was built in three days by students who “decided it would be awesome if he [the fish, named Walter] could hang out with us!” You can see the result below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="waazGm"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_GDgmP1ac_A?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cxurrh"&gt;And guess what — browsing &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/5pn4x1/my_friends_and_i_made_a_fish_controlled_robot/"&gt;a Reddit thread about that project&lt;/a&gt; unearthed &lt;em&gt;yet another&lt;/em&gt; person who made robotic fish bowls. This one was a 2004 art installation by Ken Rinaldo called “Augmented Fish Reality.” It featured &lt;em&gt;five&lt;/em&gt; robots controlled by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siamese_fighting_fish"&gt;betta fish&lt;/a&gt; and was “designed to explore interspecies and trans-species communication,” &lt;a href="https://www.kenrinaldo.com/portfolio/augmented-fish-reality/"&gt;according to Rinaldo’s website&lt;/a&gt;. Are there examples from even further back that I haven’t found? How do people &lt;em&gt;keep doing the same thing&lt;/em&gt; but seemingly for completely different reasons?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tla3rr"&gt;And after watching all these traveling fish, there’s one thing that I absolutely, desperately need to know: what would my cat do if he saw a goldfish rolling by in a robotic tank? &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Anker’s new Nano II 100W USB-C charger is the smallest 100W GaN charger yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LaNOTmCNF-EbpnCbuXpRoPvAVoM=/20x0:797x518/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346779/Screen_Shot_2022_01_04_at_1.14.13_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7hUU38"&gt;Anker has a new GaN charger that the company announced at CES 2022, the $79 Anker Nano II 100W (also known as the Anker 736 charger), which the company says is “the world’s smallest 100W gallium nitride wall charger.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="neTb2W"&gt;The new Nano II 100W charger offers a pair of USB-C ports and a single USB-A port, and it uses Anker’s second-generation GaN II technology that the company debuted earlier this year on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22450999/anker-second-generation-nano-ii-gan-chargers-smaller"&gt;its other Nano II chargers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1p77cc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More power in a smaller package&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S4v4Ij"&gt;It’s also worth noting that the 100W output is only for a single device at once — if more than one gadget is plugged in, the Nano II 100W will divvy up wattage according. But the 100W output here is enough to charge most laptops at full speed, which is a nice improvement over Anker’s previous models. The new plug also features &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anker.com%2Fca%2Fpoweriq3&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F4%2F22866945%2Fanker-nano-ii-100w-usb-c-736-charger-smallest-ces-2022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker’s PowerIQ 3.0 technology&lt;/a&gt; for optimizing charging, along with support for USB Power Delivery 3.0 PPS (programmable power standard), meaning it works with &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/what-is/super-fast-charging/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s Super Fast Charging standard&lt;/a&gt;, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lCIOer"&gt;The new charger replaces Anker’s previous Nano II plug, the Anker Nano II 65W (also called the Anker 735 charger), which had a longer, thinner design and no fold-out plugs. The Nano II 100W, on the other hand, has a more traditional design to go with the increased 100W output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1l6ffI"&gt;The Anker 736 Nano II 100W is set to hit stores in March for $79. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Anker’s new Video Bar is an all-in-one speaker, light, and webcam for your PC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Anker Video Bar" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2ITSUZWRgTYxyX0pfjYUNXvJe1g=/0x0:900x600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346773/videobar.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Anker&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9MFcsV"&gt;Anker has announced the B600 Video Bar, a nifty video conferencing toolkit that houses everything that meeting-goers need. It rests upon your monitor (or TV), and the webcam portion of the Video Bar features a 2K sensor capable of 30 frames per second capture. It offers field-of-view adjustment, autofocus, and like most fancy webcams these days, it supports an AI-powered zoom feature and image enhancement. Within the device, there’s also a microphone array. It uses an AI algorithm to make noisy environments sound quiet on the other end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k8WRyk"&gt;The Video Bar also packs two features that aren’t commonly included with a webcam: a key light and speakers. I’d assume that a large percentage of people who work from home don’t have ideal lighting during their video calls, and this should help you look a bit more lively and, perhaps, a bit more professional. Anker touts a feature called MagicSight that’s offered in the Video Bar, which can make automatic lighting adjustments. There’s also a front-facing slider that can make lighting adjustments on the fly. More tweaks to color temperature and brightness can be made within an app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PJOwkv"&gt;Those speakers that I mentioned early are just a nice perk. I doubt they provide amazing quality, but it’s probably going to be convenient for people who don’t like to manage cables. &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/ankers-new-2k-webcam-has-an-led-light-bar-to-make-you-l-1848227051"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reports that the Video Bar will cost $220 and launch on January 25th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer’s latest Nitro 5 gaming laptop continues the tradition of great value</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Acer Nitro 5" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wJtRySUHsRiBV9T1UceIlqg31xg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346745/acernitro52022.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Acer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MlSmYm"&gt;Acer’s Nitro 5 gaming laptop lineup has become more refined and feature-packed over time, and the new versions announced at CES 2022 make it even more appealing. Like before, the Nitro 5 for 2022 comes in two sizes, 15.6 inches and 17.3 inches, and you can choose between a 1080p or a QHD display. What’s new for this year is that its chassis design ditched those angular corners and added some extra pizazz to its lid. Also of note is that you can get one with either the latest 12th-Gen Intel processors (starting with a Core i5 12700H and going up to an Core i7 12700H) or one of AMD’s Ryzen 6000-series processors (starting with the Ryzen 5 6600H, going up to the Ryzen 7 6800H). Both versions can stock up to Nvidia’s new RTX 3070 Ti graphics chip, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GzXRsE"&gt;The Intel and AMD models seem identical in most ways, though the AMD-based Nitro 5 might be the one to buy if you want all of the latest (and fastest) internal components. The AMD Nitro 5 supports fast DDR5 RAM (up to 32GB using two SODIMM slots) clocked at 4,800MHz, while the Intel model is still using DDR4 RAM clocked at 3,200MHz. In terms of storage, both models feature two M.2 SSD slots, though the Intel version supports two PCIe 4.0 SSDs, along with a SATA HDD, whereas the AMD model, oddly, supports one PCIe 4.0 M.2 SSD, one PCIe 3.0 M.2 SSD, and one SATA HDD.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Acer Nitro 5" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qWm7eVWTM7dG0mGmCnj6Frpy6Wg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23141997/acernitro52022_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Acer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A top-down view of the new Nitro 5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BGt5GV"&gt;As is typically the case, the processor you select will impact the port selection on the laptop. The Intel-based laptop includes a Thunderbolt 4, as well as an HDMI 2.1 port, three USB-A ports, a power plug, an ethernet jack, and a headphone jack. The AMD-based model keeps all of that but exchanges the Thunderbolt 4 port for a USB 4 Type-C port and Thunderbolt 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U6D31r"&gt;The 15.6-inch Nitro 5 with Intel processors will begin shipping to the US in March with a starting price of $1,049.99, while the 17.3-inch version will ship in April, starting at $1,099.99. If you want the AMD version, that model will ship to the US in April, starting at $1,099.99, going up to $1,149.99 for the 17.3-inch version that will begin shipping in May 2022. These are really great prices, and I’m excited to see what these laptops are capable of.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer updates its Swift X laptops, and the 16-inch model has an Intel Arc GPU</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0XP-_HfkxDscwdpfolutuHOKMgw=/0x60:1440x1020/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346748/Swift_X_SFX14_51G_07.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LY09iX"&gt;Acer is announcing updates to its Swift X line of ultraportable laptops at CES 2022, each sporting 12th Gen Intel Core processors and, on the 16-inch model, a discrete &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22626912/intel-arc-gpu-brand-alchemist-codename-release-date"&gt;Intel Arc GPU&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iHaRF5"&gt;The 2022 versions of the laptops come in two screen sizes (and both have a 16:10 aspect ratio): a 14-inch model with a 2240 x 1400 resolution and a 16-inch model with an up to 2560 x 1600 resolution. While the 16-inch version has the Intel Arc GPU, the 14-inch model is available with Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 3050 Ti laptop GPU or integrated graphics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="frMte1"&gt;Both models run Windows 11 and are equipped with two Thunderbolt 4 ports, two USB-A ports, an HDMI 2.0 port, and a fingerprint reader. And both sound like they’ll be relatively light — Acer says the 14-inch model weighs 3.09 lbs, while the 16-inch model weighs 3.95 lbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k6jdqQ"&gt;Acer hasn’t announced pricing or availability for the new laptops just yet, so we don’t know exactly when you’ll be able to get your hands on them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake chips arrive at CES 2022 for its most powerful laptops ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cRAObyJLWmYK0-A8LQTmB148BQc=/140x0:3860x2480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346708/12th_gen_mobile_chip_pose_06_4000px.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hE1ibE"&gt;Intel has announced its latest 12th Gen Alder Lake featuring the company’s new hybrid architecture at CES 2022 with its first laptop chip using the new design, led by the Core i9-12900HK, which Intel boldly claims is “the fastest mobile processor. Ever.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2RHbZ8"&gt;Intel’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22747271/intel-12th-gen-alder-lake-chips-hybrid-architecture-price-release-date-i9-12900k"&gt;first wave of 12th Gen Alder Lake&lt;/a&gt; chips on desktop last fall were one of its biggest successes in years, allowing the company to offer a chip that could beat or compete with AMD’s Ryzen 9 5950X flagship across productivity and gaming. And now, Intel is bringing that same new approach to chip design — with its Arm-esque performance and efficiency cores — to laptops, starting with its most powerful 45W H-series models of chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="M6MEGN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake chips usher in a new generation of x86 processors","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22747271/intel-12th-gen-alder-lake-chips-hybrid-architecture-price-release-date-i9-12900k"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="QZt1vX"&gt;But the laptop world also has gotten a lot more crowded of late, with Intel not just having &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225474/amd-ryzen-5000-series-mobile-processors-ces-2021"&gt;AMD’s resurgent Ryzen chips&lt;/a&gt; to contend with, but also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;Apple’s superlative M1 MacBooks&lt;/a&gt; — including the recently released M1 Pro and M1 Max chips in the company’s 2021 MacBook Pro models, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review"&gt;offered the best performance we’ve ever seen&lt;/a&gt; from any laptop &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has ever tested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="al5atN"&gt;In other words: Intel has a lot of catching up to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MdswpJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Intel has a lot of catching up to do&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7iKxOJ"&gt;The good news is that Intel is coming out swinging at CES 2022, making the bold claim that its new Alder Lake chips — and specifically, its flagship Core i9-12900HK design and its 5.0GHz boosted clock speed — can outclass both AMD’s Ryzen 5900HX and Apple’s M1 Max as the top laptop processor around, for both gaming or productivity tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gmee39"&gt;Specifically, Intel boasts that the Core i9-12900HK offers up to 28 percent faster gaming over its predecessor, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22423545/intel-tiger-lake-h-mobile-processors-11th-gen-laptops"&gt;Core i9-11980HK&lt;/a&gt;, although the largest jumps are still in older titles like &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;. Newer games like &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Gears 5&lt;/em&gt; show far more modest generational improvements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nrX8z0"&gt;The company also touts big jumps in productivity tasks, with a 44-percent boost in PugetBench for Premiere Pro benchmarks (a task in which Intel says its new chip also can outclass Apple’s M1 Max), along with significant gains in Autodesk benchmarks. Additionally, it’s important to note that Intel is focusing its improvements here primarily on performance improvements: the company isn’t boasting of any big jumps in battery life, an area in which Apple’s chips in particular tend to excel. (As an additional caveat, Intel says it conducted its tests on December 10th, before the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22834232/adobe-photoshop-ipad-smudge-sponge-tools-premiere-pro-m1-macs"&gt;latest round of Adobe Premiere Pro updates&lt;/a&gt;, which added additional M1 Mac optimizations — so those numbers may shift a bit.) &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7LbeawtTzLalfoZmDVJ-Fd_LXsE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23143548/Screen_Shot_2022_01_03_at_8.52.24_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BWdkk2"&gt;Of course, all those benchmarks are from Intel, so we’ll have to wait until laptops featuring the new chips make their way out into the world so that we can put them through their paces to see if Intel really has retaken its mobile chip crown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rpK8el"&gt;Like the Alder Lake desktop chips from last fall, the new laptop chips offer dramatically boosted core counts, split between Intel’s “performance core” for jobs that need the most processing power and “efficient” cores for less demanding or background tasks. Intel is releasing a variety of Alder Lake chips in this latest batch, spanning 14-core i9 and i7 models with six performance cores and eight efficient cores. Other less powerful i7 and i5 models drop those numbers considerably, though, down to eight total cores (four performance, four efficient) on the base i5 model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="amMw0d"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10950021"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rd8jE0"&gt;In addition to the performance gains, the new 12th Gen chips also come with a variety of other improvements, including Wi-Fi 6E, Thunderbolt 4, PCIe 4.0, and support for the latest in memory standards (with support for DDR5 memory at up to 4,800MHz and LPDDR5 at up to 5,200MHz both offered). Notably missing, however, is integrated support for the latest in HDMI standards (Intel’s chip tops out at HDMI 2.0b) and PCIe 5.0 lanes (the latter of which Intel does offer on its desktop Alder Lake chips). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hD9PZI"&gt;It’s also important to note that Intel’s new mobile chips that it’s announcing at CES are just the first wave of laptop chips it’ll be offering in 2022 with its new hybrid architecture design. Today’s news is just focused on the company’s most powerful 45W H-series models of chips meant for gaming or high-performance productivity laptops. But Intel also has plans for 15W and 9W U-series chips designed for “modern thin and light” designs, along with a new P-series class of 28W chips also in the works that’ll utilize it’s P-core and E-core designs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vwsnPE"&gt;And while it’ll still be some time before those chips make their debut (right now, Intel is only saying that they’ll arrive later this year), the company has already released a look at the SKUs for the new Alder Lake-based P-series and U-series chips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="chbdBm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10960187"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4sr8QO"&gt;The first H-series Alder Lake laptops are set to be announced at CES 2022 for an early 2022 release, while computers with the lower-powered P-series and U-series chips should be announced and released later on in the year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel updates its Evo laptop standard for better video calls and foldable laptops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Aw5Th0jJEAUZTmE1mBbnKSzANzA=/188x0:1964x1184/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346707/Screen_Shot_2022_01_03_at_9.09.44_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wh2a8s"&gt;Intel has announced its third-generation update for its “Intel Evo” certification program at CES 2022, adding new requirements for better video calls for future devices, expanding the certification to include larger and more powerful laptops, and new foldable designs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w4aUBA"&gt;The Evo branding (itself an extension of Intel’s original Project Athena program) was introduced in 2020 alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21408718/intel-11th-gen-tiger-lake-cpu-processor-announcement-laptops-fall"&gt;Intel’s 11th Gen Tiger Lake chips&lt;/a&gt; as a simple and easy way for customers to know that they’d be getting a laptop that checked certain basic performance and experiential metrics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P7uFDp"&gt;Specifically, in addition to offering one of Intel’s 11th Gen U-series or Y-series chips, Evo-branded laptops had to get over nine hours of “real-world” battery life, wake from sleep in “less than a second,” offer fast charging (for at least four hours of charge in 30 minutes), and offer Wi-Fi 6 and Thunderbolt 4 support. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nDQeKEyzkDqH1TjvF9nlpDbcnnc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23143567/Screen_Shot_2022_01_03_at_9.08.45_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ly68Ey"&gt;Naturally, with the recently announced 12th Gen Alder Lake chips, Intel is also updating the requirements for Evo approval: new Evo laptops will have to feature Intel’s new 12th Gen chips, of course, but there’s also a new “intelligent collaboration” requirement (in addition to the battery life, fast charging, and other existing specifications) to mandate high-quality videoconferencing experiences. As part of that, the new Intel Evo standard will mandate at least a 1080p webcam (if not better), along with Wi-Fi 6E and AI-based audio enhancement to cut down on background noise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T4bGS9"&gt;Additionally, Intel is expanding the kinds of laptops on which it’ll be offering its Evo branding. Laptops with the company’s more powerful H-series chips can now get Evo branding the first time, with a few added requirements on top of the existing Evo rules: namely, they’ll have to use Intel’s upcoming discrete Arc graphics (instead of, say, an Nvidia RTX GPU). Intel says that its goal is providing a great experience for content creators here — given the professional focus of the Evo branding (and the battery requirements), it’s unlikely that gaming PCs will sport the logo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DoOdrw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Intel will give foldables its Evo badge of approval this year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MZl66j"&gt;And in what’s perhaps the most interesting bit addition, Intel is also introducing a third category of Evo certification for foldable laptops. Here, too, device makers will have to adhere to the usual Evo spec list, with the obvious addition of a large, foldable display. The first Evo-approved foldables are set to hit the market in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WRKzTV"&gt;Additionally, Intel announced that it’ll be expanding its Project Athena program to desktops, starting with its new wave of 12th Gen Alder Lake chips that the company announced at CES 2022. Unlike the Intel Evo program for laptops, though, Project Athena for desktops will focus on different experiential requirements, prioritizing things like privacy and sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HP updates its business-focused laptop lineup with Intel 12th Gen Alder Lake CPUs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QCT28LE9C1iG1utZXbo9yUZMS14=/0x303:3300x2503/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346717/HP_EliteBook_1040_G9_Front_Left.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP EliteBook 1040 G9 has a 14-inch IPS display.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: HP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ix9QmF"&gt;HP debuted its new commercial laptops at CES 2022, including its convertible Elite x360 devices, EliteBook 800 and 600 lineups, as well as its ProBook 400 G9 series laptops. Each Windows 11 laptop comes with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22747271/intel-12th-gen-alder-lake-chips-hybrid-architecture-price-release-date-i9-12900k"&gt;Intel’s 12th Gen processor, which was just introduced&lt;/a&gt; last October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ewtkbg"&gt;The HP Elite x360 1040 G9 and HP EliteBook 1040 G9 have almost the same internals; one of the main differences is that the Elite x360 is a convertible device with a touchscreen, while the latter is just your typical clamshell laptop. Each device has a 14-inch 16:10 IPS display, supports up to 2TB of storage, and comes with optional 5G connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EwtsKA"&gt;While the Elite x360 supports up to 16GB of DDR5 SODIMM memory and 2TB of storage, the EliteBook 1040 G9 comes with up to 64GB of DDR5 SODIMM memory. Both laptops also have a battery life of up to 13 hours, in addition to a 5MP camera and 940nm IR camera that should show you more clearly during video calls.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NhRxA1ecmasEycJMm29uvcHoi_M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142902/HP_EliteBook_840_G9_Front_Open.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP EliteBook 840 G9 laptop has a 14-inch display with up to 64GB of memory.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ydsTPv"&gt;HP’s 800 EliteBook G9 Series devices — the 830, 840, and 860 — are ultra-thin laptops that come in varying sizes and specs, all of which come with the option for 5G connectivity. You can choose from a 13.3-inch, 14-inch, or 16-inch 16:10 anti-glare IPS display. The 840 and 860 have up to 64GB of DDR5 SODIMM memory, as opposed to up to 16GB in the 830. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nj8kHW"&gt;HP says each device also lasts up to 14 hours on a single charge and comes with the Intel Evo stamp of approval. There’s also the option of the convertible Elite x360 830 G9 with a 13.3-inch display, in case you don’t want the traditional clamshell design.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-DYtMRzrySFE4nG0wDO1S_9IcLU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142915/HP_EliteBook_630_G9_Front_Right.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The EliteBook 630 G9 laptop has a 13.3-inch display.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wkisYA"&gt;The EliteBook 600 G9 Series includes the 630, 640, and 650 laptops, offering the option of either a 13.3-inch, 14-inch, or 15.6-inch 16:9 display. All the devices in the 600 series come with up to 64GB of DDR4 SDRAM memory and anywhere from 256GB to 1TB of storage, depending on the configuration you choose. However, only the 650 comes with an Integrated Intel Iris Xe graphics card or the optional Nvidia GeForce MX570.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Uj4_Vnx-UHGoOsyvTK_oBgk7-5Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142924/HP_ProBook_440_G9_Rear_Left.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Intel ProBook 440 G9 laptop comes with either an Intel Integrated graphics chip or Nvidia GeForce MX570.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Jopk0S"&gt;There are only two laptops in HP’s ProBook 400 G9 Series, which Intel says are ideal for “growing” businesses: the 440 14-inch ProBook and 450 15.6-inch ProBook. Both devices support up to 32GB of DDR4 SDRAM memory and various storage options (with the highest option being 1TB) and come with either an Intel Integrated graphics card or Nvidia GeForce MX570.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ieSIDb"&gt;HP’s latest lineup of commercial Intel-based laptops will be available in March of this year. Pricing information isn’t available for any of these products just yet. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel’s upcoming Arc GPUs inch closer to their debut with latest OEM update </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vPWwmtqE39NiepZPDgq2ZLuL6vI=/1x0:1654x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346703/intelarc2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UxSPJ1"&gt;Intel’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22626912/intel-arc-gpu-brand-alchemist-codename-release-date"&gt;highly anticipated Arc GPUs&lt;/a&gt; have gotten a step closer to gamers’ hands: the company announced at CES 2022 that it’s already started shipping its first-generation Alchemist GPUs to OEM customers for desktop and laptop systems, including Acer, Asus, Clevo, Dell, Gigabyte, Haier, HP, Lenovo, Samsung, MSI, and NEC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l5UbCy"&gt;The Arc GPUs are a big deal for Intel, set to package the company’s new Xe graphics architecture into discrete laptop and desktop GPUs, marking the biggest foray yet for Intel (which is best known for its CPUs) into the graphics world. Arc GPUs promise support for high-level gaming and creative features, too, including hardware-accelerated ray tracing and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22631061/intel-arc-gpu-alchemist-xe-ss-super-sampling-ai-architecture-day-preview"&gt;XeSS, Intel’s AI-accelerated supersampling&lt;/a&gt;. In short, Arc is Intel’s biggest effort yet to take on AMD and Nvidia’s GPU hegemony for both laptops and desktops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ih9XLb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Intel’s first Alchemist GPUs are almost here&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P7vx9Q"&gt;Unfortunately, there’s still no word on when exactly the first computers with Intel’s Arc GPUs will be shipping, either in pre-built OEM desktops and laptops or for customers to buy on their own and integrate into their existing gaming rigs. Similarly, there’s no official word yet on crucial details like how many different models of Alchemist GPUs there will be, what the actual specs on the graphics cards are, or — most importantly — how much they’ll cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WvZjsI"&gt;Intel also announced at CES 2022 that discrete Arc GPUs will be required on Intel Evo-branded laptops featuring its new 12th Gen H-series chips, so it’s likely that we’ll start to see at least mobile versions of the new graphics systems make their way out in the world in the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mobileye and Geely team up to build a self-driving car you can buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Auto Shanghai 2021" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U54VfmrMkiy92Plxp3S-HXGl20s=/4x0:4924x3280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346710/1313856452.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by VCG/VCG via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XkapL2"&gt;Mobileye, the autonomous vehicle company owned by Intel, and Geely, China’s largest automaker, are joining forces to develop a consumer-ready autonomous vehicle that they claim will be ready by 2024. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XLQ9ao"&gt;The self-driving car, which will also be battery-electric, will be produced under Geely’s Zeekr brand, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346358/geely-electric-vehicle-brand-zeekr-china"&gt;which was unveiled last year&lt;/a&gt; as the automaker’s “new electric mobility technology and solutions company.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ITK6cL"&gt;The new car will be equipped with Level 4 autonomous driving capabilities, meaning it will handle 100 percent of the driving tasks under certain conditions, like favorable weather or within certain geographic limits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DI2k4G"&gt;The vehicle will operate with a number of Mobileye’s branded AV systems, including six of the company’s EyeQ5 System-on-a-chips and its Road Experience Management, or REM, which uses real-time data from Mobileye-equipped vehicles to build out a global 3D map. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="33i3fr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;To date, there are no self-driving cars for sale to consumers as personally owned vehicles&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3YZPKZ"&gt;The vehicle will be built on Geely’s open-source Sustainable Experience Architecture (SEA), which includes redundant systems for braking, steering, and power. Mobileye, which is based in Israel, also plans on growing its presence in China by hiring more employees and building a data center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AhppUr"&gt;To date, there are no self-driving cars for sale to consumers as personally owned vehicles. Most AV companies are choosing to deploy their vehicles as part of fleets of autonomous taxis as a way to defray the enormous hardware and software costs associated with highly automated driving. Other companies, like Tesla, claim their vehicles are “self-driving,” but in reality, they are only equipped with Level 2 advanced driver assist systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0TRFN"&gt;Most experts assume that autonomous vehicles will eventually be sold to consumers but at a much later date, when the manufacturing costs have declined and the margins are more favorable to a company’s bottom line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mAZjqd"&gt;But Mobileye and Geely believe that date is coming sooner than most people anticipate. The companies claim their vehicle will go on sale in China in 2024, making it the world’s first Level 4-capable vehicle available to consumers. They also hope to introduce it to other global markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tJc4Xs"&gt;Mobileye isn’t the only AV company to team up with Geely, which also owns Volvo and the new electric subbrand, Polestar. Last week, Alphabet’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/29/22858144/waymo-geely-partnership-all-electric-self-driving-minivans-zeekr"&gt;Waymo said it would work with the Chinese auto giant&lt;/a&gt; on a fleet of electric robotaxis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wHnEXZ"&gt;Waymo has also partnered with Stellantis and Jaguar Land Rover to deploy and develop its autonomous capabilities, while Geely plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708804/volvo-ipo-value-geely-polestar-electric-cars"&gt;take Volvo public&lt;/a&gt; as an all-electric company, after doing the same with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696139/polestar-spac-public-value-ev-startup-volvo-geely"&gt;new Polestar brand&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
