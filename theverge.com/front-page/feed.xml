    <title>You can change your Nest doorbell ringtone starting next month</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can soon set your Nest doorbell to cackle at your visitors.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZnkQBc"&gt;Google Nest is bringing back seasonal ringtones for its video doorbells, which now include the Nest Doorbell (wired) — previously known as Nest Hello — and the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22609444/google-nest-cam-indoor-floodlight-doorbell-price-specs-news"&gt;Nest Doorbell (battery)&lt;/a&gt;. First up are Halloween-inspired tones, which will stick around through October, then the winter holiday-themed options arrive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PJAZfl"&gt;For the past three years Nest has offered them, the ringtones have disappeared following the holidays, leaving you with the standard ding dong. But this year, the new Nest Doorbell will also get six “evergreen” ringtones that are usable year-round. They will arrive with the Halloween options, but Google tells me they aren’t coming to the older Nest Doorbell (wired).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="54xcii"&gt;The spooky-themed ringtones should arrive on October 1st and will be available on both buzzers through October 31st. Fortunately, you don’t need a paid Nest Aware subscription to greet your guests with one of the tones, which include an evil laugh, a skeleton dance, a spooky raven, a boo from a ghost, a howling werewolf, a cackling witch, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J3ZfUV"&gt;The tones will ring both from the doorbell itself and on any Google Nest speakers or smart displays you have in your home. You can select the ringtone you want in the settings of the Google Home App for Nest Doorbell (battery) or the Nest App for the Nest Doorbell (wired). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="CaDgnv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10779176"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8JpkVl"&gt;If you want to get spookier, Google Nest speakers and displays can also play an hour-long playlist of Halloween-themed sounds and music. Just say, “Hey Google, let’s get spooky.” And you can play a Halloween-themed game on a Nest Hub or Nest Hub Max. Say, “Hey Google, tell me a Halloween riddle,” and enter a Riddle Room adventure with a spooky twist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CXhxtL"&gt;After Halloween is over on November 1st, your doorbell will automatically go back to the default tone. You can go into the app and choose a new seasonal theme until the end of December, or if you have the Nest Hello (battery) you can pick one of the new year-round options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2HI8as"&gt;Last year the holiday-themed options included a dozen or so tones related to Christmas, Hanukkah, New Year’s, and Kwanzaa. It seems likely that we can expect to see similar options this year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Astro cannot fetch your beer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0wQtqw77VyCBXI2s38ZOMEWlO2E=/300x16:1790x1009/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69923391/Capto_Capture_2021_09_28_06_31_38_PM.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Astro did not put that beer there!&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6EZDmO"&gt;Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22697244/amazon-astro-home-robot-hands-on-features-price"&gt;introduced a new robot today&lt;/a&gt; with the face of an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review"&gt;Echo Show&lt;/a&gt;, the sensor-laden body of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22617175/starship-technologies-delivery-robots-college-campuses"&gt;Panera Bread delivery bot&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj1t3msy8dc"&gt;pair of cupholders for a trunk&lt;/a&gt;. The instant it was announced, people clamored for a reason for its existence beyond “mobile camera with a cute face” and “potentially invasive surveillance drone.” Most seemed to settle on “beer fetcher.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ApQR9f"&gt;But friend, a pair of cupholders does not a robowaiter make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iWsRrv"&gt;While the $1,000 Astro could very well have a wide variety of capabilities beyond home surveillance, it’s not gonna be fetching you anything. For one, it reportedly sucks. “Astro is terrible and will almost certainly throw itself down a flight of stairs if presented the opportunity,” &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93ypp8/leaked-documents-amazon-astro-surveillance-robot-tracking"&gt;a source who claimed to work on the project told Vice&lt;/a&gt;. Another source told Vice “it’s a disaster that’s not ready for release.” A robot more prone to tossing itself into the void than performing expected functions is not gonna be grabbing that Heineken from the fridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PKXcFi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The real problem is the robot has no arms&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w4SF9R"&gt;It’s also unclear how well it can see anything. Google and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22642017/snapchat-scan-feature-ar-camera-visual-search"&gt;Snapchat&lt;/a&gt; have both heavily invested in creating a way for computers to interpret the real world without guideposts like bar codes. Amazon has not. It might be the maker of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18197137/amazon-rekognition-facial-recognition-bias-race-gender"&gt;Rekognition&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/10/21287101/amazon-rekognition-facial-recognition-police-ban-one-year-ai-racial-bias"&gt;controversial facial recognition service&lt;/a&gt;, but its Ring ecosystem only got the ability to recognize packages... &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22691923/ring-video-doorbell-package-alerts-amazon-event"&gt;today&lt;/a&gt;. How long would it take Astro to recognize a beer? And what happens when that beer recognition technology fails? You could find yourself with a refreshing bottle of ranch dressing instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lVjW3j"&gt;But the biggest problem isn’t the reports that it sucks, or the failure to prove it can distinguish between the various contents of your fridge. The real problem is the robot has no arms!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QdXtcC"&gt;There is no way for it to open a fridge, freezer, or even a Yeti cooler. It can’t even open a door. It certainly cannot reach into a crowded fridge and pull out a cold one. I fear people assume it's got some Doc Ock arms tucked away behind its face or are hoping those two cupholders rise out of the robot to open the fridge via suction. They’ve seen the cupholders and assumed there is a way to get things into them that don’t involve someone in the other room helping out.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A view of the Astro robot approaching a woman. A beer rests in its cupholder." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2_C405yax8mfTzzbgpHb_FKA9oQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22886050/Capto_Capture_2021_09_28_06_21_08_PM.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who gave you that beer, Astro?!?!?!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vB5Nt6"&gt;But there isn’t. Currently, there appear to be no plans to build it a pair of grabbers — or even a single appendage. The payload area the cupholders occupy &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; have a USB-C port, though! Theoretically, someone could build an arm. That arm could replace the cupholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="umYNa9"&gt;But that arm does not yet exist. Unless you want to be shouting to housemates to stick a beer in your bot, the Astro will not be fetching you any kind of beverage. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk slams Biden as ‘not the friendliest’ after White House EV summit snub</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="biden (flickr)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D6Fgh09AQkJKm04XS-C6V1026uM=/1x0:1024x682/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69923202/biden.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="E7YdLQ"&gt;Tesla and SpaceX boss Elon Musk criticized President Joe Biden as “not the friendliest administration” after the White House snubbed his company last month. Musk’s comments came &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22698563/elon-musk-code-conference-liveblog"&gt;during a Code Conference interview&lt;/a&gt; and followed a tweet in which the Tesla CEO mocked Biden using similar insults as former President Donald Trump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="plBtCg"&gt;The Biden administration invited auto executives to the &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/08/05/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-steps-to-drive-american-leadership-forward-on-clean-cars-and-trucks/"&gt;White House last month&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the shared goal of increasing the production of electric vehicles. Top officials from Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis were invited. But Tesla, which is the largest EV maker in the world, was not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="P0nG0N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Controlled by the unions”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bDxax7"&gt;One potential reason that Tesla wasn’t invited is that its factory workforce is not unionized, while Biden is a big supporter of unions. During the Code interview, Musk went a step further, claiming that Biden’s administration was “controlled by the unions.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ifUYr2"&gt;Tesla has been actively fighting against an attempt to organize Tesla workers at the company’s Fremont, Calif. plant. Musk himself was found to have &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/9/30/20891314/elon-musk-tesla-labor-violation-nlrb"&gt;violated labor law&lt;/a&gt; when he tweeted anti-union comments in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="leVCqV"&gt;Musk has been tweaking Biden on Twitter for weeks. Last week, when asked why Biden didn’t issue a statement about SpaceX’s recent rocket launch, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1439665626914635783?s=20"&gt;Musk tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, “He’s still sleeping,” echoing a Trump nickname for Biden, “Sleepy Joe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T1i8Lp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 28th, 7:15PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BRBEzv"&gt;On Twitter, a top United Auto Workers official responded to Musk’s comments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3Vy4bn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;He needs to stop whining and just admit that workers should not have to punch out of democracy when they punch into work! Good leaders aren’t afraid of smart workers but embrace them!&lt;/p&gt;— Cindy Estrada (@CindyEstrada174) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CindyEstrada174/status/1442989024067657730?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk: ‘we probably don’t need’ NDAs for Tesla’s ‘Full Self-Driving’ beta</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a_Z6z5d9DFZt6KLos-ohsHk1hFQ=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69923196/REC_ASA3_CODE21_20210928_143813_0138.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Asa Mathat&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yhPZrE"&gt;Tesla has been making participants in the “Full Self-Driving” beta test &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7ezxq/how-teslas-self-driving-beta-testers-protect-the-company-from-critics"&gt;sign non-disclosure agreements&lt;/a&gt;, but CEO Elon Musk said Tuesday “we probably don’t need” them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84zWsv"&gt;The reason? “There’s a lot of videos” being shared of the beta software in action, Musk said on Tuesday during the 2021 Code Conference. “People don’t seem to listen to me” and are “just ignoring it anyway.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JGLfO4"&gt;“I don’t know why there’s an NDA,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o82iUX"&gt;Tesla has had a small group of owners testing out the beta version of its “Full Self-Driving” software — which, despite the name, does not make the company’s cars fully autonomous — on public roads for about a year now. But this week, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7ezxq/how-teslas-self-driving-beta-testers-protect-the-company-from-critics"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that the company makes participants in the program sign NDAs. These agreements even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22696463/tesla-fsd-beta-nda-video-clips-controversy-full-self-driving"&gt;discourage people from sharing footage&lt;/a&gt; of the beta software performing poorly because “there are a lot of people that want Tesla to fail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="a8cuDD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Tesla asks owners to share fewer clips of ‘Full Self-Driving’ beta mistakes","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22696463/tesla-fsd-beta-nda-video-clips-controversy-full-self-driving"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="B6eRsp"&gt;The details about the NDA — and Musk’s apparent reversal on using them — come as Tesla is set to rapidly expand the number of people who have access to the software, despite a recent warning for caution from the head of the National Transportation Safety Board. Musk and his company say that they are using the sensors in Tesla’s cars to make sure only safe drivers enter the program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cqdcae"&gt;“The transition period to new technology is always a little bumpy,” he said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iqtq22"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Astro is ‘terrible’ and will ‘throw itself down’ stairs, developers reportedly claim</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZsjNiQvHf2kpkkqJrR1eXOb2pKU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69923157/amazon_astro_home_robot_4773_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When you see a flight of stairs.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xaEiqf"&gt;Some of the people building Amazon’s Astro home robot are not impressed with it, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93ypp8/leaked-documents-amazon-astro-surveillance-robot-tracking"&gt;according to a report by &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. One person who worked on the robot, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22697244/amazon-astro-home-robot-hands-on-features-price"&gt;was announced today&lt;/a&gt;, reportedly called it a “disaster that’s not ready for release,” while another said it was “terrible,” and the idea that it’d be a useful accessibility device (part of Amazon’s pitch is that Astro can help with elder care) was “absurdist nonsense.” The sources also mentioned that the bot doesn’t handle stairs well, with one even saying that it would “throw itself down” them “if presented the opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0wMrR"&gt;To make matters worse, &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; also reports that the robot is fragile and that several devices had broken. That’s not great news for a $1,000 (or $1,449) robot that lives on the floor, where it’s prone to being stepped on by children, kicked by inattentive adults, or attacked by pets displeased with its presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7Mz2z9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Astro is always watching&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sJBBVd"&gt;Leaked documents and videos of developer meetings obtained by &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; also show that Astro is doing a lot of surveillance with its facial recognition systems, and the feature where it follows people around if it doesn’t recognize them. &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;’s sources say that it’s not great at actually figuring out who people are, which could lead to Astro annoyingly nipping at the heels of people it should know. One of the people who worked on it called its data collection “a privacy nightmare.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LxlzjV"&gt;It’s not necessarily surprising that Astro is always watching, though — it comes with a Ring Protect Pro subscription, and Amazon’s own marketing for the robot shows off that it can be used as a security device (but in the context of wild animals entering your home rather than people). The most surprising thing is that we’re seeing leaked documents, videos, and hearing from grudging developers on the&lt;em&gt; same day &lt;/em&gt;the device was announced. Someone, or multiple someones, inside Amazon must not be swayed by the robot’s charms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Gib41L"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sj1t3msy8dc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yizb2o"&gt;The leak also somewhat recontextualizes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22698401/amazon-astro-invite-preorder-how-to-info-early-access-price"&gt;Amazon’s invite-based rollout&lt;/a&gt;. You currently can’t just buy the robot, you have to request an invite, a process which requires filling out a survey to indicate whether your house would be a good fit for Astro (which includes a question about what style stairs you have). It’s possible Amazon is trying to put these bots into the best case scenario, to see if they can even survive that. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="W1p7gL"&gt;Facebook’s interest in understanding and eventually acquiring younger users extends well beyond &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230822/facebook-messenger-kids-international-expansion-group-settings-friend-requests-supervised-friending"&gt;Messenger Kids&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696039/facebook-instagram-kids-app-pause-development-criticism"&gt;currently paused plans for a child-friendly Instagram&lt;/a&gt;. A new report in &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s series on Facebook’s internal research &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-instagram-kids-tweens-attract-11632849667"&gt;shows the company’s focus on kids goes much deeper&lt;/a&gt;, including studying children younger than four years old in the hopes of better designing future products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i6n5cm"&gt;The company’s child research is primarily motivated by the success of apps like TikTok and Snapchat in attracting younger users. “With the ubiquity of tablets and phones, kids are getting on the internet as young as six years old. We can’t ignore this and we have a responsibility to figure it out,” a confidential Facebook document viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reads. Another possible cause for concern: the &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;writes that the number of teenagers using Facebook daily has fallen 19 percent in the last two years and could drop an additional 45 percent by 2023, according to a document the publication saw. Suddenly, the directive to “imagine a Facebook experience designed for youth” makes more sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aENaAv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Children could be converted to Instagram and Facebook users down the road&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CpzZ5c"&gt;Facebook’s child research has led it down several paths. The company reportedly explored encouraging children to use Messenger Kids in person, according to a presentation the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; viewed called “Exploring playdates as a growth lever.” Facebook researchers have also tried to introduce a more holistic understanding of childhood by breaking things down into six age brackets: “adults, late teens ages 16 to maturity, teens ages 13 to 15, tweens ages 10 to 12, children ages 5 to 9 and young kids ages zero to four,” a slide mentioned in the report reads. One presentation set a goal of transitioning younger users from Instagram to the original Facebook, or the “Life Coach for Adulting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZmONm5"&gt;The idea that Facebook might consider newborns in its product decisions is an admittedly odd one. That the company has children in mind at all isn’t, though. As Instagram head Adam Mosseri notes in a statement included in &lt;em&gt;The Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s reporting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Vw4Vbf"&gt;It’s not new and it’s not a secret that social-media companies try to understand how teens and preteens use technology. Like all technology companies, of course, we want to appeal to the next generation, but that’s entirely different from the false assertion that we knowingly attempt to recruit people who aren’t old enough to use our apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="uilmzD"&gt;Facebook responded to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s reporting &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/explaining-research-to-support-families/"&gt;in a blog post published late Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, the company states that its age brackets are a taxonomy used by the “Age Appropriate Design Code and other policy experts” and that the “playdate” language it used was “an insensitive way to pose a serious question” and “doesn’t reflect its approach to building the app.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2g40JO"&gt;The possible effects Facebook’s products have on younger users are now coming to light. Earlier reporting on Facebook’s research shows that Instagram &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675130/facebook-instagram-teens-mental-health-damage-internal-research"&gt;can have negative impacts on younger users’ body image&lt;/a&gt;. Concern over how the app could potentially harm children is great enough that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675802/facebook-instagram-teens-harm-blumenthal-blackburn-markey-kids"&gt;Congress is getting involved&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696698/facebook-instagram-for-kids-mosseri-markey-blumenthal-blackburn-pause"&gt;Facebook representatives are slated to testify&lt;/a&gt; at a hearing this Thursday. Clearly, the social network will have plenty to answer for soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lcMDKR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 28th, 7:57PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added Facebook’s response to &lt;/em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;em&gt;report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk to Jeff Bezos: ‘you cannot sue your way to the Moon’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ThZhFqH38qPCftOp0eIwHCLtL2c=/36x0:2016x1320/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69923005/FAZxtkCVgAEXlov.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LtVatt"&gt;Elon Musk isn’t happy that fellow mega-billionaire Jeff Bezos keeps suing to stop SpaceX’s projects, and he shared a message for the Amazon founder during the 2021 Code Conference on Tuesday: “you cannot sue your way to the Moon, no matter how good your lawyers are.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DNScTE"&gt;Musk was responding to a question from journalist Kara Swisher about how Bezos’ space company, Blue Origin, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22623022/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-sue-nasa-lawsuit-hls-lunar-lander"&gt;recently sued to block a contract NASA gave SpaceX&lt;/a&gt; to develop a lunar lander. Amazon has also protested SpaceX’s Starlink internet satellites with the Federal Communications Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3r11gL"&gt;Swisher asked Musk Tuesday if he has spoken to Bezos about the legal fights. “Not verbally, just... subtweets,” Musk said. (In August, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22644158/elon-musk-jeff-bezos-spacex-blue-origin-lawsuits-complaints-starlink-tweet"&gt;Musk tweeted&lt;/a&gt;: “Turns out Besos [sic] retired in order to pursue a full-time job filing lawsuits against SpaceX …”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aUPdVe"&gt;Musk wasn’t all vinegar with regards to his billionaire space race cohort. When Swisher asked him about the suborbital flights that Bezos and Richard Branson recently took with their own companies, Musk said he “thought it was cool that they’re spending money on the advancement of space.” But, he was sure to point out, “suborbital is [just] a step in the direction of orbit.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now queue to purchase a PS5 at Sony (update: sold out) </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a6g9tj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 28th, 6:52PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Sony has sold out of the PS5 and PS5 Digital Edition for the day. We’ll make sure to let you know when the next opportunity comes up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CqiKZ8"&gt;Nearly a year after making its debut, the PlayStation 5 remains &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/23/22434905/ps5-restock-best-buy-walmart-sony-playstation-5"&gt;notoriously difficult to get your hands on&lt;/a&gt;. Sony has been one of the most reliable retailers when it comes to console restocks, however, and the company often opens its online queue for customers who don’t mind waiting for a chance to secure Sony’s next-gen console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7mhzE"&gt;If you want to have another go at it, Sony has reopened the queue for ordering the &lt;a href="https://direct-queue.playstation.com/?c=sonyied&amp;amp;e=aat3wy9opm&amp;amp;t=https%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%3Fqueueittoken%3De_e1i2kfmr0b~q_00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000~ts_1632868237~ce_true~rt_afterevent~h_ad66b65148bec73c74619b4bf995e2b334a2ff4656222de0a44aa932936d2210&amp;amp;cv=1051601735&amp;amp;cid=en-US"&gt;disc-based PS5&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://direct-queue.playstation.com/?c=sonyied&amp;amp;e=aat3wy9opm&amp;amp;t=https%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%3Fqueueittoken%3De_e1i2kfmr0b~q_00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000~ts_1632868247~ce_true~rt_afterevent~h_587606887c82228abc91e48cf2864541531c1c1ec4b17c9871fb1c15535d6a85&amp;amp;cv=1051601735&amp;amp;cid=en-US"&gt;PS5 Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt; via its direct store. You don’t have to refresh the landing page once you’ve arrived — just wait it out — but we do recommend that you keep your PlayStation Network account info at the ready, just in case you’re allocated a spot to buy one when the countdown finishes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix scoops up Oxenfree developer Night School</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Oxenfree" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CyK6kc7RcE31HHwg8XSrXQt0YVE=/106x0:1186x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69922839/Sreens_CYMK_House.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oxenfree.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WX5kXR"&gt;Netflix is continuing its push into video games with the acquisition of Night School Studio, the team best-known for 2016’s &lt;em&gt;Oxenfree &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20932270/afterparty-review-xbox-ps4-pc"&gt;2019’s &lt;em&gt;Afterparty&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Oxenfree&lt;/em&gt;, it should be noted, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/27/12297852/oxenfree-game-stranger-things-pc-ps4-xbox-one"&gt;had strong &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; vibes&lt;/a&gt; — and Night School also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18510849/stranger-things-secret-games-telltale-studio-closed"&gt;previously worked on a canceled &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; title&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HiRsCW"&gt;“Night School wants to stretch our narrative and design aspirations across distinctive, original games with heart,” &lt;a href="https://nightschoolstudio.com/joining-netflix/"&gt;Night School’s Sean Krankel said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “Netflix gives film, TV, and now game makers an unprecedented canvas to create and deliver excellent entertainment to millions of people. Our explorations in narrative gameplay and Netflix’s track record of supporting diverse storytellers was such a natural pairing. It felt like both teams came to this conclusion instinctively.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YC64xK"&gt;The studio says it will continue to work on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22382536/nintendo-indie-world-showcase-fez-oxenfree-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oxenfree II&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;as well as “cooking up new game worlds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nq5PUb"&gt;The acquisition is just the latest part of Netflix’s ongoing push into games. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577868/netflix-video-games-confirmed-mike-verdu-ea-oculus-facebook"&gt;the company hired Mike Verdu&lt;/a&gt;, formerly of EA and Oculus, to head up its gaming efforts, and it’s currently testing having games in its mobile app — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22689922/netflix-games-italy-spain-android-beta-mobile"&gt;just today, that test expanded to include Spain and Italy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SifBpe"&gt;“We’ll continue working with developers around the world and hiring the best talent in the industry to deliver a great collection of exclusive games designed for every kind of gamer and any level of play,” Verdu said as part of today’s announcement. “Like our shows and films, these games will all be included as part of your Netflix membership — all with no ads and no in-app purchases. Stay tuned for more.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk, live at the Code Conference</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9PXv2JIbYypjTkMELOSVwwSUqNM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69922752/acastro_191211_elon_decade_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Thus Sprach Technoking&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="BuwXrr"&gt;We’re at the &lt;a href="https://voxmediaevents.com/code2021"&gt;2021 Code Conference&lt;/a&gt; here in Beverly Hills, California — and very soon, Elon Musk will take the stage in an interview with Kara Swisher. As always with Musk, there will be more than enough to talk about. There’s the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22688377/tesla-steering-wheel-yoke-model-s-x-redesign"&gt;latest from Tesla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/26/22693610/tesla-opens-full-self-driving-beta-software-more-customers"&gt;self-driving&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/8/22615539/tesla-cybertruck-production-delayed-2022-elon-musk"&gt;where Cybertruck development is&lt;/a&gt;. Just today, we learned that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22698388/tesla-texas-lawsuit-cops-autopilot-crash-injury"&gt;Tesla is being sued by Texas cops&lt;/a&gt; after a Model X on autopilot slammed into five officers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I0F5ly"&gt;Then we’ve got &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675793/spacex-inspiration4-launch-first-all-civilian-private-crew"&gt;SpaceX&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22680152/spacex-inspiration4-first-private-crew-update-in-orbit"&gt;space tourism&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/18/22681185/spacex-ceo-elon-musk-starlink-internet-service-leaving-beta-october"&gt;satellite internet&lt;/a&gt;. Plus, we could talk about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/9/22427006/dogecoin-crashing-elon-musk-snl-host"&gt;Dogecoin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/25/21338456/tesla-elon-musk-twitter-memes-spacex"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and whether Musk is thinking much about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22463920/elon-musk-stock-price-tweets-sec"&gt;the Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt; these days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UBrIP1"&gt;Oh, and of course, we could revisit the topic of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/2/11837874/elon-musk-says-odds-living-in-simulation"&gt;whether we are still living in a simulation&lt;/a&gt; or if we can escape. (Hey, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22640826/matrix-4-trailer-resurrections-release-date"&gt;fourth &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt; movie is coming&lt;/a&gt;, so why not?) So yeah, there’s a lot that could happen. We’ll be live-blogging his interview with Swisher right here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IjKutR"&gt;&lt;div class="live-center-embed" data-src="https://livecenter.norkon.net/frame/voxmedia/17058/vox"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;(function(n){function c(t,i){n[e](h,function(n){var r,u;if(n&amp;&amp;(r=n[n.message?"message":"data"]+"",r&amp;&amp;r.substr&amp;&amp;r.substr(0,3)==="nc:")&amp;&amp;(u=r.split(":"),u[1]===i))switch(u[2]){case"h":t.style.height=u[3]+"px";return;case"scrolltotop":t.scrollIntoView();return}},!1)}for(var t,u,f,i,s,e=n.addEventListener?"addEventListener":"attachEvent",h=e==="attachEvent"?"onmessage":"message",o=n.document.querySelectorAll(".live-center-embed"),r=0;r&lt;o.length;r++)(t=o[r],t.getAttribute("data-rendered"))||(u=t.getAttribute("data-src"),u&amp;&amp;(t.setAttribute("data-rendered","true"),f=n.ncVizCounter||1e3,n.ncVizCounter=f+1,i=f+"",s="nc-frame-c-"+i,t.innerHTML='&lt;div style="position: relative; height: 300px; border: none;" id="'+s+'"&gt;&lt;iframe src="'+u+"?"+i+'" style="position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; fullscreen"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;',c(t.firstChild,i)))})(window);&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
