    <title>The Quest Store has a very good New Year’s sale going on</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QMINpm"&gt;The Quest Store is offering a lot of VR games and experiences at a discount for its New Year’s sale, which lasts until January 2nd, 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5EsneO"&gt;Some of my personal favorite titles like &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2F3235570703151406" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Job Simulator&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2F2190353671014400" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arizona Sunshine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2F3349689215139117" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gorn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have their prices slashed by up to 35 percent. &lt;em&gt;Job Simulator&lt;/em&gt; is a place where you can do your job as horribly as you want without any real consequences, while &lt;em&gt;Arizona Sunshine&lt;/em&gt; is a zombie shooter with a surprisingly decent story, and &lt;em&gt;Gorn &lt;/em&gt;lets you take your anger out gladiator style, complete with mace-swinging. I find all of them to be pretty therapeutic (although they aren’t the newest games to come out for the Quest).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gdkc5i"&gt;There are also a number of themed game bundles for sale, such as the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2F333983248234243%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Thrilling Adventures Pack&lt;/a&gt;, which includes &lt;em&gt;I Expect You to Die 2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;A Township Tale&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Stride&lt;/em&gt; at a sale price of $39.99 instead of $49.97. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2F2131467090352833%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The Challenge Yourself Pack&lt;/a&gt; also contains three games — &lt;em&gt;Pistol Whip&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Real VR Fishing&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;In Death: Unchained — &lt;/em&gt;at a discounted price of $59.99, compared to the original $75.97 price tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qgo9e7"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2F863449390989977%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Must-Play Friendly Challenges&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2F439172594588067%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Must-Play Party Games&lt;/a&gt; packs are both offered at a 19 percent discount. While the Must-Play Friendly Challenges bundle comes with &lt;em&gt;Clash of Chefs VR&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mini Motor Racing X &lt;/em&gt;for $27.99, the Must-Play Party Games bundle includes &lt;em&gt;Chess Club&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Skyword: Kingdom Brawl&lt;/em&gt; for $19.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SwUfj1"&gt;Purchasing a pack, especially when it’s at a discount, could come in handy if you’re in need of games for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;new Quest 2&lt;/a&gt;. If you happen to own one of the games in the bundle you’re purchasing, that price will automatically be docked from your total order, so you won’t be paying for the same game twice. You can also choose to gift a game to a friend by hitting “Buy for a Friend” and entering your recipient's email during checkout.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Xbox Series X is available at Best Buy right now (update: sold out) </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-0jTxER0HjVZKJoyM3eP737ZoP8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70323820/vpavic_201103_4275_0182.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jqdX7h"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 3:11PM ET, December 28th:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Best Buy has sold out of consoles for now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VMVPcx"&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox Series X keeps coming and going, but the next-gen console remains tricky to get a hold of. We &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/22/22823914/microsoft-xbox-series-x-console-restock-costco-availability"&gt;just saw it go up for sale at Costco&lt;/a&gt; this morning but it did not last long before it sold out. Now, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/28/22848656/ps5-holiday-restock-best-buy-playstation-5-console"&gt;after a PS5 drop earlier&lt;/a&gt;, another chance has sprung up at Best Buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EI1ZxG"&gt;Right now, you can queue up for the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cggdSQwET4b" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X from Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. The retailer is just selling the console — no bundle required — and it is open to anyone, including those who are not Best Buy Totaltech subscribers. Just click the “Add to Cart” button and be patient while you are put in a digital line. As of right now, Best Buy appears to be releasing stock in waves, meaning you may have a second opportunity even if the console appears to be sold out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="L3wZBm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Xbox Series X review: a next-gen PC","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"},{"title":"Xbox is letting more people test the very latest console features","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22812230/xbox-skip-ahead-alpha-testing-sign-up-open-microsoft"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="7YZCN6"&gt;Also, be ready for Best Buy’s site to ask you to verify your information and, if possible, make sure your account is logged in on another tab while you wait in line. Once you’ve added a console to your cart, you’ll be given about 10 minutes to complete your purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8NlDK"&gt;These consoles may need to be a late Christmas gift at this point, but, hopefully, you may have some good fortune with a local, in-store pickup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sDcWMo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10909049"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CqIeky"&gt;Xbox accessories and games to go with your console&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZDGCni"&gt;If you did manage to secure Microsoft’s next-gen console, there are a couple of accessories we recommend picking up alongside the Series X, whether you’re looking for a next-gen shooter, a wireless headset, or this year’s best racing title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fA0VBc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10654449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="G1YJIg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10907321"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="N2830a"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9532770"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="cIgT7V"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10718694"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Samsung resumes Android 12 rollout, updates some foldables, and more S21s</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gd7yU1LqUe5FJQiA6Fwdaj5RMYM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70324233/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0011.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WTDwyG"&gt;Samsung is starting to roll out its Android 12-based One UI 4 update again after the company paused &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22782772/samsung-one-ui-4-android-12-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-release-date-features"&gt;its original release&lt;/a&gt; due to reports of bugs and soft bricks from users, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-finally-resumes-one-ui-4-stable-rollout/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The update, which is hopefully a bit more stable, should soon be available for Galaxy S21 phones (including the S21 Plus and Ultra), along with the Galaxy Z Flip 3 and Z Fold 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="obk6Wo"&gt;One UI 4 includes a visual redesign based on Google’s Material You design &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"&gt;that debuted with Android 12&lt;/a&gt;. It also includes an updated keyboard. Despite &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22672780/samsung-android-12-beta-galaxy-s21"&gt;a public beta process&lt;/a&gt;, Samsung’s initial release in November &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-3-buggy-one-ui-4-update/"&gt;had some issues&lt;/a&gt;, and users said they were getting poor performance, saw some screen flicker, and experienced other bugs. Last week, the company &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_stops_one_ui_40_update_for_galaxy_s21_due_to_google_play_issues-news-52394.php"&gt;reportedly stopped rolling out the update&lt;/a&gt; to South Korean customers because of one particular issue with Google Play. Now, that rollout is back on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GWNby7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Android 12 has had a bit of a rocky rollout&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LdgJ8R"&gt;The Android 12 release has been rocky for other manufacturers too. OnePlus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828553/oneplus-buggy-oxygenos-android-12-update-9-pro"&gt;stopped distributing its OxygenOS 12 update&lt;/a&gt; for the 9 and 9 Pro after reports that it was riddled with bugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ycx80l"&gt;Even Google hasn’t been immune — the Pixel 6 &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/how-to-fix-google-pixel-6-connectivity-issues/"&gt;had some bugs to start with&lt;/a&gt;, and the update meant to fix them introduced new connectivity issues that Google is &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/12/23/pixel-6-connectivity-fix-testing/"&gt;reportedly still trying to solve.&lt;/a&gt; The OS is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22724322/android-12-official-launch-date-pixel-phones-samsung-oneplus-xiaomi"&gt;also available for older Pixels&lt;/a&gt;, such as the 3A, 4, and 5A. While &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/qf8mhf/android_12_issues_on_pixel_5/"&gt;some users have reported issues on those phones&lt;/a&gt;, they don’t seem to be as bad as those experienced by Samsung and OnePlus users. However, the December update for Android 12 &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/12/20/does-your-pixel-6-have-the-december-2021-update-yet-poll/"&gt;doesn’t seem to have rolled out to most people’s Pixels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Matter’s plan to save the smart home </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HH3xc4NgYaMz_QI9ezoQSF9g1nQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70268903/acastro_211117_4887_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Matter is a new standard that promises to fix smart home interoperability — but can it deliver?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="t5qLmO"&gt;The smart home should be a natural evolution of our homes, bringing better appliances, better systems, better experiences. But to date, it’s been complicated, confusing, and expensive. Walled gardens have stifled innovation as developers focus on getting their devices to work with three or four or more different platforms rather than spending their time creating better products and new features. Consumers spend too much energy figuring out which product works with which and then troubleshooting those connections, before often giving up on the whole thing. This has led to a slower smart home adoption than many expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jCtd7u"&gt;What the smart home needs, and has needed for a long time, is a universal connectivity standard — a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/19/21028256/smart-home-standard-google-apple-amazon-alexa-siri-zigbee-choip"&gt;basic level of common plumbing in our homes&lt;/a&gt; for everything to flow through. Just as we chose VHS over Betamax in the ’80s (and Blu-ray over HD-DVD in the early 2000s) for a better home theater experience,  so we need to choose a smart home standard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wyEbHC"&gt;
&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP4578799766&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EsEraa"&gt;The problem is there aren’t two or three standards to choose from. There are many, and none of them work very well on their own. Zigbee, Z-Wave, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth have all tried and failed to become the primary radio protocol of the smart home. But none have gained enough traction or offered enough flexibility to fit into all corners of the smart home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xn2P9z"&gt;That’s where Matter comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-M-Z-nOK7Q7nT95Yzp7aVixVZfU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23079856/acastro_4887_0004.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vtaYcE"&gt;Buy a gadget, plug it in, and it will work with the rest of your smart home. Set up that new device with your favorite smart home app, and control it with your voice assistant of choice, no matter who made it. This may sound like some distant smart home nirvana, but this is the promise of Matter. The simple smart home could be just around the corner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ow3RE"&gt;An open-sourced connectivity standard created by over 200 companies, Matter is a communication protocol that leverages existing technologies — Thread, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and ethernet — to allow all of your devices to communicate with each other locally, without the need for a cloud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="M2Fle3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Buy a gadget, plug it in, and it will work with the rest of your smart home&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qUilte"&gt;What makes Matter more than just another smart home standard is momentum; most of the industry is on board. Organized by the Connectivity Standards Alliance (or CSA, formerly the Zigbee Alliance), Matter is being developed by Amazon, Apple, Google / Nest, and Samsung, alongside many other smart home and smart home-adjacent companies, including Wyze, iRobot, Signify (Philips Hue), Ecobee, &lt;a href="https://buildwithmatter.com/"&gt;and more&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jVbU8O"&gt;Driven by a shared need to fix the problems of the smart home, these companies are working together to figure out how to make this standard be the one that sticks. Can Matter finally bring an end to the confusion perfectly encapsulated by Randall Munroe’s classic xkcd “&lt;a href="https://xkcd.com/927/"&gt;Standards&lt;/a&gt;” comic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yeplUXpmj1adDXyyVOg8H8OzwcQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084306/standards.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Comic by xkcd&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rNB9Yx"&gt;“This is a Renaissance [for the smart home]” says Tobin Richardson, president and CEO of the CSA. “Most of the industry, if not all the industry have agreed that [Matter] is going to be the way this will happen.” They are seemingly all on board with the fact that Matter is the solution to the smart home’s biggest problems — simplicity, interoperability, reliability, and security. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vhf5Ct"&gt;The final Matter specification, SDK, and certification program should be ready by mid-2022, and the goal is to have the first Matter-certified devices available by the end of 2022, says Richardson. That’s over a year later than promised when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/18/21027890/apple-google-amazon-smart-home-standard-zigbee-connected-ip-project"&gt;Matter first launched in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, but better late than never.&lt;/p&gt;

Otherwise, read on to learn about how Matter is going to fix the smart home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="zL4HCM"&gt;Matter is a unified connectivity technology for the smart home. It is not a smart home platform like Apple HomeKit, Google Home, and Amazon’s Alexa. Matter doesn’t automate or control your home; it simply provides the pipes and language for devices to communicate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ow3IDq"&gt;Its unique feature is it’s an IP-based technology, meaning it uses the same mechanisms to communicate as the internet. So, there is no dependency on bridges or hubs, and yes, you will (eventually) be able to get rid of all those white boxes hooked up to your modem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IGjgMI"&gt;To simplify adoption, Matter will start as an application layer on top of existing IP technologies, including ethernet, Wi-Fi, Thread, and Bluetooth (for device provisioning). This means Matter is not reinventing the wheel; it’s adding better technology to the highways our smart homes are driving on.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Matter network map shows how devices will connect to each other, to the internet, and to other protocols using Wi-Fi, Thread, and Matter controllers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="x5QDBu"&gt;Once in your home, Matter devices can operate entirely locally, talking to each other over Thread and Wi-Fi and not going through the cloud. That means if your internet goes down, your smart home will still work. Devices will still need to communicate with the internet for out-of-home control and firmware and security upgrades, which will happen directly or through a Matter controller device (i.e., a smart speaker, smartphone, or bridge). Local control is a significant step in maintaining privacy in the smart home, a big concern for people when considering installing smart home devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="wACI89"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Smart home company Eve plans to use Matter to move beyond Apple’s HomeKit ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22827727/eve-matter-thread-upgrade-smart-shades-release-date"},{"title":"Google commits to Matter, promises future interoperability between smart home platforms ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738584/google-smart-home-developer-summit-2021-matter-thread"},{"title":"Samsung promises Matter support for SmartThings hubs, Galaxy devices, TVs, and fridges ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22745664/samsung-smartthings-matter-support-products-galaxy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="eQBxti"&gt;Smart home company Eve built its entire business model on local control. “Our privacy platform is ‘what’s at home stays at home,’” Jerome Gackel, Eve Systems CEO, tells me. “With Matter, you do not need a cloud — you can have one, but it’s not a requirement.” Its commitment to avoiding cloud control is why Eve devices have been iPhone- and HomeKit-only thus far. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22827727/eve-matter-thread-upgrade-smart-shades-release-date"&gt;But with Matter, Eve can move to the other platforms while remaining entirely local&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="Z8145w"&gt;What is Thread, and why is it better?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="xzuPtx"&gt;Thread is one of the key technologies of Matter. It promises to make the smart home more robust. Like Z-Wave and Zigbee, Thread is a low-power mesh networking protocol. “Networking is one of the biggest problems of the smart home; sensors and devices dropping offline,” says Tony Fadell, founder of Nest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RYWAK"&gt;Thread and the precursor to Matter, Weave, was first developed in 2014 by Nest and six other companies, including Silicon Labs, ARM, Samsung Electronics, and Yale Security. Thread’s big selling points are speed and reliability. A motion sensor will turn your lights on in a millisecond compared to a second, and your network won’t go down because you accidentally unplugged the hub, as — with enough devices deployed — a Thread network can self-heal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1DXX7rddXUr9CI8ZEM-AOaIqdQc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23079855/acastro_4887_0003.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UidoTm"&gt;Unlike Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, Thread was specifically developed as a smart home protocol. Other protocols used in the smart home to date have been co-opted into that role, meaning they have practical and usability issues. Wi-Fi is too power-hungry for battery-powered devices. Bluetooth has range limitations. Zigbee and Z-Wave require dedicated hubs, which are cumbersome to set up and maintain and can be a single point of failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="rgpygN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Matter is not reinventing the wheel; it’s adding better technology to the highways our smart homes are driving on&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xOt5EO"&gt;Thread began in Nest’s earliest days. “Every single Nest thermostat since the beginning has shipped with a Zigbee radio inside, a connection for a long-distance, low-power protocol,” says Fadell. The idea was to future-proof a device likely to stay in the home for 10 to 20 years. “We wanted it to be able to talk to the future smart home,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="5W7LAL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10917556"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jGPb0G"&gt;But Zigbee wasn’t progressing fast enough for the Nest team, so they worked with Silicon Labs and others to develop Thread, which, in technical terms, is a Zigbee hardware stack with a software layer on top. “We knew what needed to happen — we needed a home IP-based mesh network with low-power range,” says Fadell. “The key is it’s IP native.” Low-power radios in the smart home have needed a hub or bridge to talk to the internet, but that problem went away by making Thread IP native. “That is what is so powerful about it,” says Fadell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bbCEvG"&gt;Eve was one of the first smart home companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22310378/eve-smart-home-thread-plug-home-kit-weather-station-price-specs-features"&gt;to adopt Thread&lt;/a&gt;, and today, it is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22827727/eve-matter-thread-upgrade-smart-shades-release-date"&gt;working toward&lt;/a&gt; running all of its relevant products on the protocol, having shifted over from Bluetooth. “Thread has really changed the reliability of our product, especially in terms of automation,” says Eve’s Gackel. “The difference between our Bluetooth product and Thread product experience has really increased customer satisfaction.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PzG3vv"&gt;Thread devices can be battery-powered or wall-powered, and the latter can be a Thread border router, a bridge between a Wi-Fi and Thread network. But a border router isn’t a typical white plastic box type of bridge that plugs into your router. The tech will be built into any device with an always-on power source and can be placed anywhere in your home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1HhyyS"&gt;A smart plug, smart speaker, fridge, TV, thermostat, and Wi-Fi access point can all be Thread border routers. “As you add more border routers in the home, you get better range and reliability,” explains Kevin Po, senior product manager at Google and a member of the CSA board. Case in point, the aesthetically pleasing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466594/nanoleaf-elements-light-panel-smart-home-price-release"&gt;Nanoleaf Shapes and Elements light panels are also Thread border routers&lt;/a&gt;, with a smidge more pizazz than a white plastic box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HPRjYl"&gt;A border router is like a mailman: it routes the different packets of information. Unlike a smart home hub, it doesn’t know what’s in those packets or control them. If a smart speaker wants to know the state of a lock, the border router can tell it without ever knowing the state itself. “From an end-to-end security perspective, that routing aspect provides a lot of benefits,” says Po.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7H15wWa4XdQiKA-u_uMYDtxrcm4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084334/Thread_home_network.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Thread Group&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This image illustrates how Thread border routers connect a thread network to the internet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H2UoA3"&gt;While Z-Wave and Zigbee will continue to be part of the smart home — existing hubs can be upgraded to Thread or bridged to Matter — it seems possible these technologies will be phased out in the residential setting. “It would certainly seem, if everything is executed as promised, that it will make sense to move towards Matter products,” says Mitch Klein, executive director of the Z-Wave Alliance. “That’s a big ‘if,’ however, and there are other questions in terms of security still.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FH0cQK"&gt;Because Matter devices can speak straight to the internet, that potentially exposes them to hacking or malware, says Klein. &lt;a href="https://zigbeealliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Matter-Security-Privacy_one-pager.pdf"&gt;Matter’s security approach&lt;/a&gt; is “strong, agile (to address the evolution of things like encryption types over time), and proactive, with a community of members who do threat modeling and mitigation,” says Richardson of the CSA. IP control is central to the function of Matter, and Richardson argues that the approach is one of resilient security while still getting the benefits of an IP-connected world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="NAK1hc"&gt;How will devices work in a Matter smart home?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="AOEu7g"&gt;The Matter home will need a Wi-Fi access point and a Matter controller. This can be a smartphone or tablet, but it can also be a Thread border router that works with your preferred smart home ecosystem — such as an Amazon Echo speaker, an Apple HomePod Mini, a Google Nest Hub, or a Samsung SmartThings hub. While devices will work across platforms, automations and routines will not. “If you are using HomeKit, you will need a HomeKit hub,” explains Gackel. “A Google hub will not run HomeKit automations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="18wsbx"&gt;A Matter home will be able to incorporate any smart home device that is Matter certified. (The Matter logo on a product will indicate that it’s compatible.) You will also be able to set up any Matter device with your controller app, similar to how Apple’s HomeKit works today. All this means that when you buy a new product — such as a lightbulb or door lock — if it has a Matter logo, you won’t need to worry about what it works with; it will just work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EzZFQeRI68rbbFLbOOvkuQFJUvo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23079854/acastro_4887_0002.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="omRzdU"&gt;It will also be simpler to set up. Amazon’s Frustration-Free setup is part of the Matter spec, explains Chris DeCenzo, principal software development engineer at Amazon Lab126, alongside Matter’s own set-up process. It’s designed to enable a “zero-touch” experience, where you take the device out of the box, plug it in, and it connects to your home automatically, says DeCenzo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IvYr8J"&gt;This doesn’t mean there won’t be manufacturer apps, just that you won’t have to use them for setup. Still, in some cases, you will need them to access device-specific features that aren’t available in Matter, and probably to update firmware, although this may happen through Matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="07kogK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Companies are committing to Matter, but some are still holding a few cards close to their chest.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ye0GAi"&gt;Despite the coming together of the big four smart home companies and the general excitement of the early Matter push, the reality is the smart home will still be a divided one. Matter may provide a basic standard of interoperability and portability, but companies will still seek competitive advantages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0hf077"&gt;For example, nothing in the Matter spec requires a Matter controller to support all device categories. If video doorbells become part of Matter in the future, Amazon could choose not to support doorbells in its controller. Amazon’s Ring doorbells already work in the Ring app and with its Echo devices, meaning the company may see no need to develop another doorbell camera controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="14a8Uc"&gt;There’s also nothing compelling companies to upgrade products that they don’t want to. Google has said it will update its newest Nest Smart Thermostat to Matter but has not said if any of the three generations of the Nest Learning Thermostat or the Thermostat E will follow suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9K51y"&gt;Amazon has released a slew of new smart home products in 2021, including a thermostat, air quality monitor, and smart switches, with not a mention of Matter compatibility. DeCenzo tells me this doesn’t mean it won’t come, but that’s not exactly a guarantee that it will. “It’s hard for a device maker to make any absolute statements about something they’re going to support that isn’t here today,” he says. “Matter was just an idea when these devices were being developed.”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RSoSVS"&gt;Apple has committed to Matter but hasn’t commented on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22824559/matter-tv-streaming-devices-smart-home-casting-protocol-support"&gt;whether it will adopt the Matter TV and Streaming Video player specification&lt;/a&gt; to allow Matter controllers to cast content from smartphones to televisions, similar to how AirPlay works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qvRGFc"&gt;On the one hand, companies are committing to Matter, but with the other hand they’re still holding some cards close to their chest. While it’s legitimately tricky to say how you will develop your products for a specification that hasn’t been finalized yet, these companies are all deeply involved in the process, so they are hardly flying blind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="9GBupl"&gt;How will companies differentiate themselves in Matter?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="1PALNF"&gt;Before Matter, compatibility was a huge selling point for devices. You bought a smart lock largely because it worked with your ecosystem of choice. With Matter, that reason should go away. Now, companies will need to innovate on top of the standard to create reasons for you to choose their devices over the competition. “What Matter does is change the game, so companies aren’t competing on connectivity and interoperability, and it’s just there,” says Michelle Mindala-Freeman, head of marketing at Connectivity Standards Alliance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zbAJeQ"&gt;This would appear to put the big four smart home platforms on an even playing field. If all devices talk to each other, you’re no longer locked into Google’s ecosystem because your preferred door lock only works with Google. While this would seem counter to Google, Amazon etc. selling more devices, what it does is make it easier for each company to innovate and move forward with their respective visions of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22719945/amazon-alexa-dave-limp-interview-ambient-computing-ring-eero-decoder"&gt;smart home&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KuEoO9"&gt;Ultimately, if the hardware is commoditized, the value becomes in the service layer your ecosystem of choice adds to your experience. Matter’s specifications are designed to be simple: that door lock will lock and unlock. “Above that, it’s up to the device makers, the platform companies and such to understand how to best innovate,” says Po.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZNHPu2ISjAQ9HIH0veWWCi2RLGo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23079853/acastro_4887_0005.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HQGuK0"&gt;If you want more advanced features — such as adaptive lighting or touch-to-unlock — you will go to a platform or manufacturer that supports those. “It will make for a more competitive environment,” says Kevin Kraus, of Yale Residential, part of Assa Abloy. “If you want a fully-featured door lock, you’re likely to buy a Yale lock. But let’s say you’ve got a shed, and you just need something that locks and unlocks, then you might go for something less sophisticated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GQDR3K"&gt;Matter should push manufacturers to innovate, too. “We need to focus more on the added value of our products,” said Florian Deleuil of Netatmo in &lt;a href="https://matter-smarthome.de/en/interview-en/matter-is-pretty-changing-the-game/"&gt;a recent interview&lt;/a&gt;. “Otherwise, it could end up being difficult to distinguish our product from that of cheaper and less innovative suppliers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LzVx9B"&gt;While it will be more competitive, the thinking is that the market will be much larger. Matter will help the smart home go from niche to mass. “If this is successful, everyone sells more,” says Z-Wave’s Klein. “Market penetration increases, the stagnation of the smart home in terms of growth is going to increase, and new product categories will open up.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UNKvkw"&gt;Today, you might choose a washing machine because it has an excellent design, a special cycle for athletic wear, and offers good energy and water efficiency. You don’t choose it because it works with Alexa or syncs with your fridge. Going forward, that’s probably how you’ll choose your next smart device. “Both industrial design, the overall physical user experience, and the feature sets that they virtually interact with will drive purchase decisions, not just who it works with,” says Klein. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1bs8hP"&gt;Matter will also provide wider choice. Today, you may be limited to devices that work with the platform you have set up. With Matter, that restriction should go away. The smart home future — where all devices communicate with each other to help your home run more efficiently, intelligently, and seamlessly — will finally emerge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rj5xICvNyLceaIMRUUBHTfPr1fE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084331/matter_lkup_rgb_night.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="bNpJsc"&gt;But will it Matter?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="IdBNMP"&gt;In all of the interviews I did for this article, no one had anything negative to say about Matter (on the record). Right now, the industry is aligned on drinking the same Kool-Aid. But Matter is still an idea — albeit one with an unprecedented industry coalition behind it that makes it the most promising development in the smart home since Alexa arrived on the scene. It’s easy to love an idea; it can be harder to implement and stick to one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EBsr0h"&gt;Matter’s biggest roadblock is that it’s not here yet, and whether it will arrive as promised is still a large question mark. This is holding some companies back from committing to it or developing products for it today. “We totally believe in the vision and in all the benefits that will come from having a single protocol,” says Amazon’s DeCenzo. “But at the end of the day, we’ve got to get there. And that’s going to be a journey.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="Rns5ld"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Is Apple going to go out of its way to make sure Amazon’s products work well with its platform? &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nt3pay"&gt;Fadell, who is as excited about the validation of his Thread gamble as a kid at Christmas, is also slightly skeptical. He worries that proprietary moves by companies looking to differentiate products could harm Matter’s overall promise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="niOU16"&gt;“Everything can talk to everything in Matter, but that doesn’t mean the experiences will be the same. I can speak French, but am I really French? No,” says Fadell. “It’s the same thing here. If you’re in the Apple ecosystem, sure you may work with other systems in certain ways — but inside Apple, with all the Apple tools, it will be a better experience, and it’s going to stay that way.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6x0NJ9"&gt;Yes, you will be able to use an Apple speaker to control an Amazon device, but is Apple going to go out of its way to make sure Amazon’s products work &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt; with its platform? “Unlikely,” says Fadell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZP75wL"&gt;Ultimately, Matter isn’t the solution we — as consumers — have been waiting for. On day one, it’s not going to produce the ambient, self-aware smart home that can respond to your every need without a lick of set-up on our part. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FQcQSu"&gt;What it is is the solution smart home developers need so that they can start building products and services for that smart home we’re waiting for. “If Matter only changes a couple of things, we will still have a fundamental new technology that works,” says Fadell. “And if it’s adopted — well, let’s see what happens then.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="xR0aPU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uCXfRy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated Tuesday, December 14, 10:55AM: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clarified what Matter-ready devices are -- those products manufacturers have said will be updated to Matter as soon as the specification is released.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z3v7Xn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated Wednesday, December 15, 5:35PM: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Included the names of the other companies involved in the initial development of Thread.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MRdYCu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction Tuesday, December 28, 2:35PM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;: A previous version of this article stated Amazon’s Frustration Free Setup process was the basis for the Matter setup process. While it is part of the Matter spec, it is one option a developer can choose to use. We regret the error.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to activate and use Google Chat</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2RAjBG6BUaHLxhWcMClP6Ky3fw0=/259x0:2158x1266/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69463132/Screen_Shot_2021_06_14_at_9.27.20_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Kznv7R"&gt;Real-time collaborative chat, as exemplified by apps such as Slack, has become a common way to communicate between colleagues and friends, especially since last year when so many of us transitioned to working from home. Google has apparently taken note of this and is pitting itself against Slack by taking two of the features from its corporate Workplace app suite — chat and spaces (previously called rooms) — and integrating them into its standard Gmail app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8I4aj7"&gt;Google Chat allows you to hold chat sessions with friends and groups of friends either on an informal or formal basis. The former can be done just between two people or between several in what Google calls a group conversation. The latter is done via a separate area that Google currently calls a Space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tJR9xO"&gt;What’s the difference? &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/chat/answer/7659784?hl=en"&gt;According to Google&lt;/a&gt;, chat is simply a way for two or more people to chat together without any formalities — for example, if you wanted to quickly talk about where you were going to meet for lunch, you’d create a group conversation among your friends. Once the conversation is done, it’s done, and it will be deleted after five days (if you’re using a personal rather than a Workspace account).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gliRcM"&gt;A space, on the other hand, is for more long-term conversations. Each space has its own name, remains available for people to leave and rejoin, will send out notifications, and can share files. It’s for work projects, party planning, or any other activity where you want to keep the conversation going over the course of days, weeks, or longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vkUrX7"&gt;If this sounds useful to you, then the first thing you need to do is activate Google Chat for your Gmail account. Currently, at least, you need to do it separately on your browser and on your mobile device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gQ7jOG"&gt;Activate Chat on a mobile app&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="zVHWsU"&gt;Tap the three-line icon at the top-left corner. Scroll down and select “Settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="s2RMES"&gt;Select your account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Mmujm6"&gt;Scroll down to “General” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lAJF5L"&gt;If you’re using an Android phone, check off “Show the chat and spaces tabs.” If you’re using an iPhone or iPad, toggle “Show the chat and spaces tab” on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="wJUlit"&gt;On the bottom of the screen, instead of just Mail and Meet icons, you’ll now also have Chat and Spaces icons. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Azi11N"&gt;Activate Chat on a browser&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="oWenT2"&gt;Go to your Gmail account and go to settings (the gear icon in the upper-right corner)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qBQYol"&gt;Select “See all settings”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Ade7aX"&gt;In the top menu, select “Chat and Meet”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rXItCy"&gt;You have the choice of selecting “Google Chat,” “Classic Hangouts,” and “Off.” Assuming you want to try Chat, click on that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="d0w0Fg"&gt;Usually, Chat will appear on the left side of your Gmail screen, but you can choose to have it appear on the right side instead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="D1ZOT9"&gt;By the way, “Chat and Meet” lets you hide the Meet section in Gmail if you want to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rNj6gp"&gt;Click on “Save Changes”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="On your browser, go into Settings and look for the “Chat and Meet” section." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PeCCdgUaTrDcfHylJPNrc0bJXnk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23130226/Screen_Shot_2021_12_28_at_9.56.47_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On your browser, go into Settings and look for the “Chat and Meet” section.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kKO0Wf"&gt;Instead of the Meet and Hangouts boxes that used to be on the left-hand side of your Gmail screen, you’ll now have a Chat box, a Spaces box, and a Meet box. Any contacts with whom you previously had chats with via Hangouts will appear in the new Chat box; click on their names, and a small pop-up window in the lower left will show you those previous chats. (Note that if you blocked anyone in Hangouts previously, that blocking isn’t going to carry over to Chat.) And note the button on the right of the search box that lets you choose to be active, away, or undisturbed; you can also type in your own status.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A box on the upper right lets you set your chat status." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oFsecI-vkCJf5O6ua2CJ0_U9Ois=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23130237/Screen_Shot_2021_12_28_at_11.32.49_AM.png"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qhM2oJ"&gt;Begin a chat on the web&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="NESiN8"&gt;To start a new Chat, click on the plus sign in the corners of the Chat or Spaces boxes. You’ll get a drop-down menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="f6dwYH"&gt;If you want to just chat with a single person, type their name into the top field, and you will be taken into a small pop-up chat box. (You can maximize it if you want.) If you want to chat with more than one person, then select “Group conversation.” You’ll then be able to list the people you want to chat with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qHKk4Z"&gt;The same menu also lets you start a space (more on that later), browse existing spaces, or search for message requests (in other words, search for previous requests for chats from other people).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Eh7Dld"&gt;Begin a chat on a mobile app&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="CPJqO8"&gt;Tap on the Chat icon and then on the small “New chat” popup in the lower-right corner &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="693sJQ"&gt;You can type in the name of a person here (there will be a list of your frequent contacts below the links), or you can create a space or browse existing spaces. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CtshOl"&gt;If you want to create a group conversation (in other words, have a chat with several people), first type in the name of the first person you want to chat with (or choose their name from the drop-down list), then tap on the group icon that will appear in the same field you’re typing in, and add any other names.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U4jayJ"&gt;People who are invited to your chat will get an email with a link, and will have the option of joining the conversation or blocking it; if they are on Hangouts or Chat, they will get a notification. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GuXN46"&gt;Whether you’re using the web or a mobile app, to add a new message, type into the field at the bottom of the screen. A series of icons (where they’re located depends on whether you’re using the mobile or web app) lets you add emoji or a photo, start an audio or video meeting (essentially, starting Google Meet), and schedule an event, among others. On the mobile app, if tap the plus sign to the left of the bottom field, you are given a number of things you can add to your chat message, including a GIF, a calendar invite, or a Google Drive file; on the web app, most of these are available on the right side of the field.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Once you expand your web chat, you can also add a number of features to it." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6ZuO3OvLK-G6HJpESNlbgkOmeGY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23130461/Screen_Shot_2021_12_28_at_1.31.42_PM.png"&gt;

&lt;h2 id="pT3Cfi"&gt;Create a Space&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="LfBO79"&gt;On the web, go to the Chat box or the Space box on the left of Gmail and click on the plus sign. In the mobile app, tap on the Spaces icon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6KXG1E"&gt;Select “Create space.”&lt;/li&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When you create a space, you name it and add participants.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="KnBLiM"&gt;Create a space name and add the people you want to include. (If they’re not on your contact list, you can just type in their email address.) Click “Create.” You’ll be taken into the new space. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0rvt04"&gt;The people who are invited will get an email with a link. When they click on the link, they will be shown the new space and given the opportunity to either join it or block it. (If they haven’t joined Chat yet, they will get notifications from Hangouts.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YhA8oH"&gt;To add a new message, type into the field at the bottom of the screen. Like Chat, a series of icons on the right of the field (on the web) or via the plus sign (on mobile) lets you add emoji, upload a file, add a file from Google Drive, start an audio or video meeting (which is essentially starting Google Meet), and schedule an event. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A space can include images, emoji, and tasks — but it’s not as temporary as a chat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oWymr0"&gt;A couple of notes about spaces: if you’ve created a space using a personal account (as opposed to a business account), anyone in the space can change its name. There are a few other rules as to the use of spaces that can be found on a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/chat/answer/7659784?hl=en"&gt;Google support page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dVj6Q4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this story stated that “You can even have rooms within rooms.” That is not an available feature, and the line has been deleted. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aniMAt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 28th, 2021, 1:50PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on June 21st, 2021 and has been updated to reflect Google’s switch from the term “Rooms” to “Spaces,” along with a few other minor changes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bEOx11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lAnjOi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>China complains to UN after maneuvering its space station away from SpaceX Starlink satellites</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="CHINA-SHENZHOU-12-ASTRONAUTS-EXTRAVEHICULAR ACTIVITIES-SECOND TIME-COMPLETION (CN)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NcgL9n_QYIoh7Cs9C9FZuE-e7qI=/31x0:2868x1891/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70324000/1234786226.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chinese astronauts Nie Haisheng and Liu Boming waving their hands during a spacewalk out of the space station core module Tianhe in August of 2021&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Tian Dingyu/Xinhua via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uFlJIr"&gt;China &lt;a href="https://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/oosadoc/data/documents/2021/aac.105/aac.1051262_0.html"&gt;filed a complaint this month with the United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, arguing that it had to conduct evasive maneuvers of its space station to avoid potential collisions with two of SpaceX’s internet-beaming Starlink satellites. The country is requesting that the UN’s Secretary General remind countries of their obligations under international space law, though China did not specify exactly what actions it wants to be taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X5cmFb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.unoosa.org/res/oosadoc/data/documents/2021/aac_105/aac_1051262_0_html/AAC105_1262E.pdf"&gt;In the complaint&lt;/a&gt;, dated December 6th, China details two instances on July 1st, 2020 and  on October 21st, 2021 when the nation had to maneuver the core module of its space station, called Tianhe, out of the way of two separate Starlink satellites. The three Chinese astronauts currently living on Tianhe had just arrived to the station several days before the October maneuver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="T6652Q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;China did not specify exactly what actions it wants to be taken&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qAiquW"&gt;China cited its responsibility to report the incidents to the UN due to its obligations under &lt;a href="https://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/ourwork/spacelaw/treaties/introouterspacetreaty.html"&gt;the Outer Space Treaty&lt;/a&gt;, an international agreement ratified in the 1960s that governs how countries should explore space. The Treaty offers up a set of loose guidelines and rules for countries to follow when launching spacecraft and people to space, such as prohibiting the placement of nuclear weapons in orbit and making the exploration of space a peaceful enterprise. The treaty also notes that participating countries are responsible under international law for all of the actions they take in space, including those by their commercial companies. And China apparently wants everyone reminded of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JexO5l"&gt;The complaint reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="E78vmu"&gt;China wishes to request the Secretary-General of the United Nations to circulate the above-mentioned information to all States parties to the Outer Space Treaty and bring to their attention that, in accordance with article VI of the Treaty, “States Parties to the Treaty shall bear international responsibility for national activities in outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, whether such activities are carried on by governmental agencies or by non-governmental entities...”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="yZKLH4"&gt;Starlink is SpaceX’s ambitious internet-from-space initiative, which calls for launching nearly 12,000 satellites into low Earth orbit in order to beam broadband internet coverage to the ground below. So far, the company has launched more than 1,900 Starlink satellites, with nearly 1,800 still in orbit, &lt;a href="https://planet4589.org/space/stats/star/starstats.html"&gt;according to satellite tracking&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sJJAZI"&gt;As SpaceX continues to launch large crops of Starlink satellites into orbit, space trackers have raised &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKKIAsQ-cww"&gt;concerns about how the spacecraft could make Earth orbit more crowded&lt;/a&gt; and raise the likelihood of collisions with satellites already in space. In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/3/20847243/spacex-starlink-satellite-european-space-agency-aeolus-conjunction-space-debris"&gt;there have already been&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22374262/oneweb-spacex-satellites-dodged-potential-collision-orbit-space-force"&gt;a couple of reports&lt;/a&gt; of satellites having to move out of the way of Starlink vehicles to avoid collisions. SpaceX claims that its Starlink satellites have their own autonomous collision avoidance software, which allows them to move out of the way on their own if the satellites suspect they may come close to another vehicle or piece of debris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="wlg6s1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This isn’t the first time that a space station has had to maneuver out of the way of a satellite&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xADCi4"&gt;China says that its two avoidance maneuvers with Tianhe came after two Starlink satellites changed their altitudes in space. The first one in 2020 came after a Starlink satellite moved from its long-held orbit at 555 kilometers down to 382 kilometers. China claims the second Starlink satellite that caused trouble was “continuously maneuvering,” making it hard to know where it was headed. As a precaution in consideration of the astronauts on board, China opted to do a maneuver to avoid a collision. SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8uXX5d"&gt;This isn’t the first time that a space station has had to maneuver out of the way of a satellite or piece of debris. The International Space Station is consistently boosting its orbiting to avoid potential collisions with objects in space. In November, the astronauts on board the ISS had to shelter in place after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22782946/russia-asat-test-satellite-international-space-station-debris"&gt;Russia destroyed one of its own satellites in a nearby orbit&lt;/a&gt;, a show of strength known as an anti-satellite, or ASAT test. The test created thousands of pieces of debris that initially threatened the space station — and may continue to pose a threat to the ISS for years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ifk2Hl"&gt;China is also responsible for some of the International Space Station’s collision avoidance maneuvers. In 2007, China destroyed one of its own satellites during an ASAT test, creating thousands of pieces of debris. Many of those pieces are still in orbit, and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/10/science/china-debris-space-station.html"&gt;the ISS has periodically had to move out of the way&lt;/a&gt; to avoid these leftovers over the last decade. Now with its own space station in orbit, China is getting a taste of what that experience is like.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reopens some NYC stores to ‘limited’ walk-in services</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Daily Life in New York City Around The One-year Anniversary of The COVID-19 Shut Down" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DtEwK0yns5G9a3pC5n7lXBrqSlU=/0x0:5017x3345/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70321421/1306792576.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bax011"&gt;As initially reported by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1475577591268446214"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s&lt;/em&gt; Mark Gurman&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-27/apple-closes-new-york-city-stores-to-shoppers-after-covid-spike"&gt;all of New York City’s Apple Stores&lt;/a&gt; joined the list of locations closing their doors to most customers amid a spike in the number of COVID-19 infections. Gurman &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1475878857500606468"&gt;tweeted again&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, noting the stores have updated their listings, saying they are available for “limited” walk-in services for shopping and Genius Bar tech support.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Services at Apple Upper West Side" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r5zjvcRXI95h7RUKpwxu6Z0VVs8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23128905/apple_services_nyc.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Services at Apple Upper West Side&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DQ5AT4"&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/22/22850946/apple-store-covid-two-hour-free-shipping-option"&gt;Apple closed seven stores in North America&lt;/a&gt; in a single day as positive tests among employees rose, and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/27/20-apple-stores-closed-in-us-today/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; points out that even before this announcement, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/storelist/"&gt;the Apple website listed&lt;/a&gt; more than 20 locations that were closed today due to the effects of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nu30nI"&gt;For people in New York City, the stores were still accessible if you have an appointment to pick up an online order. Apple is no longer offering the free two-hour delivery option it pushed ahead of last week’s holiday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mcphrN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 28th, 1:40PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to note NYC Apple Stores are allowing limited numbers of customers inside for shopping and Genius Bar services.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tumblr goes overboard censoring tags on iOS to comply with Apple’s guidelines</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GKAnq5xJTJ7g8S8GOddg5Yp0qAw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70323955/acastro_191203_177_tumblr_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="http://instagram.com/alexcas.io" target="_blank"&gt;Alex Castro&lt;/a&gt; / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oQUWIs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://wip.tumblr.com/post/671184848292118528/an-update-on-the-tumblr-ios-app"&gt;An update to Tumblr’s iOS app&lt;/a&gt; censors a long list of tags to comply with Apple’s &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#safety"&gt;strict safety guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. The platform explains that it’s changing iOS users’ ability to access sensitive content, affecting their experience when it comes to searching for content, scrolling through the “Stuff for You” and “Following” sections of the dashboard, and could even prevent access to blogs that are flagged. Tumblr says it has to “extend the definition of what sensitive content is” to “remain available within Apple’s App Store,” and it seems that Tumblr stretched it pretty far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0tcci7"&gt;Tags are what make posts searchable on Tumblr; posts with censored tags won’t appear on a users’ dashboard, nor will they show up on the platform’s search page. A Twitter thread brought attention to some of the absurd tags that ended up getting filtered out on iOS, including the tag “submission.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UAQwdx"&gt;The interesting part, though, is that Tumblr applies that tag automatically when a post is submitted and then published to a blog on the platform. Users on iOS who receive a submission to their blog won’t even be able to view it since the “submission” tag is already added, as shown &lt;a href="https://hellbabyfromhell.tumblr.com/post/671605726003773440/submission-is-banned-too"&gt;in a post by one Tumblr user&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NOSbIC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;but the other thing is TUMBLR WILL AUTOMATICALLY ADD THAT TAG FOR YOU&lt;/p&gt;— foone (@Foone) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Foone/status/1474985625140940802?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LhMdqQ"&gt;Another Tumblr user, aptly named “bannedtags,” has been keeping track of all the blocked tags in a &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YG7E84Dvs2PyoKMgSgZFgEX0Kh0RtJqsazZsyVGY8dk/edit"&gt;Google Doc&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://bannedtags.tumblr.com/post/671610234653048832/a-growing-list-of-banned-tags"&gt;user notes&lt;/a&gt; that most of these tags have been banned on iOS —not on all devices — and that the listed tags are subject to change. Some banned tags are blatantly related to sexual, violent, or harmful content, but others don’t seem to belong on the list, and may actually do more harm than good by staying on it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wJrvbx"&gt;For example, “girl,” “sad,” and oddly enough, “Alec Lightwood,” an actor from the show &lt;em&gt;Shadowhunters&lt;/em&gt;, has been banned (because even Tumblr can’t handle those eyes). “Single dad,” “single mom,” “single parent,” “suicide prevention,” and “testicular cancer” are also on the list, potentially harming those who want to seek support in any of these areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LuPVKP"&gt;To make things even weirder, Tumblr blacklisted some tags that basically function as unspoken social cues on the site. “Me” and “my face” are blocked, both of which are tags that bloggers use to label their selfies (oh, and did I forget to mention that “selfie” is banned, too?). The platform appears to have blocked “queue” as well, a tag that’s typically applied to posts that were placed in a queue and serves as a signal to followers that they may not be online at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="G996J6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We understand that these adjustments will impact how users are able to access potentially sensitive content”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pjKRHP"&gt;Tumblr started having issues with Apple in 2018 when its app was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/17/18100156/tumblr-apple-app-store-ios-missing"&gt;unexpectedly removed from the App Store&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/20/18104366/tumblr-ios-app-child-pornography-removed-from-app-store"&gt;child pornography was found on the platform&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/3/18123752/tumblr-adult-content-porn-ban-date-explicit-changes-why-safe-mode"&gt;Tumblr banned adult content&lt;/a&gt; altogether, a major shift from the platform's previously laissez-faire policies on NSFW posts. When Tumblr first implemented the change, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/3/18124461/tumblr-adult-content-porn-ban-flagging-errors-algorithm-fail"&gt;innocent posts were frequently flagged for explicit content&lt;/a&gt;, and it seems like we’re seeing history repeat itself, but in a different way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MubylY"&gt;Tumblr says it’s working on “additional features for a less restricted iOS app experience,” but there’s no information on when or how this will be implemented. Users on Android or on the browser-based version of the site remain unaffected by this change. It remains unclear why Tumblr banned so many tags or if Apple was involved in any way. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to Apple with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Family Hub smart fridge gets a colorful new look</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/djAz__zFIRocQs08BKJSwabcTTw=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70323927/Bespoke_Kitchen_White.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s Family Hub smart fridge will now be part of its colorful, customizable Bespoke line.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d02BHq"&gt;The smart fridge has long been the butt of many IoT-related memes, but Samsung is betting that maybe all smart fridges needed to nab a spot in your kitchen was a more colorful look. The company will show off its newest iteration of the smart fridge at CES 2022 next week, and while it still can’t reliably determine what food you need and automatically order it so you don’t even have to think about shopping, it &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be a pretty shade of blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5qXFZ6"&gt;The Samsung Family Hub fridge is now a part of Samsung’s Bespoke appliance line. First introduced in 2021, the Bespoke range is a selection of modular, configurable appliances with a clean, modern look and customizable colors and finishes. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iuHiyn09zS3C7lVf893GbSwT9_c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23130240/CES2021_FamilyHub_RF9000.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Family Hub fridge is getting an upgrade to Samsung’s Bespoke line.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="om8q57"&gt;The idea behind Bespoke is to allow households to create personalized decor for their kitchens and laundry rooms. The line includes refrigerators, ranges, dishwashers, microwaves, vacuums, washers and dryers in a choice of customized colors that can be mixed and matched. The fridge will have 12 color choices, including yellow, blue, pink, white, green, gray, and orange; two finishes, glass or metallic; and three styles, four-door flex and three- or four-door French door models, which come in full or counter depth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n8Amxv"&gt;While the new style and color options are the main attraction, this iteration of the Family Hub does have a few new, tech-focused features. These include an updated, bezel-less design for the signature 21.5-inch touchscreen, which allows the tablet-interface to blend into the glass panel of the fridge, support for Samsung TV Plus in addition to the ability to mirror a Samsung TV on the tablet, and upgraded internal camera technology that can scan food labels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/79KG0pY6l4dQ_uu7f2W2VBXp3_k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23130176/Bespoke_French_Door_Refrigerator.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jazz up your smart fridge in combination of 12 colors and two finishes. Glass finishes are available in sunrise yellow, clementine, morning blue, pink, charcoal, gray, and white glass. Metallic options are emerald green, navy, matte black, tuscan, and regular old stainless steel. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ESwkQG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22745664/samsung-smartthings-matter-support-products-galaxy"&gt;As previously announced&lt;/a&gt;, the new Family Hub fridge will have Samsung’s SmartThings Hub software built in. The smart home platform allows you to connect and control smart home devices such as thermostats, door locks, and cameras right from the fridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7CnWv7"&gt;The SmartThings Hub software is not a replacement for SmartThings Hub hardware, which allows connections to Z-Wave and Zigbee devices. So, you will still need a separate physical hub to control those devices if they are part of your smart home setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Skhlw2"&gt;Samsung made no mention of Matter support for the smart fridge, although the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22787729/matter-smart-home-standard-apple-amazon-google"&gt;new smart home interoperability protocol&lt;/a&gt; that the company helped found is not due to launch until mid-2022. Samsung spokesperson Liv Ren told me there will be more details on software enhancements for the Family Hub closer to the availability of the product in the US, which is slated for the first half of 2022. There are no details on pricing yet, either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0TukkF"&gt;The Family Hub did receive a number of software updates this past year that added to existing features — which include widgets for calendars, sticky notes, shopping, and To Do lists. The most notable was the addition of Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant, meaning the fridge can now be a giant Echo speaker — playing music and controlling devices with voice commands. Alexa sits alongside Samsung’s Bixby — giving you a choice of virtual assistants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nU1ibiqVguzDSgb02NFPEyeIcJM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23130182/CES2021_SmartThings_Cooking_UI_2.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The SmartThings Cooking app lets you input food preferences and can curate recipes and meal plans.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KQCnvNOE6rWwp02hAeW4asfFEC4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23130179/CES2021_SmartThings_Cooking_UI_1.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SmartThings Cooking is an AI-powered cooking app available on the Family Hub Fridge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AY1OGt"&gt;While primarily a tablet slapped on the side of a fridge, the Family Hub does have some AI capabilities that take advantage of its placement. The three, built-in cameras can analyze the contents of your fridge (as long as the cameras can see the items) and offer up recipe and meal plan suggestions based on what ingredients you have. This uses the built-in SmartThings Cooking app, powered by the Whisk smart food platform owned by Samsung, which can also learn your food and dietary preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BzVYUi"&gt;Plus, with its somewhat limited knowledge of what’s in the fridge (it can only see items in the main compartment that aren’t hidden behind other things or stashed in Tupperware), the app can suggest missing ingredients for those recipes and automatically add them to your online grocery cart. SmartThings Cooking supports Walmart, Kroger, Instacart, and Amazon Fresh online shopping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8jPGl"&gt;Another updated feature is the ability to manage expiration dates: the fridge scans the food labels using the cameras and pops up an alert when your milk is about to go bad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pku3lB"&gt;These features are still limited in their functionality, but this type of intelligence in our appliances does feel like a solid step toward the smart kitchen of the future. And while slapping on some stylish pastel shades to broaden the appeal of technology in the kitchen doesn’t add much to the utility, clearly Samsung is hoping it will convince a few more people to add it to their homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D5dT6Y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PS5 is available right now at Best Buy  (update: sold out)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3oBv72pzt0a-f5cwvLmnKbIGN-w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70323706/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I9K7PJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 12:59PM ET, December 28th:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Best Buy has sold out of PS5s for now, but &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/28/22857179/microsoft-xbox-series-x-console-restock-availability-check"&gt;&lt;em&gt;it has started selling the Xbox Series X&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uC7IsM"&gt;If you’re currently shopping for a PlayStation 5 console and have been recently striking out with restocks at Walmart, Costco, and other retailers, you have another chance right now at Best Buy. The electronics retailer just opened up a fresh batch of &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgcljGhDR4o" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation 5 consoles for $499.99&lt;/a&gt;. Best Buy is only selling the disc-based version, however, not the Digital Edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M4DCfC"&gt;Be sure to log in and queue up on Best Buy’s site, with your billing and shipping info saved. Click the “Add to Cart” button on the right to jump into the waiting line, and stay calm. You don’t need to refresh the automated system, though, you may be prompted to verify your account when it’s your turn. After that, you should be able to see if there are any PS5 consoles available in your area. If you strike out, stay vigilant, the store tends to restock in waves so there may be more consoles in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1URumo"&gt;We are continuing to track restocks as they roll out at various retailers. Be sure to also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/newsletters" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;subscribe to the &lt;em&gt;Verge Deals&lt;/em&gt; newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for the latest tech and gadget savings we can find and deliver right to your inbox twice a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kRs6ae"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why the PS5 paywall may not pay off at Amazon, Walmart, or Best Buy ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22771984/ps5-restock-xbox-best-buy-walmart-amazon-subscription"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="xvWX9b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10384391"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="82lPGd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9563999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UAvH7w"&gt;We’re wishing you all of the luck in getting a PS5 today. As usual, signing into your account ahead of the restock, and making sure that all of the pertinent shipping and payment info, can only help your chances of success. But generally, once you’re in the queue for a console, just hang tight and maybe cross those fingers that you actually get a console today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MWcsCA"&gt;Some must-have PS5 accessories and games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1BKh8"&gt;Whether you end up getting a PlayStation 5 today or not, it might not be a bad idea to stock up on some essentials that you may want to have on Day One with your console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ryKE4I"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10687661"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="bRRjUn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10759065"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="n2h8io"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10905923"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
