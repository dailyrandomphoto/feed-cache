    <title>Canon put AI cameras in its Chinese offices that only let smiling workers inside</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wG13SMls2yqJWC2MhPD_lenFJMY=/0x0:3200x2133/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69465571/canon_smile_recognition.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Smile recognition” in action. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Canon Information Technologies&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mty2Mn"&gt;Tech company Canon has come up with a downright dystopic way to tackle the problem of workplace morale: it’s installed cameras with AI-enabled “smile recognition” technology in the offices of its Chinese subsidiary Canon Information Technology. The cameras only let smiling workers enter rooms or book meetings, ensuring that every employee is definitely, 100 percent happy all the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uwJMrO"&gt;This depressing tale was highlighted in a &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b74b6ad6-3b8d-4cd8-9dd6-3b49754aa1c7"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;The Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on how Chinese companies are surveilling employees to an unsettling degree with the help of AI and algorithms. Firms are monitoring which programs employees use on their computers to gauge their productivity; using CCTV cameras to measure how long they take on their lunch break; and even tracking their movements outside the office using mobile apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sQTm1W"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Technologies are increasing the pace for people who work with machines instead of the other way around”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7fTSoe"&gt;As the King’s College London academic Nick Srnicek told the &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt;: “Workers are not being replaced by algorithms and artificial intelligence. Instead, the management is being sort of augmented by these technologies [...] Technologies are increasing the pace for people who work with machines instead of the other way around, just like what happened during the industrial revolution in the 18th century.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gbilPP"&gt;Canon Information Technology actually announced its “smile recognition” cameras &lt;a href="https://www.sohu.com/a/426044486_162522"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt; as part of a suite of workplace management tools, but the technology doesn’t seem to have gotten much attention. Indeed, the fact it passed under the radar is a good illustration of just how common surveillance tools like this are becoming — and not just in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PbouYm"&gt;Although readers in the West sometimes have a tendency to dismiss the sort of surveillance described by the &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt; as a foreign phenomena, countries like the US and UK are just as culpable. Amazon is perhaps the prime example of this dynamic: it’s known for squeezing every ounce of effort from its warehouse workers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22463132/amazon-injury-rate-warehouses-osha-data-report"&gt;at the expense of their health&lt;/a&gt;, and even ranking their productivity using algorithms before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/25/18516004/amazon-warehouse-fulfillment-centers-productivity-firing-terminations"&gt;firing those at the bottom of the scale&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WcmGaL"&gt;Such modern-day Taylorism is not restricted to blue collar jobs, either: many modern software suites like Microsoft 365 come with &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/nov/26/microsoft-productivity-score-feature-criticised-workplace-surveillance"&gt;built-in surveillance tools&lt;/a&gt;. And with more people working from home because of the pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/more-bosses-are-using-software-to-monitor-remote-workers-not-everyone-is-happy-about-it/"&gt;more companies are deploying these features&lt;/a&gt; for fear of losing control over their workers. (Or, for a slightly more cynical read: they’ve always &lt;em&gt;wanted&lt;/em&gt; to use these tools and the pandemic provides a handy pretext.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0HZOxK"&gt;In other words: AI-enabled smile recognition cameras are in many ways the least dangerous types of surveillance technology. They have the benefit of being obvious. Other systems of control are much more subtle, and probably coming to an office near you sometime soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zens’ latest battery pack can create a wireless charging sandwich</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EieTrvi6Scv6mcLzwY2EsS3iv_k=/0x0:1467x978/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69465331/press_release_powerbanks_1536x864.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The battery pack can wirelessly charge two devices at once.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Zens&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="toclEy"&gt;Zens’ new battery pack has a wireless charger on both sides, allowing you to charge two Qi-compatible devices simultaneously in what can only be described as a “charging sandwich.” The &lt;a href="https://makezens.com/shop/magnetic-dual-powerbank"&gt;Dual Powerbank&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href="https://makezens.com/blog/blog/experience-the-convenience-of-on-the-go-wireless-charging/"&gt;announced alongside&lt;/a&gt; a trio of other battery packs including the &lt;a href="https://makezens.com/shop/magnetic-single-powerbank/"&gt;Magnetic Single Powerbank&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://makezens.com/shop/magnetic-single-powerbank-with-stand"&gt;Single Powerbank with Stand&lt;/a&gt; (which can itself be wirelessly charged, as well as wirelessly charge other devices), and the &lt;a href="https://makezens.com/shop/magnetic-single-powerbank-stand-10000mah/"&gt;10,000 mAh Powerbank with Stand&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sXxnvy"&gt;Although you could theoretically use it to charge two Qi-compatible phones, the intended use case appears to be charging an iPhone along with an accessory like a pair of AirPods. That’s because one side of the battery pack includes a MagSafe connection, which should keep it centered on iPhone 12 devices featuring the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/10/14/21515490/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-accessories-ecosystem"&gt;embedded magnets&lt;/a&gt;. However, the accessory isn’t capable of fast charging at MagSafe’s 15W maximum, instead it’s limited to 7.5W when charging an iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ROzAL6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;With a capacity of 4,000 mAh&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SVSDy0"&gt;Otherwise, the Dual Powerbank includes a USB-C port for charging its 4,000 mAh battery, as well as a small kickstand on one side so you can keep your phone propped up while it’s charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5F7tcF"&gt;While the likes of Zens and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297307/anker-magsafe-compatible-battery-pack-apple-iphone"&gt;Anker&lt;/a&gt; have been quick to make use of Apple’s latest wireless charging tech, the Cupertino company is yet to release a MagSafe battery pack of its own. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22290938/apple-magsafe-iphone-battery-pack-report"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; in February that such an accessory is in development at the company, but that it’s facing development issues relating to the iPhone’s software thinking it’s overheating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2V74jd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 17th, 4:28AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated with Zens’ confirmation of iPhone charging speeds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7E96t9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p4N4qs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus integrates further with Oppo, if that’s even possible</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The whole camera system on the OnePlus 9 Pro is solid, but has room to improve" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PreLxGWjXgAkVLh2rVaTwuyIo_8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69465329/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0053_Edit_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro. | Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8DTWuj"&gt;OnePlus CEO Pete Lau has announced a “new journey” for the company including a plan to “further integrate our organization with Oppo.” Lau made the announcement by way of a &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/a-new-journey-for-oneplus.1454492/"&gt;post on OnePlus’ forums&lt;/a&gt;, saying “we’re at a turning point for the future of OnePlus” and “we must adapt as a team and a brand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="85hr9Q"&gt;It sounds like a dramatic move for OnePlus, the company Lau started with Carl Pei after ostensibly leaving Oppo in 2013. OnePlus made its name with rebellious marketing and hype-driven online retail strategies, portraying itself as a smarter alternative to bigger smartphone brands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1xwGeW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It was always clear that OnePlus had ties to Oppo&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3aHu8H"&gt;But it remained a private company with ownership tied up in Oppo and the shadowy BBK Electronics empire, and it was clear from OnePlus’ phones that there were still at least some ties to Oppo. Components like display panels were often seemingly identical, and even supposedly proprietary technology like the Dash fast-charging system was cross-compatible with Oppo’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MXKvIi"&gt;“OnePlus and Oppo are two completely independent companies,” a OnePlus representative told me &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/6/15/17467348/oneplus-6-vs-oppo-r15-pro-vivo-bbk"&gt;three years ago&lt;/a&gt; by way of explanation. “R&amp;amp;D, finance, sales channels, daily operations, etc operate independently. The two parties share some common investors. OnePlus leases Oppo’s manufacturing line and shares part of the supply chain resources with Oppo.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aO5T4K"&gt;Lau says that OnePlus will continue to operate independently, despite the further integration with Oppo. But he hasn’t said exactly what would be integrated, and given the existing commonalities between the two brands’ products, it’s not obvious what this will actually mean for consumers. Lau says OnePlus will continue to operate its own events and customer feedback channels, for example, but adds that Oppo’s greater resources should help OnePlus be more efficient with software updates.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lwW0B4QWWEGX6noYMYXJbc3Y74s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22664475/DSC_0784.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Oppo Find X3 Pro.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qZaPx2"&gt;It’s not a big secret that OnePlus and Oppo have been coming closer to an explicit reunion in recent years. Lau became Oppo’s chief product officer last year while keeping his role at OnePlus, and the two brands merged R&amp;amp;D departments back in January. More recently, OnePlus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344054/oneplus-9-oppo-coloros-in-china-hydrogenos"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’d start using Oppo’s ColorOS for its phones in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JFOvaO"&gt;Reading between the lines, it sounds like OnePlus will essentially be treated like a label of Oppo’s, maintaining a separate consumer-facing operation but with business activities merging in areas beyond product development. Will this manifest itself in tangible changes to OnePlus devices? Who can say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="DHs4XT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Oppo Find X3 Pro review: the Chinese phone to beat","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22411538/oppo-find-x3-pro-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Kr3ROx"&gt;If you’re a OnePlus fan, though, there’s no reason to view the closer ties as a bad thing. The company has long left its “flagship killer” roots behind, now competing at the high end with expensive “Pro” phones while offering a range of cheaper Nord devices at the low-to-mid range. Oppo, for its part, releases far more phones a year than OnePlus (mostly in Asia), but its high-end flagships are every bit as good. The latest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22411538/oppo-find-x3-pro-review"&gt;Find X3 Pro&lt;/a&gt; is my favorite phone of the year so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qarkGX"&gt;Whether OnePlus would admit it or not, the company has always been associated with Oppo behind the scenes. The biggest change here is that OnePlus is now saying so out loud — while making the association even tighter.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leica phone announced by SoftBank in Japan</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FOBU2_fK_41ENIQWpT0H1W67TMs=/0x0:660x440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69465217/leitz.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zzd58N"&gt;SoftBank has announced a Leica-branded phone for the Japanese market. Leica has lent its name to phone camera systems before, but this Leitz Phone 1 is the first time the Leica brand and iconic red dot has taken precedence on a smartphone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OYoJyG"&gt;The camera system is of course going to be paramount for a device like this, and the hardware here is certainly unusual. There’s a single 20-megapixel 1-inch sensor — the biggest in any phone — with a 19mm-equivalent f/1.9 ultrawide lens, meaning other focal lengths need to use digital zoom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1SB59G"&gt;If that sounds familiar, well, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439883/sharp-aquos-r6-japan-biggest-phone-camera-sensor-1-inch"&gt;Sharp announced the exact same thing a month ago&lt;/a&gt;. The Aquos R6 has the same Leica-branded camera system — though the Leitz Phone 1 makes it look a lot bigger — and other specs like its 120Hz Pro IGZO OLED screen are also a match. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jCzqb7S-ARMaHwm6Nw-C6Wl1s8E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22664394/leitz2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Bundled accessories for the Leitz Phone 1.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wrYfpg"&gt;On the other hand, the Aquos R6 doesn’t come with a lens cap and matching case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vqucke"&gt;SoftBank is also selling the Aquos R6 alongside the Leitz Phone 1, and isn’t attempting to hide the similarities behind the two phones. Instead, it’s positioning the R6 as a model for someone who just wants the Leica camera, and the Leitz Phone 1 for those who value Leica’s hardware design. And besides, what could be more in keeping with Leica tradition than tweaking existing products with a red dot? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LO6MRq"&gt;Preorders for the Leitz Phone 1 start tomorrow in Japan. It’ll cost 187,920 yen, or about $1,700.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>China successfully launches three astronauts to new space station</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5NdPkSgYBMVwdhuyKBsPF7wB8dU=/166x0:1711x1030/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69464656/Screen_Shot_2021_06_16_at_9.24.58_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;CGTN&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pJ1wPR"&gt;A Long March rocket blasted off from China’s Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center today, carrying three astronauts to China’s new space station. The launch marks China’s &lt;a href="https://spaceflightnow.com/2021/06/09/long-march-2f-rocket-rolls-out-to-launch-pad-for-chinas-next-human-spaceflight/"&gt;first crewed mission&lt;/a&gt; in five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q0BHsq"&gt;The launch of the Shenzhou-12 spacecraft took place at 9:22AM local time on Thursday morning. The &lt;a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-06/16/c_1310010243.htm"&gt;three astronauts&lt;/a&gt;, Nie Haisheng, Liu Boming, and Tang Hongbo, will be the first three people to board China’s space station, Tianhe. They will stay on Tianhe for three months, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-57504052"&gt;bringing the space station online&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c7cszn"&gt;The core module of Tianhe, which contains the &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/16/china-to-send-the-first-astronauts-to-its-self-developed-space-station.html"&gt;crew’s living quarters&lt;/a&gt;, was launched in &lt;a href="https://www.space.com/china-launches-core-module-tianhe-space-station"&gt;April 2021&lt;/a&gt;. This first crewed mission is part of &lt;a href="https://www.space.com/china-launching-shenzhou-12-astronauts-to-space-station"&gt;eleven planned missions&lt;/a&gt; during the space station’s construction phase — two more modules and several more cargo and crewed missions need to be completed before the space station is finished in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sg0IsG"&gt;China’s last crewed mission took place in 2016, sending astronauts to visit the country’s previous space station, Tiangong-2. That station &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/20/20701831/china-tiangong-2-deorbited-experimental-space-station"&gt;deorbited in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, China has continued to push forward with an ambitious space program. It sent a sample return mission to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178582/china-change-5-lunar-sample-return-mission"&gt;Moon and back again&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, and landed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436072/china-tianwen-1-mars-landing-zhurong-rover"&gt;a rover on Mars earlier this year.&lt;/a&gt; Long-term, the country is building partnerships with Russia, with plans to land astronauts on the Moon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536625/china-russia-nasa-joint-astronaut-moon-landing"&gt;in the next decade&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Is Facebook cornering the VR market?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m2Sg49cdnxvctpaiOy-Ts5mhjFI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69464578/akrales_200904_4160_0135.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="am38oB"&gt;Imagine that, over the past year, Facebook had managed to acquire the battle royale game &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, the kid-focused game creation engine Roblox, and the best-selling game of 2020, &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wfxZU5"&gt;For many reasons, such a spree of acquisitions would never happen. One of the biggest is that antitrust scrutiny has made it increasingly difficult for Facebook to acquire anything that resembles a social network. It was more than a year ago that the company bought the moribund GIF search engine Giphy, which had few prospects for success as a standalone company; the United Kingdom’s competition watchdog &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/25/facebooks-acquisition-of-giphy-raises-concerns-for-uks-cma.html"&gt;has so far blocked the deal from closing&lt;/a&gt;, warning the acquisition would somehow harm Facebook’s competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MRrlsB"&gt;And yet if you look at the virtual reality landscape, Facebook has made a series of acquisitions that are roughly analogous to the fictional shopping spree I describe above, if on a much smaller scale:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="FRKr6T"&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/population-one-facebook-bigbox-acquire/"&gt;Facebook bought BigBox VR&lt;/a&gt;, maker of the battle royale game &lt;em&gt;Population: One&lt;/em&gt;. The shooter has a structure and a “season”-based business model similar to that of Epic Games’ &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wHsmNl"&gt;The week before, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/facebook-buys-studio-behind-roblox-like-crayta-gaming-platform/"&gt;Facebook bought Unit 2 Games, maker of the Crayta platform&lt;/a&gt;. Crayta lets users make and share games in a fashion that mirrors &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;, the fast-growing game platform that went public earlier this year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VwKv5n"&gt;In 2019 Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/26/facebook-buys-beat-saber-vr-game-maker-beat-games.html#:~:text=Facebook%20acquires%20the%20maker%20of%20popular%20'Beat%20Saber'%20VR%20game&amp;amp;text=Facebook%20on%20Tuesday%20announced%20its,of%20Prague%2C%20the%20company%20said."&gt;bought Beat Games, maker of the hit game &lt;em&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/em&gt; was the most popular VR game on the Oculus platform by far when Facebook bought it, and it remains a bestseller today with more than 4 million copies sold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="HZ617i"&gt;The company’s other VR studio acquisitions include &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/facebook-buys-sanzaru-games/"&gt;Sanzaru Games&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/facebook-buys-ready-at-dawn-lone-echo/"&gt; Ready at Dawn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9dsuwe"&gt;Alex Heath, a reporter at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; who has closely covered the rise of AR and VR technologies, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexeheath/status/1403454403072253954"&gt;observed on Twitter recently&lt;/a&gt; that Facebook’s acquisitions in the space resembled its most famous bets on nascent technology from years ago: the purchases of Instagram and WhatsApp, which helped the company cement its position as the dominant player in social networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nG1htf"&gt;“Facebook is going to probably have a near-monopoly in VR software before it even matters,” Heath tweeted. “Facebook will have literally reinvented itself for a new paradigm shift in computing by the time regulation gets around to addressing it in its current state.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Beat Saber" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zhWw9lRNkpwTrWCz3CIj1b7BPXM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13621124/30814989187_f608551022_k.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Beat Games&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beat Saber.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6Hsjjz"&gt;Whether or not you think Congress should intervene to regulate tech acquisitions, it’s undeniable that the process moves slowly. Facebook bought Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014; a congressional antitrust inquiry didn’t begin until five years later; and a bill that would require heightened scrutiny of tech platform acquisitions was not introduced into Congress until… &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-other-tech-giants-could-be-forced-to-shed-assets-under-house-bill-11623423248"&gt;Friday&lt;/a&gt;. (OK, fine, the insurrectionist Sen. Josh Hawley introduced a bill to &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/hawley-antitrust-bill-trust-busting-for-the-twenty-first-century-act/"&gt;ban all platform acquisitions, period&lt;/a&gt;, in April, but his bills are better thought of as Fox News op-eds than as serious efforts to regulate the industry.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OjZn2F"&gt;I think the Federal Trade Commission should be more skeptical of tech giants acquiring their direct competitors, but I’m not sure a bill that defaults to banning acquisitions is the best approach. Acquisitions are part of the lifeblood of Silicon Valley, and the money that they return to investors gets re-invested in the next generation of entrepreneurs and technologies. You can encourage competition in lots of ways without banning M&amp;amp;A. And in any case, it’s hard to imagine a bill like this one garnering much support from Republicans, Hawley’s bill notwithstanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5eAJWo"&gt;At the same time, let’s say you believe Facebook’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp set back the consumer internet for a few years — until TikTok emerged, anyway. Wouldn’t you want to apply as much scrutiny to Facebook’s current shopping spree as you’re applying to moves it made as long as nine years ago?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NLEWIx"&gt;The answer to that question likely depends on how large you think the market for virtual reality headsets and its attendant software ecosystem will someday become. Currently the market is small — Facebook’s Oculus platform had &lt;a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/zuckerberg-quest-2-mainstream-vr-headset-facebook-q4-2020-earnings/"&gt;sold fewer than 10 million units as of January&lt;/a&gt;. The PlayStation 4, by contrast, has sold over 115 million units during its lifetime; Apple sold almost &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dwightsilverman/2021/02/22/apple-back-on-top-iphone-is-the-bestselling-smartphone-globally-in-q4-2020/?sh=5c6351854ca7"&gt;80 million iPhones&lt;/a&gt; in the last quarter of 2020 alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3IQtx"&gt;If you think VR will grow to roughly the size of a major console gaming platform, maybe you’re not concerned how many studios Facebook is buying. Console manufacturers buy game studios all the time — &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/09/21/welcoming-bethesda-to-the-xbox-family/"&gt;Microsoft’s acquisition of ZeniMax Media&lt;/a&gt;, owner of Bethesda Software and its many popular franchises, was last year’s mega-deal in the space — and no one seems to have too many concerns that any one console is developing a monopoly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zTldis"&gt;If, on the other hand, you think Oculus could grow to a size more closely resembling a major desktop computer manufacturer, like Dell, perhaps you would eye its acquisitions with more scrutiny. To lay my cards on the table: I think it eventually will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NHFTwu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;VR might be Facebook’s fastest-growing business&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4HLrtz"&gt;Facebook still hasn’t released sales figures for the Quest 2 headset, and I’m told Playstation VR has sold more units overall. But we know that Quest 2 &lt;a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/zuckerberg-quest-2-mainstream-vr-headset-facebook-q4-2020-earnings/"&gt;drove a 156 percent year-over-year increase&lt;/a&gt; in Facebook’s non-advertising revenue in the last quarter of 2020. Even on a relatively small revenue base, that might make VR Facebook’s fastest-growing business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpS9zT"&gt;Everywhere you look, you find signs of Facebook’s growing confidence in its VR platform. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has given &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/features/mark-zuckerberg-on-facebook-vr-future-new-sensors-on-quest-pro-fitness-and-a-metaverse-for-work/"&gt;frequent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/9/16/21439741/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-connect-oculus-ar-vr-glasses-quest-apple-watch"&gt; interviews&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/mark-zuckerberg-on-mind-reading-apple-and-the-race-to-mainstream-vr"&gt;subject&lt;/a&gt; over the past 12 months, among other things positioning AR and VR as an enterprise software platform as well as a place to play games. The company has hired more than 10,000 people to work in its Facebook Reality Labs hardware division.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SEtJ3v"&gt;In short, there’s more evidence that VR will be huge amid Facebook’s run of acquisitions today than there was evidence that Instagram was going to be huge when Facebook bought it in 2012, before the app had even 50 million users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K6Brh5"&gt;None of that is to say that I think VR will overtake smartphones as the world’s biggest computing platform. And it’s also clear that Facebook has real competition as it tries to build out the mixed-reality future. Snap is also building impressive hardware and software in that space, focused on its Spectacles glasses and growing developer ecosystem around them. Apple, which is working on a headset of its own, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/apples-secretive-arvr-footprints-point-something-big-venkateshwaran/?articleId=6713113191871848448"&gt;has made at least four acquisitions&lt;/a&gt; of mixed-reality companies in recent years itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RUoSME"&gt;It may also be that Epic Games makes &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; of VR, and Roblox makes its platform the Roblox of VR, and Facebook’s efforts in that space wither.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NPJpCa"&gt;Facebook told me its reasons for acquiring so many game studios are straightforward: it wants to accelerate the growth of a still-nascent industry by ensuring top-flight gaming experiences are widely available. It’s a very small player in the gaming industry, the company said, but hopes its acquisitions will be good for both developers and users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nAYYAA"&gt;“That’s all true — but it doesn’t doesn’t mean it isn’t going to be an issue in six or eight years,” Heath told me over the phone Wednesday. From Heath’s perspective, the more consequential aspect of Facebook’s acquisitions is that it will tie up a significant amount of VR talent at one company for at least four years while their options from the acquisition vest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9LFgbZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“the people that are good either already work at Facebook or they’re buying them”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PTGnhn"&gt;“There are not that many companies doing this,” Heath said of the VR industry, “And the people that are good either already work at Facebook or they’re buying them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uBDP4B"&gt;None of this will much matter if the VR industry fails to live up to its most recent round of hype. And failing to live up to the hype is perhaps the signature feature of the VR industry for its entire lifespan so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="22ReUu"&gt;But if VR becomes a part of our daily workflow as well our daily entertainment, and Facebook becomes the market leader in that space, we may be in for another global conversation about how a tech giant successfully used its market power to take over an adjacent industry. If that’s to be the case, it strikes me that the time to have that conversation is now — while the foundation is still being laid, one minor-seeming acquisition at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0ndWz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4xuZx0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon pulls an Apple by reducing its app store cut for some smaller developers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fc0uhGQjOijIrjNmqlpuvI_6owk=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69464448/acastro_180329_1777_amazon_0001.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cfgWL0"&gt;Amazon has decided it would really like to attract more developers to its Android and Fire OS app store, so it’s following in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;the footsteps of Apple&lt;/a&gt; (and Google) by announcing &lt;a href="https://developer.amazon.com/blogs/appstore/post/93e89be7-1611-4764-8f97-f4eef0a7c0e0/coming-soon-amazon-appstore-small-business-accelerator-program"&gt;a new “Amazon Appstore Small Business Accelerator Program”&lt;/a&gt; that takes less money out of developer’s pockets (&lt;a href="https://www.aftvnews.com/amazon-appstore-will-reduce-developer-revenue-cut-from-30-to-20-and-give-10-in-free-aws-credit/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;AFTVNews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UE3Jmj"&gt;But where Apple and Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333777/google-play-store-fee-reduction-developers-1-million-dollars"&gt;reduce their cut of a developer’s first $1 million in revenue from 30 percent down to 15 percent&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon’s formula has a slight tweak: it’ll take a higher 20 percent of revenue, but give developers an additional 10 percent in “AWS promotional credits.” The idea is that if your app is using Amazon’s popular AWS cloud services anyhow, it’ll be equivalent to you keeping 90 percent of the money. And if you happen to be using a &lt;em&gt;competitor’s&lt;/em&gt; cloud services, maybe Amazon will tempt you to become an AWS customer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9VpDrj"&gt;Like Apple’s program, though, &lt;em&gt;it is a program —&lt;/em&gt; something you have to apply for, can get booted out of, and you automatically get kicked out and have to apply again the following year if your revenue ever exceeds $1 million. By contrast, Google is simply giving developers an extra 15 percent of their first $1 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="rLYmYW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s biggest App Store critics are not impressed with its new fee cut for small developers","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573109/epic-tim-sweeney-apple-app-store-fee-cut-reduction-criticize"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="sxkyJw"&gt;Also, revenue isn’t everything: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525904/fanhouse-apple-tax-app-store-creator-fees"&gt;as Fanhouse argued when it railed against Apple last week&lt;/a&gt;, an app that’s designed to profit &lt;em&gt;creators&lt;/em&gt;, not its developer, might make far more than $1 million in revenue and not be able to afford 30 percent of the money that changes hands there. Fanhouse says it pays creators 90 percent of their earnings, and accused Apple of demanding 30 percent of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a3A3dz"&gt;Apple is currently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22454959/epic-apple-trial-recap-video-tim-cook-xbox-playstation-business"&gt;fighting a huge lawsuit against Epic Games&lt;/a&gt; that touches on whether its 30 percent cut is fair; part of Apple’s argument is that 30 percent has long been the norm. But critics say companies like Apple are taking far more for their services than a payment processor should. Moves like these from Apple, Google, Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409285/microsoft-store-cut-windows-pc-games-12-percent"&gt;and Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; suggest that there’s meaningful pressure across the industry to reconsider the 30 percent cut, if only to steer the conversation away from alternatives that might more drastically impact profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="HppqAX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple isn’t just a walled garden, it’s a carrier","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22521476/apple-walled-garden-carrier-app-store-innovation"},{"title":"Apple heads into developer conference under more scrutiny than ever","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/6/22520378/apple-wwdc-2021-developer-insult-macbook-pro"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="RqrYOi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella now doubles as the company’s chairman</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hpDBY0MitUr9378PeF8gFiEfIho=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69464330/vpavic_180502_2536_0018.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FmMMBd"&gt;On February 4th, 2014, Microsoft found its new CEO in the cloud — Azure boss &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/4/5169852/satya-nadella-microsoft-ceo"&gt;Satya Nadella took the top job&lt;/a&gt;, Steve Ballmer retired, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/4/5377226/bill-gates-steps-down-microsoft-chairman-named-tech-advisor"&gt;Bill Gates stepped down as chairman&lt;/a&gt;. Now, after growing Microsoft to become &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/26/18109784/microsoft-apple-market-cap-2018-valuable-company"&gt;one of the most valuable companies in the world&lt;/a&gt; yet again, Nadella &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/microsoft-board-of-directors-announces-role-changes-and-quarterly-dividend-301314220.html"&gt;has now been unanimously elected chairman&lt;/a&gt; of the Microsoft board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iq02Bs"&gt;It’s the first time in two decades that Microsoft’s chairman will also be its CEO, after Bill Gates originally stepped down as CEO in 2000 (Gates &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21179214/bill-gates-steps-down-microsoft-board-philanthropy"&gt;left the Microsoft board entirely&lt;/a&gt; in 2020), and it’s a testament to how much Nadella is now trusted to lead the company forward. When Gates stepped down as chairman in 2014, the board elected independent chairman John Thompson, who’d previously been CEO and chairman of Symantec and who’ll remain an independent director on the Microsoft board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8O2TUh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/7/17324920/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-interview-windows-10-build-2018"&gt;We spoke to Nadella in 2018&lt;/a&gt; about how he was changing Microsoft, and how Windows wasn’t the future of the company, but rather cloud services. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/7/8568473/windows-10-last-version-of-windows"&gt;Windows 10 was imagined as a ongoing service, too&lt;/a&gt;, but PC sales &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21065100/pc-market-shipments-idc-gartner-growth-2019-laptops-desktops-windows-7-10"&gt;turned around in 2020&lt;/a&gt; after Microsoft ended support for Windows 7, and started to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225356/pc-sales-shipments-2020-growth-idc-canalys-remote-work"&gt;see big growth in 2021&lt;/a&gt;. It sure seems like the company now believes in distinct versions again: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535123/microsoft-windows-11-leak-screenshots-start-menu"&gt;Windows 11 is coming soon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best deals on 4K TVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rmtJvuBPnkpZu39fUo0GC39vOAg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69151213/jbareham_170613_1754_0016_main_04.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vtXpJr"&gt;There are a lot of 4K TVs available to choose from, complete with a wide variety of prices and performance. And, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/amazon-prime-day-deals-tech"&gt;Prime Day 2021&lt;/a&gt; in our midst, now might be the best time of the year (or, at least this summer) to get an amazing TV deal. Even if your budget is less than $500, you can get a good 4K TV in a bigger size than you might expect. Whether you want a secondary TV for the bedroom or a high-end OLED that’s built for a cinema-like experience, we’ve picked out the best TV deals across four common categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="zUfn7z"&gt;Best 4K TV deals for most people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sFCZyo"&gt;Best budget 4K TVs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3C0Il4"&gt;Best OLED TVs &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jVQclk"&gt;Best 4K TVs for the PS5 and Xbox Series X&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="d2lRkA"&gt;We will provide regular updates to this post so be sure to check back periodically for the most up-to-date info on the best deals available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="K5eooA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best early Prime Day deals","url":"https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/22533316/prime-day-early-deals-tech-headphones-tvs-echo-dot-show-luna"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="f9MF2Z"&gt;The best 4K TV deals for most people&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mszLRr"&gt;A 55-inch TV is a popular size for good reasons. It is not too big, nor is it too small, making it a safe size if you’re looking to upgrade the TV in a living room or bedroom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X3LwO3"&gt;Sony’s 55-inch X80J 4K TV has Google TV software built-in, so you won’t need to purchase any additional streaming boxes, like an Apple TV or Chromecast. The LED panel supports HDR10, HLG, and Dolby Vision HDR, and it has four HDMI ports (one of which is HDMI ARC). It’s a relatively low-frills affair, but it seems like a good deal at Best Buy, where you can get it for $700 with a My Best Buy account (normally $750).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gEtknI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10610217"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JbaBai"&gt;The TCL 6-Series R635 model is a good option if you are looking to balance price and performance. Like the Vizio above, the R635 has a QLED panel, but it goes a step above with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363318/tcl-2020-5-6-series-4k-tvs-qled-mini-led-backlighting-gaming-ps5-xbox-series-x"&gt;Mini-LED backlighting&lt;/a&gt;, which brings better brightness and contrast. The 55-inch model is available for $810 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FTCL-55-6-Series-4K-UHD-Dolby-Vision-HDR-QLED-Roku-Smart-TV-55R635%2F796005169&amp;amp;subid1=BestTVDealsDeals04122021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, but no other retailers are currently offering competitive deals. You can also get it in 65- or 75-inch sizes if you want something bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="y8BpYm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10327662"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MPfLVC"&gt;Samsung’s Crystal TU-7000 series line of TVs offers many features, such as multiple screen mirroring. Currently, the TU-7000 is available in a wide variety of sizes, ranging from 43 all the way to 75 inches. Right now, the 55-inch model is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743619562269761088#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$450 at Best B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Crystal-TU-8000-Built/dp/B084JH43DJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;uy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9SocSo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10444776"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EYhbja"&gt;The best TV deals on a budget&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zWYgij"&gt;You don’t have to spend a fortune for a 4K TV; spending $500 or less can still net you a TV with good image quality and features. Insignia’s 55-inch 4K HDR Fire TV Edition model is the perfect case in point, one that supports HDR10, HDMI ARC, and HDMI eArc, among other notable features. For a limited time, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Insignia-NS-55F301NA22-Smart-Released/dp/B08X7KQQGJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Amazon for $350&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jIOPJT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10605845"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cW4VPC"&gt;Another Fire TV Edition TV deal happening now for Prime members is on Toshiba’s 50-inch Smart Fire TV Edition 4K LED, which normally retails for $380. As the name might imply, it allows you to stream content from services such as Disney Plus and Netflix, and includes the option to watch live TV. You currently can get a 50-inch model &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Toshiba-50LF621U21-50-inch-Vision/dp/B086VR2KY8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for just $310 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;; otherwise, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1737687233984981481#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s $350 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; or a step up to the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1737687411898346509#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch model for $50 more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="x443tm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10444802"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="74eOSC"&gt;TCL also has competitively priced televisions, and its 4-series lineup is one of the more affordable options on the market. The S435 model features a built-in Roku interface, dual-band Wi-Fi, HDR10, and support for Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri voice assistants. You can get the 43-inch model for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/TCL-4K-Smart-LED-43S435/dp/B08DHDS4T3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$290 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HtnMEi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9740197"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qm44jO"&gt;The best deals on OLED TVs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="vbJRlM"&gt;OLED televisions offer the best image quality in a mainstream TV. LG’s BX line supports HDMI 2.1, meaning this TV is perfect for people looking to take advantage of the PS5 or Xbox Series X. You can get it in either the 55- or 65-inch configuration and save up to $200, depending on the size. The popular &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-OLED55BXPUA-Alexa-Built-Ultra/dp/B0829RXYSN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch model is currently $1,297 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and basically the same price at other major retailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OMVgrF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733758"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JvNG4d"&gt;Vizio’s 55-inch OLED is a Best Buy exclusive, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1739879816744555003#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can get it for $1,200&lt;/a&gt;. At this price, it’s one of the more affordable options if you’re looking for a 55-inch TV. Vizio doesn’t have the same kind of experience in the OLED playing field as LG, but it’s a great deal if you want a high-end viewing experience and HDMI 2.1 ports to display high frame rates from your PS5 or Xbox Series X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OvRhzP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10462603"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MB8PX4"&gt;Despite the high price tag, LG’s Gallery Series GX OLED is a good TV for those looking for a more cinematic experience. It includes support for Google Assistant and Alexa, and for those who want to use their TV for gaming, it features Nvidia G-Sync and HDMI 2.1 support, meaning it can take full advantage of the RTX 30-series cards or Sony’s and Microsoft’s next-gen gaming consoles. Right now, you can get the 55-inch for as low as &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLG-GX-55-inch-Class-with-Gallery-Design-4K-Smart-OLED-TV-w-AI-ThinQ-54-6-Diag-OLED55GXPUA%2F152371849%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_33DRwsUfoxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkESb%253AWnWQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_1943169%26clickid%3D33DRwsUfoxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkESb%253AWnWQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=BestTVDeals04142021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,597 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. There are also 65- and 70-inch models available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lpiA85"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10445785"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O5Vjam"&gt;4K TVs for the Sony PS5 and Microsoft Xbox Series X &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xr7I2E"&gt;Sony’s PS5 and Microsoft’s Xbox Series X can play 4K games with HDR at up to 120 frames per second. So, naturally, if you don’t have a TV that takes full advantage of your console, it might be time to upgrade to one of our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recommendations&lt;/a&gt;. For the best experience, you’ll want a TV that supports HDMI 2.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Nkhmv"&gt;Deals on those picks are scarce right now, however, there’s one happening on LG’s CX series of TVs, which include support for Nvidia’s G-Sync and AMD’s FreeSync adaptive sync technologies, as well as a low 1ms response time. The big difference between the CX and the cheaper BX model mentioned above is the CX line can have slightly better brightness, which is better for HDR content. It comes in three sizes: 55, 65, and 77 inches. Right now, you can grab a 65-inch for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0817H41YN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;as low as $1,897 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1555067-REG%2Flg_oled65cxpua_cxpua_65_class_hdr.html%23donotlink&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, or for $1,950 &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/lg-65%22-class---cx-series---4k-uhd-oled-tv---%24100-allstate-protection-plan-bundle-included.product.100657326.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt;. The latter deal requires a &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://costcomembershipoffer.com/Purchase/Purchase/cj?qid=e6583bbeb3f911eb830f05100a1c0e10" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Costco membership&lt;/a&gt;, but it also nets you an Allstate Protection Plan — a three-year warranty for your TV.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Workhorse starts federal court fight over lost USPS contract</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w6Kwes6X1tJrTPbdDGSnA8oAXz8=/0x427:2560x2134/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69463950/NGDVsideView_scaled.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: USPS&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="34ukEI"&gt;EV startup Workhorse has filed an official protest after losing the bid to make the United States Postal Service’s next-generation mail vehicle in February, a contract that could ultimately be worth some $6 billion. The USPS instead gave that contract to defense contractor Oshkosh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rtTrTQ"&gt;The Ohio-based company filed a bid protest in the US Court of Federal Claims on Wednesday. The complaint is currently sealed, though a judge could ultimately rule to make some parts of it public, as Workhorse also filed a redacted version of the complaint that could be made public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vi07wJ"&gt;The bid protest kicks off a high-profile court fight over the contract for the next-generation mail truck, and could have an impact on how and when those vehicles switch over to electric power — something President Biden has said he wants across the federal fleet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="92yMFj"&gt;“While we do not comment on active litigation, the United States Postal Service is looking forward to the start of vehicle production for our Next Generation Delivery Vehicle (NGDV),” Kim Frum, senior public relations representative for the USPS said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Preproduction design, tooling, and facility preparation activities are proceeding on schedule with the first NGDVs estimated to appear on carrier routes in 2023.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7svFeJ"&gt;“While bid protests are a normal part of the government contracting process, we do not comment on such proceedings,” Alexandra C. Hittle, Oshkosh Defense’s director of global marketing and communications, said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We are proud that the USPS selected Oshkosh Defense to fulfill the needs of the NGDV program and we look forward to getting these highly capable vehicles into the hands of mail carriers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ilMKzY"&gt;Workhorse was one of three companies that submitted final bids to the USPS last year, and was the only one proposing to build an entirely electric mail fleet. The Postal Service and Oshkosh &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297823/usps-postal-service-mail-truck-electric-oshkosh-workhorse"&gt;revealed the new vehicle in February&lt;/a&gt;, and said that it is designed to run on both gas and electric drivetrains. The defense contractor has said the gas vehicles will be “fuel-efficient [and] low-emission” but has not qualified those claims. Oshkosh agreed to build between 50,000 to 165,000 of the trucks over 10 years, but the USPS says it needs billions more in funding from Congress in order to tip the balance of the fleet more towards electric. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9kA99l"&gt;In requesting that the complaint be sealed, Workhorse &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.uscfc.43940/gov.uscourts.uscfc.43940.5.0.pdf"&gt;told the court&lt;/a&gt; that the document “contains confidential and proprietary source selection and proposal information” about its bid, and that future filings will or are likely to contain similar information about competitors’ bids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wlclLT"&gt;But of the options that were on Workhorse’s table, this one may prove the most effective at helping the company’s legal team understand why the USPS went with Oshkosh. “They will get to see everything, the whole file, how [the bids were] evaluated, the award memo,” a person familiar with the Postal Service’s contracting process told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;earlier this year. That process will likely take place under a protective order, though, so Workhorse’s lawyers may ultimately only be able to tell the company whether or not they have a good chance at winning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ANIrLe"&gt;Oshkosh has said it is still finalizing the design of the new vehicle, and that they won’t hit the road until 2023. The USPS agreed to invest $482 million up front to help ready the new vehicle. Oshkosh had worked with Ford during the bidding process, but the automaker has repeatedly declined to comment on whether it was involved in the defense contractor’s final pitch, which looks much different from spy shots of earlier prototypes based off the Transit van.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YwazYi"&gt;The USPS set out to replace the current mail truck in 2015 with a plan to put the new vehicles on the road by 2018. It originally selected six companies (or teams of companies) to work up prototypes. But the bid process dragged on for years. A &lt;a href="https://www.trucks.com/2020/08/31/inspector-generals-report-details-new-mail-truck-program-problems/"&gt;2020 report&lt;/a&gt; from the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) detailed why: a lot of the prototypes were awful and broke down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="3uBW6V"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How the USPS mail trucks could still go fully electric","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22423179/usps-mail-trucks-electric-oshkosh"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ZgxkoO"&gt;Replacing the current mail trucks has only become more of a pressing issue, though. Built by defense contractor Grumman, many of the so-called Long Life Vehicles have blown past their life expectancies. That has left them either breaking down, which is costing the USPS a fortune, or in some cases catching on fire. Even the Long Life Vehicles that are able to stay on the road lack modern amenities like advanced safety features and even air conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Mlr4d"&gt;Beyond the OIG report, there has been little insight into the USPS’s decision to go with Oshkosh. The bid process was incredibly opaque, to the point that Rep. Tim Ryan (D-OH) called it a “black box” in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OjImk8"&gt;Workhorse itself has said very little since it lost the bid in February, but the USPS apparently still took issue with some of the company’s communications. In the request to seal the complaint filed Wednesday, Workhorse says the USPS believes the company breached its NDA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="epR5CE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hA0CRH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
