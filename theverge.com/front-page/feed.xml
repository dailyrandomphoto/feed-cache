    <title>Hugo Barra is leaving Facebook </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OkN4JM"&gt;Facebook’s vice president of AR and VR Hugo Barra is leaving the company, he announced (where else) &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/hbarra76/posts/10157618478316612"&gt;on Facebook Monday&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfMh6v"&gt;“Today is my last day at &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/facebookrealitylabs/?__cft__%5B0%5D=AZX2UjmeNgpyMfjeRfjrmWG0FmYcWpqLoUAq4Q_UN1yNAKjw8-Wxj8BHgwCPA2Zupfzuawfl6sVU_ISkvkxBPTJbg5aH79f5Cfo1YzZueKATci6RIi5fpMt79ybbqiVTIHIKja3PD7xMNdRtEpdJjnfD&amp;amp;__tn__=kK-R"&gt;Facebook Reality Labs&lt;/a&gt;, after 4 years working on projects that have been more exciting and more challenging than anything I’ve encountered in my career, with some of the brightest minds and kindest people I’ve ever had the pleasure to meet,” Barra wrote in the post. He said he planned to “explore the healthcare technology space,” so he could apply what he had learned in consumer tech to solve problems in health care. “I believe society is still poorly equipped with the tools people need to really understand our health and gain control over our health outcomes,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3WVBs4"&gt;After serving as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/8/28/4669960/android-vp-hugo-barra-reportedly-leaving-google-for-chinese"&gt;Google’s vice president of Android product management and then several years at Xiaomi&lt;/a&gt;, Barra joined Facebook in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/9/18563171/facebook-oculus-ar-vr-head-hugo-barra-stepping-down-new-role-jason-rubin-eric-tseng"&gt;2017 to run its Oculus VR team&lt;/a&gt;. In 2019, he moved to his current role, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hbarra/status/1126534172816728064"&gt;tasked with&lt;/a&gt; “building a global AR/VR partner ecosystem” based in New York City, which eventually became part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/14/18141524/facebook-building-8-reality-labs-ar-vr-portal-skunkworks-hardware-division"&gt;Facebook Reality Labs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tv10mK"&gt;Barra is leaving Facebook before the company launches its first pair of consumer “smart glasses,” which it said last year would be a branded Ray-Ban product. He touted the project on Twitter last September and mentioned the launch in his farewell note (but didn’t provide details about a release date other than “this year”). &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hbarra/status/1306279147778568194?s=20"&gt;Barra said development of the smart glasses&lt;/a&gt; became “his main focus at Facebook.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Nv3EYa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Beyond thrilled to finally share a sneak peek of our Facebook partnership with Ray-Ban! Our first smart glasses will launch next year, and that’s just the beginning… The future will be a classic and it's coming in 2021   &lt;a href="https://t.co/l9992ZQGoy"&gt;pic.twitter.com/l9992ZQGoy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Hugo Barra (@hbarra) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hbarra/status/1306278791669579776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 16, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="syhSIk"&gt;But after announcing in September that the smart glasses were coming sometime in 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/02/facebook-lowers-expectations-for-its-upcoming-ray-ban-smart-glasses.html"&gt;Facebook tried to temper expectations&lt;/a&gt; about the smart glasses; in March, CFO David Wehner said at a conference that the glasses wouldn’t be close to the technology Facebook eventually hopes to achieve in AR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3qkI1n"&gt;Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg thanked Barra for his work in a comment on Barra’s Facebook post: “Thanks for everything you’ve done to help build the next computing platform and the whole ecosystem around it,” Zuckerberg wrote. “I’ve learned so much working with you, and I’m excited to see what you build next.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BQ57dD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xuLyr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EV startup Canoo under SEC investigation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xQRigcZvoI3umu9FPQXUjWD6g1Q=/224x193:1535x1067/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69301279/Canoo_PickupTruck_ExteriorSnow_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Canoo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Qv92fq"&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission has opened an investigation into newly public electric vehicle startup Canoo, CEO Tony Aquila shared on a conference call on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwoI7w"&gt;The probe is broad, though the startup said in a &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000155837021007431/goev-20210331x10q.htm"&gt;regulatory filing&lt;/a&gt; that the SEC has characterized it as a “fact-finding inquiry,” and that the agency has not yet concluded whether anyone violated the law. It covers Canoo’s merger with a special purpose acquisition company (or SPAC), plus its “operations, business model, revenues, revenue strategy, customer agreements, earnings and other related topics, along with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397356/canoo-cofounder-ulrich-kranz-resign-new-ceo-tony-aquila"&gt;the recent departures of certain of the Company’s officers&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Uy3fm"&gt;Canoo says it plans to provide all requested material and fully cooperate. Aquila declined to take any questions about the probe on the call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JIWmfT"&gt;Canoo is one of a number of electric vehicle startups that went public by merging with a SPAC over the last year. These mergers provided a different path for these startups to go public than a traditional IPO. But since these mergers are regulated differently, it woudn up giving startups more leeway in regards to their business projections. In April, the SEC said it would &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/09/sec-is-scrutinizing-spac-projections-seeks-clearer-disclosures.html"&gt;start taking a closer look at this discrepancy&lt;/a&gt; to make sure that investors weren’t being misled. Canoo received its notice from the SEC on April 29th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="88197m"&gt;A number of other newly-public EV startups are facing pressure from the SEC and various regulators. Lordstown Motors &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336751/lordstown-motors-sec-inquiry-review-hindenburg-investigation-orders"&gt;disclosed in March that the SEC is investigating&lt;/a&gt; whether the electric pickup truck startup misled investors. Hydrogen trucking startup Nikola also faces investigations from the SEC and the &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/10/nikola-discloses-grand-jury-subpoenas-from-doj.html"&gt;Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt; after being caught lying to investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="owidSY"&gt;Aquila stressed on the call that Canoo has been overly conservative with its projections to date, and also said the startup will be careful when reporting total deposits for its vehicles versus binding orders. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440287/canoo-electric-van-price-deposit-pickup-truck"&gt;startup began taking deposits&lt;/a&gt; for its electric van, pickup truck, and delivery vehicle earlier Monday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gfmzqH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s $549 AirPods Max can’t play lossless Apple Music — even when plugged in</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/69d9CKC7JVxP7_zIM1EuPJy81d0=/0x1:2040x1361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69301267/DSCF2705_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r06i0y"&gt;Streaming music might be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440090/apple-music-lossless-audio-dolby-atmos-support-audio"&gt;entering a new era of hi-fi audio&lt;/a&gt;, but Apple’s AirPods Max aren’t technically ready to go along for the ride. The company has confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that its premium noise-canceling headphones do not natively support playback of lossless music files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jnkub0"&gt;“Lossless audio is not supported on AirPods, any model,” an Apple spokesperson said by email. “AirPods Max wired listening mode accepts analog output sources only. AirPods Max currently does not support digital audio formats in wired mode.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lq6ELI"&gt;It makes complete sense that the AirPods and AirPods Pro have no way of playing lossless audio. They’re totally wireless, and Apple supports the AAC codec over Bluetooth. AAC sounds plenty good, but it’s nowhere near the bit rate of CD-quality or high-resolution tracks. To do any better, Apple would need to come up with some new wireless codec — its own version of Sony’s LDAC, sort of — or make these things play music over Wi-Fi instead of Bluetooth. None of that is happening today or by June when Apple Music will start offering lossless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="shjiBP"&gt;Things are a little more complicated with the AirPods Max, which &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be plugged into audio sources with a cable. However, it turns out that even if you have Apple’s $35 Lightning-to-3.5mm cable plugged into a device that’s streaming lossless Apple Music tracks, you’re not going to hear the full audio fidelity of the source. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max in case with iPod and AirPods Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YfLJy784kh1AUCVTFVHU8pIrOkA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159226/npatel_201209_4332_0016.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Nilay Patel / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AirPods Max don’t support digital audio formats when hard wired.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qijZy4"&gt;So the natural question becomes... well, what &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; you hearing in that scenario? Apple tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that when you play a 24-bit / 48 kHz Apple Music lossless track from an iPhone into the AirPods Max using both the cable and Lightning dongle, the audio is converted to analog and then re-digitized to 24-bit / 48 kHz. That re-digitization step is the reason that Apple can’t say you’re hearing pure lossless audio; it’s not an identical match to the source. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RoOJMd"&gt;Is it still going to sound very good? Almost certainly. The AirPods Max sound exceptional — even with AAC over Bluetooth, and plugging in can make the experience richer. But if you’re a stickler for the technical details, this is why the AirPods Max can’t pull off lossless audio in the truest sense. It also leaves Apple in an awkward spot where other high-end headphones that &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; support digital audio when hard wired — over USB-C, for example — could deliver the full lossless audio that the AirPods Max can’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S4HjWj"&gt;The Apple Music spatial audio feature also announced today &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; work on the AirPods, AirPods Pro, and AirPods Max. So any songs that have those Dolby Atmos mixes are going to feel more immersive than their stereo counterparts. I think Apple suspects spatial audio will be a bigger deal for many customers than lossless quality — and it may be right. But hopefully the company also has a long-term plan for increasing the fidelity on its wireless headphones, especially now that lossless doesn’t cost anything extra. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon goes quiet on its Twitch-based Pac-Man game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IsQDdUukfDpRPGQkmJ_MmWTm8Lc=/79x0:922x562/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69301024/pic_03.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Pac-Man Live Studio&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon Games and Bandai Namco&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rnmAeI"&gt;In May 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21266881/pac-man-live-studio-playable-on-twitch-june"&gt;Amazon announced &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man Live Studio&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an interesting new version of &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man &lt;/em&gt;that you’d be able to play right inside Twitch. The game was set to release that June — but recently the company removed all traces of it from the Amazon Games website. Nearly a year after &lt;em&gt;Live Studio&lt;/em&gt; was supposed to debut, its status remains a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SePP7C"&gt;Right now, &lt;em&gt;Live Studio&lt;/em&gt;’s page on the Amazon Games website &lt;a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/games/pac-man-live-studio"&gt;shows a 404 error&lt;/a&gt;, but the Wayback Machine has an archived version of the filled-out webpage &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210407014742/https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/games/pac-man-live-studio"&gt;from April 7th&lt;/a&gt;. This archived version lists a release date of “coming soon” — many months after the original June launch date. And Wario64, who you might know as one of the &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/microsoft-new-gaming-console-545e87c5-0a6f-4384-8b69-dbded2737e01.html#:~:text=Wario64,worse"&gt;best video game deal-finders on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, reported that the site wasn’t working &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1383552847120257024"&gt;as recently as mid-April&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dQoHaS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10505133"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tmT7cS"&gt;There is a live page for the game on Pac-Man’s &lt;a href="https://pacman.com/en/games/livestudio.php"&gt;official website&lt;/a&gt;, which says &lt;em&gt;Live Studio&lt;/em&gt; is “coming soon” and lists Bandai Namco as the developer and Amazon Games as the publisher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rvrXLN"&gt;There’s also a live Twitter account, @&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/playpacmanlive?lang=en"&gt;PlayPacManLive&lt;/a&gt;, that has only &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayPacManLive/status/1263642826018971651"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayPacManLive/status/1280317322842931201"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayPacManLive/status/1290349893421211648"&gt;handful&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayPacManLive/status/1290350207553564672"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayPacManLive/status/1290350895025143809"&gt;tweets&lt;/a&gt;. The latest is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayPacManLive/status/1295162966736695297"&gt;from August 16th, 2020&lt;/a&gt; (in reply to a tweet from an account that no longer exists) saying that “we’re getting closer to having all the pellets in place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="A3DCbe"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We're getting closer to having all the pellets in place, and coffee breaks activated. We greatly appreciate your patience.&lt;/p&gt;— PAC-MAN LIVE STUDIO (@PlayPacManLive) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayPacManLive/status/1295162966736695297?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 17, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ewPnZ2"&gt;When I reached out about the game’s status, Amazon said it forwarded my inquiry about the status of the game to Bandai Namco, which hasn’t responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ExYxX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pac-Man Live Studio&lt;/em&gt; could indicate yet another example of an Amazon-backed game failing to materialize. Hero shooter &lt;em&gt;Crucible&lt;/em&gt; launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/5/21246923/amazon-crucible-relentless-studio-free-to-play-launch-date-may-20"&gt;last May&lt;/a&gt; but was put back into closed beta &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308638/amazon-game-studios-crucible-closed-beta-failure-relentless-studio"&gt;in July&lt;/a&gt; and eventually canceled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21510190/amazon-crucible-canceled-game-studios-closed-beta"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt;. The studio also canceled a &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; online roleplaying game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/17/22389533/amazon-canceled-lord-of-the-rings-game-tencent"&gt;in April&lt;/a&gt; after a contract dispute with Tencent. (Amazon is still working on its &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/16/amazons-lord-of-the-rings-will-cost-at-least-465-million.html"&gt;extremely expensive &lt;em&gt;Lord of Rings&lt;/em&gt; series&lt;/a&gt;, however.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHQ9wH"&gt;And open-world MMO &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt;, Amazon Games’ current marquee title (and, I should add, the only one listed in &lt;a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/games"&gt;the Games section&lt;/a&gt; of the studio’s website), was delayed for the third time from a spring 2021 release to August 31st &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285810/new-world-amazon-delay-august-2021-release-date"&gt;in February&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RRqMbI"&gt;If &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man Live Studio&lt;/em&gt; never comes out, it could also indicate that Amazon is scaling back potential ambitions to offer playable games on Twitch. &lt;em&gt;Live Studio&lt;/em&gt; isn’t just supposed to let you play the classic &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man&lt;/em&gt; mazes you’re familiar with — it’s also set to offer co-op with up to four players and let you create and share your own mazes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="OndETz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10505115"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rgW81Q"&gt;Of course, many games have been delayed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363769/halo-infinite-delay-launch-2021-release-date-xbox-series-x"&gt;due to the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s not clear that’s what is happening here, particularly because both Amazon and Bandai Namco have been so quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zeFEtr"&gt;Despite Amazon Games’ many recent cancellations, the company recently reiterated support for game development. In response to a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-01-29/amazon-game-studios-struggles-to-find-a-hit?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;damning &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report from January&lt;/a&gt; describing problems at the studio, incoming Amazon CEO Andy Jassy shared a memo internally, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-03/andy-jassy-next-amazon-ceo-says-he-s-committed-to-making-video-games?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;also reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, stating the company’s continued commitment to gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VUJBEn"&gt;“Some businesses take off in the first year, and others take many years,” Jassy reportedly wrote. “Though we haven’t consistently succeeded yet in AGS, I believe we will if we hang in there.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA chief Bill Nelson talks rockets, Moon plans, and partnerships</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W7VFcZThhQKAEExmGmPg5Mj5osw=/0x0:4496x2997/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69300922/_MG_3485.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Nelson on his first few days on the job: ‘I’m drinking from a firehose’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="55j0ie"&gt;As a politician, space was Bill Nelson’s thing. He started out as a state lawmaker near Florida’s Space Coast, ascended to Congress in 1978, then became the House’s first sitting member to actually go to space in 1986, flying as a payload specialist aboard Space Shuttle Columbia. He’d spend three terms in the Senate shaping NASA’s budget and helping steer, from the policy side, NASA’s plans to return to the Moon, before losing a reelection bid in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rpl4ln"&gt;Now, he’s on the other side, leading the agency he oversaw for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="48Q06W"&gt;Sworn in as NASA’s 14th administrator on May 3rd, Nelson helms the space agency at a pivotal moment, with a lot already on his plate. He’s tasked with putting astronauts back on the Moon, sustaining a growing bloc of international partners, shaping the fate of the 20-year-old International Space Station, and boosting NASA’s Earth Sciences wing to play a larger role in studying climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n1N5pN"&gt;Like his predecessor, congressman-turned-NASA chief Jim Bridenstine, Nelson wants to leverage his Senate experience to return humans to the Moon by 2024, a deadline set by the Trump administration. President Biden’s transition team &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22323621/trump-moon-program-artemis-biden-nasa-timeline"&gt;scoffed&lt;/a&gt; at the 2024 goal as unrealistic, but Nelson is embracing it in a measured approach, holding off on ditching it while acknowledging a moonshot is no easy task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FeQzt7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A feud over NASA’s Moon lander award presents the first test of Nelson’s Senate ties&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5WuzAB"&gt;He already faces some challenges. Last year, Congress gave NASA only a quarter of what it requested to fund its first ride to the Moon since 1972. The agency, hamstrung by a tight budget, ditched a plan to pick two companies and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387887/elon-musk-spacex-win-nasa-lunar-lander-contract-artemis"&gt;awarded Elon Musk’s SpaceX&lt;/a&gt; a lone $3 billion contract to tailor its budding Starship rocket for two initial test flights to the lunar surface, including the first astronaut landing in 2024. That spawned a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404528/nasa-bezo-blue-origin-protest-spacex-contract"&gt;wave of opposition from the two losing companies&lt;/a&gt; that were also in the running for the contract, as well as pushback from Nelson’s old buddies in the Senate. They’re calling on NASA to reopen the competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mft6ej"&gt;On Friday, May 14th, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; sat down with Nelson, virtually, to chat about his new duties as NASA administrator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ePb0s9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ZTrNH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How are you enjoying your new gig at NASA? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzB1T3"&gt;I’m drinking from a firehose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7wbIQD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ha, what’s that like? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p9qr9D"&gt;It’s like trying to take sips of water with an avalanche of water coming at you. [&lt;em&gt;Laughs&lt;/em&gt;] I’m having a ball, is the true statement. Of course, this is a subject matter that I have had some experience in and I’m passionate about. It’s just a great privilege for me to have been nominated and confirmed for this job. So we got a lot going on this year, and you’ll be seeing these things unfold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4fjXoJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It looks like your first big test is this Human Landing System dilemma we’re seeing unfold, with &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404528/nasa-bezo-blue-origin-protest-spacex-contract"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bid protests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432236/cantwell-authorization-bill-nasa-moon-lander-bezos-blue-origin"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sen. Maria Cantwell’s amendment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; aiming to reopen the competition that SpaceX won. Have you put your Senate experience to use and talked to your Senate buddies about this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RBo5oP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Congress has got to do its part”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jOYs1L"&gt;So. I’ve been having a lot of conversations with senators, congressmen, and particularly their staff, and White House staff as well. This is about the budget, and I’ve been making the case that we need vigorous competition going forward on the Human Landing System. And of course, everything’s frozen up until the first of August, with the protest of the SpaceX award. Depending on how that goes, either way, we’re going to need the competition. Maria Cantwell, at my confirmation hearing, was talking about that. And of course, I assured her that competition is good, and you get greater efficiencies and greater performance out of competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="odERqS"&gt;But Congress has got to do its part. And that is to prepare, plan for, and provide the money so we can have a vigorous competition and have more than one awardee. In last year’s budget, NASA had requested $3.4 billion for this competition, and Congress came up with $850 million. You just can’t do the competition with that kind of funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZMfmXw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With the protest litigation pending, and without much funding, it’s unclear if NASA can simply add another company to work alongside SpaceX. But with this 2024 goal in mind, do you think quickly reopening the HLS competition to add another company, alongside SpaceX, should be the way to go? Or should those other companies wait to take advantage of future competitions?  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qUUYSh"&gt;Well, if SpaceX’s award is not overturned, and you continue as a result of the Government Accountability Office saying that SpaceX is the winner, then what you have to do is look at all these follow-on contracts. SpaceX’s award is for only a demonstration flight that would land humans and return them to Earth safely. Then you get into the use contracts — and there’ll be many of them — and that’s what the competition will be for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4KApUg"&gt;If the bid protest is successful, then you have to start the original competition over again, and that’s where Congress hopefully will provide the resources in which to do a vigorous competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EWXmBq"&gt;The SpaceX award says they can land on the Moon in 2024. Of course, we know that space is hard, that because of developing technology and the unique environment of space and so forth, history often tells us that you get delays. But 2024 is the schedule as outlined in the award, and that’s what we’re planning for — at the same time recognizing the sobering reality that space is hard.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Then-nominee for NASA administrator Bill Nelson bumps elbows with Sen. Maria Cantwell, chair of the Senate commerce committee that oversees NASA, after his confirmation hearing on April 21st, 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1mZHyW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s talk about NASA’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338638/nasa-space-launch-system-hot-fire-test"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space Launch System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;How do you view the future of SLS? What role should SLS play long-term in NASA’s vision for the Moon?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3bWCGE"&gt;Remember the context, that SLS was conceived when we passed that NASA bill 11 years ago that set NASA on the dual course mandate. The commercial course, and then the other course, was to get NASA out of low-Earth orbit and go explore beyond LEO. It was felt at the time that we needed to get going, and we saw the opportunities under the advice of NASA to take a lot of the technologies that had been developing for the Space Shuttle, enhance them, and utilize them into what is today the SLS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T49t9g"&gt;The SLS, as we speak, is being stacked in the Vehicle Assembly Building at [Kennedy Space Center]. So I think there’s going to be a vigorous future for the SLS, and it will take our astronauts into the vicinity of the Moon, into what is called a cislunar orbit. So yes, there will be a lot of activity with the SLS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJh70e"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are some folks in the space community who criticize the SLS program as being a kind of jobs program and that, despite the rocket’s proven shuttle hardware, the cost and design of commercial rockets have evolved significantly since Congress initiated that dual course objective. Would you agree with that at all? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W8Nyp7"&gt;Remember, space is hard. And the SLS is getting ready to fly. The others that were the ones in the competition, none of those have flown. So you have to build step by step. So put it in context as you’re evaluating that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nuGUEe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On climate and Earth sciences — the Biden administration has vowed to boost the country’s edge in tackling climate change. What kind of new investments and programs are we going to see for climate science and green aviation in NASA’s budget request coming up? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EaEkRt"&gt;As I said at my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395950/bill-nelson-backs-nasas-moon-plans-climate-change-work-in-confirmation-hearing"&gt;confirmation hearing&lt;/a&gt;, if you want to mitigate climate change, you have to measure it. And who does that? That’s NASA that builds the spacecraft. So take, for example, we’re going to be putting up Landsat 9, and this is after 50 years of Landsat in partnership with the [United States Geological Survey]. NASA provides repetitive imaging and it shows, over that half-century, what’s happening in the human interaction with the environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IHP3p1"&gt;I could clearly see that 36 years ago with the naked eye from the window of a spacecraft. I could see, for example, going across the southern tip of Africa and out over the Indian Ocean. And lo and behold, there’s the island nation of Madagascar, and they had cut down all the trees on Madagascar. And when the rains came, there was no vegetation to hold the topsoil. The topsoil went down the rivers, and you could clearly see that from space. All the mouths of the rivers had discolored significantly that bright blue color of the Indian Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cgcEvX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I wanted to switch to international partnerships. As a senator, you sometimes took tough stances on Russia. You frequently called them out in 2018 for their hacking of Florida elections systems. Now you’re at NASA, where Russia is one of its biggest partners in space. Will you have to switch your views a bit with regard to Russia, and what future do you see for NASA’s partnership?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AODUKp"&gt;Russia has been our partner ever since the ice was broken in the middle of the Cold War in 1975, with Apollo-Soyuz. We have built the International Space Station with them. I believe that, as long as we’re involved in the space station, Russia will continue to be our partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WAsbNF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I see a continuing, close cooperation” with Russia&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YDp6lE"&gt;You probably know that I want to expand the life of the station to 2023, and the idea would eventually be that you let private industry build the space station thereafter. And NASA could concentrate on the continuing exploration of the cosmos. But I see a continuing close cooperation. Regardless of the statements that you hear coming from time to time that would indicate otherwise, I just think, at the end of the day, Russia’s going to continue to be our partner. I think we have to watch the things like Russia and China saying that they’re going to cooperate on landing on the Moon, but it’s a big difference saying that than doing it. So I want to continue the partnership with the Russians. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pgygrg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s your view on partnering with China? Through the Wolf Amendment, NASA is largely barred from partnering with China. Many former NASA officials have supported the idea of working more with China, as they &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22321114/lunar-moon-space-station-russia-china-agreement-nasa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;court NASA allies like Russia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. And Pam Melroy, your incoming deputy, last year was &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/20/biden-china-space-448529"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;quoted by &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Politico&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; as saying that trying to exclude China “is a failing strategy.” Do you agree with her on that, and should NASA engage with China?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D8ed2Z"&gt;Well, it is the law. And until the law is changed, we’re going to adhere to the law. There are obvious things that, regardless of the law, you can still cooperate with China on. For example, if China is successful in landing a lander today on Mars, there are things that we can share. [Editor’s Note: a few hours later, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436072/china-tianwen-1-mars-landing-zhurong-rover"&gt;it landed successfully&lt;/a&gt;.] Going forward in the future, there are things that we need to share with China, such as the avoidance of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422791/china-long-march-5b-uncontrollable-rocket-stage-crash-low-risk-public"&gt;space junk&lt;/a&gt;. So there are many, many things like that where you can really have a cooperative relationship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="blTFyg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Given the state of growing Russia-China relations right now, do you think that law, the Wolf Amendment, should be changed? Or would you make any effort to change the Wolf Amendment? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wyeH8z"&gt;Give me a while to be in the saddle, and then I’ll answer your question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7svgDz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks so much for chatting, Bill. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="wmSEa5"&gt;My pleasure. Call us anytime!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple wants you to know it chose not to take a cut of $400 billion in physical goods </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="phil schiller stock 2015" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kRuNIiR8ZxOfS5m6Tc5J9TCzqA0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69300846/verge-2015-09-09_12-31-45.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aUS15t"&gt;Apple is trying to convince a judge &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423567/apple-epic-app-store-policies-fortnite-trial-day-4"&gt;that it’s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; milking the App Store for all it’s worth&lt;/a&gt;, and today the company dropped some big numbers to help make its case. Apple claims that its App Store drove $400 billion worth of physical purchases in a single year in 2019, and that — unlike digital purchases and subscriptions — Apple doesn’t take a cent of that money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TMyZWo"&gt;That’s according to App Store boss and longtime Apple marketing exec Phil Schiller, who also testified that the company spends a staggering $50 million a year to throw its Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) event. The company’s also building a new developer center at its Apple Loop headquarters in Cupertino, he says, though I didn’t catch how much the company’s investing in that. None of these are included in the App Store’s budget, Schiller testified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ok6hdJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Schiller says in 2019 App Store drove $400 billion+ in transactions of physical goods, so food delivery, Amazon, Uber/Lyft, etc. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Judge interjects. “Billion with a b?” It’s a big number, and Schiller confirms Apple doesn’t take a cut of that.&lt;/p&gt;— Nick Statt (@nickstatt) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nickstatt/status/1394363213932863488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="kScH5F"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Schiller’s going over the explanation Apple has given before for why it doesn’t take a commission on physical goods: it can’t guarantee they actually arrive. (This logic goes for things like Lyft/Uber as well, per earlier discussion.)&lt;/p&gt;— Adi Robertson (@thedextriarchy) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thedextriarchy/status/1394362691859492869?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q6t7Er"&gt;Why isn’t Apple trying to take a cut of physical purchases? During his testimony, Schiller explained that Apple couldn’t guarantee they would actually arrive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9F1N9L"&gt;But I also imagine it might have been a hard sell with developers: can Apple really argue that it drove those $400 billion in purchases by itself? If I’m going to buy something online, I’ll probably start by whipping out my phone, but I’ve got a laptop with a perfectly good web browser right here to buy those same items, if an app doesn’t immediately do the job. Amazon knows this, and used it to bypass Apple’s digital cut on movies and shows, too, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206400/apple-tax-amazon-tv-prime-30-percent-developers"&gt;until it got a better deal&lt;/a&gt;. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348130/apple-documents-steve-jobs-email-books-amazon-apps-antitrust-investigation-schiller"&gt;Digital books are a different matter&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="GwhEyz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Read Steve Jobs’ emails about why you can’t buy digital books in Amazon’s apps","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348130/apple-documents-steve-jobs-email-books-amazon-apps-antitrust-investigation-schiller"},{"title":"Why Amazon got out of the Apple App Store tax, and why other developers won’t","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206400/apple-tax-amazon-tv-prime-30-percent-developers"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="j1bzfO"&gt;Even without a cut of physical purchases, Apple’s App Store cut is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220873/apple-2020-app-store-revenue-60-billion-dollars"&gt;estimated to rake in $64 billion for the company each year&lt;/a&gt;, with profit margins &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22414402/epic-expert-apple-app-store-fortnite-court-profit"&gt;approaching a ludicrous 78 percent&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dXfgHH"&gt;Schiller testified that 84 percent of all App Store apps are completely free, with roughly 75 percent of all games on the App Store completely free. Of those games, approximately 17 percent are freemium (requiring in-app purchases to unlock content) and 6 percent are paid, leaving just 2 percent on a subscription model if we do the math.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Display is showing off new foldable tech</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QTk_hAE5ag1ZXNCS4g7AKUWtiz0=/0x15:820x562/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69300675/foldable_concept.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s display division is working on a bi-folding OLED panel suitable for folding phones.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung Display&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8J1SSe"&gt;This year has seen no shortage of rollable display demos from manufacturers, and now Samsung Display is the latest company to show off new concepts for folding and sliding screens. &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsungs-new-foldable-and-udc-panels-reveal-an-exciting-future/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt; spotted&lt;/a&gt; the concepts being showcased as part of a virtual Display Week exhibition (if you forgot to mail out your Happy Display Week cards, there’s still time since it &lt;a href="http://www.displayweek.org/"&gt;runs through Friday&lt;/a&gt;) including a “multi-foldable” mobile display and a large 17-inch folding screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRlPZr"&gt;The company calls its first concept S-foldable, with a bi-fold design that opens up to a maximum screen size of 7.2 inches. It’s similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt; except, well, plus one fold. There’s also a sliding mobile display similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224591/lg-rollable-phone-extending-display-teaser-ces-2021"&gt;ill-fated rollable concept&lt;/a&gt; LG showed off earlier this year before leaving the smartphone space altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BQ1emc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10505033"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8S0EHO"&gt;Samsung Display is also showing two concepts for bigger panels, including a 17-inch foldable OLED that’s tablet-sized when folded and can function as a monitor when unfolded. Finally, there’s a more traditional-looking laptop display; it doesn’t fold or flex, but it does include an under-display camera — hopefully it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22191459/zte-axon-20-5g-under-display-camera-hands-on"&gt;better than the last one&lt;/a&gt; we used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="prKcyC"&gt;Samsung Display is a division of Samsung Electronics, and it produces OLED panels for use by Samsung and other consumer tech manufacturers. So while these concepts may end up in future Samsung products, it’s certainly not guaranteed. The company as a whole hasn’t been shy about embracing foldable technology, getting into the foldable device market early. It may have more company soon; display OEM TCL has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225446/tcl-rollable-phone-extendable-display-concepts-ces2021"&gt;shown off its own concepts&lt;/a&gt; and says it will bring one to market this year. Until then, we’ll be watching and filling out our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/15/18266637/folding-phones-bendable-screens-names-illustrated-guide"&gt;foldable concept&lt;/a&gt; bingo cards.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oculus’ latest Quest update brings mixed reality capture that only requires an iPhone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Oculus Live Overlay" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qx2j4P7bOpiv5Rz3lbJiNRL73EQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69300645/oculusliveoverlay.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Oculus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PO5Lxs"&gt;Oculus will soon roll out its v29 software for Quest and Quest 2 headsets, and this one adds more features and functionality to the lineup. The most exciting one is a new Live Overlay casting feature that will give you an easy way to capture a mixed reality view of you using VR superimposed over the content displayed in your headset. Any VR app that supports casting and recording will work with this feature, according to Oculus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uUoflT"&gt;All you’ll need is at least an iPhone XS or newer, a Quest headset, and the Oculus app for iOS updated to a new version that’s coming to “a subset of users.” Then you turn on the feature and have someone aim the camera at you (or aim it at yourself).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TzQWF1"&gt;There are other highlights to mention in this software version, but I want to focus a moment longer on how big of a technical achievement Live Overlay seems to be. The company’s previous solution, its &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtYxJnvyqtg"&gt;Mixed Reality Capture Tool&lt;/a&gt; on PC for Quest and Rift S, required a bunch of expensive hardware, including a rig with 16GB of RAM, a decent graphics card, your own 1080p webcam, a 5GHz Wi-Fi router, and — of course — your own green screen. But for lucky iOS users who get the app update, Oculus’ improved feature has eliminated the need for almost all of those gadgets. You just need your headset and your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X239Dy"&gt;In other casting news, Oculus is allowing you to capture what you’re saying into your headset’s built-in microphone during casting sessions or when you’re recording a video clip. It’s also extending multi-user support and the app sharing feature to owners of the original Quest, so multiple people can share games on a single headset. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289577/facebook-rolling-out-multi-user-support-oculus-quest-2"&gt;These features were originally limited to the Quest 2&lt;/a&gt;, but Oculus is making good on its pledge to bring them to the Quest.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Oculus files app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IepGoo1U9sDFI_bY0nFAkTrx9lA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22520891/oculusfilemanager.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4REj2I"&gt;There’s a Files app coming with this update, and it’ll be located within your app library. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Fsee-yourself-in-vr-with-live-overlay-plus-new-infinite-office-features-and-more-in-latest-oculus-update%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Oculus says in its blog post&lt;/a&gt; that you’ll be able to download and upload media files “to and from your favorite websites” through the browser built into the headset. In other words, it should be a lot easier to upload content to social media sites other than Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S5LvsE"&gt;The last couple of additions include an Infinite Office update that lets iOS users (using an iPhone 7 and newer, with Android support coming soon) see lock screen notifications from within a Quest headset. Oculus is also adding a shortcut for its Passthrough command to the user interface in the Quick Settings menu, giving you an alternative method of triggering it instead of physically double-tapping the side of your headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0SmwFs"&gt;Lastly, Oculus will begin showing ads for VR experiences within the mobile app with the intent to broaden discovery for both developers looking for an audience and users to find new content. This could be useful for smaller developers who have built quality experiences but don’t have the awareness of more popular apps. That said, if you’re a curious Quest owner looking for new experiences, I suggest checking out SideQuest on PC or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22395923/sidequest-android-app-sideload-oculus-quest-2-virtual-reality-apps-games-experiences"&gt;from an Android phone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Riot suspends Valorant pro six months for failing to cooperate in sexual assault investigation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Sinatraa" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aSoToUrFq1LGJatejpLgJ-SRhcQ=/58x0:901x562/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69300572/unnamed.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iuUrNP"&gt;Professional &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt; player Jay “Sinatraa” Won has been suspended for six months by Riot Games for “failing to fully cooperate” with an ongoing investigation into an allegation of sexual assault. The investigation stems from an allegation dating back to March of this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323695/jay-sinatraa-won-valorant-suspended-sexual-assault-allegations"&gt;when Won was accused of sexual abuse by a former girlfriend&lt;/a&gt;, which was supported by recordings and screenshots of messages. At the time, Won was indefinitely suspended by both Riot, which develops &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt; and organizes most online competitions, and Sentinels, the team for which he plays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fiRFvI"&gt;According to Riot, this latest suspension is related to Won’s behavior during the investigation. &lt;a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/esports/competitive-ruling-jay-sinatraa-won/"&gt;In a statement&lt;/a&gt;, the company said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="pJbvGR"&gt;The competitive operations team had serious concerns with Sinatraa’s conduct during the course of the investigation. It was determined that on at least two occasions Sinatraa misrepresented certain facts, made false statements, and did not cooperate with the investigation in a way expected of a professional &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt; esports player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9qenib"&gt;Of note, Sinatraa’s public commitment on social media to provide the full audio and video clip referenced in the original post was never fulfilled. Cooperation in these investigations is of the utmost importance, especially when the nature of the allegations is as serious as sexual assault. This behavior will not be tolerated by &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt; Esports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="KU4bnr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21240497/overwatch-league-sinatraa-leaving-sf-shock-valorant"&gt;Won began competing in &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt; last year&lt;/a&gt; but rose to prominence in the &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League, where he was named MVP in 2019 — though &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/overwatchleague/status/1369827584955977729"&gt;OWL began offering refunds&lt;/a&gt; on his in-game MVP skin following the allegations in March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WVYV5q"&gt;Following Riot’s decision today, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sinatraa/status/1394384776476381184"&gt;Won released a statement on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; saying that “I’ve spent the last two months reflecting on how I can be better as a person.” With regards to the investigation, he wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OfIS9X"&gt;I want to preface this by saying I do not have the video / audio that she used in her statement. After our relationship ended she had asked me to delete the video and I honored that. I’ve never even imagined a situation like this so when it all happened I didn’t know whether to just spill out my side or not. I had no clue what to do so I seeked &lt;em&gt;[sic]&lt;/em&gt; legal help immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jXJW3q"&gt;As we were drafting up an update with the legal PR team we had added that I would provide the video because we genuinely thought that the video would have to be shared in full since it’s a key part in the investigation. However that did not happen and I should not have promised something I could not personally deliver. This entire experience has been humbling and an opportunity for me to come out the other side a better person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Qt6Nt2"&gt;As for the initial allegation of sexual assault, Riot said that because the matter has been referred to law enforcement, “at this juncture we will defer to the authorities to make further investigation into and factual findings related to the allegations.” Riot added that “to the extent that additional material information comes to light, from law enforcement or otherwise, the competitive operations team reserves the right to reopen the investigation and take further appropriate action.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zZ9DFu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 17th, 4:40PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Article updated with a statement from Won.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s WorkingWell will attempt to fix employee health issues with stretching and guided meditation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qhc97lakaEwo0NYIBBtSrPPQhsk=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69300419/Health___Saftey_Huddles__2_.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="W9pC5t"&gt;Amazon is launching &lt;a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/body-mechanics-mindfulness-amazon-launches-employee-designed"&gt;a new series of health programs&lt;/a&gt; called WorkingWell designed to prevent workplace injuries in the company’s expansive system of warehouses and distribution centers in the US. While the new health program is an attempt to address the 40 percent of work-related injuries Amazon has identified as musculoskeletal disorders (think carpal tunnel syndrome or back pain), it doesn’t come with any changes to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266369/amazon-ten-hour-overnight-shifts-warehouse-workers"&gt;the long shifts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21493752/amazon-warehouses-robots-higher-injury-rates-report-reveal"&gt;demanding working conditions&lt;/a&gt; that might cause them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BxQvKK"&gt;As part of WorkingWell, workers will have dedicated meetings to watch videos covering health and safety topics, and designated spaces for stretching and meditating at work. Depending on the station and job, some workers will also receive timed video prompts to guide them through stretching and mental wellness exercises (Amazon calls these “Mind and Body Moments”). Amazon also plans to stock more healthy snacks in break rooms to round out the health-focused lifestyle it’s trying to promote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ETOKx9"&gt;Outside of the warehouse, Amazon says it’ll offer “Neighborhood Wellness Centers” for some of employees’ primary care needs — covering everything from filling prescriptions and offering vaccines, to ongoing care like physical therapy. Because this is a tech company trying to tackle “health,” there’s also a mobile app that will collect all of Amazon’s educational videos and guided AmaZen meditations (yes, that’s the name) for employees to use at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ctQAO0"&gt;In March, Amazon was criticized &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331502/amazon-warehouse-gamification-program-expand-fc-games"&gt;for how it uses gamification&lt;/a&gt; to increase employee performance, and it’s hard to not see WorkingWell as an extension of that kind of thinking. It arrives after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385762/bezos-letter-shareholders-amazon-workers-union-bessemer-workplace"&gt;Jeff Bezos told shareholders&lt;/a&gt; the company needs to “do a better job for our employees,” but it seems to help make the case that the kinds of structural changes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/28/22352987/amazon-bessemer-alabama-union-vote-rwdsu"&gt;the various Amazon unions&lt;/a&gt; are trying to win are far better than anything the company is willing to freely offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UYrRtk"&gt;Amazon plans to offer WorkingWell in all of its US operations network by the end of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
