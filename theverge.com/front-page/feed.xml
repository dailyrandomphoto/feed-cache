    <title>Polar’s Grit X multisport watch goes Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5Z0KhYhKsPyOzfB0ZCm3GBELcEc=/13x0:2040x1351/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69958059/verge_DSC_6507__1__2040pxl.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Polar Grit X Pro (shown in copper colorway) features a sapphire lens and rugged FKM strap.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Thomas Ricker / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oMNhJH"&gt;Polar is making a number of updates to its family of sport watches today. This includes the launch of the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polar.com%2Fus-en%2Fgrit-x-pro&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F6%2F22710376%2Fpolar-grit-x-pro-hands-on-multisport-watch-price-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Polar Grit X Pro&lt;/a&gt; for outdoor multisport enthusiasts, alongside feature and design tweaks to the company’s “premium” Vantage V2 multisport watch and Polar Unite fitness watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uyklzd"&gt;The Grit X Pro is an update to the Grit X launched last year. For an extra $70, the $499.90 Pro model adds a tougher sapphire lens and a durable yet supple FKM watch band. Otherwise, you’re pretty much looking at the same specs as last year: GPS/A-GPS, waterproof to 100 meters, turn-by-turn navigation when linked with Komoot, and what’s considered to be one of the most accurate heart rate sensors available on any watch. Grit X watches will last for up to 40 hours of battery life in full GPS and heart-rate tracking modes, up to 100 hours by disabling some features, or up to seven days in watch mode. The Grit X Pro is available in copper, black, and gold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kbkoUn"&gt;If weight is a primary concern (rugged multisport watches are heavy!), then Polar is also selling a titanium version, which is 12 percent lighter for $599.95 — a price that includes a second band made of leather. That makes the Grit X Pro Titan the most expensive sport watch in Polar’s lineup. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7QP5rXbf8rWVsjq5zH1maDSijVE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902072/Grit_X_Pro_Groupshot.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Polar&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Grit X Pro comes in 3 new colorways as well as a lighter weight titanium model (2nd from left).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SZvTge"&gt;Polar sent me a copper-colored Grit X Pro review unit to test. Although I’ve only used it for a few days, I can already say that the Pro model, like the Grit X it builds upon, offers a respectable mix of features for the price. It lacks some capabilities like V02max to measure your maximal oxygen uptake, on-device topographic trail maps, and local storage for music that you’ll find on other multisport outdoor watches, but Polar’s latest covers most of the basics nicely. Uniquely, Polar’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polar.com%2Fen%2Fsmart-coaching%2Ffit-spark&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F6%2F22710376%2Fpolar-grit-x-pro-hands-on-multisport-watch-price-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fitspark workout suggestions&lt;/a&gt; are actually quite useful since they’re tailored to my current fitness level, goals, activity history, and nightly recharge score that takes into account how well I’ve slept. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TsgAkO"&gt;I also really like the weight, look, and textured buttons of the Grit X Pro, but I find the display to be less readable, both indoors and out, compared to class-leading sport watches like the more expensive &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbuy.garmin.com%2Fen-US%2FUS%2Fp%2F641479%2Fpn%2F010-02158-01&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F6%2F22710376%2Fpolar-grit-x-pro-hands-on-multisport-watch-price-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Garmin Fenix 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. I like the texture of the FKM rubber band, and the durability looks promising compared to the basic silicone bands often bundled with other sport watches (I tore one of Garmin’s while mountain biking, for example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xzY39r"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10790754"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wj3NLX"&gt;Polar’s $499.95 Vantage V2, launched last year, is the company’s multisport watch for those repulsed by the Grit’s chiseled aesthetic. It’s also the multisport watch you choose when tracking your V02max is a significant concern (hello, runners). Now, in addition to a new bright red colorway, Polar is giving the Vantage V2 the ability to quickly swap out bands to make this sport watch suitable for more occasions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C7y-HXgaxfokMNc3iLS52LZqFAQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902986/Polar_Vantage_V2_frontleft_GREY_Shift_edition_Hillsplitter_Cycling.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Polar&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vantage V2 Shift Edition in silver.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gOKqXwHqZBxVa47XcWbnPtjK3jI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902154/Polar_Vantage_V2_back_OHR_Grey_leather_Shift_edition.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Polar&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New quick-release bar for bands.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P4Fuzb"&gt;Today, the Vantage V2 is getting a $549.95 Shift Edition, available in silver and black, that ships with leather and FKM straps fitted with new quick release bars. Current Vantage V2 owners can buy a $49.95 Shift Edition bundle, which includes the quick-release adapter bars and choice of any 22mm Polar band. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AL67Xn"&gt;Vantage V2 owners are also getting a 3.0 software update that mirrors the latest additions added to the Grit X Pro. These include always-on dashboard features like compass and altimeter, navigation features to help you return to the start of your journey, and an HR sensor mode that uses Bluetooth to show your heart rate on gym equipment and mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U6Az8Niy6Pn1HaueWp26L_wmas8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902166/Unite_green.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Polar&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Polar Unite and the sad reality of stay-at-home fitness.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MtNVFc"&gt;Finally, Polar is giving its lightweight (32g) $149.95 Unite watch new red and teal colorways alongside a software update. The update trickles down features like weekly summaries and energy source (carbs, proteins, and fats) consumption estimates available on other Polar watches, in addition to the same HR sensor mode coming to the Vantage V2.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HMD’s Nokia is getting into Android tablets with the $249.99 T20</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8jt3Se871mUBUNUDN1ivN2ONomc=/0x0:8448x5632/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69958070/Nokia_T20_00000269_v1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 10.4-inch tablet.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: HMD&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PwFMTa"&gt;After years of focusing on phones, HMD is releasing its first Android tablet under the Nokia brand name — something we haven’t seen since the real Nokia launched the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/11/18/7239709/nokia-n1-tablet-price-release-date"&gt;N1 Android tablet back in 2014&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JlgrZr"&gt;The T20 is a 10.4-inch tablet designed to be used for working and studying from home. Pricing starts at $249.99 in the US where it will be available from November 17th, while in the UK the tablet will be available from today starting at £179.99 for the Wi-Fi version, or £199.99 for the LTE model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yr2ss3"&gt;As you might expect from its affordable price point, the Nokia T20 is not a powerhouse of an Android tablet. It’s powered by a modest Unisoc Tiger T610 processor, and in the US and UK comes with 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of expandable storage. HMD reckons its 8,200mAh battery is good for 15 hours of web surfing, 7 hours of conference calls, or 10 hours of film watching.  The tablet supports 15W fast-charging.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8Vxvc79hCHY_7GXfYTxTfl2g8k0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902858/Nokia_T20_Emotional_Landscape.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HMD&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note the webcam, oriented for landscape video calls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FWP4td"&gt;Around the front you’ll find the tablet’s 10.4-inch 1200 x 2000 display flanked by a 5-megapixel webcam that’s thankfully located on the long side of the display (better for calls when the tablet is in landscape). Around back there’s an 8-megapixel camera if you’re the kind of person who likes to take photos with a tablet. It’s got a dust and water resistance rating of IP52, which means it should survive a light splash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bnujti"&gt;On the software side, HMD says it’s sticking to a stock Android experience, which isn’t great news considering the lack of tablet-optimized apps. Other manufacturers like Samsung have added their own software features like DeX to overcome Android’s large-screen shortcomings, but HMD doesn’t plan to do the same. The T20 will launch with Android 11, and HMD is promising two years of major OS updates, and three years of monthly security updates. There’s no extended warranty here, like we saw with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22372444/hmd-nokia-x20-specs-release-date-price-news-quad-camera"&gt;Nokia X20 earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JP2je1"&gt;In the T20’s box you get a USB-C charging cable and brick, but the company is also separately selling a flip case and rugged case if you want to protect the tablet from bumps and scratches. The rugged case will be priced at $39.99 / £39.99, and the flip case $59.99 / £49.99.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Telegram gains 70M new users in just one day after Facebook outage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tEIeHxdQb9sqoku3-laLD-WU59k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69958049/acastro_180417_1777_telegram_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gNknxS"&gt;Messaging app Telegram gained a “record” 70 million new users on Monday, as Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708989/instagram-facebook-outage-messenger-whatsapp-error"&gt;experienced a nearly six-hour long outage&lt;/a&gt; across its services, &lt;a href="https://t.me/durov/170"&gt;Telegram CEO Pavel Durov&lt;/a&gt; announced. Encrypted messaging app Signal also reported gaining “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/signalapp/status/1445164521102979080"&gt;millions&lt;/a&gt;” of new users on the same day. Both apps compete mainly with Facebook’s WhatsApp, although the outage also took down Facebook Messenger, and left users unable to send messages on Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d1ETGa"&gt;70 million new users is an increase of over 10 percent compared to the 500 million monthly active users Telegram had &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/telegram/status/1349014065931284480"&gt;as of January this year&lt;/a&gt;, the last time it reported a similar surge in new signups. Coincidentally, this last increase in users was also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226792/whatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification"&gt;helped by problems at Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. In January, WhatsApp mishandled the introduction of a new privacy policy, leading to concerns that it would be sharing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233257/whatsapp-privacy-policy-update-delayed-three-months"&gt;private user data with parent company Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7Azn7m"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“For the new users I’d like to say this – welcome to Telegram”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AFwYiR"&gt;Although Durov claimed that Telegram “continued to work flawlessly” in the face of its “unprecedented growth,” he admitted that “some users in the Americas may have experienced slower speed than usual as millions of users from these continents rushed to sign up for Telegram at the same time.” Signal users were also experiencing issues where they weren’t able to see all of their contacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EyVtSC"&gt;“For the new users I’d like to say this – welcome to Telegram, the largest independent messaging platform,” Durov wrote. “We won’t fail you when others will.” Telegram has long courted WhatsApp’s 2 billion users, and earlier this year added the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253918/telegram-ios-chat-history-import-whatsapp-line-kakaotalk"&gt;import WhatsApp chat histories&lt;/a&gt; in a move designed to help users switch from the Facebook-owned messaging service. Over the course of this year it’s also added other feature focused on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/26/22551652/telegram-adds-group-video-calling-chat"&gt;video calling&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22651880/telegram-version-8-live-streams-video-unlimited-participants-flexible-forwarding"&gt;live streaming&lt;/a&gt;, although it still &lt;a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/telegram-encryption-end-to-end-features"&gt;doesn’t offer end-to-end encryption by default&lt;/a&gt; unlike Signal and WhatsApp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xgZp6n"&gt;“Facebook-owned Whatsapp being down is a reminder that you and your friends should probably be using a more private, non-profit alternative like @Signalapp anyway,” wrote whistleblower Edward Snowden during the outage, “It’s just as free, and takes like 30 seconds to switch.” Snowden has long been a proponent of Signal, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/661313394906161152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E661313394906161152%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2015%2F11%2F3%2F9662724%2Fsignal-encrypted-chat-app-android-edward-snowden"&gt;said in 2015&lt;/a&gt; that he used it every day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZL1BX1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xAlNL6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nest Renew could make your smart home smarter </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9bU0JTETN52e0Jt0K0n-6X9FJQA=/0x90:3767x2601/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69957993/Person_Adjusting_Thermostat_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select Nest thermostats will soon be able to tell you when you are using green energy.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google Nest&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GqvbPT"&gt;Google has announced several new features for its Nest thermostats centered around helping the smart home become a bigger partner in the battle against climate change. These features are wrapped up in a new service called Nest Renew. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A194Cn"&gt;The service will use intelligent automation to allow the thermostats to communicate with energy providers and make it easier for Nest users to know when there is cleaner and / or cheaper energy on their local power grid. The device will then automatically adjust to use that energy at optimal times without you having to do a thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ym1RA"&gt;Nest Renew is the “First program of its kind,” said Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and it is entirely opt-in. It includes five main features: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="F6Fcyz"&gt;Energy Shift — automatic shifting of heating and cooling to times when energy is cheaper and / or cleaner &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5HlKBF"&gt;Monthly Impact Reports — a rundown of how clean the energy a home is using is, based on time of day, so people can adjust when they use non-connected devices to take advantage of clean energy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lOXHrc"&gt;Energy Impact Program — an option to gamify your eco-friendly choices. Users collect Nest’s green leaves to earn a vote in how Nest directs funds to clean energy nonprofits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cSFjMh"&gt;Clean Energy Match — the ability to match estimated fossil fuel electricity use at home with &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/11/9/9696820/renewable-energy-certificates"&gt;renewable energy credits&lt;/a&gt; (RECs) from US solar and wind plants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FNfbiE"&gt;Schedule Tuneups — a new version of the existing Seasonal Savings feature that makes small adjustments to your HVAC schedule based on the time of year to optimize energy use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Y4SvLD"&gt;Nest’s existing demand-side response program, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/18/22540015/psa-energy-saver-program-smart-thermostat-adjust-temperature-heat"&gt;Rush Hour Rewards&lt;/a&gt;, which is an energy-saving program where the utility company can remotely adjust a household’s thermostat to relieve pressure on the grid, will continue as a separate service. People can choose to run both services on their thermostat simultaneously, with the Rush Hour program taking priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HemXGp"&gt;Nest Renew will work on Nest’s newest thermostats, which are the third-generation Nest Learning Thermostat, the Nest Thermostat E, and the Nest Thermostat. Visual indicators on the thermostat, emails, and activity summaries will tell Nest users when the various functions are active. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ff1mGJ"&gt;There are two levels to Nest Renew: Renew Basic, which is free and will be available across the continental US, and Renew Premium, which costs $10 a month and is limited to select markets at launch (Google didn’t say which). The premium tier adds two features for $10 a month; the Clean Energy Match, which is a way to match the fossil fuel energy used with &lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/what-it-really-means-when-google-and-apple-say-they-run-on-100-renewable-energy-f6d1719fd865"&gt;renewable energy certificates&lt;/a&gt; that come from solar and wind plants in the US, and the option to pay utility bills through Nest Renew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AFrZL8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Energy Shift is the main feature of the new program&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WKOdIe"&gt;The main feature of Nest Renew is Energy Shift, and this is available in both the paid and free plans. This will automatically shift heating and cooling energy use to times when energy is cleaner and / or cheaper. Ben Brown, director of Product Management at Nest, explained that it will use small shifts — such as pre-cooling a house five or 10 minutes before the wind starts dying down or new demand spikes causing new energy plants to come online. “It will be just small coordinations based upon the needs of the grid that don’t sacrifice comfort at all,” he said. Nest customers will be able to manually adjust their thermostats if at any given moment they decide they’d rather be more comfortable than more green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7b3zxZ"&gt;Depending on where you live and who your energy provider is, the power coming to your home could be generated by fossil fuels during one part of the day and wind or solar at another. Google says Energy Shift uses intelligent automation to make adjustments based on forecasts of the type of power on the grid. It then adapts energy use to prioritize clean energy. The company partnered with the non-profit&lt;a href="https://www.watttime.org/"&gt; WattTime&lt;/a&gt;, which has developed algorithms to determine the marginal emissions rates of the grid in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qtWPCk"&gt;Energy Shift can also adjust around any “time-of-use” charges your energy provider might have. Time-of-use charges are when you are charged more for using electricity at, say, 7PM — when everyone is home cooking dinner and watching Netflix — than you would be if you did those activities at, say, 2AM. Time-of-use charging is prevalent in Europe and the UK but not so common in the US — yet. But it is coming. Energy providers see it as a way to incentivize people to use energy when there is less demand, helping them better balance demand on the grid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Kc02x"&gt;Nest says Energy Shift is a way its customers can navigate this change. “Certain regions are making it mandatory to move over to time-of-use plans — California and Michigan, for example,” said Brown. “Nest Renew will empower customers to manage their consumption against these time-of-use plans to make sure they can minimize their energy bills.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JoXwR7GK5gwMAgL7jz7bNBN3tUE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22903683/Person_on_Couch_Viewing_Nest_Renew.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nest Renew works with a near real-time  dashboard to help users see the type of energy on their local grid at certain times of day, allowing them to adjust their use in response.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tzDUtA"&gt;Time-of-use rates can be tricky to navigate. Running your HVAC system, for example, isn’t as easy to time as, say, running the dishwasher — which is something you can put off. Having a smart thermostat manage those calculations could make it easier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uCX1S2"&gt;Nest says it’s hoping to roll out Nest Renew to more household devices in the future, tying in with its smart displays and Google Home ecosystem. “We want to look at opportunities to empower other devices to coordinate with the needs of the grid; a good example would be electric vehicles,” said Brown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9I4yJ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://rmi.org/"&gt;RMI&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit working to accelerate the country’s transition to clean energy, analyzed the Nest Renew program and concluded that products like this could reduce around 50 million metric tons of CO2 per year if 10 million households participate. That’s approximately 7 percent of the gap between today’s level of household emissions and the US’s current target, which aims to cut emissions in half by 2030. With close to 123 million households in the US, the impact smart, connected homes could have on the climate change challenge will be even greater if even more people participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="khdMXr"&gt;Nest Renew will start in an invitation-only preview in the coming weeks. Sign up at &lt;a href="http://nestrenew.google.com"&gt;nestrenew.google.com&lt;/a&gt; to join the list. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google launches new features to help users shrink their carbon footprints</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google Maps will soon show users in the US the most fuel-efficient route." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n4iCQ4Hmbp_lEhHs8L4wgnVVSDE=/258x0:1959x1134/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69957991/download__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Google Maps will soon show users in the US the most fuel-efficient route. | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mKdvyf"&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbHuSHGZf5U&amp;amp;t=0s"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a suite of new features that it says will help people who use their platforms make more sustainable choices. The new services focus on reducing planet-heating greenhouse gas emissions and are primarily found on Search, Maps, Travel, and Nest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r0vVye"&gt;But before we get into the details of how their new tools work, a quick note of context; some environmental advocates have called out companies for &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/climate-change-focusing-on-how-individuals-can-help-is-very-convenient-for-corporations-108546"&gt;shifting responsibility&lt;/a&gt; for the climate crisis onto individual consumers. Holding big corporate polluters accountable for their emissions &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/10/business/what-can-you-do-about-climate-change/index.html"&gt;far outweighs any one consumers’ individual impact&lt;/a&gt;. And Wednesday’s announcements from Google aren’t really designed to reduce the company’s own carbon footprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zVfXIZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Holding big corporate polluters accountable for their emissions far outweighs any one consumers’ individual impact.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XsQIvX"&gt;That being said, there’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22613531/climate-change-united-nations-report-extreme-weather-ipcc"&gt;no time to lose&lt;/a&gt; to the prevent the climate crisis from getting worse, and every bit of emissions-savings helps. For those who might want some new tools to rein in their own emissions, here’s a breakdown of what Google just announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="axLetk"&gt;Search&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="kYepoP"&gt;Sometime this month, Google plans to switch up the way results for “climate change” appear in its Search platform. Users will be led to a dedicated results page with “high quality climate-related information,” according to Google. It plans to source content from reputable authorities on the subject, including the United Nations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kwUbXw"&gt;The company also says it wants to make it easier for consumers to see more eco-friendly options when shopping on Google. By “early next year,” when users based in the US search for car models and manufacturers, Google will also show results for hybrid and electric vehicles. When searching for a particular electric vehicle, users will also find nearby charging stations that are compatible with the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ox5d7U"&gt;Similarly, Google users in the US should begin to see suggestions Wednesday for more energy efficient home appliances when shopping online. That applies to searches for furnaces, dishwashers, water heaters, stoves, and dryers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kC7C66"&gt;Google, however, did not announce any changes to searches on YouTube, which is a big platform for misinformation and lies about climate change. Of the top 100 videos that pop up when searching for “global warming,” 20 percent of views are for videos rife with misinformation, according to one recent &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2020/1/26/21068473/youtube-climate-change-misinformation-epistemic-crisis"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; by nonprofit Avaaz. Google has also not met its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20948057/google-workers-climate-change-demands-letter-greenhouse-gas-fossil-fuels"&gt;employees’ demands&lt;/a&gt; that it cancel contracts with fossil fuel companies or stop funding and lobbying for candidates that derail climate action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="bXrY1C"&gt;Maps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="pZcOMK"&gt;Starting Wednesday, people in the US can see which driving routes are the most fuel-efficient when using Google Maps. (The company originally announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22357528/google-maps-directions-indoor-ar-live-view-fuel-efficient-weather-air-quality-layer"&gt;in March&lt;/a&gt; that this feature was on the way.) Fuel efficiency cuts down on both gas costs and tailpipe pollution. When the most fuel-efficient route is also the fastest, Google Maps will default to that option. If the fuel-efficient route is slower, the app will show users their options so that they can make an educated decision on which to choose. Users in Europe will be able to do the same starting in 2022, according to Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qAqdrk"&gt;That will, in theory, help individual Google Maps users reduce their CO2 emissions. A &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/greenhouse-gas-emissions-typical-passenger-vehicle"&gt;passenger vehicle&lt;/a&gt; typically releases just under five metric tons of CO2 a year. And a person in the US, which has one of the highest rates of &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/24306/carbon-emissions-per-capita-by-country/"&gt;per capita emissions&lt;/a&gt; in the world, might be responsible for about 18 metric tons a year. Google, on the other hand, unleashed 12,529,953 metric tons of CO2 into the atmosphere in &lt;a href="https://www.gstatic.com/gumdrop/sustainability/google-2020-environmental-report.pdf"&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt;. That’s roughly &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator"&gt;equivalent&lt;/a&gt; to more than 2.73 million passenger vehicles’ pollution in a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google’s new Lite Navigation for cyclists." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2YNlIQ59h7WQ6sg-ZqITBqUam1k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22903827/SWG_litenav.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s new Lite Navigation for cyclists.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z36QHo"&gt;Wherever cycling navigation is offered on Google Maps, the app will feature “Lite Navigation” in the coming months. This feature lets bikers see instructions and details about their route without having to leave their screen on. And starting Wednesday, the app will share information about nearby scooter and bike shares in 300 cities around the world, including Berlin, New York, São Paulo, and Taipei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="OfKN5c"&gt;Travel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="jlmf7W"&gt;When searching for flights through Google, starting Wednesday, users will now be able to see the carbon dioxide emissions associated with each flight. They’ll even be able to see how their seat choice affects their individual carbon footprint. Taking a seat in business or first class increases the amount of pollution you’re responsible for, since they take up more space and therefore a larger share of the plane’s emissions. Choosing a more fuel efficient itinerary can actually cut CO2 pollution from a given route by as much as 63 percent, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588466/greenhouse-gas-emissions-flight-travel-climate-pollution"&gt;recent research found&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="DtzPT4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Choosing a more fuel efficient itinerary can actually cut CO2 pollution&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sCcTFT"&gt;Separately, Google announced plans to expand its research into how to cut down emissions from driving by enabling traffic lights to direct traffic more efficiently. Google piloted the program, which utilizes AI, in Israel and found reductions between 10 to 20 percent in fuel and intersection delay time. It plans to bring the program to other cities around the world, starting with Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dKldYO"&gt;Nest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="uWH27v"&gt;Google launched a new service for Nest thermostat owners in the US, which it plans to start rolling out over the next several weeks. It’s called “Nest Renew,” and allows users to automatically shift their heating and cooling to times when there’s more renewable energy available on the grid. This is a strategy that energy experts and environmental advocates have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22419206/smart-grid-renewable-energy-power-sector"&gt;promoted&lt;/a&gt; as an important step to making homes more energy efficient, and reducing strain on electricity grids during times of peak demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EzXzAi"&gt;In “select” markets, Google will also offer a Renew Premium subscription, which would enable subscribers to match their fossil-fueled electricity use with some investment in renewable energy (through &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/11/9/9696820/renewable-energy-certificates"&gt;renewable energy certificates&lt;/a&gt;). To learn more about Nest Renew, check out &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="http://google-nest-renew-nest-thermostat-service"&gt;guide&lt;/a&gt; to all the changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B72SZ0"&gt;Google has been offsetting its own emissions rather than fully eliminating them since 2007, and has been able to say that it is carbon neutral since that time. Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436228/google-climate-change-pledge-2030-renewable-energy"&gt;pledged&lt;/a&gt; last year to run its offices and data centers entirely on locally-sourced carbon-free energy by 2030, a commitment that puts it ahead of the pack when it comes to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332461/apple-carbon-neutral-2030-climate-change"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873834/amazon-sustainability-jeff-bezos-climate-change-pledge-emissions-paris-accord"&gt;tech&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21437208/facebook-climate-change-misinformation-greenhouse-gas-pledge"&gt;companies’&lt;/a&gt; promises to reach carbon neutrality. Google’s data centers now run on 67 percent clean energy, Google Chief Sustainability Officer Kate Brandt said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Canon’s new dual-fisheye EOS R lens is for creating 3D VR content</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9N33hK1vdP9UfzNxpbz0UWvC5UY=/0x0:675x450/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69957825/f5.2mm_f2.8_l_dual_fisheye_675x450_5.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PgRv0B"&gt;Canon has announced what’s easily the oddest glass yet for its EOS R mirrorless camera system: a dual 5.2mm f/2.8 fisheye. The fisheye lenses are 60mm apart and are designed for creating 3D VR images and video content; Canon calls out the Oculus Quest 2 as a potential hardware destination and says this is “the world’s first digital interchangeable lens that can capture stereoscopic 3D 180° VR imagery to a single image sensor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Rezit"&gt;The lens can be used to shoot up to 8K footage on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/9/21318398/canon-eos-r5-announced-8k-price-specs-release-date"&gt;the EOS R5&lt;/a&gt;, which appears to be the only camera it’ll work with. Canon is releasing a 1.5.0 firmware update for the R5 as well as a Premiere Pro plug-in and a standalone file conversion app called EOS VR Utility. Canon calls this combination the EOS VR System and will be making the software available on a subscription basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xKr5Nq"&gt;The lens will cost $1,999, while the EOS R5 sells for $3,899. That’s a pricey combination, but not too much more than some dedicated VR cameras like the Insta360 Pro 2, and Canon’s solution should be a lot more versatile. The lens and software will both be released in December.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="f2WAHy"&gt;T-Mobile &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Foffers%2Fhome-internet-big-fee-deal&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F5%2F22711794%2Ft-mobile-home-internet-no-fees-price-cut" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s cutting the price of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22312155/t-mobile-5g-home-internet-wireless-broadband"&gt;5G-powered home internet service&lt;/a&gt; by $10, bringing it back to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18275640/tmobile-lte-wireless-home-internet-service-pilot-launch"&gt;the $50 price that it charged during its pilot program&lt;/a&gt;. That $50 a month gets you internet with no data cap, speeds that &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fisp%2Fplan%3Ficid%3DHEIS_ISW_C_20HMEINTPL_4201BARY4O4BX5HPG23552&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F5%2F22711794%2Ft-mobile-home-internet-no-fees-price-cut" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile estimates&lt;/a&gt; will be anywhere from 35 to 115 Mbps, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fisp%2Fgateway&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F5%2F22711794%2Ft-mobile-home-internet-no-fees-price-cut" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a router&lt;/a&gt; capable of turning 5G and LTE into Wi-Fi (which you’ll have to return if you ever cancel the contract-free plan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z0snAV"&gt;T-Mobile is adamant that your bill won't be higher than $50 — &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Foffers%2Fhome-internet-big-fee-deal&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F5%2F22711794%2Ft-mobile-home-internet-no-fees-price-cut" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in its press release&lt;/a&gt; it says there’s no installation fees, activation fees, or equipment rental fees. It seems to view this as a kind of apology for all the fees traditional ISPs like Xfinity and Charter have charged. It’s pretty self-congratulatory, but it’s hard to argue that the service seems like a bad deal: I personally pay $80 a month for Comcast, and frequently find myself chafing under &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21591420/comcast-cap-data-1-2tb-home-users-internet-xfinity"&gt;its data cap&lt;/a&gt; (though I haven’t been buried with fees like T-Mobile implies I should’ve been). If you’re interested you may want to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fisp%2Feligibility&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F5%2F22711794%2Ft-mobile-home-internet-no-fees-price-cut" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;check to make sure your address is eligible&lt;/a&gt; for the service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UPQgIk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;At a flat $50 a month, the service doesn’t seem like a bad deal if you can get it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Pe7eVk"&gt;Of course, there are still some asterisks. That $50 price is with automatic billing turned on — leaving it off means you’ll pay $55 a month instead. Plus, you are still paying taxes and fees, they’re just built into the price (T-Mobile’s estimates that they account for 3-12 percent of your bill can be found in the fine print). The company also warns that you could have your service slowed down in times of heavy congestion, though some of its executives have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381885/t-mobile-5g-home-internet-issues"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that’s “unlikely”. And, while there’s no installation fee, that does mean that you have to do it yourself. The company estimates that’ll only take 15 minutes. If you’re seriously considering the service after the price cut, it’s worth giving our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381885/t-mobile-5g-home-internet-issues"&gt;article explaining some of the potential downsides&lt;/a&gt; a read.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sPrOyu"&gt;Mark Zuckerberg posted a staunch defense of his company in a note to Facebook staffers, saying that recent claims by an ex-employee about the social network’s negative effects on society “don’t make any sense.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ApfTy2"&gt;On Tuesday, a former Facebook product manager named Frances Haugen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710539/facebook-whistleblower-hearing-instagram-child-safety-congress"&gt;testified before Congress&lt;/a&gt; about a trove of internal documents she gave to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;. The focus of the hearing was on Facebook’s&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675130/facebook-instagram-teens-mental-health-damage-internal-research"&gt; internal research that showed Instagram can have a negative effect on young people&lt;/a&gt;, but Haugen took the opportunity to also attack the company’s business model and News Feed algorithm. One of her main arguments was that Facebook’s business of selling ads based on engagement leads it to keep users on the service at all costs, even when it knows that the content they’re engaging with is harmful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="V0UByh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The argument that we deliberately push content that makes people angry for profit is deeply illogical&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C4Pvvt"&gt;“The argument that we deliberately push content that makes people angry for profit is deeply illogical,” Zuckerberg said in the memo, which he also &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10113961365418581"&gt;posted on his public Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;. “We make money from ads, and advertisers consistently tell us they don’t want their ads next to harmful or angry content. And I don’t know any tech company that sets out to build products that make people angry or depressed. The moral, business and product incentives all point in the opposite direction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UyrjWh"&gt;Zuckerberg has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711182/facebook-whistleblower-smear-pr-response"&gt;noticeably silent&lt;/a&gt; on Haugen and the internal documents she gave to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; until now. Sunday, the same day she &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/3/22707860/facebook-whistleblower-leaked-documents-files-regulation"&gt;revealed her identity&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt;, he posted a video of him sailing, which lawmakers later pointed to as evidence that he was avoiding scrutiny. The same committee Haugen spoke to called on Zuckerberg to testify, but he didn’t address the request anywhere in his 1,300-word rebuttal. And as with Facebook’s earlier statements, he didn’t address Haugen by name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qz4ZN"&gt;He touched on her claim to Congress that a 2018 News Feed change to prioritize what the company calls “Meaningful Social Interactions” actually encouraged the sharing of more hateful and divisive content. Echoing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/11/16881102/facebook-news-feed-changes-meaningful-interactions"&gt;his statements at the time of the change&lt;/a&gt;, he said it was done to encourage the sharing of more content between friends and family, and that Facebook knew it would lead to decreased engagement. “Is that something a company focused on profits over people would do?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tf1H2D"&gt;Facebook’s internal research about Instagram’s negative effects on teens—the main topic of Tuesday’s hearing—has particularly stoked anger towards the company and led for calls to publish more research for independent experts to evaluate. In his memo to employees, Zuckerberg said the company would keep doing research and work to make more of it public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2vOJE"&gt;The post appears in full below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="sSbg1V"&gt;Hey everyone: it’s been quite a week, and I wanted to share some thoughts with all of you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cca6bV"&gt;First, the SEV that took down all our services yesterday was the worst outage we’ve had in years. We’ve spent the past 24 hours debriefing how we can strengthen our systems against this kind of failure. This was also a reminder of how much our work matters to people. The deeper concern with an outage like this isn’t how many people switch to competitive services or how much money we lose, but what it means for the people who rely on our services to communicate with loved ones, run their businesses, or support their communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qXBlK5"&gt;Second, now that today’s testimony is over, I wanted to reflect on the public debate we’re in. I’m sure many of you have found the recent coverage hard to read because it just doesn’t reflect the company we know. We care deeply about issues like safety, well-being and mental health. It’s difficult to see coverage that misrepresents our work and our motives. At the most basic level, I think most of us just don’t recognize the false picture of the company that is being painted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G9ei9V"&gt;Many of the claims don’t make any sense. If we wanted to ignore research, why would we create an industry-leading research program to understand these important issues in the first place? If we didn’t care about fighting harmful content, then why would we employ so many more people dedicated to this than any other company in our space — even ones larger than us? If we wanted to hide our results, why would we have established an industry-leading standard for transparency and reporting on what we’re doing? And if social media were as responsible for polarizing society as some people claim, then why are we seeing polarization increase in the US while it stays flat or declines in many countries with just as heavy use of social media around the world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KxKPRH"&gt;At the heart of these accusations is this idea that we prioritize profit over safety and well-being. That’s just not true. For example, one move that has been called into question is when we introduced the Meaningful Social Interactions change to News Feed. This change showed fewer viral videos and more content from friends and family — which we did knowing it would mean people spent less time on Facebook, but that research suggested it was the right thing for people’s well-being. Is that something a company focused on profits over people would do? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nq5RRZ"&gt;The argument that we deliberately push content that makes people angry for profit is deeply illogical. We make money from ads, and advertisers consistently tell us they don’t want their ads next to harmful or angry content. And I don’t know any tech company that sets out to build products that make people angry or depressed. The moral, business and product incentives all point in the opposite direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QM7hzC"&gt;But of everything published, I’m particularly focused on the questions raised about our work with kids. I’ve spent a lot of time reflecting on the kinds of experiences I want my kids and others to have online, and it’s very important to me that everything we build is safe and good for kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gruXeC"&gt;The reality is that young people use technology. Think about how many school-age kids have phones. Rather than ignoring this, technology companies should build experiences that meet their needs while also keeping them safe. We’re deeply committed to doing industry-leading work in this area. A good example of this work is Messenger Kids, which is widely recognized as better and safer than alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aPhRyW"&gt;We’ve also worked on bringing this kind of age-appropriate experience with parental controls for Instagram too. But given all the questions about whether this would actually be better for kids, we’ve paused that project to take more time to engage with experts and make sure anything we do would be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3L5wlp"&gt;Like many of you, I found it difficult to read the mischaracterization of the research into how Instagram affects young people. As we wrote in our Newsroom post explaining this: “The research actually demonstrated that many teens we heard from feel that using Instagram helps them when they are struggling with the kinds of hard moments and issues teenagers have always faced. In fact, in 11 of 12 areas on the slide referenced by the Journal — including serious areas like loneliness, anxiety, sadness and eating issues — more teenage girls who said they struggled with that issue also said Instagram made those difficult times better rather than worse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B87CHv"&gt;But when it comes to young people’s health or well-being, every negative experience matters. It is incredibly sad to think of a young person in a moment of distress who, instead of being comforted, has their experience made worse. We have worked for years on industry-leading efforts to help people in these moments and I’m proud of the work we’ve done. We constantly use our research to improve this work further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wWa8LP"&gt;Similar to balancing other social issues, I don’t believe private companies should make all of the decisions on their own. That’s why we have advocated for updated internet regulations for several years now. I have testified in Congress multiple times and asked them to update these regulations. I’ve written op-eds outlining the areas of regulation we think are most important related to elections, harmful content, privacy, and competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="92dxhL"&gt;We’re committed to doing the best work we can, but at some level the right body to assess tradeoffs between social equities is our democratically elected Congress. For example, what is the right age for teens to be able to use internet services? How should internet services verify people’s ages? And how should companies balance teens’ privacy while giving parents visibility into their activity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DlyRAn"&gt;If we’re going to have an informed conversation about the effects of social media on young people, it’s important to start with a full picture. We’re committed to doing more research ourselves and making more research publicly available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3YciIi"&gt;That said, I’m worried about the incentives that are being set here. We have an industry-leading research program so that we can identify important issues and work on them. It’s disheartening to see that work taken out of context and used to construct a false narrative that we don’t care. If we attack organizations making an effort to study their impact on the world, we’re effectively sending the message that it’s safer not to look at all, in case you find something that could be held against you. That’s the conclusion other companies seem to have reached, and I think that leads to a place that would be far worse for society. Even though it might be easier for us to follow that path, we’re going to keep doing research because it’s the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OnYsro"&gt;I know it’s frustrating to see the good work we do get mischaracterized, especially for those of you who are making important contributions across safety, integrity, research and product. But I believe that over the long term if we keep trying to do what’s right and delivering experiences that improve people’s lives, it will be better for our community and our business. I’ve asked leaders across the company to do deep dives on our work across many areas over the next few days so you can see everything that we’re doing to get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BluobP"&gt;When I reflect on our work, I think about the real impact we have on the world — the people who can now stay in touch with their loved ones, create opportunities to support themselves, and find community. This is why billions of people love our products. I’m proud of everything we do to keep building the best social products in the world and grateful to all of you for the work you do here every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Google files document production demand against one of its biggest public critics</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JmCDSpTjU4VGduNWYawQRTJsmK8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69957063/acastro_210121_1777_google_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BLutbu"&gt;Late Monday night, Google filed for a court order to produce documents from longtime Google critic Luther Lowe, as part of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21454192/google-monopoly-antitrust-case-lawsuit-filed-us-doj-department-of-justice"&gt;ongoing federal antitrust case&lt;/a&gt;, US vs. Google. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nxMmEZ"&gt;The motion arises from an apparent breakdown in negotiations between Google and Lowe’s employer, Yelp. Yelp has agreed to document production from a number of its employees, but has resisted on Lowe in particular, leaving Google to ask the court for a subpoena that would compel email archives and other documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yX5Xkc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Yelp cannot deny Google the documents it needs to defend itself”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="du0Vot"&gt;“Yelp’s allegations against Google conceived and advanced by Mr. Lowe, are a central part of the government’s case,” the filing reads. “Now that the very governmental action Yelp advocated for in its communications is underway, Yelp cannot deny Google the documents it needs to defend itself.” The 51 page filing, like many in the antitrust case, contains numerous redactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OntnrT"&gt;As vice president of public policy at Yelp, Lowe has long been a prominent voice pushing for antitrust action against Google, even launching an email newsletter called &lt;a href="https://wordpress.us13.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=52562efd9a39dbe9559cb4285&amp;amp;id=e5d8f6ac12"&gt;“This Week In Google Antitrust”&lt;/a&gt; to track support for action against the search giant. In public statements, Lowe has particularly focused on the search neutrality case against Google, alleging that the company uses the power of Google Search to co-opt and overwhelm subject-matter directories like Yelp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUUbQz"&gt;This isn’t the first time Google has used the antitrust proceedings to compel document production from rivals. In July, the company pushed for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22601166/us-google-antitrust-case-microsoft-document-discovery"&gt;significant new document production from Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, after the company shared hundreds of thousands of documents with prosecutors in advance of the case’s filing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZiPuTg"&gt;Neither Google nor Lowe responded to a request to comment on the filing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OqX2Be"&gt;

    <title>Intel tries to bash Apple again with a terrible ‘social experiment’ ad</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U2HNQ08e7DW7WVFvoBPCvzcT_04=/242x0:2638x1597/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69956919/Screen_Shot_2021_10_05_at_2.12.50_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a59JUa"&gt;I regret to inform you that Intel has again &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xp0xzapm-zY"&gt;made a terrible ad&lt;/a&gt; to showcase how absolutely not mad it is about Apple switching to its own processors. This one, called “Breaking the Spell,” follows a classic format — people are put in a room and told about features supposedly coming to MacBooks. Then, after they get all excited, the twist! They were actually being told about Windows computers, powered (of course) by Intel. The folks in the ad (which the fine print says are “real people paid for their time and opinions”) are speechless and then clamor to buy or take the laptops, presumably now that they’ve awoken to the possibilities of the PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwy2Wj"&gt;It’s an ad format that’s never been great, but the real kicker is that it makes absolutely no sense here — in the intro, Intel claims it’s showing off “new technology” and “innovations” and then proceeds to show people absolutely gobsmacked by tech that is old news by almost any standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O6giOD"&gt;If you’re brave, you can give it a watch below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SdEmkz"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xp0xzapm-zY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mPY0gJ"&gt;I know that when it comes to tech news, there can be somewhat of a bubble, with writers and readers thinking that certain things are more well-known to the general public than they are. But really, if you’ve walked into Best Buy’s laptop section at some point in the past decade, you probably would’ve seen some of the things the people in the ad are shell-shocked by: two-in-one laptops that fold to become a tablet have been popular since the early 2010s, Intel’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/18/17993690/intel-computer-concept-copper-harbor-tiger-rapids-dual-screen-pc-prototype"&gt;pushing laptops with two screens since 2018&lt;/a&gt;, and PC gaming was a thing before the original IBM Personal Computer that popularized the term “PC.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QZf8CJgm_dXJdrbWt_bX3cIPuDk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22903630/Screen_Shot_2021_10_05_at_2.15.17_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Intel&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;To be fair, secret rooms are always pretty cool (unless they’re serial killer dungeons, I guess).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="V1DM9J"&gt;As for Intel’s upgradability argument, I agree. While I understand that Apple building RAM into the same chip as the processor probably has some performance benefit, it does bite that you can’t upgrade — especially when M1 laptops start with a paltry 8GB and carry a $200 charge for the 16GB upgrade. The problem is, though, that there’s a high chance that the Windows laptop this ad inspires you to buy will also have unremovable and non-upgradeable memory. While you can find Windows laptops with swappable RAM or SSDs, nowadays, that’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22587205/framework-laptop-review"&gt;a notable feature&lt;/a&gt; rather than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/3/20895293/microsoft-surface-pro-x-laptop-3-upgradability-ssd-apple-ifixit"&gt;an expected one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="quFHd7"&gt;Perhaps this ad would be at least closer to forgivable if it wasn’t a mashup of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvDDC6ktCUg"&gt;another series of ads&lt;/a&gt; Intel made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22340359/intel-apple-macbook-pro-ad-commercial-justin-long-all-screen"&gt;featuring “I’m a Mac” actor Justin Long&lt;/a&gt; (which people hated) and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbjeJ1lxUw"&gt;those Chevy truck commercials&lt;/a&gt; (which people also hated). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3WOA_UFCvHOdeCAP6VGSL_YMJ0o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22903515/Screen_Shot_2021_10_05_at_1.54.21_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The like to dislike ratio for Intel’s new ad. Lots of people still spellbound, I guess.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3lct6yFxCO7w5r1CrfgEv24Jdbw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22903714/Screen_Shot_2021_10_05_at_3.12.21_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ratio for Intel’s “Justin Gets Real: Having Choices” ad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KsDzMW"&gt;Wait, actually, yes, it would still suck — because Intel’s bragging about things you can find in laptops with chips from its other competitor, AMD. There are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;2-in-1s rocking Ryzen chips&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"&gt;our top gaming laptop for 2021&lt;/a&gt; has both an AMD CPU and a slot to add more RAM. “But what about dual-screen laptops with AMD,” asked probably no one because it’s a niche product category. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Zephyrus-Display-Keyboard-GX551QR-XS98/dp/B09F2LM842?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Asus has you covered&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vpc5kN"&gt;I don’t want this criticism to come off as being done by a butthurt Apple fan who’s, as one person in the ad put it, “100 percent loyal to Apple.” (Who talks like that?) While I mostly use Apple products, I’m also an unabashed old ThinkPad lover who thinks Intel has a point — if you can look past how condescending and embarrassing this ad campaign is. I do wish Apple gave people more choice and more upgradability with its computers, and I think people should be more willing to give other computing platforms a shot if they fit their needs better. But does an ad full of people acting like they’ve never seen a computer convince anyone of that? &lt;/p&gt;
