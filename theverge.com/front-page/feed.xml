    <title>GameStop is selling PlayStation 5 console bundles in-store on December 17th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dNavx3OJfdavVFpChqU7EzA-Ad0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70282982/vpavic_4278_20201030_0041.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MIOH2S"&gt;GameStop has announced &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fps5-store-event.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a special in-store sales event&lt;/a&gt; for the hard-to-get Sony PlayStation 5 console, taking place on December 17th. The restock event requires &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergegamestopinstoreps5&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fpoweruprewards%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a subscription to GameStop’s Pro membership&lt;/a&gt; — which normally runs $14.99 per year but is currently discounted to $9.99 once added to your cart. GameStop &lt;a href="https://gamestop.a.bigcontent.io/v1/static/12-17_PS5Event_StoreList"&gt;lists all its participating retail locations&lt;/a&gt; on its site, which spans over 700 stores across the US. While this event is being hosted at many locations, GameStop has indicated that quantities will be limited. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="36Dqxf"&gt;Despite launching over one year ago, Sony’s PlayStation 5 is still very difficult to buy. If you have been struggling to luck out on recent online console restocks from GameStop, Best Buy, Walmart, or other vendors, this may be one of the few remaining chances to score a PS5 in time for the Christmas holiday. GameStop sells its new consoles in bundle form only, so while you should not be paying more than MSRP, you can expect to potentially pay upwards of $700 or $800 depending on what accessories are being bundled. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Meta adds sign language interpreters for Portal video calls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YJGkl0rcX9GKuxbSxxUzV0iDmUQ=/69x0:821x501/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70282902/01_Meta_and_ZP_Better_Together_VRS_on_Portal.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Portal now offers sign language interpreters | Meta&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qbshGz"&gt;Facebook parent company &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/12/video-relay-services-on-meta-portal/"&gt;Meta is adding video relay services&lt;/a&gt; (VRS) to its Portal video calling devices, allowing users to bring English or Spanish sign language interpreters into video conversations. The new feature is part of a collaboration with ZP Better Together, a tech firm that makes communication solutions for Deaf and hard-of-hearing users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Hm4pq"&gt;Meta spokesperson Lisa Auslen explained in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that users will need to apply for a ZP account to confirm they’re eligible for the service, which is federally funded under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Both the service and the Portal devices are free for those who qualify; they must be VRS users in the US who communicate using ASL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FAtODx"&gt;Once the user has their ZP account and their Portal, the ASL interpreter service can be accessed through ZP’s apps available in the Portal App Store. The American Sign Language (ASL) interpreters appear on-screen during Portal calls and are available 24/7, the company said in a news release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XVXAFU"&gt;Video calling became ubiquitous during the pandemic, and even though video-calling services like &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-live-captions-in-a-teams-meeting-4be2d304-f675-4b57-8347-cbd000a21260"&gt;Microsoft’s Teams&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744704/zoom-auto-generated-captions-available-free-accounts-accessibility"&gt;Zoom have closed captions&lt;/a&gt;, nuance in conversations &lt;a href="https://wjla.com/news/local/deaf-community-faces-extreme-lack-of-access-during-covid-19-pandemic"&gt;can be lost&lt;/a&gt; without a sign language interpreter providing tone and context. And as Meta notes, sign language is the primary language for the Deaf and hard-of-hearing community, so the addition provides a new level of accessibility to Portal calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mL4aKd"&gt;People who are Deaf or hard of hearing can apply to receive a Portal device for free at &lt;a href="https://portal.zpvrs.com/"&gt;portal.zpvrs.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>As promised, Nokia phones started getting Android 12 this week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Android 12" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b6Ury3w_zy1QZ2X2zQVU4y49ZSc=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70282874/VRG_1777_Android_12_002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nokia X20 is HMD Global’s first device to get Android 12.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mZCT2X"&gt;HMD Global offered its first Android 12 update this week, starting with the midrange Nokia X20. The company says &lt;a href="https://community.phones.nokia.com/discussion/64559/android-12-on-nokia-x20"&gt;users in this first wave&lt;/a&gt; will receive the update by December 17th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NQvmdb"&gt;Good. That’s what HMD said it would do, and it’s doing just that. We love to see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jfq1o7"&gt;You’re forgiven if you forgot that the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nokia.com%2Fphones%2Fen_int%2Fnokia-x-20&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F16%2F22839883%2Fnokia-x20-android-12-update" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nokia X20&lt;/a&gt; exists — it’s a mostly unremarkable device with a 6.67-inch 60Hz display, Snapdragon 480 processor, and four rear-facing cameras. In fact, its most compelling features might just be its healthy support policy (three years of OS updates) and an unusually generous three-year warranty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="E0TWvj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Generally speaking, the Android 12 rollout has been a rocky one&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kV0pax"&gt;That’s a great policy in theory — as my colleague Jon Porter pointed out in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22372444/hmd-nokia-x20-specs-release-date-price-news-quad-camera"&gt;his hands-on with the X20&lt;/a&gt;, the phone should still be under warranty when it gets Android 14. But there’s no real guarantee that HMD (or any Android device maker for that matter) will follow through with its promise of continuing OS updates. To that end, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22811988/hmd-global-nokia-9-pureview-android-11-software"&gt;recently backtracked on its promise&lt;/a&gt; to bring Android 11 to the Nokia 9 PureView. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WF2h4z"&gt;And generally speaking, the Android 12 rollout has been a rocky one. OnePlus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828553/oneplus-buggy-oxygenos-android-12-update-9-pro"&gt;pulled its buggy Android 12-based OxygenOS update&lt;/a&gt; for the OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3 owners &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-z-flip-3-fold-3-android-12-problems-issues-update-postponed/"&gt;have also reported issues&lt;/a&gt; with the stable Android 12 update. Google’s own Pixel 6 and 6 Pro &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22832212/google-pixel-6-pro-december-update-bug-fixes-fingerprint-sensor"&gt;appear to be afflicted&lt;/a&gt;, too. Even a so-called stable Android 12 release for Nokia phones could prove to be equally unstable. But if the X20 is to live up to its promised three-year lifespan, it’s certainly starting on the right foot.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US Treasury claims DJI assists Chinese surveillance of Uyghurs and blocks investments</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-8sDFru7IaLBDPp4tHgNI_TpWlw=/0x1:2048x1366/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70282872/DJI_Mavic_3___Forest_11.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Courtesy of DJI&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7kWKAX"&gt;DJI is one of the biggest drone companies in the world, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188789/dji-ban-commerce-entity-list-drone-china-transaction-blocked"&gt;last year, the US government added it to the Department of Commerce’s Entity List&lt;/a&gt;, which marked it as a national security concern and banned US-based companies from exporting technology to it. &lt;a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/recent-actions/20211216"&gt;Today, the Treasury Department placed further sanctions on DJI&lt;/a&gt;, including it as one of eight Chinese companies added to the Non-SDN Chinese Military-Industrial Complex Companies (NS-CMIC) List.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mQJxMq"&gt;&lt;a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0538"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US Treasury:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="KK1X7U"&gt;Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) identified eight Chinese technology firms pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13959, as amended by E.O. 14032. These eight entities actively support the biometric surveillance and tracking of ethnic and religious minorities in China, particularly the predominantly Muslim Uyghur minority in Xinjiang. As a result of today’s action, U.S. persons will be prohibited from purchasing or selling certain publicly traded securities connected with these entities, as described in E.O. 13959, as amended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rHuTB6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SZ DJI Technology Co., Ltd.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZbNNk1"&gt;SZ DJI Technology Co., Ltd. (SZ DJI) operates or has operated in the surveillance technology sector of the economy of the PRC. SZ DJI has provided drones to the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau, which are used to surveil Uyghurs in Xinjiang. The Xinjiang Public Security Bureau was previously &lt;a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm1055"&gt;designated&lt;/a&gt; in July 2020, pursuant to E.O. 13818, for being a foreign person responsible for, or complicit in, or that has directly or indirectly engaged in, serious human rights abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OOYyol"&gt;As described in the sections of the statement shown above, the US government says these companies have supported efforts to surveil and track the Uyghur people in Xinjiang. Last week, the White House announced a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing due to those activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QncRr7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Today, Treasury’s OFAC identified 8 Chinese technology firms as part of the Chinese Military Industrial Complex. These 8 entities actively support the biometric surveillance &amp;amp; tracking of ethnic &amp;amp; religious minorities in China.&lt;a href="https://t.co/MpGbAhsMxP"&gt;https://t.co/MpGbAhsMxP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Treasury Department (@USTreasury) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/USTreasury/status/1471560495027077142?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WEjzDD"&gt;During a press conference yesterday, China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian was asked about the ban and &lt;a href="https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/2511_665403/202112/t20211215_10470159.html"&gt;responded by saying&lt;/a&gt;, “We noted relevant reports. I would like to stress that China always opposes US moves to overstretch the concept of national security and exert unwarranted suppression on Chinese companies. The Chinese side has already shared the facts and truth on Xinjiang-related issues on many occasions. We will closely follow the relevant situation and firmly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QGttBf"&gt;DJI spokesperson Adam Lisberg did not comment on today’s action but referred to the company’s response to last year’s sanctions, which reads as follows: “DJI has done nothing to justify being placed on the Entity List. We have always focused on building products that save lives and benefit society. DJI and its employees remain committed to providing our customers with the industry’s most innovative technology. We are evaluating options to ensure our customers, partners, and suppliers are treated fairly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2o2frj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify’s latest acquisition is about making money off radio shows turned into podcasts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JgLWyfXeiH1GgHEB4JqbJBS1eDQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70282752/acastro_180213_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8ZIR34"&gt;Spotify continues to beef up its audio product arsenal. Today, it &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-12-16/spotify-is-building-on-megaphones-capabilities-with-the-acquisition-of-whooshkaa/"&gt;announced the acquisition&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.whooshkaa.com/"&gt;Whooshkaa&lt;/a&gt;, a nearly six-year-old Australian company focused on helping radio broadcasters monetize, edit, and distribute their shows as podcasts. Spotify says some radio broadcasters, like the Australian Radio Network, already rely on its podcast hosting platform Megaphone, and this Whooshkaa radio technology will be integrated into it. The selling price was not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NMjdu7"&gt;Radio networks will be able to prepare shows for publishing by capturing live broadcasts and using the Whooshkaa tech to edit and remove ads to make room for podcast-only spots. From there, Megaphone can host the shows, and Spotify can help the shows monetize by encouraging them to take advantage of the Spotify Ad Network, thereby allowing Spotify to insert ads dynamically based on the audience these programs reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fesJm9"&gt;The acquisition makes sense for Spotify CEO Daniel Ek’s vision of audio’s future. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22295315/spotify-ceo-interview-podcast-daniel-ek-music-stream-on"&gt;he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; traditional radio was dying. “If you think over the next 10 years for certain, what’s now radio is going to collapse and move from a linear space to an on-demand space,” he said. “That’s where I think we’re in this race to try to get as many people as possible to convert into streaming on demand and hopefully choose Spotify as their preferred platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wZBnNA"&gt;If that reality plays out, Spotify could be in a place to take a heavier hand in all aspects of that transition, but most notably, selling the ads for those broadcast shows. Other companies, namely in the radio space, are also investing in similar technology. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22287309/podcast-iheart-media-triton-digital-acquire-spotify"&gt;iHeartMedia acquired Triton Digital&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://omnystudio.com/learn"&gt;Omny Studio&lt;/a&gt;, which also offers both live broadcast to on-demand technology, hosting, and monetization options.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PlayStation 5 is available at Best Buy right now (update: sold out)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fRlsbB8OpYzqHGItWg8bJuSkq2o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70282619/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PEdX6I"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 3:25PM ET, December 16th:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Best Buy has sold out of consoles for now. This one lasted a bit longer than some recent restocks, though availability seemed dependent on your location and proximity to Best Buy stores.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u4bhQA"&gt;If you’re currently shopping for a PlayStation 5 console and have been recently striking out with restocks at Walmart, Costco, and other retailers, you have another chance right now at Best Buy. The electronics retailer just opened up a fresh batch of &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgcljGhDR4o" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation 5 consoles for $499.99&lt;/a&gt;. Best Buy is only selling the disc-based version, however, not the Digital Edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M4DCfC"&gt;Be sure to log in and queue up on Best Buy’s site, with your billing and shipping info saved. Click the “Add to Cart” button on the right to jump into the waiting line, and stay calm. You don’t need to refresh the automated system, though, you may be prompted to verify your account when it’s your turn. After that, you should be able to see if there are any PS5 consoles available in your area (it’s currently only available for in-store pickup).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bungie’s head of HR steps down following reports of harassment at studio</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Inside The 2017 E3 Electronic Entertainment Expo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5UdZoLDAjY90U8TUlgcYjHdURWk=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70282603/696030068.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H1mEwP"&gt;Days after &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;’s report highlighting Bungie’s years-long struggle with harassment, abuse, and crunch conditions, Gayle d’Hondt, head of HR, is stepping down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B77VXQ"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-head-hr-stepped-down"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, d’Hondt served at Bungie for 14 years before stepping down from her role as head of HR effective immediately. It is not yet known if she will remain with the company in another role. In an email obtained by &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;, d’Hondt shared her experiences at Bungie, which included “deeply challenging interpersonal conflicts” and reporting her own abuse.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6H7XKq"&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-report-battle-soul-work-culture-harassment-crunch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that the culture at the studio was at times at odds with its image of being a progressive video game development company. The report captured incidents of a manager yelling frequently at employees (so much so, employees kept track of his explosions on a whiteboard), toothless diversity and inclusion committees that seemed to actively work against the needs of its members, and numerous incidents of harassment directed at female employees. Also in the report were allegations that the company’s HR department worked to protect bad actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nirR0T"&gt;“There was at least one long-standing Bungie employee in HR, still with the company, who almost all of our sources described as actively protecting harmful individuals,” Rebekah Valentine of&lt;em&gt; IGN&lt;/em&gt; writes. This person is not named, nor is it known if d’Hondt’s stepping down is at all related to &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;’s reporting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCROu4"&gt;Bungie’s CEO Pete Parsons &lt;a href="https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/50895"&gt;responded&lt;/a&gt; to the report saying he doesn’t refute the incidents described and apologized for the pain and suffering working at Bungie caused current and former employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fxwcJ5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to Bungie for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AunlO9"&gt;d’Hondt seemed complimentary of her time in HR but spoke of a need for the team to bring in outside people “new to Bungie” in order to regain employees’ trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OtGmvU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge’s 2021 holiday gift guide for dads</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Clever gift ideas to satisfy the pickiest of dads&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="SIITPe"&gt;It’s not an easy task to do holiday shopping for the people who you’re closest to, especially for the dad in your life. Not all dads are the same, mind you, but they can be tough to please in the gift department because they might already buy themselves everything they want, thus keeping a clean slate of a wishlist at all times. Or, maybe they’re tough because what they find enjoyment in is really niche, and you fear that you won’t get them something they’ll actually enjoy. No one wants that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aG7bGi"&gt;We at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; can certainly relate to those feelings, but we think we can assuage most of those concerns with the list of gift ideas below. Most of our staff chipped ideas into this gift guide, which encompasses a range of tastes, hobbies, and aesthetic preferences. Since we originally published this gift guide, we’ve even taken the time to add a couple more must-haves to the list, including Topo Design’s Dopp Kit and the Torch 500 multi-purpose light.  No matter the kind of dad you’re buying for, there should be something in here that’ll remind them, at the very least, that you’re trying to make sure they stay cool.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is reportedly going to make more of its own chips</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CqPpYNbvftEmMdmVKKeMhMRR8yI=/0x0:2028x1352/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70282304/vpavic_210916_4760_0082.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uziLaj"&gt;Apple is reportedly working to design more chip components in-house, with the company said to be establishing a new office with the aim of replacing components that Apple currently sources from Broadcom and Skyworks, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-16/apple-builds-team-in-new-office-to-bring-wireless-chips-in-house"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w9yzwE"&gt;The new office is said to be in its early stages but will eventually focus on “wireless radios, radio-frequency integrated circuits and a wireless system-on-a-chip,” in addition to “semiconductors for connecting to Bluetooth and Wi-Fi,” &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="12mJgk"&gt;While the A-series and M-series SoCs that contain the CPU and GPU for Apple’s iPhones and Macs get most of the attention, there are tons of additional chips inside those devices, handling things like power management, USB connectivity, wireless charging, and more. As &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FGuide%2FiPhone%2B13%2BPro%2BFull%2BChip%2BID%2F144993&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F16%2F22839850%2Fapple-office-develop-chips-in-house-broadcom-skyworks" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;iFixit’&lt;/em&gt;s iPhone 13 pro teardown&lt;/a&gt; documents, Skyworks and Broadcom supply a significant portion of the iPhone’s third-party circuitry — parts that Apple, it seems, would prefer to design on its own to create more bespoke solutions for its hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="E4HLXA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple wants to rely less on third-party suppliers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ETAvVH"&gt;One of the most prominent examples of third-party chips is the iPhone’s modem, which is currently manufactured by Qualcomm (but had previously been the subject of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/16/18410985/apple-qualcomm-settle-royalty-dispute-patent-licensing-terms-high-fees"&gt;years-long legal battle&lt;/a&gt; that briefly saw Apple switch to using Intel parts). Apple has made no secret about its ambitions to develop its own 5G chips instead of paying for Qualcomm’s chips, either: the company bought Intel’s smartphone modem business in 2019 for around $1 billion and is said to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/24/22800144/apple-own-iphone-modem-2023-tsmc-4nm"&gt;looking to switch over&lt;/a&gt; to its own in-house modems for the iPhone as early as 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J6uxU8"&gt;That Apple is looking to build more of its own chips may not just be about exercising a greater level of control and hardware integration, though: it could also be about getting a better handle on part supply. Right now, Apple is already feeling the impact of the ongoing global chip shortage with supply issues for parts from suppliers like Broadcom, which forced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723209/apple-iphone-13-chip-shortage-manufacturing-report"&gt;Apple to slash its manufacturing targets back in October&lt;/a&gt;. Building its own chips could help Apple alleviate some of those issues in the future, assuming it’s able to continue to work well with its manufacturing partners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UO2mYA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>After 21 years Google Toolbar is finally gone, so we installed it one last time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="This is the page that opens after installing Google Toolbar, giving a synopsis of some of its features." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uJoVgmSe38z3gmS01nrUGLyy444=/0x0:876x584/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70282160/gdesktop14.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Success! You just installed the last Google Toolbar.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot by Umar Shakir / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L7I2iY"&gt;I was lost and in search of myself after hearing the &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/12/happy-21st-birthday-to-google-toolbar-which-inexplicably-still-exists/"&gt;devastating news on &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Google Toolbar had been put down by the search giant after nearly 21 years — longer than most projects &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/killedbygoogle/status/1470410675554033666?s=20"&gt;the company lets live&lt;/a&gt;. (A recent &lt;a href="https://museletter.area120.google.com/"&gt;newsletter effort&lt;/a&gt; didn’t make it past three months).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvGf27"&gt;There was no ceremony, no announcement, no moment of silence, nor any closure — just a “no longer available.” That’s what Google has now on its &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/toolbar/answer/81376?hl=en&amp;amp;ref_topic=6317538"&gt;Install Google Toolbar help&lt;/a&gt; page; it tells you how to uninstall the Google Toolbar and install Chrome instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i3H8_qjtM4guEqJ4mKipZynSQQk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100539/Screen_Shot_2021_12_14_at_4.41.45_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to “install” Google Toolbar — the result may surprise you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jwh8Zz"&gt;It feels unreal for Google to silently forsake a tool that was, in 2008, &lt;a href="https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/03/googles-chrome-kills-the-lucrative-toolbar-business/"&gt;responsible&lt;/a&gt; for 12 percent of all Google searches — and then convince a new internet generation that everyone should just download Chrome if they love Googling so much. Chrome is great (&lt;em&gt;fine?&lt;/em&gt;), but it isn’t what it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16805216/google-chrome-only-sites-internet-explorer-6-web-standards"&gt;used to be&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="unDrdA"&gt;I have a confession: I was not a Google Toolbar user, but we had a relationship. Google Toolbar existed to help me blame it for my family’s and friends’ computer problems. If they ask me about tuning their computer or complained about websites loading slowly: I told them it’s the Google Toolbar, and I was happy to uninstall it for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cJNqJ2"&gt;It always seemed to work, too: removing not only Google Toolbar but also Yahoo! Toolbar, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/reviews/ask-jeeves-toolbar-review/"&gt;Ask Jeeves Toolbar&lt;/a&gt;, or any toolbar would give back so much screen real estate (we are talking about the 1024 x 768 screen resolution days of the 2000s) that there was at least the perception of a tune-up. Sure, I’d still end up going the extra mile and actually fix their real issues, but each removal of the omnipresent Google Toolbar felt almost like material change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1shFzR9f8tb3xO4j9B9fApxkMOE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100650/gdesktop16.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Umar Shakir / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Internet Explorer 8 (released in 2009) on Windows XP. You could do a Google search in the Google Toolbar, the IE8 search field, or the Google website — the choice is yours.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VSzvDf"&gt;The popularity of Google Toolbar — and other browser toolbars — in the 2000s was what pushed web browsers to adopt web searches as a built-in feature. Internet Explorer 7 (2006) was one of the first browsers to have a dedicated search field next to the address bar, making web searches quick — though the default search engine was Microsoft Live Search, to the dismay of many. That’s why Google Toolbar would continue to thrive and build a dependence of Google services on users for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zN5ZPl"&gt;With Chrome dominating web browser usage &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/5/21/3033566/chrome-most-popular-browser-weekly-may-2012"&gt;since 2012&lt;/a&gt;, the redundant web search fields have finally come to an end. Now let’s get together and install Google Toolbar one last time to celebrate its life and let it rest in peace:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="Aka4vk"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Find a PC that has Internet Explorer, Preferably IE8 or newer.&lt;/strong&gt; It could be your first build with a Pentium 4 and a Radeon All-In-Wonder that your family threatens to dump. The important thing is it should be a computer no one is using, cares about, or otherwise wouldn't mind toolbars being added to Internet Explorer. I found a PC running Windows XP x64 Edition, so that should work!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PrXb0TbTNGTY6A23BpN33IGZ2hw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100874/IMG_0947.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Umar Shakir / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The computer I found had a CPU fan error since it was filled with thick dust, but I flicked the blades until it started spinning. It has a Pentium 4 and an Nvidia Quadro FX 1700.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="osCne0"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Find and install Google Toolbar.&lt;/strong&gt; Some &lt;a href="http://google-toolbar.findmysoft.com"&gt;freeware sites&lt;/a&gt; still have it, or if you’re lucky, there might be about three toolbar installers deep in the downloads folder of any old PC. Open the installer and run it. After install, it will close all browsers and reopen Internet Explorer. Congratulations, Google Toolbar is here!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bYYCiH4-UyAdTWOtdkgpNFrET-Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100790/gdesktop11.PNG"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Be sure your finding is actually from Google. Though that is no longer verifiable since Google doesn’t host the file anymore.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4Znnr2gDlPxaVOT2DYUY-xnUIHk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100799/gdesktop13.PNG"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This one is specifically for Internet Explorer, but it will close Firefox when you click Restart Now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Consider your search options.&lt;/strong&gt; You can Google on your new Google Toolbar, Google on Google.com, or Google in the Web Search field — though you would have to drop the default Live Search or Bing (in my case it was mywebsearch.com, which was probably set inadvertently or maliciously on this PC). In the Search Provider Default window that pops up, select Google (after all, this is a Google Toolbar tribute).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The war between browser and search engine rages on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="BiwL4A"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Try signing in with your Google account for the full experience.&lt;/strong&gt; Click on the Sign In button on the right side of the bar. You’ll get error messages and a wonky Google sign-in screen pop-up. If you enter your credentials, it will give you another error message, so maybe don’t bother. Let’s just pretend it works, quietly close the error messages, close the sign-in window, and continue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The services don’t seem to work anymore, but it’s also because Google stopped supporting old versions of Internet Explorer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="nIZX1r"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Enable geolocation.&lt;/strong&gt; Go to Toolbar options &amp;gt; Tools under the wrench menu. Check “My Location.” We may as well contribute to a decade or two of targeted ad tracking while we’re at it, right?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uDdIno_Ln1o4CRPEutzoa_F9108=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100805/gdesktop24.PNG"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Toolbar options have tools that let you block pop-ups (before browsers could do it), sync bookmarks between computers using Google Toolbar, and help with spell checking!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="sbnLGV"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Review the Google Toolbar Privacy policy.&lt;/strong&gt; Click on the Privacy side tab. You’ll find the 2014 edition of Google’s Privacy policy (though it does link to the latest policy). You could even opt in to “enhanced features,” although I admittedly didn’t look into what it does (but you can).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2AYGmGOk9uA_BrtLh0VNVS-YZGE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100806/gdesktop28.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Umar Shakir / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There was also a button to opt out of all the features that send information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="YEtupt"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;A moment of silence.&lt;/strong&gt; Click on the About Toolbar tab. Gasp at the fact that you’ve just updated to the final version of Google Toolbar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IkJYko0l3jCckFXJewgafniAfk4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100813/gdesktop25.PNG"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;We installed version 7.5.5111, but the software still downloaded the latest version with 7.5.7210.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="IEifyN"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Share your favorite sites to social media. &lt;/strong&gt;Under the More button on the toolbar, you can translate the page, share to social media, and more. MySpace and Google Plus are the recommended places to share.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XJML9NG_5XVHFTg5tPb8k0egwd0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100810/gdesktop21.PNG"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can add more buttons to this list under the Toolbar Options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="TMSZ1K"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Uninstall the toolbar (Optional).&lt;/strong&gt; It’s so easy with just two clicks — next to the wrench icon in a drop-down menu click “Uninstall.” Or, instead, continue and you could get your Google Toolbar a companion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tTwTHF06kGMY8mKtplIkM3FRRSk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100811/gdesktop22.PNG"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the step I took helping people over the years. I’ve got a lot of thank you’s uninstalling this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="agkxxH"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Get Yahoo! toolbar.&lt;/strong&gt; Find it in the same place(s) where you found Google Toolbar. It’s the same steps, but scarier.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FTNFQjeOonTxAgQszsVwA6grcZk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100807/gdesktop34.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Umar Shakir / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I don’t think I’ve ever opened this installer myself, and I shudder thinking about everyone who has. Let’s carry on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="dMgrLR"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Be bold.&lt;/strong&gt; Make Yahoo! your default search engine, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/11/19/7250513/firefox-signs-yahoo-as-default-search-engine-"&gt;and commit to it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h4O0S8hp1WA-7YENK2ZI0kjzyo0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100808/gdesktop35.PNG"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notice the check box to share your data. Let’s skip that and save it for Google.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="GA2Kgh"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Experience search overload.&lt;/strong&gt; Internet Explorer will ask you again about what default provider to use. Feel forever conflicted by choosing between the two... there’s not much more you can do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x0TeKL5lntFlRm1MK3iq1lzKUu4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100809/gdesktop36.PNG"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This takes me back to the computer conditions of some friends and professors I’ve helped.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="0ejqN4"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Time to put Google Toolbar to rest. Turn off the PC.&lt;/strong&gt; If it’s a computer you don’t care about, skip the shutdown. Just hold the power button so the last thing the computer did was operate Google Toolbar. If you’ve made it this far, I’m proud of you. You’re a strong and beautiful human. Now we can finally lay Google Toolbar to rest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x_F1GhgGFHuVll4oY7ho7u0HQDM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23101415/old_pc.001.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Umar Shakir / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This PC I found has a power switch on the power supply. A quick flip for me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="anh1L2"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Bonus:&lt;/strong&gt; I stumbled upon another relic, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Desktop"&gt;Google Desktop&lt;/a&gt;! Maybe you will find this on an old PC you procure. The program came out in 2007 (full release) and was basically a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_(software)"&gt;Sherlock&lt;/a&gt; — but for any PC. Google would index all your files so you could find anything, and interfaced through a web browser. Comes with a sidebar of widgets like weather and RSS feeds. I tried adding &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; RSS feeds, but it wouldn't load. Google Desktop was discontinued in 2011.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NFV__034P6MDk6hwyxOr0oK4pmg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100863/gdesktop2.PNG"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google would love to index your Thunderbird emails.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lKhgVVEHLtDOmrihKcTgjJ1jIMI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100864/gdesktop8.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Umar Shakir / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Imagine doing an “I’m Feeling Lucky” search for a file on your computer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SdufsmhAnMhDI191NESQBKD2qpw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100865/gdesktop31.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Umar Shakir / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was really hoping it could load more than just Blogspot RSS feeds. It probably could, but I didn’t try any harder.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="C7RaAt"&gt;And that’s all. If you really feel like you need another toolbar fix, the &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/yahoo-toolbar-and-new-tab/"&gt;Yahoo! Toolbar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/8/15/4625024/yahoo-introduces-a-brand-new-browser-toolbar"&gt;somehow&lt;/a&gt; still exists — but now as an extension for Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
