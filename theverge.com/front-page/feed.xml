    <title>Firefly releases video and more details about its Alpha rocket that exploded mid-flight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nYk-zYSpbfW55DPFVxIaKzkcBs8=/164x0:1601x958/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69820093/firefly_rocket.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Firefly’s Alpha rocket takes off from Vandenberg Space Force base  on September 3rd | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFjoPw0CfAU&amp;amp;ab_channel=FireflyAerospace" target="_blank"&gt;Firefly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ysIVmH"&gt;Firefly’s Alpha rocket &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22655687/firefly-alpha-rocket-explodes-space-force-first-launch"&gt;exploded mid-flight&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday, but the company posted a new video on Sunday and provided more detail on what happened.  “Although the vehicle didn’t make orbit, the day marked a major advancement for our team,” the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Firefly_Space/status/1434596618485911554"&gt;company tweeted.&lt;/a&gt; “We demonstrated we ‘arrived’ as a company capable of building and launching rockets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xWoqdW"&gt;Alpha, a two-stage rocket, lifted off from the Vandenberg Space Force base in California at 9:59PM ET on Thursday, carrying a payload of private satellites. It was the company’s first-ever mission, and two minutes after liftoff the rocket began tipping horizontally, falling short of reaching its maximum aerodynamic pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E7HGGW"&gt;According to Firefly, the rocket cleared the launch pad successfully, but about 15 seconds into flight, engine 2 shut down. The vehicle continued its climb and was able to maintain control for about 145 seconds, Firefly said, but the climb rate was slow because it was lacking the thrust of one of its four engines (the one that shut down). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zBTsNE"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qFjoPw0CfAU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="id__q88hhly6pk8"&gt;“The vehicle was challenged to maintain control without the thrust vectoring of engine 2. Alpha was able to compensate at subsonic speeds, but as it moved through transonic and into supersonic flight, where control is most challenging, the three engine thrust vector control was insufficient and the vehicle tumbled out of control,” according to Firefly. “The range terminated the flight using the explosive Flight Termination System (FTS). The rocket did not explode on its own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="id__pprp9i9g7yn"&gt;It’s investigating why engine 2 shut down early, and says it will report the root cause once it’s completed the investigation. “In collaboration with the FAA and our partners at Space Launch Delta 30, we’ll return to conduct Alpha Flight 2 as soon as possible,” the company tweeted.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Segway’s Navimow robot will mow your lawn using GPS </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PLNPHwtgl_mVL_XKgsgx9SmFOw8=/0x0:672x448/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69819658/Navimow_3_web.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Segway Navimow robot uses GPS to navigate your lawn as it mows | Segway&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EpVjp3"&gt;Segway has introduced its first robot mower, the Navimow, that uses GPS to stay on your lawn and keep it neatly trimmed. So unlike other robot mowers, you won’t have to install a boundary wire to keep the robot on the right patch of grass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QyDAAn"&gt;Segway says its Exact Fusion Locating System keeps the Navimow to “precise positions and systematic mowing patterns,” keeping its position accurate to within two centimeters. If its GPS signal is temporarily weak, the Navimow has sensors that will keep it mowing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MnE2i2"&gt;Users define the boundaries of the area to be mowed for the Navimow using its smartphone app, including giving it directions for which areas to avoid. Segway says the Navimow’s algorithm “determines a systemic mowing path,” and doesn’t have to criss-cross already-mowed areas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IFkllO"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8etNM_BXY0A?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J845LJ"&gt;The Navimow has offset blades that let it cut as close as possible on a lawn’s edges. Its Blade Halt technology can detect things in the grass like pets, toys, or kids, and stop the mower’s blades from spinning. While Segway says the Navimow can “withstand rainfall, heavy splashing and high-pressure water jets,” its rain sensor guides it back to its charging station if it detects rain starting. Segway hasn’t said yet when the Navimow will be available in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X16ngj"&gt;The Navimow can handle inclines in lawns of up to 45 degrees, and runs at a relatively quiet 54 dB. Segway has four models of the Navimow starting with the H500E, which can be used on a lawn up to 500 square meters, or about 5400 square feet in area, and is priced at €1199, or about $1,425. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QK8pDD"&gt;The Navimow H800, priced at €1499 ( about $1,781), is designed for lawns of up to 800 square meters (about 8,600 square feet); the H1500E can tackle lawns of 1,500 square meters (roughly 16,145 feet) and costs €1999 ($2,375); and the H3000E can mow lawns up to 3000 square meters (about 33,000 square feet) with a price tag of €2499 (or $2,969).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TbUZE7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mercedes-Benz AMG EQS is a dual-motor electric sedan with over 750 horsepower</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l1-LkgkXqHzQnRWUjpj62tQePWw=/0x3:4961x3310/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69819543/2021_04_17_Image_D638565.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Daimler AG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pwOfP8"&gt;Mercedes-Benz said recently that it was going &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588587/mercedes-benz-electric-ev-2030-caveat"&gt;all-electric by 2030&lt;/a&gt;, which naturally got race fans excited about the possibilities of an electric high-performance car from the automaker’s AMG sub-brand. Today, we’re getting our first look at the upcoming AMG EQS, a wickedly fast sport sedan with a 0-60 mph time of 3.4 seconds and a top speed of 155 mph. It made its public debut at the 2021 IAA Mobility show in Germany. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1uehOE"&gt;The AMG EQS is the first battery-electric production car from the automaker’s in-house performance subsidiary. As such, there’s a lot riding on Mercedes getting everything exactly right if it wants to satisfy its loyal customers while also luring new ones away from Tesla. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MsxGgO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;first battery-electric production car from the automaker’s in-house performance subsidiary&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zC70EP"&gt;This is a driving machine made for “car enthusiasts,” Mercedes said — and at first glance it’s easy to see why, with its smooth lines and aerodynamic profile. The question is how car enthusiasts will react to the completely silent electric motors, or Mercedes’ attempt to fill the void left by the lack of a V8 with something called “emotive vehicle sound.” (More on that in a bit.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0n3jQUpsMxPbk1emCdIOfy1FyPk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22827132/2021_04_17_Image_D638564.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Daimler AG&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DHVVbK"&gt;The EQS, the all-electric version of the automaker’s storied S-class sedan, came out this year to rave reviews. When we tested it, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/11/22375877/mercedes-benz-eqs-ev-s-class-specs-hands-on"&gt;we came away impressed&lt;/a&gt; by the powerful battery, wide range of driving modes, and the over-the-top in-car technology. Mercedes needs the AMG version of the EQS to be equally impressive if it wants to compete with Tesla, Audi, BMW and others in the luxury segment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wA2cLp"&gt;A quick look at the spec sheet reveals a lot to be impressed by. The sedan’s dual motors will put out 649 horsepower, with a maximum torque of 700 ft-lbs. If somehow that’s not enough acceleration, you can kick the horsepower up to 751 while using Race Start mode with boost function, which also increases the torque to 752 ft-lbs.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/piCwNDhI4zWcOmz0rCJCnlbmwC0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22827133/2021_04_17_Image_D638575.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Daimler AG&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JAfwLl"&gt;The 400-volt battery has a usable energy content of 107.8kWh, which is more capacity than every Tesla vehicle. Mercedes says it has reduced the cobalt content of the battery’s chemistry to 10 percent. Cobalt is the most expensive material used in batteries, so eliminating it from the mix is expected to help EVs become as affordable as those that run on gas. It has also been called the “blood diamond of batteries” because it’s been mined in a way that’s endangered child workers and wrecked the environment in the Democratic Republic of Congo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tYtz0V"&gt;Mercedes says the battery management system is also configured specifically for AMG. In the Sport and Sport+ driving modes the focus is on performance, while Comfort mode focuses on operating range. Given what we know about the EQS’ driving modes and the use of regenerative braking, that is sure to be a welcome feature when you’re in the driver seat.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yv5iwl"&gt;And you know Mercedes is really excited to explain the AMG’s unique sound profile because it’s really high up in the press release under the subhed “AMG SOUND EXPERIENCE: emotional sound spectrum for a unique driving experience.” The whole idea is because EVs are silent, the automakers are creating their own fake sounds that match the vehicle’s acceleration, so you aren’t flying around the race track in a completely silent sports car. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h2CIYeG67AHXEWnnsCzIiZZktuE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22827134/2021_04_19_Image_D638569.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Daimler AG&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fU9Y2e"&gt;Mercedes says it used “special loudspeakers, subwoofers and a sound generator to create a special sound experience in two versions: ‘Authentic’ or ‘Performance.’” The fake sounds are generated inside and outside the vehicle to match the driving status. There’s a video that includes the sound, and honestly, I’m fine with it. It’s not an engine growl, but it also doesn’t sound overly manufactured. I wasn’t a huge fan of the Volkswagen ID 4’s fake sound, but this one seems like it won’t offend too many people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ts8azv"&gt;The AMG EQS is built on one of three bespoke EV architectures built by Mercedes for its new lineup of electric vehicles. This car and future electric AMG models will be built on the AMG.EA architecture, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BjAWuR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10735489"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ewcZjL"&gt;Inside, you’ll find the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22217267/mercedes-benz-hyperscreen-size-specs-eqs-ces-2021"&gt;Mercedes Hyperscreen&lt;/a&gt;, three screens embedded in a single piece of glass that extends from pillar-to-pillar. It runs on the automaker’s MBUX system, but also includes something unique to AMG:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="D7IsiG"&gt;AMG TRACK PACE, the virtual race engineer, is also available as an option: the software is part of the MBUX infotainment system and permanently records more than 80 vehicle-specific data (i.e. speed, acceleration), for example while driving on a racetrack. On top of this, lap and sector times are displayed, as well as the respective difference from a reference time. Because specific display elements are shown in green or red, the driver is able to see at a glance, without reading numbers, whether they are currently faster or slower than the best time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Hbzkwl"&gt;Think of it like a fitness app that tracks your workout performance, but for your car. Race enthusiasts are going to find a lot to like here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SuQOzq"&gt;We still don’t have a production date or a suggested retail price. The 2021 EQS costs well over $100,000, so don’t expect this one to retail for anything less than $120,000. The question is whether Mercedes can get this car to customers before the release of the next-gen Tesla Roadster, which was just delayed to 2023. If they can than the AMG EQS has a real chance to steal the show. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mercedes-Benz takes another shot at launching an electric SUV in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c1sh-2oLNOblBSiuiu17fEJ2NJ4=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69819525/2020_09_26_Image_D638345.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Mercedes-Benz&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oF8Gk5"&gt;Just months after Mercedes-Benz launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22239135/mercedes-benz-eqa-electric-crossover-range-price-specs"&gt;its first true compact electric SUV&lt;/a&gt;, the EQA, the German automaker now has a slightly larger and more capable companion: the EQB. Revealed in full today at the 2021 IAA Mobility show in Germany, the company will start building the EQA in Hungary and China this month, and it will start selling the SUV in the US in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GCtGU0"&gt;Mercedes-Benz trotted out the EQB alongside a few other new electric vehicles that it’s adding to its stable. There’s the EQE sedan, which is a more attainable version of its flagship executive electric, the EQS. Mercedes-Benz also rolled out AMG and Maybach versions of the EQS. There’s even now going to be an electric version of the G-Wagen — though that’s not coming for a while, as Mercedes-Benz only debuted a concept version of the so-called EQG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0u0Y7d"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Mercedes’ second compact electric SUV, after the EQA&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UGD5Fm"&gt;Mercedes-Benz first showed off the EQB at the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22392215/mercedes-benz-eqb-electric-suv-us-specs-auto-shanghai-2021"&gt;Auto Shanghai show April&lt;/a&gt;, but the company used Sunday’s reveal to dive deeper into the details, and its plans for the compact SUV. Crucially, the EQB will represent Mercedes-Benz’s second attempt at launching an electric SUV in the United States, after it canceled plans to bring the EQC stateside earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="br3lhq"&gt;The broad strokes of the EQB are the same as we heard in April. The all-wheel drive EQB will seat five, with an optional third row that can turn it into a seven-seater. Those third-row seats won’t be massively accommodating, though, as Mercedes-Benz says they’ll only be good for kids or people up to 5 feet, 4 inches tall. The EQB is also expected to get around 419 kilometers (roughly 260 miles) of range, at least based on the European WLTP standard — meaning the EPA estimated range will likely be lower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jHgrcO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10736393"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2r9ImB"&gt;It’s not hard to imagine that interior space and range were among the reasons Mercedes-Benz backed off bringing the EQC to the US. The EQB has a little more of both, but it could yet be a tough sell in a market that’s still a bit wary of electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qu4UMy"&gt;Still, the EQB is set for far more markets in the US, and it could find success in those other parts of the world. Mercedes-Benz said Sunday that it will sell two versions of the SUV, too — one with 225 horsepower and one with 288 horsepower, dubbed the EQB 300 4MATIC and EQB 350 4MATIC, respectively. A front-wheel drive version will come at a later date, as will a “particularly long-range version,” Mercedes-Benz says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0fOJ3Q"&gt;Small- to mid-size electric SUVs can &lt;a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/features/g36278968/best-selling-evs-of-2021/"&gt;find success in the US&lt;/a&gt; — just look at the Tesla Model Y, which has already eclipsed its sedan counterpart, the Model 3. Ford has had early luck with its Mustang Mach-E, and the new Chevy Bolts were doing okay before the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/30/22648922/gm-chevy-bolt-ev-production-halt-recall-fire-risk"&gt;massive recall&lt;/a&gt;. But higher-end imports that require some compromise on range, like Audi’s E-Tron, have not found such solid footing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r0y4cA"&gt;Mercedes-Benz will eventually build electric SUVs on the platform it developed for the EQS (like it’s doing with the EQE), and those ground-up EVs naturally require less compromise. The EQB will test whether Mercedes-Benz can carve out some of the market until that happens — that is, &lt;em&gt;if &lt;/em&gt;it follows through on the launch this time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Mercedes-Benz EQE is a more approachable luxury electric car</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w5A2ehAPGaP-iAz31CawlhbFgo0=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69819542/2021_07_01_Image_D638183.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Mercedes-Benz&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cM67wL"&gt;If you liked Mercedes-Benz’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/11/22375877/mercedes-benz-eqs-ev-s-class-specs-hands-on"&gt;flagship electric sedan&lt;/a&gt;, the EQS, but grimaced at its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22618661/mercedes-benz-eqs-price-sale-germany-orders-over-the-air"&gt;six-figure price tag&lt;/a&gt; (or don’t feel you need its sundry bells and whistles), the German automaker has a new vehicle on the way that may be of interest. On Sunday, Mercedes-Benz revealed the EQE, a slightly smaller sedan built on the same technical platform that will undoubtedly be a few bucks cheaper when it launches next year — though the company did not share pricing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1YUZ04"&gt;The EQE was revealed at the 2021 IAA Mobility conference alongside a few other electrics that are coming out of Stuttgart: the EQB compact SUV, AMG performance and Maybach versions of the EQS, and an electric G-Wagen concept. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NXi6cE"&gt;While the EQE is 3.5 inches shorter than the EQS, it will share a lot of the same traits as the company’s leading electric sedan — in fact, at one point in its press release, Mercedes-Benz says the EQE will be “[c]ontinuing the good genes of the EQS.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8Yy91T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10736404"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yPBqyt"&gt;That said, some of the EQS’s more standout features are no longer standard. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22217267/mercedes-benz-hyperscreen-size-specs-eqs-ces-2021"&gt;massive “hyperscreen” display&lt;/a&gt; that dominates the dashboard will be available, but only as an option. Rear-axle steering will also be available... as an option. (In the EQS, 4.5 degrees of rear-axle steering is standard, while buyers can pay more to essentially “unlock” 10 degrees of rear axle steering.) The EQE will get over-the-air &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22618661/mercedes-benz-eqs-price-sale-germany-orders-over-the-air"&gt;updates and upgrades&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YGzijb"&gt;The rear-wheel drive launch model of the EQE will use the same 90kWh battery pack that powers the base model of the EQS, which the company says will be good for up to an impressive 660 kilometers (410 miles) of driving on a full charge — though that figure is based on the more forgiving European WLTP standard, and so a more realistic range estimate will likely be lower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KcrVzz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A slightly less ludicrous EQS — but with plenty of options&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eRr5DL"&gt;This EQE will put down significantly less power — 288 horsepower versus the 516HP of the all-wheel drive EQS. Mercedes-Benz says a second variant will be available at launch, though it didn’t clarify whether that other EQE will be more or less capable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ihpGCL"&gt;Still, by building on an electric vehicle platform and ditching the combustion powertrain, Mercedes-Benz says that the EQE’s interior dimensions “clearly exceed” those of the existing E-Class. Practically, this means there’s an extra inch of shoulder room for those sitting up front, and an extra three inches in interior length. Being seated atop the battery pack also means the EQE offers a higher seating position for an even better view of the road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qvme8"&gt;The EQS already looks like a worthy competitor to Tesla’s Model S Plaid, so the EQE is all about trying to offer a somewhat more affordable and approachable way into what Mercedes-Benz is doing at the high end with its electric cars. And as long as it executes, the EQE could be a far more promising entrant into the market than some of Mercedes-Benz’s other early attempts, like the EQC, which was full of compromises due to being being built on a combustion engine platform instead of being a ground-up electric vehicle — one of the goals that it established when it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/10/20858555/mercedes-benz-vision-eqs-concept-frankfurt-motor-show-2019"&gt;first revealed the Vision EQS concept in 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eXdWHA"&gt;“After the EQS, the EQE is already the second model on our platform for luxury- and premium-class electric vehicles,” Markus Schäfer, chief operating officer of Mercedes-Benz said in a statement. “This speed of innovation shows the advantages of the scalable architecture: With the new EQE, we can quickly make the high-tech solutions of our electric flagship EQS available to a wider group of buyers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m8BSy5"&gt;One of the other big goals Mercedes-Benz laid out with the Vision EQS in 2019 was sustainability, and it’s backing up some of that ambition with the EQE. The company says the structural shell of the car is made with recycled steel, and that many of the internal components are made of recycled and renewable materials, including cable ducts. Mercedes-Benz also says less than 10 percent of the battery chemistry consists of cobalt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YIi2om"&gt;That’s good to hear from a company that, like Volkswagen, spent years &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367768/daimler-diesel-emissions-cheating-scandal-settlement-us-amount"&gt;lying about the true emissions of its diesel cars and intentionally duped regulators&lt;/a&gt;. Though it likely won’t boost EQE sales. Instead, Mercedes-Benz will have to convince buyers that sedans still have a place in the world — and that an electric E-class is just as much worth a year’s salary as its gas-powered predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mercedes-Benz reveals an electric G-Wagen concept for the future</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WcDrA2P5Nx4nZlU3dNVVKvFe1LU=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69819528/2021_06_21_Image_21C0523_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Mercedes-Benz&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The G-Class is going electric&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="zZSKwc"&gt;Mercedes-Benz has revealed an electric concept version of its boxy luxury off-roader, the G-Wagen, dotted with glowing accents and wearing some seriously moon rover-style wheels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GBQnVD"&gt;Officially known as the Concept EQG, Mercedes-Benz was &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; light on details about the electric SUV while showing it off at the 2021 IAA Mobility show in Munich. It didn’t cite estimates for range, or mention battery size, or the power output of the electric motors. It will be all-wheel drive, though, and it will have a low and high gear. Also, those wheels are 22 inches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NKeCbM"&gt;Instead, the Concept EQG is right now closer to a design exercise — a first attempt at how Mercedes-Benz may modify the new generation of the G-Class that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/15/16893660/2019-mercedes-g-class-detroit-auto-show-2018-first-look"&gt;first revealed at the 2018 Detroit Auto Show&lt;/a&gt;, and something to gawk at until a production version comes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wexe7c"&gt;It’s a striking first attempt, though. The EQG is clad in the same kind of two-tone paint job that Mercedes-Benz used on the first editions of its electric EQS sedan. The illuminated grille the company has been toying with on some other concepts and production vehicles finally doesn’t look so out of place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="niP213"&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Ed. note: Enjoy this amazing video of the EQG in “an epic 70s space opera” from Mercedes-Benz “where an electric vehicle will take you to a world beyond imagination” ... starring “aliens”]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8ZNSS7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/if-4pPa7KGw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xmTJtW"&gt;Whenever a production EQG does arrive, it’ll join an ever-crowded field of electric vehicles that can handle rough terrain. General Motors revived the Hummer brand and is making two all-electric versions of it: an SUV and a pickup truck. EV startup Rivian is about to launch its first pickup truck, with an SUV coming later this year. Ford has even teased that an all-electric version of its newly-revived Bronco SUV will eventually hit the road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="UvHK9F"&gt;The G-Wagen has always been as much of a status symbol vehicle as it is about venturing off-road, though, so expect the production EQG to be loaded with all the same kinds of features that Mercedes-Benz has been rolling out in its newest, most expensive vehicles, like the EQS sedan. And if Mercedes-Benz can give the EQG the same kind of range and performance that its EQS and EQE sedans are getting on the company’s new electric vehicle platform, the electric G-Wagen could be something to behold.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New published patents show Dyson designs for stair-climbing and drawer-opening robots</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/toRvLtyPu1M51_xGJBl-XuAJxU8=/28x0:697x446/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69819237/stair_climbing_robot1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A patent filing from Dyson showing a robot that can climb and clean stairs | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.ipo.gov.uk/p-ipsum/Case/ApplicationNumber/GB2002772.8" target="_blank"&gt;UK Intellectual Property Office&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="514wn8"&gt;Premium vacuum company Dyson has patented designs for robots that look like they could climb and clean stairs, and open drawers, new filings show. It’s not clear whether the designs are for forthcoming products or ideas that are on hold, but &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-03/dyson-could-be-designing-a-robot-that-can-climb-stairs?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that Dyson’s robotic unit has been working on a robot to interact with other home appliances. Whether it’s the robot hand or the stair-climbing robot, or another product entirely also isn’t clear at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ymahoP"&gt;The patents published in the UK on September 1st show the two designs; a “&lt;a href="https://www.ipo.gov.uk/p-ipsum/Case/ApplicationNumber/GB2002772.8"&gt;robotic device with tri-star wheels and actuated arm&lt;/a&gt;” that would be able to climb steps and clean them (a stair-climbing vacuum sounds like an excellent idea), and a &lt;a href="https://www.ipo.gov.uk/p-ipsum/Case/ApplicationNumber/GB2002777.7"&gt;“robot hand”&lt;/a&gt; which is shown in drawings with the patent application holding a mug (and which is making me envision it bringing me a cup of coffee at this early hour).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nZocIjq-tl-a3ZHrpW_nVGuq1x4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22828144/robot_hand_2.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.ipo.gov.uk/p-ipsum/Document/ApplicationNumber/GB2002777.7/54d08efc-7e2d-4444-bd37-c296c448ad87/GB2592410-20200227-Drawings.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;UK Intellectual Property Office&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;A drawing from a Dyson patent filing shows a robot hand holding a cup&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lazy-img-377930264"&gt;The usual caveats about patents apply, of course; companies file for many patents that may never result in a consumer product, and &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes that Dyson has filed for patents for everything from a “&lt;a href="https://www.pocket-lint.com/smart-home/news/dyson/157072-dyson-s-next-device-could-be-an-electric-toothbrush-with-integrated-water-jet"&gt;dental treatment device&lt;/a&gt;” (aka a toothbrush) to an &lt;a href="https://www.ipo.gov.uk/p-ipsum/Document/ApplicationNumber/GB2002777.7/54d08efc-7e2d-4444-bd37-c296c448ad87/GB2592410-20200227-Drawings.pdf"&gt;air purifier/headphone device&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b3yu8T"&gt;Dyson didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment on Sunday. But a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; “we file a lot of patents” and that the company doesn’t comment on technologies it “may or may not launch in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GoDaddy cut off Texas Right to Life’s abortion ‘whistleblowing’ website, and it might be gone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-MEXICO-BORDER" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mzsrsS8Dh7ma-8JqW0CDO3pJ3xQ=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69814931/1233640838.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PUy8f0"&gt;In case you haven’t heard, Texas now has a law that makes it illegal for anyone to help women get an abortion &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22656392/lyft-uber-legal-fees-drivers-lawsuit-texas-sb8-abortion-law"&gt;after six weeks of pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; with no exceptions for rape or incest — and to take advantage of that, the anti-abortion group Texas Right to Life is encouraging citizens to report those people at a dedicated “whistleblower” website, promising to “ensure that these lawbreakers are held accountable for their actions.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FLQOwQ"&gt;On Friday, Texas Right to Life had to find a new home on the web, because hosting provider GoDaddy gave the group 24 hours to find a different place to park its website. “We have informed prolifewhistleblower.com they have 24 hours to move to another provider for violating our terms of service,” &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/03/technology/texas-abortion-law-website-tiktok.html"&gt;a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H3VEtx"&gt;By late Friday, it appeared it found that home: Epik, the provider that also helped save &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18049132/gab-social-network-online-synagogue-shooting-deplatforming-return-godaddy-paypal-stripe-ban"&gt;controversial sites Gab&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/17/22236178/parler-resurfaces-sunday-app-banned"&gt;social media platform Parler&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/5/20754943/8chan-epik-offline-voxility-service-cutoff-hate-speech-ban"&gt;internet hate forum 8chan&lt;/a&gt; when other web service providers wouldn’t take them, is now listed as the registrar and name server provider for prolifewhistleblower.com as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ssajkq"&gt;But the site may have gone too far for any web provider to touch, even Epik. Initially, GoDaddy told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the whistleblower site violated “multiple provisions” of its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.godaddy.com%2Flegal%2Fagreements%2Funiversal-terms-of-service-agreement&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F3%2F22656196%2Fgodaddy-texas-right-for-life-abortion-whistleblowing-site" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Terms of Service&lt;/a&gt; including Section 5.2, which reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="uQcvnG"&gt;You will not collect or harvest (or permit anyone else to collect or harvest) any User Content (as defined below) or any non-public or personally identifiable information about another User or any other person or entity without their express prior written consent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="VdDqlT"&gt;After Epik stepped in, the website still had plenty of trouble staying online. As of 4AM ET Saturday, we saw HTTP 503 error codes when trying to access it. &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/09/texas-abortion-snitch-website-kicked-off-godaddy-for-invading-peoples-privacy/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Texas anti-abortion group tried to use Digital Ocean as a hosting provider first, but may have fallen afoul of that provider’s rules as well, and it’s not hosted there anymore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n1Z61S"&gt;On Saturday, the site appeared to have migrated to BitMitigate, a webhost owned by Epik itself, and one that specifically advertises &lt;a href="https://bitmitigate.com/sovereign-hosting.html"&gt;its “sovereign hosting” services&lt;/a&gt; for platforms under attack. Yet by Saturday evening, the site was not loading for us at all, throwing an “accessed a banned URL” error. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CatEmbedded/status/1434317058620207105"&gt;Reportedly&lt;/a&gt;, Epik also decided hosting the form that allowed citizens to inform on their neighbors was against its terms of service, too, and has cut it off once more. We’ve reached out to Epik to confirm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5zw3kD"&gt;The anti-abortion group’s website has been under siege for days now, with angry protesters flooding it with fake tips — including at least one fake claim that Texas governor Greg Abbott himself had violated the law, according to the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;. One activist on TikTok even created a script that can automatically feed fake reports into the website’s tipbox, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3x9ba/tiktok-texas-abortion-law-bot-site-ios-shortcut"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Motherboard &lt;/em&gt;reported yesterday&lt;/a&gt;. He told&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; that the automated tools he’d created had received over 15,000 clicks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="zQ1vqM"&gt;But on Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/here-s-how-you-can-help-shut-down-the-vile-website-for-1847557293"&gt;Gizmodo’s Shoshana Wodinsky suggested another way for activists to protest&lt;/a&gt;: blowing the whistle on Texas Right to Life itself, by complaining to GoDaddy about what it was doing. That’s what appears to have happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6bxPLM"&gt;It’s not the first time web hosting providers or even GoDaddy specifically have played this role: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/28/18036520/gab-down-godaddy-domain-blocked"&gt;Gab.com had to find a new home in October 2018&lt;/a&gt;, and GoDaddy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/4/17320086/godaddy-domain-registrar-richard-spencer-altright-com-offline"&gt;took down white nationalist Richard Spencer’s Altright.com&lt;/a&gt; that May. Neo-nazi news site the Daily Stormer was similarly given 24 hours by GoDaddy to find a new home &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/14/16142384/daily-stormer-site-go-daddy-hosting-providers-hackers-anonymous"&gt;in August 2017&lt;/a&gt;, and wound up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/15/16150668/daily-stormer-alt-right-dark-web-site-godaddy-google-ban"&gt;moving to the dark web&lt;/a&gt; instead. Gab was able to return, though, and Texas Right to Life at least briefly did as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony to offer free Horizon Forbidden West PS4 to PS5 upgrade after criticism</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/unkK9aJ4aIlLAckYQ-qI65jMFxE=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69818210/011c8fd12276586aaf21afa308317ab0.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yd7GB1"&gt;Sony is now planning to offer a free &lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt; upgrade from PS4 to PS5. The U-turn follows widespread criticism after the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654091/horizon-forbidden-west-no-next-gen-upgrade-ps4-ps5"&gt;company announced&lt;/a&gt; there would be no upgrade path for &lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West &lt;/em&gt;PS4 players, despite &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/4/22657200/sony-upgrade-playstation-horizon-forbidden-west-ps5"&gt;an original promise of a free upgrade&lt;/a&gt; to the PS5 version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Mbq6j"&gt;“It’s abundantly clear that the offerings we confirmed in our pre-order kickoff missed the mark,” &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/09/04/pre-order-horizon-forbidden-west-now-collectors-and-digital-deluxe-editions-detailed/"&gt;admits Jim Ryan&lt;/a&gt;, president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment. “While the pandemic’s profound impact pushed &lt;em&gt;Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt; out of the launch window we initially envisioned, we will stand by our offer: Players who purchase &lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt; on PlayStation 4 will be able to upgrade to the PlayStation 5 version for free.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YAVDeh"&gt;Sony had originally planned to force PS4 players of &lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West &lt;/em&gt;to purchase the $79.99 Digital Deluxe edition, $199.99 Collector’s edition, or $259.99 Regalla edition to get access to both the PS4 and PS5 versions of &lt;em&gt;Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LzpWip"&gt;Sony is now also committing to a $10 digital upgrade option for both digital and physical versions of PlayStation first-party exclusive cross-gen titles. That means the next &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo 7&lt;/em&gt;, and other Sony first-party cross-gen games will have a $10 digital upgrade option for PS4 players wanting to move to the PS5 version of the games.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Last year’s M1 MacBook Air is just one of many items on sale this Labor Day weekend.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2LBXuy"&gt;Labor Day deals are now in full swing, with a slew of notable discounts available on some major hardware and accessories across the tech spectrum. Whether you’re picking up some last-minute gear for school or preparing to hunker down for the fall TV season with your favorite streaming device, this weekend might be the last real opportunity for you to save some serious money on TVs, headphones, and other gadgets until Black Friday and Cyber Monday roll around in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MzRWwT"&gt;To make sorting through the abundance of deals easier, we’ve curated a selection of the best Labor Day sales and deals available, the bulk of which should last through the long weekend.
