    <title>Amazon Glow review: fun but unfinished</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;There’s a lot to like about this intergenerational calling device, but Amazon is a bit bossy&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="4RDYdT"&gt;Amazon’s latest attempt to entertain your children is an innovative effort that combines an interactive projector with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436457/amazon-kids-rebranding-freetime"&gt;Amazon Kids Plus’&lt;/a&gt; excellent catalog of child-friendly content. What it is not is an Alexa device, despite having four microphones built in and sharing a name with the Echo lamp for kids. Rather than being a part of Amazon’s growing, open smart home ecosystem, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09DWNZQYM?ref=+ods_lp_day1_io_ja&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$300 Amazon Glow&lt;/a&gt; is an expensive, manicured walled garden for your kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GApn0k"&gt;A video calling / interactive gaming device specifically designed to make it easier for children to communicate with friends and family remotely, the Amazon Glow is attempting to make these rather forced interactions more natural, engaging, and fun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hadjHo"&gt;Where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22732472/facebook-portal-go-10-inch-2021-review"&gt;Facebook’s Portal Go&lt;/a&gt; tries to solve the problem of wriggly, distractible kids by making a portable device that lets you bring the conversation to where they are, Amazon tries to keep your kid captivated with Grandma via a stationary tabletop projector. A 19.2-inch projected play area encourages more active play, letting grandparent, aunt, uncle, or second cousin not just watch your child draw, paint, or play games but join in the fun — albeit in a slightly terrifying, disembodied head format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="agsnRK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10847665"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9XMv4n"&gt;Unfortunately, coming with an entirely new hardware platform makes the Glow too expensive, and its limitations mean it’s not likely to replace a tablet as your child’s tech toy of choice. I would also caution anyone considering investing in this as a holiday gift that Glow is part of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=21601403011"&gt;Amazon’s Day1 Editions&lt;/a&gt; program, which could mean the company is still figuring out if it wants to commit to this product. You also can’t just go and buy this; you have to request an invitation, although you do get it at the slightly discounted price of $249 for your trouble. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2G9Esp"&gt;Adding to the initial outlay is an ongoing monthly content subscription (starting at $2.99 a month but included for the first year) and the need for whoever your child is calling to have a tablet for the best experience. (It also doesn’t currently work with Fire tablets, which can be had pretty cheap, but Amazon says compatibility is coming soon.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LNOZzP"&gt;However, Amazon does offer a two-year guarantee and free replacement if it breaks — which is a good thing as this nearly took a nose dive off our kitchen counter several times. Also, there are no ads anywhere to be found in the Glow, which is a refreshing change for an Amazon device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5RoUu5bKb5I0VRahw2EZ3MQD_l8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22977076/jtuohy_211027_4856_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;My 10-year-old chatting with her grandma while they both draw in the Glow’s art program. The 8-inch portrait screen that displays the caller’s head is a bit awkward.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h82HuW"&gt;At just over 14 inches tall, the Glow is a towering device resembling a squared-off Echo speaker with an eight-inch touchscreen on the front to show the remote caller. A 720p camera sits above the screen to capture the child and their actions, and a 10-watt speaker sits below it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wBBzfP"&gt;Two-way audio is enabled by four microphones above the protruding hunk of plastic that houses a projector. This beams a 19.2-inch touch-sensitive projection screen onto a specially designed white mat where IR sensors and a second camera enable interaction. Also included are seven tangram puzzle pieces, which you can scan into special puzzles and play with both digitally and physically. All of this takes up a significant amount of space, however, and it can be challenging to find a good spot for it; plus, the device is not very portable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eeVPxM"&gt;The Glow is powered by a short, removable power cord, and there is a physical privacy shutter that cuts off video and microphones, plus a power button and volume up and down button along the side. It’s designed for kids ages three to nine to chat and play with remote family and friends, and it takes advantage of Amazon’s strong parental control features (so, there’s no worry that your child is going to wander off down an internet rabbit hole, and there is no web-browser in the Glow). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oykBsow-vGyj9vlKGXjoBFPFw_M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22977073/jtuohy_211027_4856_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The projector sits above a 720p camera that captures what the child is doing and sends it to their virtual playmate. A physical shutter can be engaged at any time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JhrgZq"&gt;The child uses the hands-free Glow device, and the remote user plays on a tablet (iPad or Android). You can’t currently play Glow to Glow, and while there are some games you can play solo or side by side, the concept here is resolutely about interacting with someone who lives elsewhere, not about adding another personal screen into your home. In reality, this means if you want to play on the Glow with your child while you’re at home, you’ll have to sit in another room with a tablet. It feels like someone didn’t really think that through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dq7OzO"&gt;Unlike most video-calling devices, this is designed to offer two slightly different experiences for the participants. While each participant sees the same interface that consists of digital bookshelves from which you select games, puzzles, books, and activities, and each can control that interface, the adult gets more prompts and controls than the child. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LTN11E"&gt;It feels specifically designed for the Glow user to be a tech-savvy child who can instinctively control things with touch and would otherwise get bored and distracted by talking to a 2D face on a screen. The tablet user designation seems to be an older person who requires more text-based prompts and guidance when grappling with this new-fangled technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nK2_MmHrdS17psY1zC4Ee0fKntk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22988402/A4CCD05B_EE8E_4491_A84A_F2035E345F33.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The tablet interface in the Glow app shows you an inset video of the child, and the same gameplay screen but from your perspective. If you tap on the caller you can view yourself and them but not the gameplay.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8d6JRQ"&gt;While I get where Amazon is coming from here, this stereotyping feels uncomfortable. And feeds into my chief complaint with the Glow: it’s too tightly controlled. I’m not talking about privacy or parental controls, those are all present and correct. I mean the gameplay. After an hour or so of testing it with my 10-year-old daughter and her 74-year-old grandmother, we ran into several restrictions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XpsYuj"&gt;For example, a game of chess (which was incredibly fun and cleverly executed) refused to let me win. It insisted the game was a draw, even though I had thoroughly checkmated my kid. It was like being told by a teacher that you’re not allowed to do that until you’re old enough to handle it. Also, while you can download books from the Kids Plus catalog, only picture books and graphic novels work, not chapter books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GmAr4Q"&gt;I was also flummoxed to find out that despite the device having Bluetooth, you cannot pair Bluetooth headsets to the Glow. “[That] is not possible with Glow as part of the fun for parents is to be able to hear their child speaking with a remote family member or friend, just like a playdate in person, and joining the conversation if they choose,” Amazon PR told me in an email. Thanks, but I don’t need to be told how to have fun with my kids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/plw0w_eW4q3K3GbbNMjklj4xY88=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22977077/jtuohy_211027_4856_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The art screen lets a child’s creativity roam, but beware of the vacuum cleaner icon, which either player can use to erase your work in an instant.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dCcqdk"&gt;An excellent use case for this device for work-from-home parents is to pop their child on a call with a friend or family member if they need to get some work done. It’s much less guilt-inducing than sticking on another &lt;em&gt;Peppa Pig&lt;/em&gt; marathon to get through your weekly team meeting. But for that to work in a small apartment, for example, headphones on your child would be very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k5fdBl"&gt;While my children aren’t the target age range here (at least not yet — Amazon told me it is planning to bring more content tailored toward older children), my 10-year-old daughter really enjoyed many of the games. Her favorite feature by far was the interactive art area, where you can let your creativity roam free from most of the device’s restraints and even scan real-life objects into your masterpieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uKnhRt"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Amazon Glow scanning|104696" data-volume-uuid="fe35039c2" data-volume-id="104696" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="true" id="volume-placement-932" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A demonstration of how the scanning feature works to add everyday objects into your art projects on the Amazon Glow. The results are fine but the colors are quite grey.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6AymQ5"&gt;Setting up the Glow is straightforward, but it has to be done by an adult — it’s not a toy in itself. Plug it in, turn it on, scan the QR code displayed on the screen to download the Glow app. You can use a phone or tablet but the interactive experience is much better on a tablet. The app connects to the Glow over Bluetooth and enables a connection to your Wi-Fi network (2.4GHz or 5GHz). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKPlo9"&gt;Next, you sign in with your Amazon account (one is required to use the Glow and the companion app) and select your profile and add your children. If you already have an Amazon Kids account, they will show up, or you can create profiles for them. You can then add friends and family and choose which child they can interact with (if you have more than one). As a nice touch, you can change the family member’s name to one the child uses for them. Currently, the Glow app is only available to download in the US, so you won’t be able to chat with friends and family who live overseas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="eUsBmt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;My chief complaint with the Glow is it’s too tightly controlled&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WR8TqZ"&gt;When you add a contact, a download link for the Glow app is sent to them. On the other end, it gets a bit more complicated. Grandma or Grandpa has to sign in to their Amazon account (or sign up for one), add a mobile number, receive a text message confirmation code, and enter it in the app to enable Alexa calling. It’s also never made clear that it’s best to do this on a tablet, not a phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nanRUZ"&gt;Once set up, the child can call a contact by tapping on their avatar on the touchscreen, and the call comes in on the tablet like an Alexa call on an Echo smart display (although this is not an Alexa device). Once you answer it, both participants can see and control the game space and see each other. I like the interface because neither person sees themselves — you only see your playmate and the games, which helps a lot in limiting distractions. Although, this did often mean the grandparent wasn’t properly in the frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7PdFzjL1xdZd0fQ7QN_-GDZboHA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22988607/jtuohy_211028_4856_0017_blurred.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chess is one of the few games you can play side by side (i.e. without being in a call) and was a favorite during our testing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FxaZCS"&gt;The Glow has an impressive amount of content at launch, leaning heavily on the Amazon Kids Plus’ books library (there is no video anywhere to be found, which is a good thing) and introducing several entirely new games and puzzles. Some of our favorites were Bubble Game (where you work against the clock and your opponent to burst bubbles holding your designated letter), Paddle Battle (a variant of the Pong arcade game), and card games Crazy 8s, Go Fish, and Slapjack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRHUPD"&gt;But it was chess that took over most of our testing time. I’d been trying to get my daughter into chess for years, and she’s always resisted. But here, with an instant setup and hints on how to play, she was quickly captivated. She also loved that you could play in different worlds (with the pieces dressed up according to the theme) and that each piece was animated. When you move a piece into a dangerous zone, it starts shaking and looking scared. When you move one to a good spot, it looks smug. Fun &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; educational. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wGu31WRLgaKy3ULjrlsqq2Xk38U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22977080/jtuohy_211028_4856_0019_cropped.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The other person in the call uses the Glow app on an iPad (iOS14 or higher) or Android (OS 8 or higher) tablet to interact with the child using the Glow.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HYVjG2"&gt;Perhaps the best feature of Glow overall is that the games learn your competency as you play, starting out easy but quickly escalating in difficulty as you do well, helping keep the child engaged. Each activity also starts with plenty of hints and prompts to make it clear whose turn it is and what you should be doing, taking a lot of the tiring explanation out of teaching a child (or grandparent) a new game. A lot of these do require the child be able to read, though, so for younger children the picture books from Disney, Mattel, and others are another highlight of the device, with interactive touch points for the child and conversation hints on the adult’s side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="tPco8P"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon Glow is very promising but feels unfinished&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1kMuls"&gt;The gameplay was primarily smooth, but we did encounter a fair amount of freezing, slow loading, and glitches. Not surprising for a first-gen product that’s still in the testing stages, but frustrating all the same, causing my daughter to throw up her hands in annoyance and wander off during a game of Paddle Battle. (Again, this is a beta product for which you’re paying hundreds of dollars.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="OVZuHR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10847832"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kChYEW"&gt;The device is also slightly underpowered, and despite not being required to produce high-end graphics, a little more juice could help keep things flowing more smoothly. The video quality on the built-in 1280 x 800 resolution touchscreen was also often highly pixelated, and audio became robotic and garbled a few times. This was likely due to a poor internet connection on the other end, but something to bear in mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uhCSJa"&gt;The Amazon Glow is very promising but feels unfinished, a bit rough around the edges, and too limiting. However, I hope Amazon keeps working on it as it has plenty of potential as a kids’ entertainment device as well as for other applications. Touch-enabled projection technology makes a ton of sense in the home when you don’t want screens everywhere. A small, voice-activated projection device tucked up under a kitchen cabinet that could project on your kitchen counter or wall when you need a recipe or to see the feed from your video doorbell could easily be the next evolution of Amazon’s smart home efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="6K5h5O"&gt;But for now, you’ll probably want to pass on paying to join this beta test and wait for Amazon to fully flesh this product out before diving in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JJouLL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Walmart has PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles online today at 3PM ET</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yafvltDhCEhAYjlimngNXoncprM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70100579/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WX2inP"&gt;It’s November, and the holiday shopping season is well upon us. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;Early Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt; have already begun, and there’s sure to be a lot more in store for us come actual &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday&lt;/a&gt;. But the hottest tickets of the season, just as they were last year, are the still-hard-to-get consoles from Sony and Microsoft. Today, we bring some good news for you. Walmart is launching a restock of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"&gt;Playstation 5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; consoles at 3PM ET / 12PM PT today, Friday, November 5th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KxC1Bo"&gt;The consoles are hard enough to come by, but we don’t always get a drop of both Sony and Microsoft consoles at the same time — Walmart has been the only one doing so recently. Today’s restock will include the disc-based &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Video-Game-Console%2F165545420&amp;amp;subid1=vergeconsoles110521" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation 5 for $500&lt;/a&gt; and its less-costly sibling, the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Digital-Edition-Video-Game-Consoles%2F987823383&amp;amp;subid1=vergeconsoles110521" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation 5 Digital Edition for $400&lt;/a&gt;. On the Microsoft front, Walmart’s offerings for today only include the top-tier &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X%2F443574645&amp;amp;subid1=vergeconsoles110521" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X for $500&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CS6qwo"&gt;We strongly advise creating or logging in to your Walmart account in advance of 3PM. Make sure you already have your correct billing and shipping information added to minimize potential risk of delays or issues during the checkout process. If you don’t land the console of your choice right at 3PM, be sure to keep trying as Walmart often releases more stock in 10-minute increments until it’s all cleared out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LUv6RI"&gt;Since buying a console is only one part of the equation, we have gone ahead and pulled together some key accessories, game subscriptions, and notable titles you might also consider during your purchase. Many of the options below are on sale or discounted, unlike the consoles, so you can save some money as you step into the latest gaming generation. We’ve even got an exclusive deal for &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers on a 12-month subscription to PlayStation Plus, this weekend only or while supplies last, for just &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeConsoles110521&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Furldefense.proofpoint.com%2Fv2%2Furl%3Fu%3Dhttps-3A__www.eneba.com_us_psn-2Dplaystation-2Dnetwork-2Dcard-2Dpsn-2D365-2Ddays-2Dusa-2Dpsn-2Dkey-2Dunited-2Dstates%26d%3DDwMFaQ%26c%3D7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg%26r%3Dxk5KiED8BX7y2-_MCQb470KHOk8NhVXPerTCKuSIIjV9vZUa0o8dpEMoOMF_A_wF%26m%3DnV_0DHdj0FhX_webKkESlfOjCg5lBh3t9p_DUdvg5mhzeaqtP1R_v-b87nWieZeN%26s%3DrupKh2MCtibQPWxgcP1bIsJano46ZNTZUIXKXiEjHlg%26e%3D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$38 from Eneba&lt;/a&gt; (use code &lt;strong&gt;PLUSYEAR&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout). If picking up any of these accessories or titles at Walmart, add them to your cart ahead of time so you’re ready to go if you manage to nab a console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EWPq1j"&gt;Good luck, and happy gaming!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EV startup Workhorse faces Department of Justice probe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tKtHqCZMKI_-OFCjyHjAJPc2q5k=/8x0:4025x2678/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70100436/workhorse.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1jQOFS"&gt;The Department of Justice has opened an investigation into struggling electric vehicle startup Workhorse, according &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/electric-van-maker-workhorse-is-being-investigated-by-the-justice-department-documents-show-11636122236"&gt;to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The probe is reportedly being led by the US Attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York, which often investigates financial crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D7uCHM"&gt;Workhorse is already part of an investigation from the Securities and Exchange Commission that first came to light in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652319/workhorse-fraud-sec-investigation-short-seller-fuzzy-panda"&gt;September&lt;/a&gt;, when short-selling research firm Fuzzy Panda released a report accusing the EV startup of fraud. It’s the third EV startup under investigation from both agencies, following Nikola (whose founder was indicted on fraud charges earlier this year) and Lordstown Motors (which Workhorse has deep ties, too). Both of those startups came under investigation after Hindenburg Research, another short-selling research firm, published reports filled with accusations of fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sey47Y"&gt;The startup, an Ohio-based maker of commercial electric delivery vehicles, has struggled mightily the last few years as it fought for — but ultimately lost — the contract to build the next-generation mail truck for the United States Postal Service. That contract instead went to Oshkosh Defense. Workhorse protested the decision in the US Court of Federal Claims earlier this year, but abruptly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675630/workhorse-usps-mail-truck-bid-protest-dropped-oshkosh"&gt;dropped the lawsuit in September&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5R9ExO"&gt;Workhorse has also had trouble with its flagship vehicle, the C-1000. After finally getting it into production in August, the company immediately said it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616733/workhorse-c1000-electric-van-truck-redesign-wkhs-usps"&gt;needed to redesign the van&lt;/a&gt;. In September, it stopped shipping them altogether and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22688037/workhorse-suspends-delivery-recall-c-1000-electric-van"&gt;recalled all 41 that had been delivered&lt;/a&gt;. The startup’s executive ranks have turned over recently as well, with CEO Duane Hughes departing in July and CFO Steve Schrader leaving in October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XGpf6K"&gt;The Fuzzy Panda report published in September contained allegations that Workhorse lied about the validity of some of the orders it had collected for its delivery vehicle, and that the startup may have also committed accounting fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QA7pI3"&gt;Throughout all this turmoil, Workhorse has largely survived on loans from hedge funds. It has put up much of its intellectual property as collateral for those loans and stands to lose a lot in the event of a default. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s Dr. Brain is a bold, genre-bending thriller</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="dr. brain" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bdSPZb0E9B9NJVm_kU2J-QnyLwI=/694x0:3147x1635/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70100297/Dr_Brain_Photo_010302.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A decent Korean original series debut for the platform, helmed by a seasoned director&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Z1rZU1"&gt;Although &lt;em&gt;Dr. Brain&lt;/em&gt; stumbles through its world-building at times, there is something deeply bold and profoundly ambitious in this first Korean original series on Apple TV Plus. &lt;em&gt;Dr. Brain&lt;/em&gt; takes off as a six-episode thriller starring Lee Sun-kyun (of &lt;em&gt;Parasite&lt;/em&gt; fame) as neuroscientist Dr. Koh Se-won. It’s an encouraging start for the streamer’s Korean debut, though the show doesn’t quite deliver on the promise of its fascinating premise and excellent cast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CFxyyD"&gt;We are first introduced to Dr. Koh as a young kid on the autism spectrum, struggling to understand emotions and relate to others. He is unfortunately labeled as a problem child in school, which becomes an enormous burden for his single mother. Bringing him to doctors, the (exorbitant) treatments offered don’t quite seem to work the way she hopes for. Growing up with a propensity to “take things apart to see what is inside,” Dr. Koh dives into brain research, which allows him to study the human mind and get a glimpse of how others experience the world. Presenting his research and experiments at conferences, he is portrayed as a relatively successful scientist — albeit one whose ideas are unsettling to his peers. This introduction then takes a dark, abrupt turn as Dr. Koh suffers a series of horrific personal tragedies in quick succession. Increasingly desperate to unearth what happened, he personally tests his research by undergoing “brain syncs” with the dead to pry open their memories for clues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n8N3TH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr. Brain&lt;/em&gt; is a genre-bending piece of work, dancing between crime thriller, science fiction, and, most poignantly, a family drama. The series’ best work is in its portrait of grief, sketching Dr. Koh’s private moments as ones of anguish and gradual reckoning with his own flaws and missteps. There is a saying in academia that all research is in some part autobiographical and this rings true for Dr. Koh. His “brain sync” research becomes both a form of mourning and a type of searching, as he realizes that there is something more sinister behind the tragedies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="XHDPrQ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eB9PW65kWFo?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dbU7oN"&gt;Lee Sun-kyun delivers an appropriately reserved performance, getting the balance just right between playing an aloof neuroscientist and a traumatized, bereaved man seeking answers. His colleague, Dr. Hong Nam-il (Lee Jae-won), blossoms over the series, portraying a depth of character that far outdoes what the script offers him. As police officer Lieutenant Choi, Seo Ji-hye (from the immensely popular &lt;em&gt;Crash Landing On You&lt;/em&gt;) offers a refreshing steadiness throughout the series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Wg7MNB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s Foundation starts out big, lavish, and a little boring","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690292/foundation-apple-tv-plus-review"},{"title":"Apple’s latest sci-fi drama Invasion starts out too dang slow","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22740520/invasion-review-apple-tv-plus"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OgTp33"&gt;There are unshakeable marks of &lt;em&gt;Inception&lt;/em&gt; echoing through the six episodes, as characters wander through altered realities and layers of consciousness. &lt;em&gt;Dr. Brain &lt;/em&gt;is most intriguing when its characters are unsure whether other people they are seeing are real or figments from a glitchy brain sync. Although the show fumbles through the details of the brain sync mechanism, the central story of Dr. Koh’s search for truth and redemption is resoundingly coherent. Which makes it all the more disappointing that the more philosophical explorations in &lt;em&gt;Dr. Brain&lt;/em&gt; — on neurodiversity, ethics in brain research, and the concept of the self — are half-baked. Additionally, its treatment of female characters feels disconcertingly underdeveloped. They’re often left with little agency, abruptly enter and exit the narrative, and are ultimately relegated as untidy footnotes. With its uneven pace over six episodes, there is a gnawing sense that &lt;em&gt;Dr. Brain &lt;/em&gt;could have been truly great if its supporting characters and theories were more deeply fleshed out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="irGFjO"&gt;For example, though it never examines this fully, &lt;em&gt;Dr. Brain &lt;/em&gt;hints at some of the most complex moral dilemmas in technology that we’re really only beginning to truly interrogate. It is gravely disturbing to see Dr. Koh lurking around the morgue to find a corpse to test out his brain sync technology or hook himself up with a cat (!!) in the name of (hopefully) solving a crime. There is a fine balance between being a user of technology and being used by technology. Here is where the concept of brain syncs in the show carries some real-life parallels. How much of ourselves do we share via technology — and do we even have control over what and how much is shared? What does privacy mean in this digital age? Can the methods of technological advancement be justified as long as the outcomes are “good”? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Dr. Brain" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DnTuAzAMvTWXfCYSFw9JFSheX0U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22988263/ATV_Dr_Brain_Photo_010104.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sfcGtw"&gt;These questions are all the more poignant given the fact that the show is backed by one of the biggest technology companies in the world. There is perhaps a meta-critique here somewhere about the relationship between Apple and its users and whether our lives have really been made better by its products. Perhaps the conclusion that the show offers us is one of stubborn ambivalence toward technology: Dr. Koh’s use of brain sync technology (somewhat ironically) allows him to experience the richness of life, in all of its emotions, joys and sorrows, more than he ever could without it. Yet, this comes at a cost. He sometimes suffers from an information overload and his personality changes when reality and technology start to blur. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cqzmld"&gt;Seasoned writer-director Kim Jee-woon has helmed critically acclaimed Korean classics like &lt;em&gt;The Good, The Bad, The Weird&lt;/em&gt; (2008) and Korea’s first Warner Brothers-funded film &lt;em&gt;The Age of Shadows&lt;/em&gt; (2016). There are flashes of brilliance throughout the series, particularly in its seamless, well-timed use of flashbacks — a storytelling tool that too often feels abused nowadays. On one level, his sleek transitions between past and present fittingly capture the unsettled mind of Dr. Koh. On another, these shifts in time provide an absorbingly suspenseful experience for the viewer, especially in the last few episodes. This works in the show’s favor, as Apple TV Plus will drop episodes of &lt;em&gt;Dr. Brain&lt;/em&gt; one at a time, weekly through December 10th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="3jFg09"&gt;Based on the popular Korean webtoon of the same name, &lt;em&gt;Dr. Brain&lt;/em&gt; premiered on November 4th, coinciding with Apple TV Plus’ launch in the Korean market. Though Dr. Brain might feel like a slow start for Apple, it is perhaps helpful to remember that not too long ago, Netflix debuted its first Korean original series &lt;em&gt;Love Alarm&lt;/em&gt; to rather disappointing, less-than-illustrious reviews. However, the platform has since developed a prolific portfolio of Korean shows winning both critical and commercial acclaim, most notably with the breakout success of &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt;. Despite its shortcomings, &lt;em&gt;Dr. Brain&lt;/em&gt; offers a promising, hopeful glimpse of Apple TV Plus’ vision for its future projects in Korea and a veritable challenge to other streamers in the market. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook sued by defunct photo app Phhhoto on antitrust grounds</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook sued by founders of defunct photo app Phhhoto for putting it out of business&lt;/strong&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="B4wt1E"&gt;Defunct photo app Phhhoto is suing Meta, formerly Facebook, on antitrust grounds, claiming the social media platform feigned interest in working with it, but then copied its features and hid its name from search results, effectively driving it out of business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TapuwX"&gt;Phhhoto’s technology allowed users to capture five frames “in a single point-and-shoot burst,” which could be looped into a short video (a phhhoto) to be shared either on its platform or Instagram. Sound familiar? That’s because, according to Phhhoto, Facebook copied Phhhoto’s main feature and &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/introducing-boomerang-video-app"&gt;released it on its Instagram platform as Boomerang in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, after blocking Phhhoto from Instagram’s API and from being pre-populated in Instagram posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ni4nr7"&gt;“The actions of Facebook and Instagram destroyed Phhhoto as a viable business and ruined the company’s prospects for investment,” Phhhoto says in a complaint filed in US District Court on Thursday. “Phhhoto failed as a direct result of Facebook’s anticompetitive conduct. But for Facebook’s conduct, Phhhoto was positioned to grow into a social networking giant, similar in size, scope, and shareholder value to other social networking and media companies with which Facebook did not interfere.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yxNiD6"&gt;Phhhoto, which launched in 2014 and shut down in 2017, claims it had 3.7 million monthly active users at its peak, and celebrities including Beyoncé, Joe Jonas, Chrissy Teigen, and Bella Hadid were uncompensated users of the app, posting its content to their Instagram accounts. Phhhoto claims in its complaint that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, former Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom, and several other Facebook employees downloaded the app in August 2014 and examined its features. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mIO0qRIZq4XBFWsVWBjZ2i00Om0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22988080/zuck_phhhoto2.PNG"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phhhoto claims in a new lawsuit that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg examined its app in 2014.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NvyYRi"&gt;Bryan Hurren, then strategic partnerships manager at Facebook, reached out to Phhhoto in February 2015, telling the company it was “really awesome,” and offering to incorporate its tech into Facebook Messenger, according to the lawsuit. Phhhoto declined, but Hurren then offered to incorporate Phhhoto content into the News Feeds of Facebook users. After investing heavily in the project, Phhhoto says Hurren cited internal legal conversations that prevented the two companies from moving forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JkiMk2"&gt;In March 2015, Instagram’s settings changed, so that users of Phhhoto were unable to find their friends on Instagram, the lawsuit claims. Phhhoto claims Hurren told its team at the time that the company was “upset that Phhhoto was growing in users through its relationship with Instagram.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ow0KsL"&gt;Then, just as Phhhoto was about to launch the Android version of its app in October 2015, Instagram introduced Boomerang, which the lawsuit calls a “slavish clone” of Phhhoto. In March 2016, Phhhoto discovered that its content was being suppressed on Instagram. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XgVKXz"&gt;The company says its suspicions were confirmed in 2018, when UK’s Parliament released a &lt;a href="https://www.parliament.uk/globalassets/documents/commons-committees/culture-media-and-sport/Note-by-Chair-and-selected-documents-ordered-from-Six4Three.pdf"&gt;cache of previously sealed documents&lt;/a&gt; as part of an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18127230/facebook-data-documents-parliament-deals-zuckerberg"&gt;investigation into Facebook&lt;/a&gt;’s alleged anti-competitive and data-collection practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yaG2EF"&gt;“This revelation provided the first link between Facebook’s earlier actions toward Phhhoto (here, cutting off API access) as part of an exclusionary scheme with the algorithmic suppression discovered in late 2017,” according to Phhhoto’s lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5lgOo7"&gt;Phhhoto is seeking a jury trial and unspecified monetary damages. Joe Osborne, a spokesperson for Meta (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22745234/facebook-new-name-meta-metaverse-zuckerberg-rebrand"&gt;Facebook changed its name to Meta&lt;/a&gt; on October 28th), said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, “This suit is without merit and we will defend ourselves vigorously.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QrTRA4"&gt;

    <title>Lime raises over $500 million, confirms plans to take its electric scooter company public</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hw9PIGmh7cCQJpb3HfpDCVF4S2c=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70099980/LIME_SAN_FRANCISCO_STREET_DREAMS_120.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vnRqfq"&gt;Lime announced today that it raised $523 million in debt financing, a sign that investors are feeling more optimistic about the long-term survival of shared electric scooters in a post-pandemic world. Lime must be feeling more optimistic, too, because a spokesperson confirmed that the company plans on going public sometime in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KM6IaK"&gt;Last September, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/scooter-startup-lime-raise-new-funding-after-spac-setback-uber-2021-9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insider &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Lime was hoping to raise up to $200 million in convertible debt from Uber and other previous investors. The scooter company was also reportedly in talks with investment bank Evercore about going public via a reverse merger with a special acquisition company, or SPAC, but &lt;em&gt;Insider &lt;/em&gt;says those talks fizzled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kV3isn"&gt;Now, Lime says that its most recent funding round was oversubscribed, with $418 million in debt financing led by Abu Dhabi Growth Fund, Fidelity Management &amp;amp; Research, Uber, and certain funds managed by Highbridge Capital Management. The company also received a $105 million senior secured term loan facility from a private equity group at UBS O’Connor. (These bank loans are typically made to companies that have below investment-grade credit ratings.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nsZbXx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Lime says that its most recent funding round was oversubscribed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VV805V"&gt;Lime is not releasing details about interest rates or anything else related to the terms of the deal, the spokesperson said. The company also declined to reveal whether it plans on going public by merging with a special acquisition company (SPAC) or a traditional initial public offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8cavD"&gt;The past two years have been a rollercoaster for Lime and the shared scooter industry as a whole. The company’s ridership dropped 95 percent as a result of the pandemic. While the world was locked down, Lime made a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21250420/lime-funding-uber-deal-alphabet-scooter-jump-bike"&gt;crucial investment deal with Uber&lt;/a&gt; and others for $170 million to take over the ride-hailing company’s bike and scooter business Jump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tHMmiX"&gt;In the fall of 2020, the company was feeling more optimistic, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538190/lime-scooter-ceo-interview-covid-future-200-million-rides"&gt;having hit the milestone of 200 million rides worldwide&lt;/a&gt;. Lime CEO Wayne Ting told a crowd of investors in November that for the first time the company was operating cash flow positive and free cash flow positive in the third quarter and was on pace to be full-year profitable, excluding certain costs, in 2021. (Being cash flow positive means Lime has more money going into the business at a given time than going out. But it’s not the same as having net income or being profitable after adjusting your earnings for interest and taxes, also known as EBIT.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uFCm9G"&gt;Then the Delta variant hit, which led to more lockdowns and delayed reopenings. Now, a spokesperson wouldn’t confirm whether Lime was still on pace for a full year of profitability, even though its last quarter was EBIDTA (earnings before interest, depreciation, taxes, and amortization) profitable. (Its Q3 2020 was also EBITDA profitable.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W0mIT9"&gt;Even though it has proven popular with riders, scooter sharing’s early years were marked by steep losses. Most companies relied on a hefty dose of venture capital to keep their operations afloat. The industry struggled to fix its unit economics, in which the purchase price for each scooter exceeded the amount of revenue it brought in before eventually breaking down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nid79M"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Lime wouldn’t confirm whether it was still on pace for a full year of profitability&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5C4Pm4"&gt;The original scooters deployed by companies like Bird and Lime — mostly sourced from Chinese companies like Xiaomi and Segway-Ninebot — weren’t built for shared use, so they were prone to breakdowns, often within weeks of being rolled out. But over the last several years, the scooter companies have taken pains to roll out better, more durable scooters in order to increase the average life span and improve their unit economics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wuWHYs"&gt;Going public would certainly help raise cash in the near term, but it also carries big risks. Lime’s main rival, Bird, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428864/bird-electric-scooter-spac-public-valuation"&gt;recently went public via a SPAC merger&lt;/a&gt; that valued the Santa Monica-based company at $2.3 billion. That deal just closed, and as soon as they were publicly listed, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/shareholders-approve-bird-spac-merger-stock-promptly-falls/"&gt;shares in the newly merged company fell sharply&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o004cy"&gt;But while Bird relies on its business model of sending fleets of scooters to small operators to handle deployment and charging, Lime will likely rely on its scale and global status to attract investor interest. The company claims to be the top scooter operator in the US and Europe. It hit 250 million rides over the summer (recall it was at 200 million a year ago) and recently rolled out the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575127/lime-next-gen-scooter-profit-quarter"&gt;fourth-generation version&lt;/a&gt; of its electric scooter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SGplhu"&gt;“This oversubscribed round is a testament to the strong business we’ve built and the overwhelming confidence we’ve received from the financial community,” said Ting in a statement. “This investment will allow us to double down on our newest generation of e-bikes and e-scooters, as well as additional modes, to ensure people have reliable access to affordable, shared, carbon-free transportation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ofn23J"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 5th, 11:38AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lime has had two EBITDA profitable quarters: Q3 2020 and Q3 2021. A previous version of this story misstated that. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dTjLTR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pfizer says its antiviral pill reduces hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4UmeQu_bI1-uS7dE2fwFVAvIoOA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70099857/acastro_200428_1777_coronavirus_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Rq77J7"&gt;Pfizer’s antiviral pill is highly effective at preventing people who catch COVID-19 from becoming seriously ill, the company said today &lt;a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizers-novel-covid-19-oral-antiviral-treatment-candidate"&gt;in a press release&lt;/a&gt;. A clinical trial showed that the pill, which has the brand name Paxlovid, cut the risk of hospitalization and death by 89 percent for adults at high risk of developing severe disease when it was given within three days of symptoms appearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HsFXH1"&gt;The company said it plans to submit its data to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for emergency use authorization “as soon as possible.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I5uJta"&gt;This is the second effective anti-COVID-19 pill. The first, developed by pharmaceutical company Merck, cut risk of hospitalization and death &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/01/business/covid-antiviral-pill-merck.html"&gt;by about half&lt;/a&gt;. The United Kingdom’s health agency authorized the Merck pill &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/04/health/uk-authorizes-merck-antiviral-molnupiravir-covid/index.html"&gt;on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;, and the FDA’s advisory committee is scheduled to discuss it &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-hold-advisory-committee-meeting-discuss-merck-and-ridgebacks-eua-application-covid-19-oral"&gt;on November 30th&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GAOK6i"&gt;Pfizer tested its drug in a study that included 1,219 adults who tested positive for COVID-19, had mild or moderate symptoms, and who had at least one underlying medical condition that would put them at risk for a severe case of the disease (like diabetes or a lung condition). Participants were randomly assigned to either take a course of placebo pills or the active drug. Three people in the active drug group were hospitalized and none died. In the placebo group, 27 people were hospitalized and seven died. The data was announced in a press release and has not been published in a scientific journal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hkqd3V"&gt;The Pfizer treatment works by stopping the coronavirus from making copies of itself inside cells. It includes 30 pills taken over five days. Merck’s, which works in a similar way, requires 40 pills taken over five days. Both are &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22704265/merck-covid-19-antiviral-pill-molnupiravir-treatment-drug"&gt;cheaper than&lt;/a&gt; treatments like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176631/coroniavirus-antibody-treatment-doses-unused-warp-speed"&gt;monoclonal antibodies&lt;/a&gt;, which also can keep people from becoming seriously ill. They’re also logistically easier to use — pills can be taken at home, while antibody treatments are given through an infusion at a health center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t1Zs75"&gt;The challenge with antiviral treatments like the Pfizer pill is ensuring that people are able to access them in the short window when they’re most effective. If people aren’t able to get a COVID-19 test result or make it to a doctor within the first few days after they start feeling sick, they likely won’t be able to get the same benefits from the drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nr1t2q"&gt;Medications taken after someone gets sick also aren’t a replacement for vaccines, which can prevent people from getting sick in the first place. But antiviral pills are an important tool to fight COVID-19. “I think getting an oral pill that can inhibit viral replication — that can inhibit this virus — is going to be a real game changer,” former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/04/health/uk-authorizes-merck-antiviral-molnupiravir-covid/index.html"&gt;told CNN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OiPOwV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A fake press release claiming Kroger accepts crypto reached the retailer’s own webpage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration a Bitcoin Cash logo seen..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GyVB1-soYz4vdW2pZ2eQTbhgHEA=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70099845/1234440443.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Thiago Prudencio/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vco3YT"&gt;Cryptocurrency and blockchain news presents many headlines that are hard to believe, so when a seemingly authentic press release ties a major retail outlet to second-tier crypto, it can take a moment to find out the truth. That was the case with a fake “Walmart takes Litecoin” release in September, and again this morning as PR Newswire &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kroger-to-accept-bitcoin-cash-this-holiday-season-301417472.html"&gt;published an illegitimate announcement&lt;/a&gt; claiming Kroger will start accepting Bitcoin Cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YA3gd4"&gt; Because Kroger’s webpage pulls in the releases from PR Newswire, the fake release actually appeared on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2FKroger.com&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F5%2F22765098%2Fkroger-bitcoin-cash-cryptocurrency-hoax-pump-dump" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kroger.com&lt;/a&gt; until it was removed. Kroger has been linked to cryptocurrency but does not accept it as payment. A partnership &lt;a href="https://blog.lolli.com/earn-bitcoin-back-at-kroger/"&gt;announced with Lolli late last year&lt;/a&gt; allowed users of that rewards program to earn small amounts of Bitcoin back on purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="97j63K"&gt;Kroger PR confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the Bitcoin Cash release is fake and quickly issued a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="WniJnZ"&gt;This morning a press release was fraudulently issued claiming to be The Kroger Co. that falsely stated the organization will begin to accept Bitcoin Cash. This communication was fraudulent and is unfounded and should be disregarded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The price of Bitcoin Cash spiked briefly due to the hoax" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o2PJx1qvniAnlSFT0Tigv_hKtWs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22988094/coinbase_bch_price.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The price of Bitcoin Cash spiked briefly due to the hoax.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zsAkyY"&gt;In less than 15 minutes, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coinbase.com%2Fprice%2Fbitcoin-cash&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F5%2F22765098%2Fkroger-bitcoin-cash-cryptocurrency-hoax-pump-dump" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Coinbase shows&lt;/a&gt; the price of Bitcoin Cash rose &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/05/bitcoin-cash-briefly-spikes-on-fraudulent-press-release/"&gt;nearly 5 percent&lt;/a&gt;, going from about $602 to $630, which was likely the point of the hoax. It returned to the previous level almost immediately, but whoever was behind the scheme may have netted a profit already. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YmlyDc"&gt;Bitcoin Cash &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/1/16075276/bitcoin-cash-hard-fork-coinbase"&gt;arose from a contentious chain split in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, as its proponents made a “hard fork” from Bitcoin, claiming that cryptocurrency hasn’t addressed high transfer fees and block size limitations. Coinbase halted trading for a time under accusations of insider trading, while in the years since the value of Bitcoin Cash has not kept up with the massive spikes seen from Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7OxW8A"&gt;If you need a powerful iPad with plenty of storage and a gorgeous display, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932FH25J?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWafjgPfUw" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; are selling the 512GB, Wi-Fi version of the latest 12.9-inch iPad Pro for its lowest price yet. Normally $1,399, the retailer is selling it for $1,249 instead. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In Dieter Bohn’s review&lt;/a&gt;, he deemed this the best and nicest iPad out there. Powered by Apple’s M1 processor, the 2021 iPad Pro is a speed demon and it comes with features like Thunderbolt connectivity, Wi-Fi 6 compatibility, Apple Pencil support, as well as Face ID unlocking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fd91ge"&gt;As we noted yesterday, if you’re looking for something cheaper and smaller, Apple’s 2021 11-inch iPad Pro (128GB, Wi-Fi) is also on sale, selling for $699 instead of $799 at at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfVKgWMaDgM?u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22527112%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com%2Fgood-deals%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B09328WZPR?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YtmtDj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10845841"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="K7Phiy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"},{"title":"The Verge’s Guide to Black Friday 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="SypmRr"&gt;Supply might sell out sooner than later, but at eBay the reputable seller BuyDig is offering a fabulous deal on LG’s 48-inch C1 OLED TV. Normally around $1,300 while on sale, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F324842746233%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26toolid%3D20008%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F5%2F22763370%2Fapple-ipad-pro-macbook-gopro-hero-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s just $1,100&lt;/a&gt; and comes with a four-year accidental extended warranty. Better yet, after you purchase, &lt;a href="https://slickdeals.net/f/15376480-48-lg-oled48c1pub-4k-smart-oled-tv-100-ebay-credit-4-year-accidental-warranty-w-burn-in-coverage-1099-free-s-h-at-ebay?src=frontpage" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slickdeals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;says that your account will be credited $100, so it’s like getting the TV for $1,000 flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="laDMPh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10833105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PmOWsR"&gt;You can also save hundreds on an Intel-powered Apple laptop, if you’d prefer one over an iPad today. And even though it doesn’t come with the M1 processor, it’s still a fast, powerful MacBook in its own right. Right now, Amazon is selling the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08821TJLG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;mid-2020 13-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; with 16GB RAM, a 1TB SSD, four Thunderbolt ports, and a 10th Gen Intel Core i5 processor for $1,500 instead of $1,999. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21256520/apple-13-inch-macbook-pro-2020-review-keyboard-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In our review&lt;/a&gt;, we praised this MacBook Pro’s keyboard and build quality, calling it a “competent, dependable laptop.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2O5aOt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10846203"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8VKBXx"&gt;For Android users who are eager to snag a folding phone, Amazon has a great deal on Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 3. Released just a few months ago in August, the Galaxy Z Fold 3 touts a more durable screen than its predecessors, with 120Hz refresh rate displays, support for the S Pen, and IPX8 water resistance. Its main drawback, usually, is that it can be very expensive, but today’s deal shaving $200 off makes it more affordable. Right now, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B097CMYTLD?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is the selling the 256GB foldable phone for $1,600&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,800. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09HGBG94S?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;For $80 extra&lt;/a&gt;, you can also add an S Pen case to your order. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TKYAPK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10820291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8lDfUD"&gt;Best Buy is taking $200 off of one of the best Chromebooks you can buy, the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfMWtFCPMfN" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;. Typically $529 for the previous-gen model with 4GB of RAM, 64GB of SSD storage, and an Intel 10th Gen Core i3 processor, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfMWtFCPMfN" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can get it now for $329&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In our review&lt;/a&gt;, we found this Chromebook outperforms many others when it comes to features, build quality, and performance. Although it lacks Intel’s 11th Gen processor and Thunderbolt 4 support, we found that it boasts slightly better battery life than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451261/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2021 model&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eEq0RM"&gt;However, if you’d prefer the latest version with an Intel Evo-certified 11th Gen Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, a 256GB SSD, and Thunderbolt 4 support, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfM3aomFXkf?u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22490339%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is selling that&lt;/a&gt; one for $529 instead of $699.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8hwmpR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10730313"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PKPznw"&gt;If you’re going on an adventurous vacation soon and want to take great photos and video clips, check out this GoPro Hero 9 deal. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437419/gopro-hero-9-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt; last year, we called the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09DJLW458/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2020 GoPro Hero 9&lt;/a&gt; the “biggest, baddest action camera out there.” The portable action camera is capable of capturing 5K video and 23.6-megapixel photos, and it can also be used to record in a variety of settings, including underwater. Right now, the GoPro Hero 9 is on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09DJLW458/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfVPVzIXaMN" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $350, the biggest price drop we’ve seen for this model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ElvxWm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10332746"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="seU8L7"&gt;Best Buy is taking $100 off of &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfVSQ4vPqZp" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG’s 32-inch UltraGear QHD Nano IPS display&lt;/a&gt;. Normally $500, you can buy the gaming monitor for $400 instead. This monitor features thin bezels and a 16:9 aspect ratio with a sharp 2560 x 1440 resolution. It’s fast, boasting a 165Hz refresh rate with a 1ms response time, and it’s also compatible with Nvidia’s G-Sync adaptive sync technologies. We might see slightly lower prices come Black Friday, but those who are in the market for a capable 32-inch gaming market should check this out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SEwZtz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10846505"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9u2IVi"&gt;PC or Xbox gamers can now now enjoy a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TGNFVWV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three-month Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription&lt;/a&gt; for $38 instead of $45 when they buy it off of Amazon. With the subscription, you can get access to exclusive deals, online multiplayer, EA Play titles, and Microsoft’s cloud gaming service, xCloud, for a multitude of devices. This deal is particularly good for existing subscribers as you can use it to add three months to your existing subscription. Eneba’s also selling a &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22514911%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/authors%5Bd%5DD&amp;amp;ued=https://www.eneba.com/us/xbox-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-3-month-membership-xbox-one-windows-10-xbox-live-key-global/best-pick" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three-month subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate&lt;/a&gt; for $29, but that price often fluctuates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IudFYC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9532770"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IycHjK"&gt;But wait! There’s more! Here are some other notable deals:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="vFXq8N"&gt;You can pick up &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G8WTNVR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s official iPhone 13 Pro MagSafe leather cases&lt;/a&gt; for $50 instead of $59. This deal only applies to the green and purple colors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="title"&gt;Amazon is selling &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Joy-Con-LR-Neon-PinkNeon-Green/dp/B078GZM4H8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nintendo’s Joy-Con controllers&lt;/a&gt; for $69 instead of their typical $80 when you buy the neon pink and neon green bundle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9qe09g"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HZJ64WD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first generation of Amazon’s Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; sandstone-colored smart display is selling for $45 instead of $60. You can get an additional 25 percent off when you trade in select devices as well. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18714432/amazon-echo-show-5-alexa-smart-alarm-display-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
