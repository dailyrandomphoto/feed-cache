    <title>Senators call on Facebook to shelve Novi cryptocurrency project</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qLWLJd"&gt;Senate Democrats called on Facebook to end its digital wallet and cryptocurrency project in a letter to chief executive Mark Zuckerberg Tuesday, saying that the company “cannot be trusted to manage cryptocurrency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UreiCB"&gt;The letter comes hours after Facebook launched Novi, a new digital wallet, as part of a “small” pilot program in the US and Guatemala. Facebook first announced its plans to enter the cryptocurrency industry over two years ago, but the digital currency project, called Libra, was halted after heavy criticism from lawmakers and regulators. The Libra currency was later rebranded as “Diem,” which has yet to be released alongside the new wallet product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ye2gMB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The letter comes hours after Facebook launched Novi&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q3MKUj"&gt;In their letter, Sens. Brian Schatz (D-HI), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and others wrote, “Facebook is once again pursuing digital currency plans on an aggressive timeline and has already launched a pilot for a payments infrastructure network, even though these plans are incompatible with the actual financial regulatory landscape — not only for Diem specifically, but also for stablecoins in general.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XELpfy"&gt;Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uthzU7"&gt;Without its own currency, Facebook’s Novi wallet will allow users to send and receive money using the Paxos stablecoin in a partnership with Coinbase. Coinbase serves as the custody partner, holding the actual funds involved with the pilot program. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davidmarcus/status/1450447443250728962?s=20"&gt;In a statement issued Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook’s David Marcus, head of F2 (Facebook Financial), said that the company still plans to launch Novi with Diem “once it receives regulatory approval and goes live.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sDEkVH"&gt;In 2019, the House and Senate hauled Zuckerberg in to provide testimony on the Libra project after weeks of back and forth with lawmakers who were largely skeptical of Facebook’s project. The hearing came only a year after Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/23/20929313/mark-zuckerberg-hearing-congress-libra-calibra-facebook-maxine-waters"&gt;lawmakers questioned the company’s credibility&lt;/a&gt; in light of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ofoyEF"&gt;In Tuesday’s letter, the senators invoked these same concerns. “Facebook cannot be trusted to manage a payment system or digital currency when its existing ability to manage risks and keep consumers safe has proven wholly insufficient,” they wrote. “We urge you to immediately discontinue your Novi pilot and to commit that you will not bring Diem to market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UckzVd"&gt;Earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710371/facebook-whistleblower-congress-hearing-instagram-kids-safety-privacy-blumenthal"&gt;Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen&lt;/a&gt; came before the Senate Commerce Committee to testify on the harms Facebook and its other products can inflict on users. Republicans and Democrats shared concerns over how platforms like Instagram could hurt teenagers, and Haugen’s testimony has already been met with legislative proposals to regulate the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="voDoaq"&gt;The Novi criticism from lawmakers also arrives as Facebook is bracing itself for more disclosures from Haugen, according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fbnewsroom/status/1450154004730707972?s=20"&gt;a Monday Facebook Newsroom tweet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sinclair TV stations experienced a massive outage during ransomware attack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration a Sinclair Broadcast Group (SBG)..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DC9WWSqjCGL69m7FFqRo5b3-y0U=/0x14:3848x2579/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70017024/1234599696.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hDAxHo"&gt;Sinclair, the broadcast group that runs some of the most popular local channels across the US, experienced a nationwide outage during a ransomware attack on October 16th (via &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/sinclair-tv-stations-disrupted-across-the-us-in-apparent-ransomware-attack/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Record&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Viewers initially were informed technical difficulties caused the disruption, but the &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912752/000119312521300540/d245680dex991.htm"&gt;US Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt; published a filing from Sinclair two days later, identifying ransomware as the source of the outage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u06cks"&gt;“Certain servers and workstations in its environment were encrypted with ransomware, and that certain office and operational networks were disrupted,” the report reads. “Data also was taken from the Company’s network. The Company is working to determine what information the data contained and will take other actions as appropriate based on its review.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tzF4Ic"&gt;A person close to the situation tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that as of yesterday, employees still had problems accessing email or signing into systems, but today, those things are restored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fLWMg5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The US Treasury identified over $590 million in suspected ransomware-related transactions between January and June&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cgvhnG"&gt;Sinclair’s report also notes the company still isn’t up and running at 100 percent. While it’s trying to resolve the issue, there may still be “disruption to parts of the Company’s business, including certain aspects of its provision of local advertisements by its local broadcast stations on behalf of its customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qJ2vof"&gt;Sinclair operates a massive number of local TV stations, causing the attack to prevent the company from broadcasting local news shows, sports games, and other scheduled content. According to &lt;em&gt;The Record&lt;/em&gt;, the attack could’ve been much worse, as the bad actors weren’t able to compromise something called the “master control.” Having access to this tool let Sinclair replace some scheduled shows with a national feed — that way, not &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of its channels were completely down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wsxaop"&gt;And as &lt;em&gt;The Record&lt;/em&gt; notes, the ransomware attack was preceded by a &lt;a href="https://www.ftvlive.com/sqsp-test/2021/7/7/sinclair-cyber-attack"&gt;call for a password reset across all of Sinclair&lt;/a&gt; following the discovery of a “potentially serious network security issue.” It’s unclear whether that security issue has anything to do with the attack that just transpired. There still isn’t an official count of how many stations were shut down, as well as who exactly was responsible for the attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tez70y"&gt;Ransomware attacks are becoming increasingly common; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428996/colonial-pipeline-ransomware-attack-apology-investigation"&gt;Colonial Pipeline&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616882/gigabyte-technologies-ransomware-attack-data-leak-112-gb-ransomexx"&gt;Gigabyte&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446388/cna-insurance-ransomware-attack-40-million-dollar-ransom"&gt;CNA Financial&lt;/a&gt; are just some of the high-profile companies targeted this year. According to a report by the US Treasury, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728765/us-treasury-ransomware-payout-numbers-reports-2021-first-half-cybercrime"&gt;ransomware payouts in 2021 are on track to beat the combined payouts from the entire past decade&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Wyze captures the banality of suburban life in its newest video doorbell ad (and it’s not pretty)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0m1MvHPvP9stEne2ErshzvSL0oI=/131x0:1115x656/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70016997/Screen_Shot_2021_10_19_at_2.07.45_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Screenshot&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CL3BLJ"&gt;The typical sell for a video doorbell is: “You need to see what’s going on at your front door from your phone so no one steals your Amazon packages.” Smart home company Wyze has gone a step further, warning its prospective users: “You need a video doorbell so your neighborhood kids don’t put flaming bags of poop on your doormat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ekgfov"&gt;In a frankly hilarious video promoting the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22734238/wyze-video-doorbell-pro-price-specs-shipping"&gt;new Wyze Video Doorbell Pro&lt;/a&gt;, the company invites you to purchase its newest doorbell so you can keep a watchful eye over the bonafide war zone that is the classic suburban neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gk0yzv"&gt;The video opens with a soothing James Earl Jones-style voiceover discussing the magnificence of the American “Front Porch” as a young boy runs joyfully along the path to his front door. But as we zoom in, the child is revealed to be a grubby little turd who is playing Ding Dong Ditch on a soon-to-be angry dad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QNABxg"&gt;We see him pushing the Wyze doorbell frantically and peering menacingly in through the fisheye lens on the homeowner’s Wyze app. As the man leaps up and chases the kid down his front path, he clips a delivery driver, who responds by kicking the package he was delivering onto the porch with all the finesse of an NFL kicker. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BD3tpOZuyA1FCwwzHVXq47ZBNFk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22939494/Screen_Shot_2021_10_19_at_2.07.45_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wyze&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wyze’s video promoting its new video doorbell reflects on the realities of why you might want one — such as neighborhood kids leaving flaming bags of dog poop on your porch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jGBVsv"&gt;All the while, the soothing narrator is telling us about the benefits of Wyze’s new doorbell — including package detection and pet detection — as, on cue, the family’s small terrier runs out to attack the mail carrier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eayyat"&gt;As the voiceover waxes lyrical on neighborly neighbors bringing by a basketful of freshly picked garden zucchinis, the husband is pelted with eggs by an entire gang of neighborhood kids. When his wife comes out to save him, one of those dastardly kids puts — what we can only assume by her face as she stamps it out — a bag full of flaming dog poop on the doormat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wQN6l5"&gt;It’s clearly a send-up of video doorbell company Ring’s &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Fe7SJ_LxZro"&gt;own marketing push&lt;/a&gt;, which is focused on how neighborly we all are and how we are all looking out for each other and our packages. In the end — sad as it is to say — Wyze is probably painting a slightly more realistic picture of the storied American neighborhood — and of why you might actually want a video doorbell.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat says the Pixel 6 is ‘the fastest phone to make a Snap’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Quick Tap to Snap feature" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SrbM_WCT6PU76J7irVQ25LxLsw0=/0x33:1318x912/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70016898/google_quick_tap_snap.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EwgD1Q"&gt;At today’s Pixel event, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22727944/google-pixel-6-pro-cameras-computational-photography-features"&gt;Google &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;dove&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22727944/google-pixel-6-pro-cameras-computational-photography-features"&gt; into the details about the Pixel 6 series devices&lt;/a&gt; and outlined a brand new feature that will make sending Snaps even faster. The new feature, called Quick Tap to Snap, adds a camera-only version of Snapchat directly to the lock screen of the Pixel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Vo7NeY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Us   &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Snapchat?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Snapchat&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pixel6?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Pixel6&lt;/a&gt; is the fastest phone to make a Snap thanks to Quick Tap to Snap!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And check out Pixel lenses and other exclusive features too!&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pixel6Launch?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Pixel6Launch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/94trIxzHzk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/94trIxzHzk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Made By Google (@madebygoogle) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/madebygoogle/status/1450516328763232261?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EWTrw3"&gt;To access it, all you have to do is tap the back of your phone twice, and the Snapchat camera will open. From there, you can snap a picture all without unlocking your device — you’ll only have to authenticate your identity when you go to send the Snap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Obcgex"&gt;In addition to Quick Tap to Snap, Google is also working on exclusive augmented reality Lenses, as well as incorporating live translation into Snapchat. This means that users will be able to have their conversations translated in real-time while using the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V1Y6qN"&gt;Google’s partnership with Snapchat doesn’t come as much of a surprise, considering that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/15/5106950/google-snapchat-4-billion-buyout-rumor"&gt;Google actually attempted to buy Snapchat in the past&lt;/a&gt;. Now that Snapchat is sort of built into the Pixel, Google might see that as a small victory. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The biggest announcements from Google’s Pixel 6 event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gdcUY04juykf3dUZuLQ_fPyEcas=/152x0:1768x1077/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70016892/lcimg_e5568f90_70f5_4d74_938b_5d1c34060e11.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="B3AjPT"&gt;Google just wrapped up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22733532/google-pixel-6-pro-event-live-blog"&gt;its Pixel 6 Fall Launch event&lt;/a&gt;, where it announced two new phones as well as a wealth of features that are supported by its new Tensor processor. Here are the biggest things Google announced during its live stream.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro lineup" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qYkC6nm2kiiK0khVjc2DFmxtpp8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22755114/Google_Pixel_6__Portfolio_Shot.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AEQ0zz"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;Google finally shows off the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="i7vkhn"&gt;After months of leaks, we got the full details on Google’s Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro phones — the Pixel 6 will sell for $599 and the Pixel 6 Pro for $899. Both will feature Google’s Tensor processor and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22727944/google-pixel-6-pro-cameras-computational-photography-features"&gt;a 50-megapixel camera&lt;/a&gt; (which bins images down to 12.5-megapixels during processing). The phones also feature an ultra-wide camera, and the Pro adds a telephoto camera and gives the selfie camera an upgrade with a wider lens and higher-resolution sensor. The Pro model is also physically larger, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;it’s not a massive difference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IaquUxERUcc8HTWAYqEYbuZ_yU8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22939252/Screen_Shot_2021_10_19_at_1.08.09_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="H0EQpd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22710844/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-ai-speed-specs-details"&gt;Google’s new phones are powered by its Tensor processor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NrRCfR"&gt;Much of Google’s event focused on the Google-designed Tensor processor that powers the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. Google showed off how the machine learning prowess of its chip would be able to help with tasks like voice recognition, making photos less blurry (and even automatically erasing unwanted people from the background), and real-time captions and translation. Outside of ML, Google says that it should be competitive with Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon processors when it comes to overall CPU and GPU performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WedQNW"&gt;Google also emphasized how the Tensor could help its phones be more personalized to you but didn’t go into much detail on how exactly that would work. Thankfully, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;we have our hands on the new phones&lt;/a&gt;, so we’ll be able to poke around at them. Speaking of those phones...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IjF24v"&gt;Google showed off the results of its camera inclusivity work with Real Tone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="RYFFmy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442515/google-camera-app-inclusive-image-equity-skintones"&gt;At Google I/O 2021&lt;/a&gt;, Google announced it was working on making its cameras and photo processing better for people with darker skin, and today, we got to see some of those results. Google’s Real Tone tech, which will work both in its camera app and third-party ones, will try to accurately depict people’s skin tones instead of doing weird things with exposure and contrast like old phones used to do. Google’s &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/WNarpiGz3Kk?t=2775"&gt;before-and-after presentation&lt;/a&gt; was impressive, but we’ll have to see how it actually performs in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="QwUH07"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22499034"&gt;Snapchat gets a special place on the Pixel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qtFb6N"&gt;You’ll be able to quickly access Snapchat’s camera by tapping the back of the Pixel, even from the lock screen. Of course, you’ll have to log into the phone to actually send the Snap to your friends, but it’s quite possibly the quickest way to send a Snap that we’ve seen yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="rzqJfm"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22498413"&gt;Google’s trying to make phone trees suck less&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="na3Wsr"&gt;Google announced a new Pixel phone feature, which aims to make calls to customer service lines less awful by trying to estimate how long you’ll have to wait on hold and giving you a written list of the phone tree options, so you don’t have to go “wait, what number do I press for this again?” Google’s also expanding its feature that lets you have your phone wait on hold for you to more countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="qxpSs0"&gt;Google didn’t announce it during the event itself, but it’s also launched Pixel Pass alongside the new phones. Pixel Pass lets you bundle a phone (and &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/store/answer/7528518?hl=en"&gt;Google’s Preferred Care repair plan&lt;/a&gt;), cloud storage, YouTube Premium, and Google Play Pass, all in one monthly payment. Google’s charging $45 per month for the plan with a Pixel 6 and $55 a month for the Pixel 6 Pro plan. According to the company, you’ll end up paying off your phone over the course of two years, and if you cancel Pixel Pass, you’ll have to pay off the remaining balance on your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RIfpRT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/introducing-pixel-pass/?_ga=2.47950050.454935072.1634662818-63996501.1634662818"&gt;Google says&lt;/a&gt; that subscribers to Google Fi, its cellular plan, will get $5 off their monthly bill for subscribing to Pixel Pass. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s how the Pixel 6 compares to the Pixel 6 Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h-JP5RqG0K2_Zvw2q3b_1-Pbu8Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70016830/bfarsace_211014_4802_0105.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Sote5c"&gt;There’s a lot that we already knew about the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; ahead of their debut at Google’s October 2021 event. Some of the key specs, including the Tensor processor and the camera details, were made publicly available by Google itself. But of course, we know a lot more now than we did before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3dv7Xm"&gt;Check out my colleague Dan Seifert’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;big hands-on with both phones right here&lt;/a&gt;. It dives into the design, features, and he talks about how this is a big moment both for Google to prove that its Tensor processor is as good as it claims to be and that it knows how to make flagship phones that people want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="j9ykUg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sundar Pichai and Rick Osterloh think the Pixel 6 is Google’s breakout phone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22733159/sundar-pichai-rick-osterloh-google-pixel-6-interview-podcast"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="oOL3J0"&gt;If all that you’re curious about is raw specs, we’ve got that below. Given that the design differences between the Pixel 6 Pro and Pixel 6 are minor, we’re focused instead on what’s inside of them. There are just a couple of differences internally, but you deserve to know what they are. To be exhaustive, we’ve also compared them to other Pixel phones that you can easily buy these days, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;Pixel 5A&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xmqcf3"&gt;We’ll add more specs to this table should they become available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8yT6YJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10815633"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Google Store serves would-be Pixel 6 buyers nothing but errors</title>

Some unsteadiness is to be expected given the sudden demand, but at 1PM ET, the doors opened and Google’s store seemed to fall flat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-VTM8N_HuEMKwCMJ5jQfb8z0u5k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22939534/google_store.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="feOHQ5"&gt;Since then things have improved, but more than an hour later, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisPirillo/status/1450522739442262018"&gt;most of us&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reneritchie/status/1450527567593758721"&gt;only seeing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1450507803504881666"&gt;one error code after another&lt;/a&gt;. If you can get through, you can select to use the new Pixel Pass or add on a 30W phone charger. The fast wireless charging &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22732918/google-pixel-stand-23w-wireless-charging"&gt;Pixel Stand&lt;/a&gt;, however, says it’s “coming soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HmY7tH"&gt;A quick scan of social media reveals that some people have been able to complete purchases for the new Pixel 6. For the rest of us, at least we’ve had time to learn patience while searching for a PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch OLED, RTX 3090, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22727969/xbox-series-x-mini-fridge-price-release-date"&gt;Xbox Series X refrigerator&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nikola allowed to proceed with $2 billion patent lawsuit against Tesla</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HE39GVbvHhJGE2HCgcIhmoa7qzY=/295x0:2455x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70016755/nikola_one_16.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nikola&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Adozuj"&gt;Hydrogen trucking startup Nikola is being allowed to continue its three-year-old $2 billion patent lawsuit against Tesla. A federal judge shelved the suit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/1/22704492/nikola-tesla-patent-infringement-lawsuit-closed-trevor-milton"&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; after the two companies stopped responding to the court’s orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KVZkHR"&gt;The case against Tesla will still remain “administratively closed” but won’t be dismissed, Judge James Donato said in a &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.335954/gov.uscourts.cand.335954.159.0.pdf"&gt;new order on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. He assigned Nikola two new January deadlines: one to walk the court through the technologies in question and one for a hearing about the scope of the patents Nikola claims were infringed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OmFJTX"&gt;Donato closed the case on October 1st after neither Nikola nor Tesla responded to orders in July and September to prep and schedule these meetings. He gave Nikola an October 6th deadline to argue why the case should be continued, which the startup met — though not totally convincingly, apparently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dcdBOt"&gt;“Nikola’s ostensible reasons for not responding to the Court’s orders are not particularly compelling,” the judge said in Tuesday’s order. “The case will not be dismissed at this time for failure to prosecute, but that may change if Nikola does not move this case forward to resolution in an efficient and timely manner.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XiaKvh"&gt;Nikola first filed the lawsuit in 2018. The startup alleges that Tesla’s own semi-truck infringes on a number of Nikola’s design patents. Nikola said in its original complaint that Tesla stealing its designs would rob the startup of $2 billion in market share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="plv4q7"&gt;Tesla has said since the start that there is “no merit” to the claims. The Silicon Valley automaker lost a bid with the US Patent and Trademark Office to invalidate some of the patents in question in April 2020, though, prompting Nikola founder and former CEO Trevor Milton to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21231758/nikola-sba-loan-pandemic-tesla-patent-lawsuit"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;: “Two billion dollar lawsuit moving forward. We will defend our company’s IP no matter who it is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4vwLF0"&gt;But Nikola has run into a lot of trouble in the time since it filed the lawsuit. After going public — and just as the startup was about to secure an investment from General Motors — Milton was accused of lying to investors. He eventually stepped down from running the company and, this year, was arrested and indicted on multiple counts of fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RDguDY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Smash Ultimate’s final update is a love story</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VXET5aG2UuQkoW7_f2LDfDVavBA=/1x0:2047x1364/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70016732/EqqrzukXYAEjTBz.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AJAOTr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt; is delighted to announce the long-awaited nuptials between Mr. Doom Slayer Ripandtearington III and Ms. Isabelle née Shizue. The wedding ceremony took place during &lt;em&gt;Smash Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;’s final content update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IkEUr5"&gt;Mr. Doom Slayer and Ms. Isabelle are a match made in &lt;a href="https://www.ssbwiki.com/Final_Destination_(SSBU)"&gt;Final Destination&lt;/a&gt;. The two met back in March 2020 when their respective games &lt;em&gt;Doom Eternal&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/2/24/21150803/animal-crossing-isabelle-doomguy-doom-eternal-new-horizons"&gt;launched on the same day&lt;/a&gt;. With the vast differences between their two lines of work, the pairing was regarded as little more than an accidental meeting of polar opposites. But what started as a joke quickly became serious &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/doomguy-and-isabelle"&gt;as memes of the two&lt;/a&gt; spread throughout the internet, sparking rumors that there was more to this unlikely couple — rumors the couple themselves were more than happy to contribute to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Nfwvb0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;happy new horizons &lt;a href="https://t.co/BwjwtJkpLh"&gt;pic.twitter.com/BwjwtJkpLh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— DOOM (@DOOM) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DOOM/status/1345076347882893316?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="K4nmyM"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;will Isabelle be there&lt;/p&gt;— DOOM (@DOOM) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DOOM/status/1229892342452191238?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 18, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LgihGB"&gt;Since then, the two have been engaged in a whirlwind romance, unfortunately, made long distance due to the COVID-19 pandemic and whisperings that a match with a man who makes his living &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/19/21186572/doom-eternal-review-xbox-ps4-pc-stadia-date-battlegrounds"&gt;slaughtering the malcontents of hell&lt;/a&gt; would damage Isabelle’s political career. Today, the lovely couple final smashes those rumors with their union in &lt;em&gt;Smash&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IircSn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;together at last &lt;a href="https://t.co/aa1ZOX5PUa"&gt;pic.twitter.com/aa1ZOX5PUa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— DOOM (@DOOM) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DOOM/status/1450494190945714178?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cLhK3h"&gt;The joyous event also heralds the release of Challenger Pack 11 that features several Mii fighter costume additions, as well as the arrival of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22690440/sora-kingdom-hearts-final-smash-ultimate-character-nintendo-switch"&gt;final DLC fighter, Sora of &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts&lt;/em&gt; fame&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;‘We acknowledge we’re a challenger’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="xcZLfv"&gt;When did Google decide it would need to make its own custom processor for phones? “I think I started April 16th and it was around the 17th, in 2016,” says Rick Osterloh, Google’s head of hardware. He says he sat down with Google CEO Sundar Pichai and the two agreed that custom silicon was in their future, but its exact form wasn’t yet clear. This year, as Google prepared to launch the latest Pixel that uses Google’s custom silicon, the Tensor SoC, I sat down with Osterloh and Pichai to talk about the phone, the chip, and the Android ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9XPbBV"&gt;Osterloh is &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/4/28/11586518/google-hardware-division-rick-osterloh"&gt;five years in&lt;/a&gt; to his tenure as the head of Google’s hardware division. In those years, Google has acquired both HTC and Fitbit, pushed the idea of computational photography to new heights, and almost completely failed to pick up meaningful smartphone market share. Although the Pixel has been influential, the top-tier Pixels haven’t sold in big numbers — and the less expensive versions have fared only a little better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4pceM6"&gt;“Part of the reason that I think the team has been more modest in their approach with Pixel over the past 18 months or so is because they’ve been waiting for Tensor,” Pichai says. Google has gone all out this year with a marketing blitz that began well ahead of today’s launch and continues with an NBA deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rr2rrA"&gt;So now, with the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro, Osterloh hopes that the culmination of that chip decision paired with what his team has called Google’s “first real flagship” will make this year’s Pixel something different from all the phones that came before: something that will sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="albpbE"&gt;To get there, Google will need more than just a marketing blitz — it will need to have made a great phone. Answering that question will have to wait for our review, but there’s no question that Google’s &lt;em&gt;ambition&lt;/em&gt; is to make a phone that can stand toe-to-toe with the best from Apple and Samsung. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bNqGeH"&gt;For this week’s &lt;em&gt;Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;, Pichai, Osterloh, and I got into all that as well as some of the antitrust issues facing Android. Listen in to hear, and stick around after the interview for some first-hand impressions of the phone from myself and Nilay Patel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="ut7whS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ZEEgf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GDxWDH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sundar Pichai, Rick Osterloh, thanks for coming on &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. I have asked both of you a version of this question at least a half a dozen times. Because the Pixel 6 is now announced and out, and you have your own chip, I’m going to ask it one more time. I’ll start with you, Sundar; why is it important that Google is in the hardware business?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1g8sth"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sundar Pichai:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s a good question. I have answered it before, but I think it’s worth saying. If you’re committed to driving computing forward, I do think you need to think at the intersection of software services [and] hardware, to evolve it. I think we have a unique expression of it. We have always invested in certain deep technology to build helpful experiences with AI, we see a chance to express it in a unique way. So I think we will bring newer insights, newer experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WLFcIl"&gt;Second, it helps us drive the ecosystem forward. In my experience, every time we have done something well in a category, that category as a whole benefits in Android. Be it the Nexus phone or Nexus 7 as a tablet, and so on. And third, to do this well, you have to build a sustainable business. We are committed to it, we are building a business we want to grow and do well, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QkFYqY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I imagine that third answer is where I’m going to turn to you, Rick. How is that going?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="03mM3R"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rick Osterloh:&lt;/strong&gt; We’re still very early in this. I think the [hardware] organization was started about five years ago. And especially in such a mature market, that matters so much to users, it takes a long time to build the right capabilities to be leading. And we feel like finally, at this moment, we’ve gotten to the place where we feel really good about the innovation we’ve been able to build, the organization and capabilities we have in that towards building great phones. We think Pixel 6 is a big step change, and a nod to where we’re going in the future, which is really focused around AI innovation, really focused around building a portfolio that tries to address big parts of the market. We want to give our users the best of Google. So, that’s what we’re trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VcH4Vy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me why you think the Pixel 6 is categorically different than other smartphones that are currently on the market. Or do you think that’s true?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ewlBqm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RO:&lt;/strong&gt; I think there are significant differences. The number one thing is that it really is a clear representation of Google’s brand. What we’re trying to deliver is the very best possible Google experience. We do that by bringing all of our services that many people use, pulling them together in a cohesive user experience on Android 12 and beautiful new material UI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="35ZHlx"&gt;We also have been bringing a lot of our AI innovation. We’ve been working in tight coupling with our AI research teams. We’ve been building silicon together, and we put all that together in Pixel 6 so we can build the best possible experience. You see that in the work around speech. There are really exciting new improvements in that arena, we’ve always been strong in computational photography but we’re taking that a lot further with Pixel 6 and Tensor, and we’ve got a big jump in our video capabilities too. We’re just really excited about this being a moment where we pull it all together in its best possible form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e7A0AK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think it’s fair to say you’re intending to go toe to toe with the best that Apple or Samsung have to offer in terms of their flagships?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eIyYps"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RO:&lt;/strong&gt; That is our intention, yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dOsG8b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you intending to take market share from either of those companies?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hLpi6T"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RO:&lt;/strong&gt; Certainly we want to grow. First of all, we acknowledge we’re a challenger. The market has been pretty ossified, there have been a couple of key leaders for a long time. We think we’re taking a different approach with AI-led innovation, and we think our time is now to be able to grow, and that we’ve taken a big step change in so many parts of the overall experience that it’s a good time for us to be investing a lot in distribution, in marketing, and of course, in the product and technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hxb11B"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m bringing up the ecosystem because it’s Rick’s job to sell a bunch of phones. Sundar, it’s part of your job to make sure that the Android ecosystem is growing and secure and that all your partners are happy with it. When you’re sitting down with Samsung to talk about Android, are you talking about the Pixel line? How do those conversations go?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LOOGw3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SP:&lt;/strong&gt; They are our most important partner on Android. I think Samsung is a big partner for our devices and services team as well. There are many components [in this phone] from Samsung to make all of this work as well, so they’re a big partner there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y176tY"&gt;From an Android standpoint, we are very focused for example, on the work we are doing with Samsung on foldables, working hard to make that leap and make it successful; the partnership more recently on the watch, which we have done together with them. So I see Android as one of the more customizable and flexible OSes out there. It gives Samsung and other OEMs the chance to really innovate. And we have Google also doing that. I think some part of it will grow the pie overall. And I think it’s good as a consumer. It’s good we want to put out something unique in the market, and it’s more choice. So I think it’s healthy that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RbeIXf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m actually wondering what both of you think about the market specifically with Android. You called it ossified. You are coming in as a challenger. You say you want to grow the pie, but I can’t imagine there’s a lot of new smartphone customers to get. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6VBrz8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m wondering, going forward, what you think you need to do to be successful. You mentioned marketing, I’m wondering what else you might need to focus on to shake up the market like you seem to want to?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RAsjCu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RO:&lt;/strong&gt; I think first off is innovation. Our main focus as a company, and especially in our phone products with Pixel, is to try to offer as much help as we can to users across a lot of different arenas. People are very familiar with what Google does with search and Gmail and so many other categories. But we also think we can help people even further with AI as applied to photography, or videos, or speech, or natural language processing, or translation, and on and on. And we can put that together in the best way on Pixel. We also feel like there’s an opportunity to give people great value with a combination of these things. Our Pixel A-series has done a really good job with that to date, I believe, and we intend to continue forward with that. So there are both innovation and value-for-money opportunities in the market, and we hope to offer that for users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="DJSbFr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9222414"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XIYv5q"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sundar, any thoughts on what you think the Android market needs these days?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvomev"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SP:&lt;/strong&gt; I take a slightly longer-term view, and if you look at computing as a whole, there are phones, you have seen hints of people doing stuff beyond their phones as well. There are watches, we’ve done Google TV with Chromecast, Google Home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DudAsk"&gt;To me, this is as much about building a deep capability to innovate in computing for the very long run. Taking that 10, 20-year view. The day-to-day of the current position in high-end phones, I think that’s one snapshot in time, but if I zoom out, that’s what I meant by growing the pie and taking that long-term view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WCuB2U"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RO:&lt;/strong&gt; And if I could add one thing, it would be that we believe that we have a unique portfolio and that it covers a lot of the activity in the home. We recently acquired Fitbit, so we have a nice, robust capability on wearables now that we intend to grow and knit together. Then, of course, the phone is the most important part of people’s computing day-to-day usage. So we believe this unique set of things is the right portfolio to best express where Google can go in the future. We’ve been calling our computing vision for the future ambient computing, and that’s the way we think about it. We want to have people be able to use these devices wherever they are, whatever situation they’re in, whenever they need it, [and] be able to naturally interface with them. Google Assistant is a common interface across all these services. And we think it’s the leading assistant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1u08OA"&gt;This combination is the right set of technologies for the future of where we feel computing needs to go for users. That is going to be our unique element in this, is the strength in the home, in mobile, and wearables. And we’re excited to start on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mb1qCJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SP:&lt;/strong&gt; And hopefully [we] do it in an open way. Hopefully all this computing doesn’t mean you have to be locked into one brand or one OEM. I think some of what Android brings is the ability to have many people plug in and participate. So I’m excited about that as well. And us doing all this also really pushes us hard to make sure different phones can work with different watches, etc., in a way that it doesn’t add complexity for the user and things can be seamless. I think that’s important as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZIXZ9y"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I definitely want to talk about Tensor, but you mentioned Fitbit. How’s that going? I know they’re still releasing new products that are on the Fitbit platform. I’m waiting to see if they’re going to be doing hardware on your watch platform. The software story seems a little bit confusing. There’s some Fitbit stuff, but Google Health is still sitting around. So what’s going on with this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Na8maq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RO:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, they joined our company six or seven months ago now. So it’s pretty early in the integration. James [Park, Fitbit CEO] and team are part of my organization and we’re working really closely together. We’ve consolidated a lot of our health work into the Fitbit organization so that we can really have a focused consumer health approach for wearables and mobile. We announced at Google I/O that we’ll be working on Wear OS in our Fitbit team. So we’re really excited about where that’ll go. No doubt you’ll see them build wearables on Wear OS in the future. So we’re hard at work at that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="21ZQvU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I asked too soon. We’ll check in on it next year, maybe.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hpUcWk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RO:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. Next year. Let’s talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KNnfq7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s talk about Tensor. When did this project start? When did you decide, we’re making our own system on a chip?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lf9rU7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RO:&lt;/strong&gt; I think I started April 16th and it was around the 17th, in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aSPhlq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So literally the day you started at Google, you walked in Sundar’s office...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVokHI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RO:&lt;/strong&gt; When Sundar and I were talking about starting this organization five years ago, this came up. We felt like it was inevitable that we need to start to invest here. Exactly the form wasn’t clear. But Moore’s Law and general computing laws started to break down around that time and a little bit earlier. So it’s pretty clear, if you wanted to be on the cutting edge of AI innovation, it would have to involve real complete system design. About a year in, 2017, we decided we actually really needed to build an SoC, because you couldn’t just build a single co-processor in order to really harness the full capabilities we needed across a diverse set of AI models and approaches. We discussed this a long time ago. I remember talking to Sundar, letting him know this was going to be a pretty big investment and take a long time. And we didn’t have an organization at that point to build it. So it’s been a long journey. But we’re really excited we’re here. I mean, this is why I came back to Google. Why we wanted to work together on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nLrRTv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SP:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve always felt like you have to do deeper work. If you look at our services we’ve built on the consumer side, our data centers, we’ve never shied away from the fastest switches you needed for our networking side, subsea cables. So we have all these TPUs (Tensor processing units). On our data center side, we buy a lot and deeply use Nvidia GPUs and so on. But we have also tried to push the boundary with TPUs custom-built for our AI services. I think it’s important, recognizing that to do well here, particularly if you want to do it well from a AI standpoint, we need to evolve silicon with that focus. I think we had good DNA in thinking on the server side too, here. I think it’s a natural part and I appreciate the long-term focus. I clearly remember our conversation. It’s good to see it all come together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ABtUa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cast yourself back to this conversation. Was it obvious that you wanted to do what you’ve ended up doing or was it a little bit fuzzier? Did you say, “We’re going to need to do some AI chip, we’ll figure it out?” Or were you thinking, “Apple’s got their own chips, we’ve got to have our own chips.” What was that conversation decision process like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IlbRx5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RO:&lt;/strong&gt; It wasn’t 100 percent clear what form our system design work would take in the very early days. It was only after really thinking through what the direction of travel in our various AI research teams was that we realized that we really needed to build the whole thing, simply because of how data moves in and out of our models and how, when we’re doing computational photography, we’re using not just an accelerator, but all parts of the chip to achieve what we need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZfQvI9"&gt;There were other elements too, like being able to have a very low power set of the system that could do things when the device was otherwise at sleep. So this combination made us realize we actually really need to build a full applications processor that includes a lot of different heterogeneous sub-components. That was evolutionary thinking. That took a while to fully come to that realization. And we had lots of discussions about it along the way. But it wasn’t one flash of one inspirational moment where that came to us. It was an evolution of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sjwik2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s the old history. I need to ask about more recent history. This morning as we were talking, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Snapdragon/status/1448317606365179906"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualcomm decided to say that, “If a company’s making their own SoC that’s a red flag,” on Twitter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. Wondering if y’all have anything you’d like to reply to Qualcomm with.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3ovrV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RO:&lt;/strong&gt; Qualcomm has always been great partners of ours. We’re doing this so that we can work closely with our AI team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SDCn7r"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SP: &lt;/strong&gt;Qualcomm plays a really important role in the Android ecosystem and will continue to [do] so. That’s why I gave the server side example as well. We have done Tensor processing units on the server side, but we deeply use Nvidia GPUs across everything we do too. I think the market has done well overall. I think pushing the high end of silicon across all of us is good. But we are doing this for Pixel, and Qualcomm and others will play an important role in supplying the Android ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ROykdX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is a problem across all of Google communicating with customers. It’s a specific problem now with Tensor on the Pixel, of explaining the value of your AI systems, of getting people to understand what they can do, why it’s helpful, and have it be more than just, “it does this specific feature where you can erase something in the background.” I feel like a lot of the time when we talk about AI, it ends up just ending on jazz hands. And it’s supposed to be better. So I’m wondering how you’re thinking about communicating the capabilities that you’ve built for this phone to customers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c667JF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RO:&lt;/strong&gt; I think it’s really difficult to reduce AI to a benchmark or any sort of simplified measure. The way we intend to try to communicate the value to users is through specific experiences that they’re likely to really get excited about. It does make things possible that weren’t possible before. For instance, on Tensor and Pixel 6, the speech recognizer is out of this world. We took a lot of engineering efforts to move our data center quality models, make them run on-device using the TPU. It wasn’t possible before Tensor. And what you get out of it is something that can recognize words at 200 words a minute. I mean, it can go faster than I can think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lLbaJq"&gt;And I think it’ll totally change how I use the phone, and I think people will see the same thing. It works across the whole device. That’s an example of how AI will affect everyone’s day-to-day usage of devices. We’ve been doing it for years in other areas, like with screening calls that might be unwanted or in computational photography areas. And we get to apply that more and more to harder problems. So we’ll show users these specific problems that we solve with it and hopefully they’ll find it helpful. Hopefully, they’ll see the benefits of AI overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vgjiUm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you’re thinking about what features to launch next, how much are you thinking about potential backlash? I think that with &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/26/18112807/google-duplex-robot-calls-restaurants-businesses-transparency"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duplex in particular, there was a very strong reaction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; and it took a while for you all to figure out the best way to talk about it and how to get that out into the world. When you’re thinking about new features for the phone or even for Google search or something, how are you thinking about the rollout?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LdOv8A"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SP:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, it’s a good question. We now have the experience of many features across our products people use and rely [on]. And they actually walked with their feet. Think about smart compose in Gmail. That’s a new thing to get used to. You have, effectively, AI suggesting phrases to you and stuff. Really, it resonates with users, right? People understand it. I would give a lot of credit to the people using our products. They understand, they are adapting, and they let us know if we get something wrong. I’ve seen [this] across search, across maps. When we do these features well, I think the bar doesn’t change. If it’s an AI feature or not, the bar is still the same; doing something which users find magical and useful. And if so, I think they will adopt it well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x8HsdY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RO:&lt;/strong&gt; A wonderful attribute of Tensor is it enables us to do a lot of these capabilities closer and closer to the user. It keeps them in control. We took great pains to move our data center quality speech model to the phone. It’s running locally on-device. The information stays on the device. A lot of our computational capabilities are done there with our photography experience. And this is a direction of travel for us. We want to strike a great balance between making sure that we’ve got great capability for users and also making sure they’re comfortable with how data is being handled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ouy8cQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How are you balancing adding capabilities to the Pixel specifically? Maybe you’ve got a Pixel feature and then it goes into Android a year later or something? I could imagine a bunch of Android manufacturers would love to have your speech model on their phones. How are you thinking about the stuff that you do? Does it get put into the rest of Android in some way?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SVkc8T"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RO:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s a balance that we work on with our platforms and ecosystems team and Hiroshi [Lockheimer]’s organization. But a lot of times Pixel is basically the vanguard of our innovation across the company. We can get it to market through that quickly. And then a lot of it does flow into our ecosystem. Some of it is harder for that to happen, in that a lot of the Pixel 6 innovation, for instance, is driven by new hardware capabilities that haven’t been possible so far. So those might take a while, if ever, to move over to the ecosystem. But in general, we want a lot of this capability available to people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XixFLE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SP: &lt;/strong&gt;Be it Google Assistant or Gboard, the Google keyboard, etc. There are many ways to do it. Over time also, and this is not directly answering your question, but I would say we are taking our speech APIs, computer vision APIs through GCP [Google Cloud Platform], through cloud, and providing to companies as well. So we’re giving it through APIs as well. But it’s a good question. I do think OEMs are interested in accomplishing an experience. I think we work hard to make it possible. So I’ve never seen that be the gating factor. If people have really wanted to make the camera better on their phones and they engage with us, I would say our teams work super hard to make their cameras better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J3Vl7y"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Since we’re talking about Google services on Android, I do need to ask, South Korea recently ruled you need to allow third-party payment systems in Google Play. It seems like you’re going to go along with that.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J9YdOs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SP:&lt;/strong&gt; Obviously I think our Google Play team is assessing it and understanding it. I think they are in dialogue with it and we’ll find the right way to comply and make sure we support the ecosystem well. It’s an important ecosystem for us. I do think it’s important to understand Android is different from others. We invest thousands of engineers, build the operating system, which we provide for free. We don’t take a share of the device sales, not a share of the carrier revenues. So in some way we have to sustain our ecosystem. We have a different model. Google Play is an important way. In fact, it’s the main source of revenue. It supports Android as a whole. I think we’ll make that viewpoint clear, but we’ll engage in conversations. I’ll leave it to the team to figure out the right next steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bc7bxC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Similarly, there is also a ruling that your contracts have often not allowed manufacturers to make forks of Android if they want Google services on their Android phones. Do you know what your reaction to that ruling is going to be?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Hfkwk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SP: &lt;/strong&gt;I literally spent so many years in computing. I’ve never seen anything as open as Android. I buy a Peloton, and I discover it’s built on Android. No one from Peloton, I’m sure, ever talked, I don’t know whether they talk[ed] to people at Google. Amazon ships on Android. Obviously, one of the areas where Android gets criticized is at an end user level; the fragmentation as a cost, right? Developers complain of complexity. So, we are constantly striving to create that balance. And as part of that, sometimes there may be feedback from regulators, and I’ve taken the approach that we will understand it. I haven’t seen this as a major issue, but to the extent it is, I think we will address it, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TpUyAI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I guess I don’t know what addressing it means.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xrDgkU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SP: &lt;/strong&gt;It depends on what the specific thing is. I’m just basically pointing out many different ways people work on Android and ship Android. And in fact, there are like, literally, I think if you [count] tablet, all the form factors, all the versions, there are forked versions of Android we ship all the time. So, I do think we are trying to make sure at the end of the day we feel responsible for delivering a user experience on top. There are going to be areas where we are going to have viewpoints. I understand there’s a balance, and we’ll have to figure that out on a case-by-case basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Pi3aG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To end, let’s talk about one more fun thing. Spending a ton of money, which you all have been doing on Pixel marketing. I have seen billboards. There are TV ads. The thing hasn’t even officially launched yet. You’ve got ads before we know the price. This is a blitz. Is it going to get bigger to try and sell this phone?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0iDq19"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RO:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, we’re excited about the product and we want to make sure people know about it. We started our marketing early this year, which is a bit unusual. And the reason we did that was it’s a really big change. So we started that effort a couple of months ago and have been building it. You’ll continue to see it build throughout the year. We’re doing a terrific partnership we’re going to announce with the NBA, so we’re very excited about that. That’s just one of many things we’re doing, but you’ll see Pixel is the official phone of the NBA. And we’re very excited about that because I’m a huge basketball fan, so this is a fun topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t58FUC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sundar, did you know this NBA deal happened? I saw you do a double-take.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ymip2H"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SP: &lt;/strong&gt;No, I realized the real thing that drives Rick to work hard on Pixel is so that he gets some courtside seats somewhere for NBA games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qvNjV5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about carrier deals? Even with the iPhone, I think that a bunch of the recent success has been coming from getting huge discounts on trade-ins and huge discounts on — they’re not called subsidies anymore, but they might as well be, especially here in the US, where I think you’re really targeting — phone sales are driven by carrier, deals and subsidies. How is your thinking around that going?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5e5kN4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RO:&lt;/strong&gt; We’re going to be working very closely with carriers. You should expect to see Pixel on all major carriers going forward. In the past, we’ve had distribution with them, but not always the whole portfolio and not across all of them. That’s going to change going forward, and we’ve been talking to all the carriers in the US, and we expect to see that for Pixel 6 going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aqj2P2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think you’re going to be able to make enough of them to meet demand?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vDBT9k"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RO:&lt;/strong&gt; I hope so. I mean, we’re making a lot more than we have in the past. There is a minor supply chain issue happening in the world. We feel good about where we are right now for this year’s supply. And hopefully that will continue throughout next year, but we’ll see. I mean, we’re small right now, so it’s hard to know if you’ve gotten enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9v9NEB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SP:&lt;/strong&gt; There are many areas which we are a small player trying to do better. So we face the same challenges. We are competing against others who have economies of scale, better supply power and so on. And so I think the team has to work extra hard, be it on the go-to-market side, getting carrier deals and making sure people can see the product, or on the other side, making sure we can get supply. And I think those are all the challenges which make it even more exciting, but uncomfortably exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LfxREt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s a cognitive dissonance when it comes to thinking about Google as a small player. You’re Google, but you’re a very small player in the actual phone market. I think it was four years ago, I asked you when you think the business will be big enough to start breaking it out in your financial results. And you told me five years, so you got a year left. Do you think you’re going to get there?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MCu8ZZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SP:&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t want to make any forward statements from a financial standpoint, but broadly, I want to be clear. We want to build a sustainable business and there are other areas where we are a challenger, right? I think when we try to compete for enterprise contracts, we go up against big Microsoft bundle contracts all the time, trying to convince CIOs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CCqR5H"&gt;I think there are several aspects of business which have that characteristic and just like we have done with cloud or YouTube, I think to do well in technology, you have to build a sustainable business and they go hand-in-hand, otherwise you can’t. For someone like us, who believes in deep R&amp;amp;D investment, it is even more important to do it well. We are committed, and I take a very long-term view and you’re right, it’s year four or five, but I thought of this in a 10- to 20-year timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mFCqRn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Was the plan to have this be the hockey stick moment for Pixel? It seems like you’ve been building up to this, and this is the moment when instead of having a little bit of success, you really want this phone to be the thing that launches it as a real competitor with Samsung and Apple?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0zkPp9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RO:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s definitely a step change moment for us. We see this as truly the starting line for Pixel, in that we’ve brought together all the elements that we think we need to be a real player in this space. But consumer electronics in general doesn’t usually [grow] like hockey sticks like you would in a web services business. It’s a steady build. And that’s how we’re approaching the next several years, a real steady build. And we’re excited about where it’s headed because what we’re building with Tensor, and with Pixel 6, is how we see the future as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qbvdGu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SP: &lt;/strong&gt;Tensor was a big part of it, so I think a common question I would ask Rick is about Tensor timelines and not where the status of the project is. Part of the reason that I think the team has been more modest in their approach with Pixel over the past 18 months or so is because they’ve been waiting for Tensor to time our investments this way.&lt;/p&gt;
