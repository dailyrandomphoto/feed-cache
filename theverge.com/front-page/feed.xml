    <title>Twitter will comply with India’s new rules to keep its legal immunity</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ADWtNc"&gt;Twitter has outlined how it intends to “fully comply” with India’s new social media rules after the government said its lack of compliance meant it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564768/twitter-india-legal-liability-users-posts-defamation-digital-media-ethics-code"&gt;could be held legally liable&lt;/a&gt; for its user’s posts, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-08/twitter-pledges-to-fully-comply-with-india-internet-rules?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. In response to the government’s filing, a lawyer for the company said it has already appointed an interim chief compliance officer and that it would soon have a grievance officer and an employee to respond to law enforcement requests, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/twitter-appoints-india-interim-compliance-exec-fill-other-jobs-soon-2021-07-08/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter is required to fill each of the roles under new regulations introduced this year. The company also said it would be setting up an India liaison office in the next eight weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MRsXVw"&gt;Had Twitter not pledged to comply with the rules, it faced being made legally liable for users’ posts on its platform, potentially allowing its executives to face criminal charges over user-generated content. Social media platforms often take down content in response to legal challenges, but they’re generally not considered liable for it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bmI845"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The government could still take action if it doesn’t comply&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0SRv3l"&gt;If Twitter does not comply with the rules, the judge said India’s government will be able to take action against the company, &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;reports. The company was given a deadline of two weeks to make the appointments. Other tech companies, including Facebook and Google, have reportedly already started appointing employees to the relevant positions in response to the regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uiWKbX"&gt;The legal action marked an escalation of the tensions between Twitter and the Indian government. In May, police &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451271/police-india-raid-twitter-tweets-government-manipulated-media"&gt;raided Twitter’s India offices&lt;/a&gt; after the platform labeled a government official’s tweets as “manipulated media,” and more recently, a government minister warned the company of “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/5/22520330/india-warns-twitter-rules-social-media"&gt;unintended consequences&lt;/a&gt;” if it does not comply with the new rules. As the world’s largest market outside of China, India is not one that Twitter can afford to be excluded from, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w60Fwx"&gt;While the company said it will comply with the rules, it said it reserves the right to challenge their legality and validity, &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWbeYN"&gt;Twitter is not the only large tech firm to clash with the Indian government over its new regulations. In May, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454381/whatsapp-indian-government-traceability-lawsuit-break-encryption-privacy"&gt;WhatsApp sued the government&lt;/a&gt; over a requirement that it trace the origins of messages sent on its platform. The firm argued that this is unconstitutional, would force it to undermine its users’ privacy, and risks breaking the end-to-end encryption offered by its service. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best laptop you can buy in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Dell XPS 13, Dell XPS 15, HP Elite Dragonfly, Surface Laptop 3, MacBook Pro, and Lenovo Yoga C740." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C554ZjlwY7R1hgqzx9H7bhxKvWA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66770456/VRG_4013_Best_Laptop_Grid.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best laptops for you, from ultraportables to high-powered editing machines&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="gnIMOm"&gt;The best laptop of 2021 can come with a variety of brands, prices, and features. Here, we’ve got the rest of the best laptops, Windows 10 business notebooks, gaming rigs, Chromebooks, laptops for school, and 2-in-1 convertibles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lfv5g0"&gt;Our current pick for the best laptop of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a device that does just about everything right. While it’s certainly not a perfect device, there are no major flaws. It’s a great pick for productivity, browsing, and even light gaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNThzL"&gt;We live in a world where smartphones are ubiquitous, tablets are commonplace, and even smartwatches are a thing that people talk about on the regular. But throughout all of these advances, the humble laptop has persevered — and for good reason. When it comes time to work, whether that's editing photos, writing a lot of emails, composing documents, or staying in touch with colleagues and family, we’re here with our top picks to help you find the best laptop for the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="31HnuI"&gt;It's getting harder to buy a bad laptop, but what separates the best laptop of 2021 from good laptops is how they balance power, efficiency, portability, and comfort. The top laptop should have a fantastic keyboard and trackpad — after all, those are the two biggest reasons you'd choose a laptop over a smartphone or tablet. Its display should be easy on the eyes, bright, and sharp enough that you aren't distracted by jagged edges and visible pixels. It should be powerful enough for most anything short of intensive video editing and advanced gaming. It should be easy to carry around from place to place, and it should be able to last all day without needing to be plugged in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hnoYs"&gt;In our view, the best laptop for budget shoppers is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 13&lt;/a&gt;. For a sub-$1,000 price, it delivers performance on par with much more expensive laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ABV8A"&gt;Our other picks for the best laptops, Chromebooks, and 2-in-1s of 2021 include the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14, the MacBook Pro 16, and the HP Elite Dragonfly. Check out the full list of best laptop picks below or our roundup of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"&gt;best gaming laptops&lt;/a&gt;, if you’re looking for a powerful machine that doesn’t sacrifice portability.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple MacBook Air is the best laptop of 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oTToOm"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air (late 2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best laptop of 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="qIDMjX"&gt;The late-2020 MacBook Air, powered by Apple’s M1 processor, is the best laptop you can buy. The base model, which includes 8GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage, starts at $999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYCzY0"&gt;Appearance-wise, this laptop has a lot in common with the Intel-powered MacBook Air that Apple released earlier this year, including the same 2560 x 1600 screen, Touch ID, 720p webcam, fingerprint sensor, and scissor-switch keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iDDWFN"&gt;But the new processor is the star of the show here; it’s fast. In our testing, it handled intense photo- and video-editing workloads better than almost any Intel-powered laptop we’ve tried this year. It was also able to run &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at close-to-playable frame rates, which is quite a feat for integrated graphics. At launch, these apps hadn’t yet been optimized for the M1 processor and were running through Apple’s Rosetta 2 translation layer — but they still worked fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ACwNY3"&gt;And the processing power didn’t even weigh down the battery life: we got between eight and 10 hours of sustained work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XZkaRR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10220133"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8eGPnz"&gt;Another benefit of the M1 processor is that it enables the MacBook Air to run iPhone and iPad apps natively on macOS. As of this writing, there still isn’t a huge selection of mobile apps available, and some that have been released aren’t quite optimized for the laptop screen. Still, it’s a benefit we can look forward to as time goes on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NjPO8F"&gt;Overall, there’s no reason that a general-use customer shouldn’t consider the MacBook Air. It’s a reliable device with excellent performance, as well as the excellence in build quality for which Apple is known. Power users who need a MacBook Pro probably know who they are; the Air should be fine for everyone else. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Best Laptop 2021: HP Spectre x360 14" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VXu0jcRLvUdGZwwpjg3vvbG1mn4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22279295/mchin_190429_4395_0002.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Spectre x360 14 is one of the best convertible laptops you can buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O7mXrt"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22264792/hp-spectre-x360-14-laptop-stylus-oled-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Spectre x360 14&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="N7xEV5"&gt;The best Windows laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4nwIVn"&gt;It’s hard to come up with a single complaint about the Spectre x360 14. It’s a drop-dead gorgeous machine with a sturdy build and a premium look and feel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xL3xF1"&gt;But the Spectre x360 14 isn’t just pretty to look at: it’s also a pleasure to use as a daily work driver. Intel’s latest 11th Gen processors and Iris Xe integrated graphics deliver snappy performance with no slowdown or freezes that we observed. And we got an average of 10 hours of battery life out of the device — one of the best results we’ve ever seen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfMa1S"&gt;On the outside, the Spectre includes a roomy 3:2 display, and if FHD resolution doesn’t suit your fancy, there are OLED and 1,000-nit options available. There’s even a packaged stylus, which attaches magnetically to the side of the Spectre — handy if you’re using the device as a tablet. Pretty much every other aspect of this laptop, from its comfortable keyboard and smooth touchpad to its bass-heavy audio and practical port selection, rivals or exceeds the best convertibles on the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xxTNW9"&gt;Such an exceptional package of features doesn’t come cheap, and many customers will find everything they need in a less expensive product. But the Spectre x360 14 is the new gold standard of Windows convertibles. Overall, it’s the best Windows laptop you can buy.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Best Laptop 20201: LG Gram 17" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GfTxqQBd93C-ef4Dw31UfHEVW_I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22411713/cfaulkner_20210326_4491_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LG Gram 17 is the lightweight 17-inch laptop to buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SoHxJX"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22364183/lg-gram-17-2021-intel-11th-gen-iris-xe-graphics-performance-battery-review"&gt;LG Gram 17 (2021)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aOmcws"&gt;The best laptop in 2021 for big-screen fans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ovDneV"&gt;Even if you’ve used a light laptop before, it’s difficult to explain how light the LG Gram 17 is. It has a massive 17-inch display, but it’s somehow only three pounds. Picking it up messes with your mind; you feel like you’re not holding anything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AbftFc"&gt;But the Gram 17’s weight isn’t the only standout feature. It also has some of the best battery life you can get, lasting over 12 hours in our testing. Add a great keyboard, a solid port selection, quiet fans, and a fast processor, and there’s very little not to like about this device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BvoTCC"&gt;Not everyone needs a 17-inch display, and many folks who do are looking for a heavier-duty workstation that probably doesn’t get moved very often. But if you’d just really like a large screen for your daily office work and Netflixing, you’re the target demographic for this machine. It’s a niche, but truly impressive device without much real competition in today’s market.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Envy x360 is the best laptop you can buy for under $1,000.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7dLyUJ"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 (2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IOuDKK"&gt;The best budget laptop in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6ONzJr"&gt;You don’t need to spend $1,000 to get a laptop that looks and feels premium. The HP Envy x360 2020 is the best budget laptop you can buy, thanks to its sturdy and compact build, chic convertible design, and excellent performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TwdF5"&gt;Part of what makes the Envy so great is that HP has ported over a number of elements from its excellent 2019 flagship, the Spectre x360, including the thin-and-light chassis and nearly bezel-free display with an 88 percent screen-to-body ratio. The touchscreen (which supports HP’s MPP2.0 pen) is bright and looks great. (You can choose a 300-nit, 400-nit, or 1,000-nit panel). And HP has added a row of convenient hotkeys to the keyboard, including kill switches for the microphone and webcam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xRbztF"&gt;But the most exciting feature is inside: the new Envy x360 is powered by AMD’s Ryzen 4000 series. The Ryzen 5-4500U in my model did an outstanding job with a fairly heavy load of multitasking. And AMD’s integrated Radeon graphics delivered good gaming performance comparable to what you’d expect from a lower-powered discrete GPU.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 13-inch MacBook Pro is a refreshed MacBook Pro for modern customers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3k1xVZ"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;MacBook Pro 13 (late 2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lYrZ3f"&gt;The best MacBook Pro for everyday users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="yUbRrT"&gt;If you’re looking to buy an M1 MacBook for heavier workloads, you’ll want to look at the late-2020 MacBook Pro. It starts at $1,299, which is $300 more than the late-2020 MacBook Air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNImzP"&gt;The MacBook Pro has a slightly different design and look than the Air, as well as a few additional features like the Touch Bar. But the two have the same processor. The main difference is that the Pro includes a fan (the Air is fanless), which means it can sustain heavy workloads for a longer period of time without needing to throttle its performance. But you won’t notice much of a performance difference between the two MacBooks unless you’re routinely pushing heavy tasks for long periods of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USngRn"&gt;If that’s you, though, go for the Pro. We were able to run a number of hefty Premiere Pro exports and didn’t see a dip in times. The Pro also achieved a significantly higher score than the Air in a 30-minute loop of Cinebench R23; the scores were closer together after a single run. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 is the best convertible you can buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NKt5f4"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575308/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 13 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Ucqsb1"&gt;A great 2-in-1 laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iLNMXR"&gt;If you’re looking for a convertible laptop that does just about everything right, we recommend Dell’s latest XPS 13 2-in-1. It features a sturdy and well-made chassis, a nearly bezel-free 16:10 touch display, and Intel’s newest 11th Gen processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dghfZI"&gt;The base model, for $1,099, includes a Core i3-1154G4, 8GB of RAM, a 1920 x 1200 display, and a 256GB SSD. You can spec that up to a 3840 x 2400 display, a Core i7-1165G7, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. There are various add-ons as well: you can pay $50 extra for a white model and $60 to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro. Basically, there’s something for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BEAGgI"&gt;Dell has made a few minor tweaks to the 2-in-1 since last year’s model. The webcam now supports Windows Hello, and the RAM and microSD reader have been upgraded. But the exciting news is the new chip and, in particular, Intel’s new integrated graphics. The XPS 13 2-in-1 did a better job than any 10th Gen laptop with an iGPU on our Adobe Premiere Pro export test. And you can even play some games on this thing: it broke 60fps on &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, and even managed 36fps on &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at its lowest settings. That’s an improvement over the results we saw from 10th Gen systems, and it also beats some 11th Gen systems (including the clamshell Dell XPS 13). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izx3w7"&gt;Of course, it’s not perfect. The port selection is limited (as is customary for modern XPS models) and the keyboard is a bit flat for my taste. But overall, the 2-in-1 excels on the fundamentals: build quality, display, performance, and battery life. What more could you want?&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 is one of the best laptops of 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ncv6I8"&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 13 (late 2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="w7TWDY"&gt;The best laptop for college&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6xPrkB"&gt;The Dell XPS 13 is a compact and reliable laptop. Its beautiful chassis, excellent 16:10 display, and great performance make it an excellent choice for general-purpose users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ik0URk"&gt;This late-2020 model comes with Intel’s new Tiger Lake processors, from a Core i3-1154G4 up to a Core i7-1165G7. It starts at $999, so it’s a bit cheaper than the 2-in-1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZCO5H"&gt;My review unit (an i7 model) blew through the work tasks I needed it to do without any slowdown or heat. It did quite well, and handily beat its 10th Gen predecessor in both gaming and media work. It didn’t do as well as the XPS 13 2-in-1, which is why that model is ranked higher on this list. But if you like the look and feel of the XPS 13 and would prefer a clamshell model (or need a bouncier keyboard), this XPS is still a great option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uN3gSr"&gt;There’s an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22528646/dell-xps-13-oled-2021-review-screen-specs-price"&gt;OLED model&lt;/a&gt; of the XPS 13 as well, which costs $300 more than the FHD model. This model has worse battery life, but does deliver a stunning picture. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nxYz9i"&gt;The best gaming laptop in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="2eqQM4"&gt;At just over four pounds, the Zephyrus G15 is one of the lightest 15-inch gaming laptops you can buy. But you’re not compromising performance for that portability. The G15 is powered by the top mobile chips AMD and Nvidia have to offer, and pairs thim with a fast 165Hz QHD display. In our testing, the system was able to handle even the toughest AAA titles at QHD resolution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SxthwN"&gt;Almost everything else about the G15 is great too: the audio sounds good, the keyboard and touchpad are some of the best on the market, the port selection has just about everything you’d need, and the battery can last over eight and a half hours to a charge. If you’re looking for a high-powered gaming machine that also works great as a daily driver, the Zephyrus G15 should be at the top of your list. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="TA1Mem"&gt;The best laptop for business travel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="XTubRZ"&gt;In many ways, the ThinkPad X1 Nano is a run-of-the-mill ThinkPad. It’s got a solid sturdy chassis, discrete clickers, a physical privacy shutter, a red TrackPoint in the middle of the keyboard, and all kinds of business-specific security and management features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WdGWMd"&gt;But the Nano is special because it’s the lightest ThinkPad Lenovo has ever made. It’s also one of the lightest laptops you can buy, at just 1.99 pounds. You’re not sacrificing performance to get that mindblowing weight: The Nano kept up with our heavy testing workloads without any fan noise or noticeable heat. If you’re looking for a reliable business laptop that will feel like nothing in your briefcase, this is the one for you.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="pLq6K9"&gt;The best 14-inch gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="FBMA49"&gt;The Zephyrus G14 is an astonishingly powerful gaming laptop for a low price (relative to other notebooks with comparable hardware). It pairs AMD’s new Ryzen 9 4900HS with an Nvidia RTX 2060 Max-Q GPU and a 120HZ display, and it can run demanding games at their highest settings without a problem. It’s also quite light for such a powerful laptop, weighing just over 3.5 pounds. Its battery life is also impressive for a gaming rig; we got almost nine hours of multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWOpxK"&gt;But you don’t need to be a gamer to appreciate the Zephyrus G14. It’s also a great notebook for business and everyday multitasking with a unique retro design. Plus, the keyboard and touchpad are exceptional and quiet enough not to bother officemates. On the flip side, if you need to use your laptop for videoconferences, the G14 would not be a great choice, as it lacks a webcam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2WSPjS"&gt;A great choice for Mac power users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="TfAFYg"&gt;The 16-inch MacBook Pro is the best Apple laptop for power users. Apple dealt with the biggest complaints that people have historically had about MacBook Pros, and if you can stomach the price, there’s not a lot else to complain about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cIH5ZZ"&gt;Most importantly, the keyboard is good again. The keys have a full millimeter of travel, and while the typing experience isn’t exceptional, it’s a world away from the maligned butterfly keyboard of MacBooks past. It’s fairly quiet, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjExSY"&gt;This MacBook also features the best sound you’ll find on a laptop. Apple has crammed three speakers into each side, including two woofers. The result is balanced audio with audible bass and great stereo separation. For those who need a laptop that can crank through editing video, working with multiple audio tracks, or processing large batches of photos, the 16-inch MacBook Pro is the king of the hill.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id="t0EL7n"&gt;The best business laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="MrOD1p"&gt;If you’re a business professional and money is no object for you or your company, you can’t do better than the HP Elite Dragonfly. The 2020 model is the first Dragonfly that features HP’s super-secure SureView Reflect technology, which tints the screen so that snoops can’t see what you’re doing while you’re working in public. When it’s not tinted, the display gets quite bright (over 700 nits) and has great viewing angles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OzVcoU"&gt;The new Dragonfly is also the first laptop to include a built-in Tile tracker. That means if you lose the device, you can use the Tile smartphone app to set off an alarm (if it’s in Bluetooth range) or locate it anywhere in the world using Tile’s crowd-finding network. The tracker can work for a limited time even when the laptop is off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yXS6n7"&gt;Almost everything else about the Dragonfly is good; it has some of the best battery life of any laptop on the market (we got over 11 hours), a sleek and stunning 2-in-1 design, and an exceptional keyboard. Plus, it incorporates sustainable material, including ocean-bound plastics and recycled DVDs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IEHKpz"&gt;The Dragonfly is pricey, and there are cheaper business laptops that will suit the needs of most professionals just fine. But if you’re looking for the best of the best, it’s the unambiguous winner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WpIKDR"&gt;The best laptop for students&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="5khaPj"&gt;Lenovo’s Chromebook Duet is a great convertible laptop for kids, or anyone who wants a reliable secondary driver for browsing and games. It’s a nice-looking, well-made 10-inch device that comes with a detachable keyboard and kickstand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FV5DZN"&gt;The Duet is tailor-made to be used around the house and on the go, weighing just 2.03 pounds and delivering over 11 hours of battery life. Its MediaTek processor isn’t designed to shoulder heavy loads, but it’s just fine for browsing in a couple tabs, watching Netflix, or playing Android games — it even handles photo editing pretty well. The Duet also features a new “tablet mode” for Chrome OS, which supports an Android-inspired gesture navigation system and a unique Chrome layout optimized for tablet use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XiBrWO"&gt;The Chromebook Duet is an absolute steal for its low price, and is the Chromebook to buy if you’re on a tight budget. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sky6IZ"&gt;A stylish, powerful productivity laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="1AVfKp"&gt;Razer is best known for its gaming laptops, but the company is making a big splash in the business and productivity space with its new Razer Book 13. At 0.6 inches thick and 3.09 pounds, the Book 13 is a portable workstation with a gorgeous and sturdy aluminum build. It features a good port selection including Thunderbolt 4, USB-A, HDMI 2.0 and a microSD slot, and it’s one of very few non-gaming laptops out there to come with a per-key RGB keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAI01n"&gt;On the inside, this laptop is even more impressive. Its powerful chip did better than any other Windows laptop of its size on our Premiere Pro media export test. And while the Book 13 isn’t a gaming laptop, it delivers some of the best gaming performance I’ve ever seen from integrated graphics — it can even run &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; over 30fps. While the Razer Book 13’s high price means it won’t be ideal for everyone, it’s still an outstanding laptop all around, combining a high-quality chassis with powerful productivity performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DdByBe"&gt;The best 17-inch gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="S5SM7Z"&gt;Usually, if you want a 17-inch laptop that can pull playable frame rates out of today’s most demanding games, you’d expect some compromises on portability and design. Notebooks of this size often weigh north of seven pounds and require multiple power bricks to charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Whz2V3"&gt;But while the Blade Pro 17 doesn’t have quite the gaming chops of some bulky desktop replacements, it makes up for that by sporting the compact and attractive design that’s a trademark of the Razer Blade line. At just over six pounds, it’s not too difficult to move around (as 17-inch workstations go). You get an RTX GPU (up to Nvidia’s 2080 Super Max-Q) an eight-core CPU (Intel’s Core i7-10875H) and either a 300Hz screen or a 120Hz touchscreen. There’s even an RGB keyboard with color effects tailored to the game you’re playing. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Volkswagen, BMW fined $1 billion for colluding to make dirtier cars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="File: Global Carmakers Brace For Tariff Whiplash" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aDR3F_siHbDdbfVSJhOSCgdlLWE=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69556348/989626420.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IMkxPd"&gt;Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz parent company Daimler spent years illegally colluding to slow the deployment of cleaner emissions technology, says the European Union, which is &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_3581"&gt;dishing out fines as a result&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dgHabJ"&gt;The EU’s executive branch hit the Volkswagen Group (which owns Audi and Porsche) and BMW with a collective €875 million ($1 billion) fine on Thursday for their role in the scheme. Volkswagen Group must pay €502 million ($595 million), while BMW will pay €373 million ($442 million). Daimler, however, evaded a €727 million fine of its own because the automaker revealed the collusion to the regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2gCst8"&gt;The scheme described by EU authorities is separate from the Volkswagen Group’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22352646/volkswagen-dieselgate-investigation-damages-winterkorn-audi"&gt;massive Dieselgate scandal&lt;/a&gt;, in which the company installed software on its diesel vehicles that helped fool environmental regulators into believing they were compliant, when in reality, they were polluting far more than the legal limit. Dieselgate ultimately led to nearly $40 billion in fines, buybacks, and legal fees for the Volkswagen Group. Daimler also installed software on some of its diesel vehicles &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367768/daimler-diesel-emissions-cheating-scandal-settlement-us-amount"&gt;to cheat emissions tests&lt;/a&gt; and has paid billions of dollars in fines. BMW was careful to point out Thursday that, unlike the other companies it was caught colluding with, it had not cheated emissions testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fABc7D"&gt;The existence of this so-called emissions cartel was first revealed in an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/24/16021292/german-car-companies-cartel-diesel-emissions-90s"&gt;explosive July 2017 report from &lt;em&gt;Der Spiegel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which said that collusion around diesel emissions dated back to the 1990s. The companies met in secret working groups to discuss “the technology, costs, suppliers, and even the exhaust gas purification of its diesel vehicles,” the outlet reported at the time. At the same time, EU authorities announced a probe into the allegations and started raiding the automakers’ corporate offices in search of evidence. Daimler claimed &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-antitrust-volkswagen/eu-raids-daimler-and-vw-in-widening-cartel-inquiry-idUSKBN1CS1OK"&gt;whistleblower status in October of that year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6Na3U6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An emissions cartel, in addition to the separate dieselgate scandal&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="86Imsv"&gt;The EU &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/5/18296540/european-commission-emissions-scandal-collusion-bmw-daimler-vw-diesel-petrol"&gt;formally accused the companies&lt;/a&gt; of collusion in 2019. The conduct considered for the fines announced Thursday took place between 2009-2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ee0fNO"&gt;The “exhaust gas purification” of diesel vehicles mentioned in the original &lt;em&gt;Der Spiegel&lt;/em&gt; report is at the center of the fines that the EU levied Thursday. Specifically, authorities say the Volkswagen Group, BMW, and Daimler agreed on details like the sizes of the tanks used to house AdBlue, a common solution that mixes with a diesel car’s exhaust to neutralize harmful pollutants. By doing this, authorities argue that the automakers had the technology to make cleaner cars but effectively agreed not to compete on this issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QEkXhV"&gt;“The five car manufacturers Daimler, BMW, Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche possessed the technology to reduce harmful emissions beyond what was legally required under EU emission standards,” the EU’s executive branch wrote in a statement. “But they avoided to compete on using this technology’s full potential to clean better than what is required by law. So today’s decision is about how legitimate technical cooperation went wrong. And we do not tolerate it when companies collude.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aRBbb1"&gt;The Volkswagen Group, which has a documented history of lying about its compliance emissions regulations at this point, said in a statement that the “contents of the talks were never implemented and customers were therefore never harmed” and said that bigger AdBlue tanks were eventually used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EbnRlw"&gt;As for some of the other allegations that originally surfaced in the &lt;em&gt;Der Spiegel &lt;/em&gt;report about the collusion extending to suppliers and other technology, the EU authorities had already “narrowed the original scope of its investigation to ensure its charges stuck,” according to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/eu-fines-bmw-volkswagen-group-restricting-competition-emission-cleaning-2021-07-08/?taid=60e6ff0bfdc7d300011fd83e&amp;amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The settlement agreement announced Thursday won’t make an enormous dent on either the Volkswagen Group’s or BMW’s bottom line. The Volkswagen Group made nearly €12 billion, or around $14 billion, in before-tax profit in 2020, while BMW logged €5 billion, or just over $6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hori’s Split Pad Pro for the Switch is $10 off at Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DHmsWglKjz3FA0yIohWeLOxYqPk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69556244/DSCF7116.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OJUBaZ"&gt;The deals are thin today, but there are a few that are worth sharing with you. If you already have a Switch or are planning to get &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565307/nintendo-oled-switch-screen-news-updates"&gt;the OLED model launching in October&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll definitely want to get Hori’s Split Pad Pro controllers. You can get them in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FJ7XY3B?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the translucent black colorway (in my opinion, the best option available) for $40 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, which is $10 off their normal price. These slide in just like Joy-Con controllers but are more accommodating for larger hands than Nintendo’s. They make the Switch less portable, but it might be worth it for you. Unlike Joy-Con, though, these don’t feature rumble, and they only work while connected to the Switch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tpYrmR"&gt;If you need more convincing, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20871866/hori-split-pad-pro-controller-nintendo-switch-daemon-x-machina-review"&gt;check out my colleague Sam Byford’s hands-on with the Split Pad Pro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hsCIz5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10382060"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="W8mVhk"&gt;Until 1PM ET / 10AM PT today, July 8th, you can still purchase PC games on Steam at the lowest prices of the season. The digital storefront has been hosting its annual Summer Sale for several days, but it’s down to the wire now. A few notable discounts include &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1151640/Horizon_Zero_Dawn_Complete_Edition/?snr=1_4_600__104"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for $30, &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/782330/DOOM_Eternal/?snr=1_4_600__104"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doom Eternal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for $20, &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/814380/Sekiro_Shadows_Die_Twice__GOTY_Edition/?snr=1_4_600__104"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for $30, and &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/435150/Divinity_Original_Sin_2__Definitive_Edition/?snr=1_4_600__sale-deals"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Divinity: Original Sin II&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for $18. There’s so much more to check out, so do that before 1PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="n41xYM"&gt;I featured this deal yesterday, but it bears repeating if you’ve been trying and failing to find Microsoft’s Xbox Wireless headset in stock. It normally costs $100 by itself, but there’s a deal happening at eBay that includes a month of Game Pass Ultimate (normally $15) &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F124796256296%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26toolid%3D20008%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F7%2F8%2F22568320%2Fhori-split-pad-pro-nintendo-switch-steam-summer-sale-xbox-headset-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for a total of $107&lt;/a&gt;. Get it while it’s still available, which may not be for much longer as the eBay listing says it has a limited supply.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PodcastOne’s ‘free’ podcast hosting service will cost you</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ta1rnYRTeTKxYJMv1u9PgNMaC7Q=/0x0:3500x2333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69556234/launchpadone.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;PodcastOne&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K2ccgh"&gt;PodcastOne, the podcast network behind shows from people like Mike Tyson and Tom Green, is looking to make more money off shows outside its network. The company is expanding and rebranding its free hosting service, now known as Launchpad One, with more perks to make it appeal to indie podcasters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XOCQ3r"&gt;The free hosting platform allows podcasters to not only host their show, but also accept PayPal donations (a new feature), distribute the show across platforms, and insert their own ads. PodCastOne says it’ll also market shows that use its platform across its own network, a benefit that many hosting services don’t or can’t offer. It says 1,000 shows are already on the service, which was previously known as LaunchpadDM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKpQwB"&gt;At the same time, there’s still a major catch: PodcastOne can insert two ads into any show that hosts on its platform. These ads are sold through PodcastOne’s team, and the company says it retains 100 percent of revenue “in order to keep hosting free,” it explained in an email to me. Podcasters are automatically opted into this monetization. For PayPal donations, the company retains a 4 percent service fee, with 95 percent of donations going to the podcaster. The revenue from any ads the podcaster sells, records, and embeds themselves will be fully kept by the podcaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ihFVW1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The catch is letting PodcastOne insert ads&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YVNDvh"&gt;This is a steep exchange for free hosting, especially because those two ads could become a nuisance to listeners, worsening their experience. If podcasters sell their own ads, it’s feasible listeners will hear three or more ads per show. Granted, free hosting isn’t all that widely available, so it’s a nice offer, but the 100 percent cut is unique and a tradeoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OG1u5x"&gt;Competitors like RedCircle &lt;a href="https://redcircle.com/pricing"&gt;take&lt;/a&gt; a 50 percent cut on ads they sell and automatically insert, for example. Anchor, Spotify’s free hosting service, hasn’t said what cut it takes from automatically inserted ads, which it’s only allowing in the US currently for a subset of podcasters. But for its sponsorships tool, which pairs hosts with brands to create host-read ads, the company &lt;a href="https://help.anchor.fm/hc/en-us/articles/360018999351-New-article"&gt;takes&lt;/a&gt; a 30 percent cut along with a payment processing fee of 25 cents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wXppOs"&gt;Although free hosting and monetization isn’t widely available yet, it’ll presumably only become more important to the industry as larger tech companies enter the space and subsidize hosting in exchange for more ad surface. It’s easy to imagine Amazon and Facebook doing this, for example, both of which only entered the podcasting space recently. The strategy is easy to understand: encourage as many people as possible to launch a podcast, thereby creating more space to run ads; collect as many shows as possible on the hosting platform; and then sell and take a cut of those ads. I just would expect the hosting companies to give podcasters &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; cut of the revenue and not keep 100 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LiveWire One is Harley-Davidson’s second chance at electric motorcycle dominance</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5DqGrK8_3mDJhY0plG3L-AeooXM=/0x2:8192x5463/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69556232/LiveWire_2021_Blk_002.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5Qf4no"&gt;Harley-Davidson is renewing its push into electric motorcycles with the reveal of its latest battery-powered product, the LiveWire One. While the new bike will roughly have the same specs as the company’s first LiveWire motorcycle, it will be more attractively priced in the hopes of attracting more customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FrhmWZ"&gt;The LiveWire One will start at $21,999, without factoring in any federal, state, or local tax benefits. (Any electric motorcycle that can go at least 45mph is eligible for a 10 percent federal tax credit, up to $2,500.) When you take into account these credits, Harley-Davidson said the price will actually fall below $20,000 for most customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zotZyS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Harley-Davidson said the price will actually fall below $20,000 for most customers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xtFrjr"&gt;To start out, the LiveWire One will be available to customers in only three states: California, New York, and Texas. The company is employing what it’s calling a “hybrid” approach to the retail experience, allowing customers to do most of their shopping online before taking delivery from a local Harley-Davidson dealership. Initially, 12 dealerships will be authorized to sell the LiveWire One, but the company expects that number to grow next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PujUhK"&gt;Harley-Davidson says the LiveWire One will be able to travel 146 city miles on a single charge, but it doesn’t say how that translates on the highway. (That’s probably because the range takes a significant hit the faster you go.) Still, it’s a slight improvement over the original LiveWire’s range of 110 city miles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FshLwX"&gt;There are few other major differences, though Harley-Davidson did not release a spec sheet at press time. Plugged into a DC fast charger, the LiveWire One’s battery will go from 0 to 100 percent in 60 minutes, or 0 to 80 percent in 45 minutes. Much like the original LiveWire, this new bike will have a six-axis IMU (inertial measurement unit) to help with traction control and anti-lock braking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eWF62r"&gt;“It’s a very different riding experience,” Harley-Davidson CEO Jochen Zeitz said in an interview. “It’s exhilarating because it is an incredibly agile and fast motorcycle... you go from 0 to 100[mph] in no time.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Dc7IWI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10642676"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rUtcZb"&gt;A more detailed side-by-side between the two LiveWire motorcycles, as well as a comparison with other electric two-wheelers, will reveal more about the new brand’s ability to attract new customers. We’ll likely have to wait for the Northern California International Motorcycle Show on July 18th, when Harley-Davidson plans to officially unveil the LiveWire One. If you can’t wait until then, orders are available at &lt;a href="http://LiveWire.com"&gt;LiveWire.com&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TsXsbb"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18172421/harley-davidson-livewire-electric-motorcycle-price-ces-2019"&gt;the first LiveWire&lt;/a&gt; was praised for being well-made and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/14/20692388/harley-davidson-livewire-electric-motorcycle-test-drive"&gt;fun to ride&lt;/a&gt;, it was often criticized for being overly expensive, with a starting price of $29,799. There was also a glaring lack of options within the company’s lineup. If you really wanted to buy an electric motorcycle from Harley-Davidson but couldn’t afford the LiveWire, you were basically out of luck; LiveWire was the only electric model offered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dTlOup"&gt;It put Harley-Davidson at a competitive disadvantage in the burgeoning electric motorcycle space, with companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21144093/zero-srs-electric-motorcycle-bike-speed-mile-range-photos-price"&gt;Zero Motorcycles&lt;/a&gt; selling multiple models attractively priced between $10,000 and $16,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GeiE4g"&gt;But if the first LiveWire was meant to serve as a demonstration of what Harley-Davidson could do with an electric drivetrain, LiveWire One is meant to be a more serious effort to capture those city-dwelling customers who the company sees as essential to its future survival. The question, though, is &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-harley-davidson-electricbike-focus/harley-struggles-to-fire-up-new-generation-of-riders-with-electric-bike-debut-idUSKBN1WM10N"&gt;whether this market segment truly exists&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5mysDj"&gt;“This is not just a product within a traditional dealer network,” Zeitz said. “It’s a new brand. It’s a new go-to-market approach.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TmXe73"&gt;Zeitz pushed back against the idea that the company’s core customers of aging “boomers” was a problem specific to Harley-Davidson. “The world population is aging, right?” he laughed. “So it’s not just a Harley problem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jeE1Q9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s a new brand. It’s a new go-to-market approach.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aRtDcZ"&gt;But he acknowledged that with LiveWire, the goal is to entice a new generation that didn’t grow up on classics like &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1cDECkN2xg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Easy Rider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Every brand needs to innovate... and needs to excite the next generation about your product and about the experience you deliver,” Zeitz said, pointing to the 2020 television series &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=611fw81BN98"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Long Way Up&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in which actor Ewan McGregor and TV presenter Charley Boorman ride LiveWires from Argentina to Los Angeles, as an example of the appeal of electric motorcycles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YF9EYS"&gt;With the LiveWire One, the company is recommitting itself to the electrification of an entire product line. Earlier this year, Harley-Davidson decided to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428750/harley-davidson-livewire-electric-motorcycle-brand"&gt;spin off LiveWire into its own brand&lt;/a&gt;, with the goal of launching multiple electric motorcycles under that nameplate. LiveWire One is the first product of that effort, and there will be more to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fCrlHS"&gt;The company telegraphed this move in its &lt;a href="http://investor.harley-davidson.com/news-releases/news-release-details/harley-davidson-unveils-hardwire-five-year-strategic-plan"&gt;Hardwire strategic plan&lt;/a&gt; to reinvigorate its flagging sales over the next five years. This dedicated division would be “focused exclusively on leading the future of electric motorcycles,” the company said in its plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y2c0VE"&gt;But while LiveWire will certainly play a significant role in Harley-Davidson’s future, the company is not planning to phase out gas-powered vehicles anytime soon. That’s not the case in the auto industry, with giants like Ford, General Motors, Volkswagen, Honda, Volvo, and others promising to go EV-only within the next decade. Meanwhile, California has said it would ban the sale of gas-powered vehicles by 2035. Other states are sure to follow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wVYi3x"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A lot of factors hold Harley-Davidson back from going whole hog (pun intended) on electrification&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vJJcW1"&gt;There are a lot of factors holding Harley-Davidson back from going whole hog (pun intended) on electrification. For one, space is more limited on a motorcycle than in a car, which means the battery needs to be more condensed. This limits the bike’s range, which makes it a tougher sell to customers interested in cross-country trips or touring. And those people represent a significant portion of the company’s base. On top of all that, the EV charging infrastructure in the US is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22419150/ev-charging-us-joe-biden-infrastructure-plan"&gt;fractured and unreliable&lt;/a&gt; and frankly sucks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JllAWR"&gt;“There is no path to electrifying a touring bike and giving it the three or four hundred miles that you would want,” Zeitz said. “And also bearing in mind that fast charging infrastructure is not common yet outside of the city. And even within the city, it’s not always available.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ix0eI9"&gt;Zeitz, who took the helm at Harley-Davidson in 2020 after serving as CEO of Puma for 18 years, noted that “synthetic fuels are not something that you can completely disregard” and said he was holding out hope for “a major revolution in that space” that would help Harley-Davidson navigate the post-fossil fuel future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gg9ieo"&gt;“But electrification is gonna be a significant part of it,” he added. “And time will tell. We will as a company certainly be prepared for both.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOkWkA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2pQkFp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="7pP10h"&gt;Okay, this article is for those who have never posted a video on TikTok. The rest of you? Stop snickering, and go away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tf4ObF"&gt;Are we alone? Okay, here we go. To begin, there are actually more TikTok newbies than you’d think. But the service is definitely worth exploring: TikTok is a really fun (and sometimes even educational) app. And after you’ve swiped through a bunch of videos — some great, some really funny, and some that you wish you’d never seen — you may want to try your hand at creating your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dBCmCP"&gt;TikTok has its own culture: straightforward, brash, sometimes (actually often) pushing past the bounds of what many would consider good taste. That’s why it’s so creative. But while you can be as wild as you want (within &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines?lang=en"&gt;certain boundaries, of course&lt;/a&gt;), you don’t have to let out all the stops — especially if you’re just trying it out. When you’re trying out your first video, go where you want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dnTUSz"&gt;And what’s even better, you can keep your videos private until you’re ready to let them out into the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ocq4u"&gt;Here’s how to create your own TikTok video. We’re just going to touch on the basics and give you the tools so you can explore further. One note here: this was done using an Android Pixel phone, so there may be minor differences in the interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AGcdz2"&gt;Getting started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="FRCcTV"&gt;Tap the plus sign in the lower center of the display. You’re now in camera mode. If you want to make a video inside of TikTok, hit the large record button and start recording. But first, some tips.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="D1O2Ff"&gt;Just above that button are the time limits for your video. You can choose one of three: 15 seconds, 60 seconds, or 3 minutes. (This last is a new update, so it’s possible it hasn’t rolled out to your phone yet. Be patient.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="To begin, tap on the “plus” button in the lower center." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SNqq1DaX4Uomet2V3wjX-M2S-xg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22704344/Screenshot_20210707_143346.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;To begin, tap on the “plus” button in the lower center.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You’ll immediately find yourself in camera mode." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OiMblge42SX0oyws3bWEjKUs0mE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22704310/Screenshot_20210707_144045.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll immediately find yourself in camera mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="WRAe33"&gt;Below the button is a label for the camera button and, to its right, a link for a series of templates that will take several of your photos and put them into a prepackaged form. Take a look; these may be nice if you want to share a TikTok as a card with some friends, but they’re not very exciting. (There are other templates available online if you want to go looking.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="n8S65I"&gt;More interesting (to me, anyway) is the Effects button to the left of the camera button, which will add interesting effects to your video as you film it. Go ahead and check it out, but be warned: this may take up the rest of your afternoon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="TikTok comes with a few initial templates." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F0X2ZeLs4FGVu6VbYGzmOZxQxI8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22704312/Screenshot_20210707_144231.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;TikTok comes with a few initial templates.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Effects button lets you play with the look of your video." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o3msEPMAevXbdAKw17XVNCv4dcA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22704327/Screenshot_20210707_162334.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Effects button lets you play with the look of your video.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jc1uWM"&gt;Adding sound&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="itZcB7"&gt;And then, there is sound. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0vzcGp"&gt;There are a variety of ways you can add music or other audio to your videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="5gKbUx"&gt;If you like the audio in a video you’re watching, you can tap on the moving circle in the lower-right corner. That will bring you to a page of videos that feature music from the artist. If you’re currently creating your own video, you can tap on the big “Use this sound” button on the bottom to add it to your video. Otherwise, you can just “Add to Favorites” by tapping the button on top.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="If you like the audio, tap the circle in the lower right corner." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AXpptSzoZuURnqUqVPVkcl-mMyc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22705596/Screenshot_20210708_084347.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you like the audio, tap the circle in the lower-right corner.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can immediately use that sound, or add it to your favorites." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XBr9WvTvdddmcpe6fvjmKiYJceY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22705574/Screenshot_20210708_084424.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can immediately use that sound or add it to your favorites.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="dzedTv"&gt;When you’re ready to add audio to your new video, and you’re in camera mode, tap the “Add sound” button on the top of the screen. You can do a search for an artist or song in the top search box, find new sounds using the Discover listing on the lower left, or look at your previously chosen Favorite on the lower right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ymYmfT"&gt;But wait, there’s more: swipe down on the page, and you can find some categorized playlists. Further down, you can see samples of types of available music; if you like a category, tap “See all” for more selections. Tape on the flag icon to favorite any you like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tap “Add sound” on your camera mode screen, and you can add a variety of audio to your new video." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nr1Lsrp5jpjpr7iSp1F1Kqh0QkI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22705599/Screenshot_20210708_090724.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tap “Add sound” on your camera mode screen, and you can add a variety of audio to your new video.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LkjYfXf7JYj_aeHRRWk7DuZUDfY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22705576/Screenshot_20210708_091058.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OH9rp9"&gt;(Note: if you’re creating a sponsored video — in other words, if you’re getting paid for your video — tap on the “Sounds” label up top and choose “Commercial Sounds” to access audio that is licensed for commercial use.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="o13DLZ"&gt;Uploading videos and photos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="2743Xy"&gt;If you’d rather use a video that you already filmed, tap on the “Upload” button on the right side of the camera button. This will take you to your Photos app, where you can select one or more videos or photos in any combination you want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9jLgj9"&gt;When you choose a photo or video, a thumbnail will appear at the bottom of the screen, numbered in order of presentation (which, it is assumed, is in the order you chose them). If you want to put them in a different order, press on the thumbnail at the button and move it to the left or right; you’ll see that the numbering in the main window changes. When you’re ready, select “Next.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Thumbnails of your chosen video or photo will appear at the bottom." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FLgNkcKGLt4huUHxufNi27dmVbY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22704329/Screenshot_20210707_150154.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thumbnails of your chosen videos or photos will appear at the bottom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can crop your video at the beginning or the end." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m3vfZgGGtYJOQt4wBoeqbvz4nMQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22704331/Screenshot_20210707_150553.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can crop your video at the beginning or the end.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PLJWyn"&gt;Preparing your video&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="dq8yr5"&gt;On the next screen, your video will play, with a cropping box at the bottom that lets you crop it at the beginning or end. You can also speed up your video by 2x or slow it down by 0.5x by tapping on the clock icon or turn the image by 90-degree increments by tapping the square icon. When you’re ready, tap on the Next button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oo0C42"&gt;This is where you can add sounds (if you haven’t already) and effects (including color effects or transitions; you can also play with time using repeats or slo-mo). You can add text or stickers. If you’re feeling even more ambitious, you can add a filter (to change hue) and do a voiceover. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oLRpOh"&gt;You can also add captions. This can be an important addition; it makes your video more accessible, and it also allows people to watch it when they can’t have the audio on. Note: when you turn on automatic captions, you will have to consent to the “collection and use of the audio.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="C2lWQb"&gt;Don’t be afraid to play around; each of these features can be tweaked in a number of interesting ways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Here, I’ve added some text to the video." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NuSsJSvdhAyw6k9h-K_XjKhus_U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22704334/Screenshot_20210707_153939.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here, I’ve added some text to the video.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="On the last page, you can add a description and set the limitations for your video." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DH0j3_gJzYdbUevv6SMVpXfWIYw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22704375/Screenshot_20210707_164034.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the last page, you can add a description and set the limitations for your video.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="x8uFBt"&gt;Finally, you’ve hit the last page. Describe your video; put in a few hashtags or tag friends; add a link. You can also decide whether to allow comments and whether to allow people to use your video in a TikTok Duet (where they could record a video side by side with yours) or a Stitch (where others can use parts of your video while crediting you). And (perhaps most important when you’re a beginner) you can decide whether you want to keep it private, only share it with friends, or throw it out to the world. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zhFfi1"&gt;If you still want to play with it a bit, tap Drafts. Otherwise, tap Post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="qQzXXW"&gt;And you’re done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WYnScT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99ZRlV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>‘Huge leap’ for NASA’s Mars helicopter ushers new mission support role</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7vpD1yX27riHCcvpXqSQCyqXoL8=/0x27:640x454/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69555987/Mars_Perseverance_HNM_0120_0677593611_564ECM_N0080001HELI02797_0000LUJ.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A frame from Ingenuity’s navigation camera during its ninth flight over Mars’ Séítah region.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: NASA / JPL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o5Rboo"&gt;The Séítah region on Mars, filled with rocks and sand dunes, was too treacherous for NASA’s Perseverance rover to drive across. So Ingenuity, the tiny helicopter accompanying the rover, flew over the area on Monday and snapped some photos of a key spot on the other side. In less than three minutes, Ingenuity spared Perseverance the months it would have had to spend driving to take its own photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5iEhjh"&gt;The quick Monday morning jump across Séítah was Ingenuity’s ninth flight on Mars so far, but it marked the first time the chopper lent a helping hand to Perseverance in its hunt for ancient signs of life at the Red Planet’s Jezero Crater. The four-pound helicopter arrived on Mars on February 14th, attached to Perseverance’s underside, and became the first object to take powered flight on another world on April 19th. Its initial set of flights served as increasingly complex practice tests to demonstrate how off-world rotorcraft can buzz around places that wheeled rovers can’t go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lgIy9b"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This was a big leap — &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; leap — in terms of what we’ve done before.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cjEXK9"&gt;But on Monday, NASA engineers pushed Ingenuity’s limits further than ever. In 166 seconds, Ingenuity flew roughly 11mph for almost a half-mile, or 2,050 feet — a far greater distance than its most recent flight in June, which tallied 525 feet. The copter buzzed around different corners of Séítah and snapped photos of its borders, where junctures between different rock formations — called contacts, in geology lingo — make for some of the most scientifically intriguing targets in Perseverance’s hunt for fossilized microbial life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UzrTxs"&gt;“This was a big leap — &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; leap — in terms of what we’ve done before. We went between sites that were 620, 625 meters apart, which is enormous compared to what we’ve done before,” Ingenuity chief pilot Harvard Grip said in an interview. Ingenuity’s photos, expected in the coming days after traveling down a delayed Mars-to-Earth data pipeline, will help engineers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory decide whether to send Perseverance on a path to scoop up rock samples in that particular contact region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0JoqCG"&gt;The mission is “designed to be high risk, high reward, so that means it makes sense for us to take those additional risks because of the potential payoff,” Grip said.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b8SgKretqfk-v03OszCU7JgK_5Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22705682/1400x1609.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: NASA / JPL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The flight path for Ingenuity’s ninth flight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GMwDnB"&gt;Ingenuity, originally designed to fly on short trips from point A to B, dipped into one of Séítah’s eroded craters, slowed its speed, then ascended up slopes for the first time while dancing along a zig-zagged path. Its autonomous navigation algorithms were written to anticipate flying over only flat terrain, so engineers tweaked the code and convinced the helicopter that Séítah’s bumpy features were flat. That demanded several simulations in preparation for the flight, mainly to predict whether the helicopter could potentially spin out of control under its new flight directions. No accidents occurred, and Ingenuity successfully reached the targeted rock formation on the other side of Séítah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4koYox"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Let’s go big, and let’s take a risk and get across Séítah”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XtGAWo"&gt;“This was the first time where we really said, ‘Let’s go big, and let’s take a risk and get across Séítah,’ which we know is an extremely challenging terrain for a rover to traverse,” Ken Williford, deputy project scientist for the Perseverance mission, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="coTLEP"&gt;Sending a tiny drone across a potentially dangerous field of thick sand to scout for cool Mars rocks is a huge time-saver for the Perseverance team. “When scientists can get those images of that contact early, we can start the science process much earlier than we would otherwise, and start to make observations and interpretations and understand what those rocks are,” Williford says.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BZfHUmt9NfiETz_5PlklVMxGoEg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22705706/25964_PIA24600_web.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: NASA / JPL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An image of Séítah, taken by Ingenuity in May during its sixth flight. Newer images of Séítah from the helicopter’s ninth flight weren’t immediately available.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uzv8pw"&gt;The rover has its own cameras, primarily designed to analyze nearby rocks and Martian landscapes. And sensors aboard NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, a satellite roughly 155 miles above Mars’ surface, give the Perseverance team imagery of far-off rock targets but lack the close-up details a helicopter like Ingenuity can provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="19Kodf"&gt;The helicopter was set for retirement after its first five flight demonstrations to let the Perseverance team focus on its own work. But after Ingenuity aced its fourth flight in late April, engineers decided to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22412154/nasa-ingenuity-aces-fourth-flight-mars-advance-new-testing"&gt;expand the craft’s mission&lt;/a&gt; on Mars to demonstrate how helicopters could help future rovers conduct science. Some of Ingenuity’s midflight photos taken during test flights were convenient for Perseverance scientists, but Monday’s flight marked the first time that it took off with a sole mission to help the rover’s science team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fDoBTL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A very unique interaction” between Perseverance and Ingenuity teams&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gnzMQ4"&gt;NASA leadership approved Ingenuity’s mission expansion on the condition that it doesn’t perturb or interfere with Perseverance’s core mission, Williford said. A small “interface” team combining engineers from Perseverance and Ingenuity, serving as the operational glue between the two missions, has since been expanded to include Perseverance scientists as Ingenuity proves itself more scientifically useful than expected. For most NASA missions, these interface teams sometimes spark debate and disagreement as eager scientists negotiate technical risks with more risk-averse spacecraft engineers. But the Ingenuity-Perseverance team is surprisingly smooth, Williford says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gYffH7"&gt;“This has been a very unique interaction, where I can go in there and say, ‘You know what would be so fantastic? Is if we could get over here,’ and then to hear Bob Balaram [Ingenuity’s chief engineer] say, ‘Yeah, let’s do it!’ and really pushing his team to go further,” said Williford, who also works as the director of JPL’s Astrobiogeochemistry Laboratory. “It’s been one of the most fun things that I’ve ever done, really. Working with those engineers and a few other scientists to plan these flights, I feel like a 12-year-old kid again, honestly.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The UK is considering legal protections for animals’ feelings — so what do animals ‘feel’?</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="frmJrQ"&gt;Animals with spines in the UK could soon be legally recognized as “sentient” beings with feelings if a &lt;a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/2867"&gt;bill&lt;/a&gt; being debated in Parliament &lt;a href="https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2021/june/lords-discuss-key-areas-of-animal-welfare-sentience-bill/"&gt;moves forward&lt;/a&gt;. Should the bill become law, it could get lawmakers to consider animals’ feelings, like pain or even joy, when crafting any new policy. The bill is part of a &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-57072922"&gt;larger push by the government&lt;/a&gt; to set high standards for animal welfare in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PrhQ5m"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Are animals used for food or fur bored in their pens?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I23c7j"&gt;That raises a lot of questions for humans. Are animals used for food or fur &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0049180&amp;amp;utm_source=baytoday.ca&amp;amp;utm_campaign=baytoday.ca&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral"&gt;bored&lt;/a&gt; in their pens, for instance? And what do you do with an individual who might react differently to a situation than its peers, based on its unique personality? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9GF4fs"&gt;If passed, the bill would create an “Animal Sentience Committee” in charge of evaluating how well the government considers those feelings in its policies. For now, the bill focuses on vertebrates; animals with spines. But there’s a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/animal-welfare-sentient-uk-parliament/2021/07/04/44593460-d8df-11eb-8c87-ad6f27918c78_story.html?utm_campaign=wp_evening_edition&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;amp;wpisrc=nl_evening&amp;amp;carta-url=https%3A%2F%2Fs2.washingtonpost.com%2Fcar-ln-tr%2F3415776%2F60e372da9d2fda8060f80c90%2F596a4fb9ae7e8a0ef33cf3d7%2F43%2F54%2F60e372da9d2fda8060f80c90"&gt;push&lt;/a&gt; from animal rights advocates to expand its proposed protections to invertebrates, like octopuses and lobsters, that have recently surprised scientists with what they’re capable of &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4803207/"&gt;doing&lt;/a&gt; and potentially &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004221001978"&gt;&lt;em&gt;feeling&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vRRRXI"&gt;To better understand what it means for an animal to “feel,” &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke with Kristina Horback, director of the Animal Behavior and Cognition Lab at the University of California, Davis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P5Qday"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xaWrum"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I know this can get a little complex but, first of all, how do you define sentience?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lSbs3B"&gt;In teaching undergraduates at UC Davis, I use a definition of: capable of sensing environmental cues — sensation, perception, and then responding to those cues. In that definition, you include invertebrates, insects, so many things. But there’s definitely confusion with taking a philosophical slant in adding feeling — not only feeling but consciousness, awareness of that feeling. That’s where it gets really muddled, trying to “prove” consciousness: the actual acknowledgment of “I’m experiencing pleasure right now” or “I’m experiencing pain” and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="kEPJpM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That’s where it gets really muddled, trying to ‘prove’ consciousness”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aKAC7F"&gt;Right now, there’s a lot of focus on pain, which is understandable. We’re seeing some evidence of learned behavior, where the animal will avoid certain areas in their environment where they experienced pain. For example, some fish species will avoid an area where they were once hooked in their mouth. So we have enough evidence of the experience of pain, and learned behavior from that experience of pain — but it’s going to be really difficult to have sufficient evidence right now that the animal is on a conscious level of, “Wow, that hurt.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0o6KvR"&gt;This is where I think a lot of this legislation comes into play, is “shouldn’t we kind of err on the side of caution?” In particular, there’s this interest in vertebrate mammals and birds that have the same brain structures, they’re showing the same behavioral responses that we see in humans in terms of body postures, or learned changed behavior for experiences of pain and anxiety and stress. Shouldn’t we assume that they are also experiencing that on a conscious level? But that gets heavy in philosophy as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eD87CC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How has our understanding of animal sentience changed over time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JGIPM6"&gt;Well, I think you can go back as far as philosophers like Rene Descartes, who viewed them as automatic machines where information goes in from the environment and then they just have sort of reflex responses and that’s it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QURsNm"&gt;But we’ve had a really great merging of other psychologists, cognitive scientists, and primatologists. Think of your classic Jane Goodall, people who actually sit and take time to view the animals and say, “Now hold on, there’s a lot more going on than just in and out in terms of response to the environment or response to finding a mate, survival, and that’s it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MSrznV"&gt;I think it’s just taken time for humans to become more clever to design experiments where we can acknowledge the capacities of other animals. We are so limited because we are primates ourselves, that all we think about is vision and spatial cues. But that doesn’t work for dolphins, you know. We’ve got to think like the species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FURi3Z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re no longer viewing animals as just robotic objects”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nZdDQi"&gt;It was really neat to see it spark so many different fields in terms of, what about personality? Or what about boredom? Do animals experience boredom? Because we’ve already kind of had an acceptance that animals experience pain. But these other levels of complex experiences like boredom or guilt — a lot of scientists are getting together to see, can we find evidence of that? We’re no longer viewing animals as just robotic objects that take in information and spit out information and just survive and die. There’s a lot more going on in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qbYqKY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So we can say now that animals have personalities?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tBicgp"&gt;Yes, there’s certainly so much literature out there — going from insects and reptiles and birds to your great apes and marine mammals — looking at personality. It could be an animal of the same sex, and the same family group, and the same rearing environment, but one is always more aggressive than the other or one is always more cautious than the other. You know, there’s a style in terms of how they respond to their world. That’s personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="AJ0iAr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s a style in terms of how they respond to their world. That’s personality.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="azPNbT"&gt;In terms of comparative psychology and animal welfare science, you know, we all are aiming at understanding capacities and experiences of &lt;em&gt;individual&lt;/em&gt; animals. I think it’s a wonderful progression. I think it’s pretty easy for a lot of humans to acknowledge differences among their pets, and this is just kind of expanding it out now in terms of livestock or lab animals even. We want all lab animals to be the exact same, but the thing is, they’re not. That’s what I think is moving forward. It’s not just, “the lab rat does this.” It’s, “Well, it depends on…” you know, and then finishing the sentence because they’re individuals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1za3IN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What impact might this bill have if it passes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kY0Owa"&gt;It’s easy to see how it relates to farm animal treatment, like new housing requirements or enrichment requirements, or the treatment of animals in transportation. And then it could kind of expand to the import and export of livestock. If you put a bunch of sheep or cattle on a ship and send them somewhere, is that going to be changed now? That’s kind of the level I see it directly impacting commerce and trade for these products. And then it could get even larger. If we’re still just sticking to vertebrates, that can expand to fur animals or so many other uses of animals in medical fields. If it goes forward, a lot of things need to move as well to make it work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7H7w9x"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ndXeBG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 preview: a first look at Apple’s latest software</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ndZckU4N8rhNAvTM3h79RZ4Q17Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69525167/cgartenberg_210629_4653_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Hands-on with the public betas&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="RGStJw"&gt;iOS 15 and iPad 15 are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22557308/ios-ipados-15-public-beta-apple-install"&gt;kicking off their public betas today&lt;/a&gt;, and after a few weeks with the developer betas of the new software, Apple’s OS updates feel like more of a grab bag of new features than ever before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eGHjhM"&gt;A major rethinking of either platform, this year’s updates are not. The two updates were clearly born in 2020’s norm-shattering pandemic. The feature list at WWDC and on Apple’s website wears last year’s remote-first influences firmly, from the heavy emphasis on FaceTime features to a better system for corralling notifications into “work” and “personal” buckets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kCtoK8"&gt;Of course, Apple’s release cadence and insistence on major updates coming just once a year means that some of these features are arriving in what will — hopefully — be a post-pandemic return to life this fall. So it’ll be interesting to see how things like SharePlay, one of the update’s marquee features, actually shake out once people have the option to watch movies and listen to music together in person again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="82OTUS"&gt;Other parts of iOS and iPadOS 15, like the overhauled Safari app or the new Maps app, feel like the kinds of more noticeable changes generally associated with Apple’s major software updates, but they’re sporadic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9D4var"&gt;The result is a software update that feels a lot quieter than Apple’s usual releases, one that — at least for now — looks to improve smaller things behind the scenes than rebuild things from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2-YOwTs3Mxm7lXWTL3BFGCCtW8I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22689245/cgartenberg_210629_4653_002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The iOS 15 homescreen is largely unchanged from iOS 14. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZGKdwT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FaceTime and SharePlay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Nan3wn"&gt;The flashiest feature coming to the fall updates is SharePlay, a new Apple-wide system built on top of FaceTime for sharing TV shows, movies, music, and podcasts with friends and family even when you’re not in the same room. It’s also the most pandemic-inspired feature, an Apple product-based spin on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21307583/watch-videos-movies-online-friends-streaming-netflix-hulu-amazon-scener-extensions"&gt;countless watch party apps and services&lt;/a&gt; that sprung up to replace movie nights over the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="warmv9"&gt;SharePlay shows off how well Apple’s hardware and software services all work together: watching a TV show or listening to an album over FaceTime is seamless. But it also highlights the height of Apple’s walled garden: developers have to choose to use SharePlay — which is missing big names like Netflix and YouTube right now — and it only works on Apple hardware, despite the expansion of FaceTime and the Apple TV app to other platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_FEgxPx_dNvDn7GZ-gzLRUEouR4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691037/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_10.11.02_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SharePlay in action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k8DJV1"&gt;And since content is streamed locally, everyone watching or listening has to have access to it, meaning that you can’t share an episode of &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso &lt;/em&gt;with a friend who’s not a TV Plus subscriber, nor can you both watch the same movie if only one of you has purchased it from iTunes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SXcJ1T"&gt;FaceTime is also getting a wide variety of long-overdue updates that help cement it as a more viable video chatting application: a sorely needed grid view, screen sharing, a portrait mode to blur your messy background, and the ability to FaceTime with Windows and Android users (in web browsers) thanks to sharable links. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HGPKYn"&gt;These are all badly needed features for FaceTime, but they’re also the sort of thing that remains bewildering to have had to wait until September 2021 for, especially given the reliance on video calling over the past year and a half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6YfJml"&gt;Unlike SharePlay, though, the FaceTime improvements feel like the kind of thing that will remain front and center even as things start to go back to normal, although the Apple product focus and more limited feature set when compared to professional solutions like Zoom or Microsoft Teams mean that FaceTime won’t be making a play for business meetings any time soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tEy0Z1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ZhK4nw"&gt;As is traditional for an iOS update, Apple has done some tinkering with notifications on iOS 15. Some of the smaller notifications are bigger now, and feature contact images — which might be the push to get people to actually add photos to their contacts, something that doesn’t generally exist in the real world outside of an Apple presentation in my experience. And apps that you care less about can be filtered to a new summary mode that’s delivered several times a day, instead of pinging you for each notification right away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aVieJE"&gt;But the bigger addition is the new Focus feature, and after only a few weeks of using it, it’s already one of my favorite features on iOS in years. On the surface, Focus is an expansion of Apple’s existing Do Not Disturb feature, but instead of a blanket mute, Focus allows you to select specific apps and contacts to share notifications at specific times or specific triggers. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9wwnvgScnLVZ0lgi5r3_OifdHWE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691389/focus.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Focus settings (left), the expanded Do Not Disturb menu (middle), and Focus-siloed notifications (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bE7U7n"&gt;A “work” Focus, for example, can be set to activate when you’re on the clock and mute all notifications except from your email, Slack, and calendar apps, then automatically switch off when you’re off work. Focus modes can be triggered by specific times, locations (like when you get to your office or home from work) or when opening a specific app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="trNbrP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Focus gives you real control over filtering notifications&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FRnXl4"&gt;So far, I’ve mostly just been using a “personal” focus for weekends and evenings to automatically mute any work Slacks and emails until the morning, which has been absolutely delightful. Apple’s machine learning also tries to learn from how you use your phone — for example, it suggested that I add a sports app I use a lot during “personal” time to the whitelist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XnjYef"&gt;And while Focus can be used in conjunction with Apple’s Screen Time feature, it’s not a totally cohesive system: for example, there’s no way to automatically disable work apps like Slack when in a “personal” Focus mode. It just shuts off notifications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8qA9Ae"&gt;Focus also lets you assign specific homescreen pages to each Focus mode — including widgets — for even more customized experiences. iOS has also added the option to add duplicate icons for apps (so you can still have Apple Music visible on both a “personal” and a “work” homescreen, for example). But I’m a big fan of the feature, since it gives me a good reason to actually set up homescreens with widgets, and helps curb the instinct to tap the Slack icon when I’m supposed to be offline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tg2Joz"&gt;There’s also a new kind of notification to go with Focus and the morning summary feature, called “Time Sensitive Notifications,” which can override specific notification filtering features, so you don’t miss urgent alerts from your bank, for instance. Apple has specific rules for when developers can use these, but we’ll have to wait to see how they’re actually implemented when apps get updated this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eQJ6s9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safari explores a new look&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sa-F42U9akLG4HUc8T5Q-CFoKCQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691391/safari.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Safari’s new design, with the rearranged URL bar.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="mrCBnF"&gt;Safari has been entirely redesigned in iOS 15. In terms of material changes to iOS, this is the biggest, and it’s coming to what might be the most essential application on the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YP04AG"&gt;For the iPhone in particular, that means an emphasis on a one-handed design that moves the URL bar to the bottom of the screen, adds a swiping gesture interface, and a tab grouping feature (which is also coming to iPadOS and macOS Monterey). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJ7LM1"&gt;I’m still getting used to it, even with a few days of use under my belt, and of all the additions in the latest software update, I suspect it’ll be the most polarizing. Over a decade of muscle memory has trained my brain to reach up for the menu bar on smartphones. I get Apple’s motivation in moving it to the bottom, making it easier to reach on the increasingly large phones it makes and putting the actual content of devices front and center at the top of the screen, it’s still a change that’ll require an adjustment period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qCUCdYYVSJw438QnZ8SDpmQE4lU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22689246/cgartenberg_210629_4653_003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;iPadOS 15 allows for widgets on the homescreen now.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="j5vaNa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad multitasking: what’s a computer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="luHkRC"&gt;Overall, iPadOS 15 gets a lot of the same improvements as the iPhone update. There’s a few iPad-specific features, though, starting with two major features from iOS 14 that were oddly missing last year: widgets on the homescreen and the App Library (which comes with a spiffy animation when you open it). I still can’t explain why Apple didn’t add those features last year, but they’re extremely welcome now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g4rff1"&gt;Widgets, as expected, work even better on the iPad than they do on the iPhone, given the bigger homescreen. It’s not as big of a sacrifice to give up a quarter of your homescreen for widgets when there’s still so much extra space on the screen. Apple has also added even &lt;em&gt;bigger&lt;/em&gt; widget sizes, the biggest size of which is roughly the same area as an entire iPhone 12 display when viewed on a 12.9-inch iPad Pro. Despite the massive size, Widgets still have the same functionality as they do on the iPhone, meaning that they’re focused on glanceable information rather than more interactive mini applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YaF2Fz"&gt;Apple is also continuing to refine multitasking on the iPad with two new additions: a multitasking icon (three dots at the top of the display) that makes it easier to use the different split-view and slide-over modes it introduced in 2019, and a “shelf” that shows all the open windows for a particular app when you open it or tap the multitasking icon. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5vQ2rbcsyuXVwyn4YZJjxh2girI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691086/IMG_0008.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multitasking on iPadOS 15 is still... a lot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MbzDBs"&gt;The new multitasking setup is better, albeit still slightly confusing. Putting a single app into split view using the new menu punts you back to the homescreen to select a second app (or the same app again) to view in split-screen mode. Apps can be dragged and dropped when you’re in the app switching window to create new split-screen or full-screen combinations. The multitasking dots light up to show which app in split-screen is in focus, which is incrementally better than the bar from before. And swiping down on the multitasking dots is now an almost home-button-like experience, closing that app and letting you select a new one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ndrGX"&gt;There are still a lot of ways to move things around and arrange things and keyboard shortcuts available — so much so that Apple has a new menu when you hold the globe key to view system and multitasking shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yqls37"&gt;But there’s still plenty of friction here. iPadOS remains unpredictable: I’m never 100 percent sure what version of an open app or app windows will open when I tap in on my homescreen. Just opening a new window is still an opaque process that involves dragging and dropping things around in split view. Slide-over panels still live in their own, separate confusing world. Split view is still frustratingly rigid, letting you have exactly two apps open with a third visible as a slide-over panel, instead of any other configuration (like one large app on the left and two smaller ones on the right). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="8yAG2j"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An iPad operating system with iPad apps — and that’s just how Apple likes it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MxrfpE"&gt;Ultimately, the new multitasking and split-screen views are a refinement of the older system, rather than some grand new paradigm for how to use an iPad. Those who like the iPad’s software abilities will likely find the new additions and enhancements to those modes nice. But those who were hoping that iPadOS 15 would offer a wildly overhauled windowing system — especially in the wake of Apple’s M1 upgrade in the latest iPad Pro — are going to be disappointed. Apple may do some additional tweaks or changes before iPadOS 15 launches this fall, but it’s unlikely to do any sweeping design changes for this update. iPadOS is still firmly an iPad operating system with iPad apps, and that seems to be how Apple likes things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s3jMKY"&gt;Also new is a Samsung-like “Quick Notes” feature that lets users swipe up from the bottom corner of the display or hit a keyboard shortcut and scribble down a thought, highlight text on a website, or add a link for context. Quick Notes get saved to their own category on the Notes app, and can be accessed from other Apple devices, too. They’re useful, although like many iPadOS 15 features, it’s not something you’d likely figure out how to use without outside prompting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="w8vdJA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The best of the rest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="sRILU7"&gt;As is always the case, there are dozens of bigger and smaller features coming in iOS and iPadOS, too. Here are some of the more notable ones to check out on the public beta:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JKJ4ez"&gt;Live Text might be the most technically impressive part of the updates, letting you point your camera at any handwritten or typed text to grab a phone number or email address, translate it, or pull it directly into a text field. Apple has quietly made this a system-level feature — meaning that it’s available whenever you’re viewing an image, be it in the live camera feed, an image on the web, or directly from the keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="7eJg3R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Live Text might be the most technically impressive update&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8cDWpCArz45zoW0gA6_K0S7khj0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691400/text_image.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Live Text on iOS 15 can capture text directly from a photo feed.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZbDOvr"&gt;An interesting new addition on both operating systems is a new “Shared with You” feature, which shows photos, Apple Music songs, links, Apple TV Plus content, and podcasts that were shared over iMessage in dedicated rows within those apps. The theory is that if someone texts you a nice photo or their favorite playlist, you’ll be able to see it (and respond to it) in the Photos or Music apps. The feature is unsurprisingly entirely limited to Apple services for now, so sending a Spotify song to someone won’t appear in Spotify. It also might be overestimating how often users send links to TV Plus shows to each other, but showing shared links and photos are admittedly useful (at least, when the feature works properly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3F8nIP"&gt;The Weather app has an overhauled design that adds a vertical, Dark Sky-style 10-day forecast and Dark Sky-style maps for temperature and precipitation. It looks nice. Notes and Reminders are both getting hashtags for categorizing and organizing, and the Memories feature in Photos is getting completely overhauled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cHpcLX"&gt;Lastly, you can now put your Memoji avatars in outfits. I have no opinion on this.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D4gSsb6Ov3LMeV40ABqou9nGmF4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691105/Untitled.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;¯\_(ツ)_/¯ &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1O7u7A"&gt;A lot of the other flashy new features are things we can’t test yet. Apple’s beta is only rolling out new maps to the San Francisco Bay Area to start (although it’ll be in far more locations when the final software is out this fall). IDs and keys in Wallet will also have to wait for broader support from state governments, hotels, and workplaces before we can see how those work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D3fEA5"&gt;There are also a lot of features that will have to wait for third-party developers, like Focus statuses or SharePlay in third-party apps, which also have to wait for app updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="MvxOuP"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="V6Offf"&gt;The most notable thing from my time with the betas, though, is how easy it is to miss the newer features. Outside of the most in-your-face updates like the larger notifications or the new Safari design, most of the updates here are quieter, behind-the-scenes features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="bVfAK1"&gt;They’re things that give you more options and ways to use your devices, but they’re just that — options. Focus modes are great for those who want to use them and integrate them into their workflow, but iOS doesn’t go out of its way to advertise them or push you to use them. It’s a mature way of looking at software, and one that’s nice to see, even if it means that iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 aren’t the most exciting updates ever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="TSDORv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; iOS 15 added the ability to have multiple app icons for a single app. This article originally stated that it was still not possible to do so. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
