    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;At launch, it’s a very hit or miss experience&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="AQSssp"&gt;Late on Monday night, Apple flipped the switch on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523228/apple-music-lossless-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-features"&gt;two new features for its Apple Music subscription service&lt;/a&gt;: immersive Dolby Atmos spatial audio and lossless-quality streaming. It feels like the company is really only excited about one of them, though, and it’s not the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N07Cwb"&gt;Eddy Cue is Apple’s senior vice president of services and the person who oversees Apple Music. He &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/streaming/9583947/apple-music-eddy-cue-spatial-audio-lossless-future-of-music/"&gt;didn’t mince words when he told &lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the sudden proliferation of lossless audio isn’t going to significantly evolve or change how we listen to music. “There’s no question it’s not going to be lossless,” he said when asked about what technologies will bring about the “next-gen” of music streaming. Cue firmly stands on the side of the crowd that argues most people can’t hear any difference between CD-quality or hi-res tracks and the AAC or MP3 files that’ve been filling their ears for so long now. He did acknowledge that the higher-bit rate tracks might matter to music lovers with particularly sharp hearing or premium audio equipment, but he was also direct about how niche that group is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jKCf33"&gt;“The reality of lossless is: if you take 100 people and you take a stereo song in lossless and you take a song that’s been in Apple Music that’s compressed, I don’t know if it’s 99 or 98 can’t tell the difference.” Cue revealed that he has regularly done blind tests with the Apple Music team, and they confirm how rare it is for anyone to be able to consistently recognize lossless audio. “You can tell somebody, ‘Oh, you’re listening to a lossless [song],’ and they tell you, ‘Oh, wow. That sounds incredible.’ They’re just saying it because you told them it’s lossless and it sounds like the right thing to say, but you just can’t tell.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fKbQBn"&gt;If you go by the message that Cue and Apple are pushing, the Dolby Atmos-powered spatial audio feature is where the true breakthrough is. “When I look at Dolby Atmos, I think it’s going to do for music what HD did for television,” Cue said in the &lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt; interview. And then he &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; went in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="UAmSeJ"&gt;“I think this is going to take over everything. It’s the way I want to listen to music when I’m in my car. It’s going to be the way I listen to music immediately with my AirPods. It’s going to be the way I listen to music in my house. In a way, it won’t feel very good when I’m listening to something that’s not Dolby Atmos because it’s so good. It’s like when I’m watching HD, it’s hard to go back.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="eqX3h9"&gt;“This requires somebody who’s a sound engineer, and the artist to sit back and listen, and really make the right calls and what the right things to do are,” Cue told &lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt; about mixing for spatial audio. “It’s a process that takes time, but it’s worth it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J5rpOU"&gt;Problem is, with much of the Dolby Atmos content on Apple Music I’ve sampled so far, it doesn’t seem like everyone is making those right calls. It’s a hit-or-miss game of exploration, and songs that truly showcase the immersive potential of Atmos are more often the exception than the rule. In many cases, spatial audio tracks have an artificial wideness to them, unfamiliar placement of vocals and instrumentation, and just sound… &lt;em&gt;off&lt;/em&gt;. Distant? Too reverb-y? Pick your preferred interpretation. Yet, Apple is so confident in Apple Music’s spatial audio that essentially overnight it became the default for millions of customers listening with AirPods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nue23S"&gt;But let’s back up a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xXic1j"&gt;What is spatial audio supposed to do for music?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="11yuxN"&gt;In a word, it’s all about immersion. Here’s how Cue hyped it: “it makes you feel like you’re onstage, standing right next to the singer, it makes you feel like you might be to the left of the drummer, to the right of the guitarist.” On its website, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-music%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22525028%2Fapple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple says&lt;/a&gt; “music created in Dolby Atmos is freed from channels, allowing artists to place individual sounds all around you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jfUQw4"&gt;Whoa there. Like all of Apple’s senior executives, Eddy Cue knows how to pitch something. But if you slap on your AirPods and expect to feel like an invisible person standing in the middle of a recording session, you’ll probably be underwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1RCDpv"&gt;When it’s done well, spatial audio does indeed give music a unique feeling of breadth. And it’s in a different way than a high-end pair of headphones might bring the most out of a stereo track’s soundstage. In particular, vocals often have a very distinct placement in the mix and cut through better than on traditional stereo tracks. That’s the most consistent advantage I’ve noticed with spatial audio music. But because of the different mix, you’ll very likely also pick up on details or sounds that ordinarily don’t stand out in the regular version of a song. And on the best Atmos tracks, everything has a lot more room to breathe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rw13aL"&gt;But when engineers don’t put much care into an Atmos mix, it really shows. Sometimes giving everything so much space can take the impact or crunch out of guitars. Or other aspects of a track fall flat. I’ve included just a few samples below where the spatial audio version of a song is an obvious downgrade from the original. But there are many, and when you hit a few in a row where the vocals sound weird or something’s amiss, it can detract from the listening experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="B3ZRod"&gt;How many songs are available in Dolby Atmos spatial audio?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WmlWUp"&gt;Apple currently isn’t providing a hard number, and is instead only saying that “thousands” of tracks are available with spatial audio at launch, with many more on the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uBiKGJ"&gt;How do I know when I’m hearing spatial audio on Apple Music?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="23SBGz"&gt;You’ll see either a Dolby Atmos or Dolby Audio logo appear on the Now Playing screen beneath the album artwork. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="o4yEjZ"&gt;A few random, good examples of Apple Music spatial audio:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="z57G7e"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Fus%2Falbum%2Fdont-know-why%2F728317060%3Fi%3D728317110&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22525028%2Fapple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Don’t Know Why” by Norah Jones&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;— This is one where I nearly buy into Cue’s description. Close your eyes, and you could almost transport yourself to a small club where the spread of this mix feels like a live version of Jones’ career-making hit. Stereo doesn’t take you to the same place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sPvVgB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Fus%2Falbum%2Fpaparazzi%2F1440818588%3Fi%3D1440818663&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22525028%2Fapple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Paparazzi” by Lady Gaga&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — With a very surround sound-esque mix (skip to the second verse at 1:23 for the best examples), this is a great example of an old pop hit with an excellent spatial audio treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j3pUlD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Fus%2Falbum%2Fboom%2F1445039970%3Fi%3D1445039972&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22525028%2Fapple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Boom” by Tiësto and Sevenn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — A fun, lively track that does give off a nice surround sound effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2NlV7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Fus%2Falbum%2Fblack-skinhead%2F1440873068%3Fi%3D1440873230&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22525028%2Fapple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Black Skinhead” by Kanye West&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — This one is another good example of the “beyond two-channel” openness that spatial audio can provide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gj4mdV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A whole lot of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Fus%2Fplaylist%2Fjazz-in-spatial-audio%2Fpl.efbd24628ff04ff3b5e416a6e237d753&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22525028%2Fapple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;jazz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Fus%2Fplaylist%2Fclassical-in-spatial-audio%2Fpl.ffea4bbea2d141cbb0ec67e32059b278&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22525028%2Fapple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;classical&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — If there are two genres that naturally lend themselves to spatial audio and Dolby Atmos, it’s jazz and classical. Orchestras can sound truly massive, and it’s a captivating way to listen to jazz ensembles where it’s easy to hear even the quietest notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="x9Wd0G"&gt;Other examples where it just sounds wrong&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LRYDOh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Fus%2Falbum%2Fbuddy-holly%2F1440878798%3Fi%3D1440879325&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22525028%2Fapple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Buddy Holly” by Weezer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — The guitars basically lose all life in this mix and vocals dominate the entire thing in a way that just sounds strange and bad. And yet this song is on Apple’s own playlist meant to showcase Atmos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zd7B49"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Fus%2Falbum%2Ffollow-your-arrow%2F1440858493%3Fi%3D1440858612&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22525028%2Fapple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Follow Your Arrow” by Kacey Musgraves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;— Apple mentioned Musgraves as an artist to check out with Atmos. And while her most recent album &lt;em&gt;Golden Hour&lt;/em&gt; sounds… fine… her breakthrough &lt;em&gt;Same Trailer Different Park&lt;/em&gt; is pretty rough in spatial audio format. “Follow Your Arrow” seems to lose most of its background vocals, and even the main guitar melody is way quieter here than in the regular mix. It almost comes off like a demo recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OJDOwx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Fus%2Falbum%2Fwhats-my-age-again%2F1440839912%3Fi%3D1440840493&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22525028%2Fapple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“What’s My Age Again?” by Blink 182&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — This is another song that Apple seems to think makes spatial audio sound good, but I’d strongly argue it does the opposite. Mark Hoppus’ muffled vocals legitimately sound like they were recorded through a phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3zkCdc"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Fus%2Falbum%2Falex-chilton%2F698654479%3Fi%3D698654487&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22525028%2Fapple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Alex Chilton” by The Replacements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — Is that enough cowbell for you during the chorus? It overpowers everything else and makes me feel like I’m in the old Christopher Walken &lt;em&gt;SNL&lt;/em&gt; skit, only with a different band. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2qTZ2"&gt;I’m curious to hear some of your examples that sound great, and others you’ve found that are a disappointment with Atmos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NQHaSb"&gt;Do I need AirPods or Beats headphones for Apple Music spatial audio?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="i47rdV"&gt;No. Apple Music’s spatial audio works on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="oCk9sW"&gt;All headphones and earbuds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ICjX4a"&gt;The loudspeakers on supported iPhones, iPads, and Macs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2KknA7"&gt;Apple TV 4K&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="qc9Feh"&gt;If you set Dolby Atmos to “always on” in settings for the Music app, you’ll see a pop-up advising that it probably won’t sound right on all speakers, but Apple Music will still play the spatial audio mix if that’s your preference. In fact, &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212182"&gt;Apple clearly states&lt;/a&gt; that you can “listen on any headphones” to Apple Music’s spatial audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="V229ep"&gt;How do I turn off Apple Music spatial audio if I don’t like it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5x0IvE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iOS and iPadOS:&lt;/strong&gt; Go to Settings &amp;gt; Music &amp;gt; Dolby Atmos (under “audio”), and there you can pick between automatic, always on, and off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PekaN7"&gt;If you’d prefer to leave Atmos on by default but want to quickly switch to a regular stereo version of any song that’s playing, just pull down Control Center, press and hold on the volume slider, and toggle off spatial audio. Apple Music will switch over to stereo. If you turn spatial audio back on, you’ll return to the Atmos track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Houvwm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;macOS: &lt;/strong&gt;In the Music app, open preferences and select the “playback” tab. Halfway down you’ll see an “audio quality” section and Atmos is in there. You get the same three automatic / always on / off choices as on Apple’s mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZeqbWk"&gt;Head tracking is coming to Apple Music spatial audio this fall&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="CGvFcb"&gt;Apple Music’s spatial audio is currently much different than the spatial audio experience you get when watching movies and TV shows on an iPhone or iPad. For videos, Apple includes a head-tracking feature that adjusts the sound placement as you turn your head to keep it anchored to the source device. This trick is exclusive to the AirPods lineup, but it’s a very impressive effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wONQz3"&gt;Apple has said it plans to bring this sound-changes-as-you-turn-your-head feature to Apple Music in the fall — likely with iOS 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="83be3G"&gt;Is this just a gimmick?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JqTPw8"&gt;That’s really the question that remains to be answered. But Apple isn’t alone in hyping multidimensional music (nor is it the first to do so). Amazon, Tidal, and others are also increasingly pushing the experience. I recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22360437/sony-srs-ra5000-speaker-review-360-audio-features"&gt;reviewed an extravagant Sony speaker&lt;/a&gt; that positions 360-degree audio as its main selling point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iIKRc0"&gt;Are people like Eddy Cue and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F06%2Fapple-musics-zane-lowe-explains-how-spatial-audio-will-transform-music%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22525028%2Fapple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zane Lowe&lt;/a&gt; right in their insistence that spatial audio will revolutionize how we consume music in the same way that stereo did? Or is this a gimmick like 3D TVs that will fizzle out and be forgotten within a few years? If it’s going to be the former, it’ll take a lot of work and creativity from artists, producers, and mixers to make this format shine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="92rz3E"&gt;Because right now, for every Atmos spatial audio track that’s a standout on Apple Music, there are a dozen others that are quite meh — or worse than in stereo. We’re still in the early days, and now that Atmos is officially part of Apple Music, hopefully the consistency will improve. When you do find those mixes where they totally nail it, it’s something special. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tKT9hC"&gt;Apple should make it easier to switch between Atmos and regular stereo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jV8qIF"&gt;But in the meantime, and to avoid turning people &lt;em&gt;off&lt;/em&gt; from Atmos when they land on a bad mix, Apple Music should make it easier to go back and forth between spatial audio and regular stereo tracks on a per-song basis. One solution could be displaying a choice when you tap on the Dolby icon, similar to the “go to artist / album” options that appear when tapping on an artist’s name. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Garmin Venu 2 review: sports and style</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The Venu 2 straddles the line between a lifestyle accessory and dedicated sport watch&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="ounJIj"&gt;In the great pantheon of gadgets we attach to our wrists, two categories have jumped to the front: smartwatches and sports watches. Smartwatches are sleek and more for the day-to-day, but they typically suffer horrible battery life. Sports watches are tougher, longer-lasting, and, well, sportier, but they tend to be big, bulky, and ugly. The Garmin Venu 2 is an attempt to close the gap between the two product categories — and while it isn’t perfect, it’s the closest anyone has come yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Za1lYj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10597404"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hG1CWK"&gt;Let’s start with the body. There are two sizes to choose from. The standard Venu 2 comes in at 45mm (1.77 inches), and the Venu 2S is 40mm (1.58 inches). Both watches cost the same $400 and are effectively identical, but the 2S has a slightly smaller screen (1.1 inches versus 1.3 inches) and a nominally shorter battery life. I thought the regular Venu 2 looked good on me, but smaller-wristed people should go for the S. Right up front, the watches have a bright and colorful OLED touchscreen. It’s sharp and clear, and I was able to clearly read it even in bright, direct sunlight while running. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tGK6nY"&gt;There are only two physical buttons, both on the right side of the watch. The top button is the activity start / stop button, and long-pressing will get you right to you a circle of shortcuts for settings and apps. The bottom button is the back button, but it also doubles as a manual lap / set trigger, and long-pressing will get you into your settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MpPxH3"&gt;The rest of the UI is navigated by touch, and it actually doesn’t suck! That may sound like a low bar to clear, but the vast majority of smartwatch user interfaces are objectively awful. In contrast, Garmin’s is simple and intuitive. It borrows heavily from its sports watches like the Fenix 6 and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22446410/garmin-enduro-review"&gt;Enduro&lt;/a&gt; — including its excellent widgets that provide just enough info — you just navigate it with a touchscreen now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_pEZXhc818_DvPfLw_8M63WmngI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22646080/20210603GarminVenu2_9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Venu 2 is sleeker and more understated than Garmin’s other watches, such as the Fenix 6 seen here on the right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JviyPx"&gt;The watch itself is understated and attractive. It’s low-profile enough that it doesn’t catch on sleeves, and you could even get away with wearing it for formal occasions. Changing straps is quick and easy; there are plenty of classy leather type options in addition to the typical workout-focused straps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2AP2lS"&gt;Fortunately, it’s outdoorsier than it looks. In addition to being waterproof to 5 atmospheres (about 164 feet), it has basically every sensor you could want, including: GPS and GLONASS for satellite positioning, a barometric altimeter for elevation, a compass for positioning, a gyroscope and accelerometer for motion tracking, a thermometer, ambient light sensor, a heart rate monitor, and pulse oximeter. All of those work very well. The heart rate monitor and pulse oximeter represent the first use of Garmin’s new Elevate V4 sensor suite, which has upgraded infrared sensors (as well as more sensors) for better accuracy. It tracked my runs and hikes accurately, and the heart rate monitor was almost as accurate as the chest strap I wore (the Wahoo Tickr, which also has been excellent in my testing). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I8JVcs"&gt;On the smartwatch side, the Venu 2 checks most of the boxes, though there’s nothing particularly revolutionary about it. It displays notifications from your smartphone, be it Android or iOS. If you’re using Android (I was testing with my trusty Google Pixel 5), you can quick-reply to text messages and other notifications (you can program your own quick-replies via the app), which is handy when a Yes / No / ”Call you back in a bit” will do. This works fine with texts, but when I tried this with Gmail messages, the replies never actually went through, despite it saying it had been sent on the watch screen. For what it’s worth, Apple would prefer you buy the Apple Watch, so it does not allow you to reply to text messages via any third-party watch, which is annoying. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P6Lga14CAxUDwKQozrBwt5A9Z7g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22646082/20210603GarminVenu2_7.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can reply to incoming messages from the Venu 2 — if you’re using with an Android phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nqaQNJ"&gt;The Venu 2 has an NFC radio and Garmin Pay, which allows you to store credit card info on the watch and tap to pay when you’re without your phone / wallet. It can also store music (there’s enough storage for up to 650 songs) and pair directly with Bluetooth earbuds. Getting the watch set up with Spotify was a bit of a pain, but once that was done, I was able to quickly download a whole playlist and head out sans phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ADlYOJ"&gt;While most smartwatches top out around a day of battery life (maybe two if you’re conservative), the Venu 2 boasts 11 days of battery life in smartwatch mode (10 days for the Venu 2S), which is excellent. Obviously, using the GPS for activity tracking will take a good bite out of that, and I always did a mix of both, but even with logging all of my GPS workouts, the battery never lasted less than eight days between charges. That ends up being a big deal for your 24 / 7 health tracking metrics. The Venu 2 has very detailed sleep tracking, as well as heart rate, respiration rate, and more, and it’s really nice to get a week-plus of uninterrupted measurements without having to worry about taking it off to charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D4MoVJ"&gt;It’s worth noting that there are some smartwatch features the Venu 2 does not have, which would be stock on something like Apple Watches or Google’s Wear OS. It doesn’t have any kind of voice assistant built in. In fact, it doesn’t even have a mic or a speaker, so there are no voice calls or voice commands. There are a lot of customizable watchfaces to choose from, and it can display your upcoming calendar events, but you can’t add or edit events from the watch. Basically, it’s smart-ish, but there are sacrifices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rfzA7muZB0Go456C1klNQmgrRaM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22646131/20210603GarminVenu2_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Venu 2 can coach you through a number of workouts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="G2nAgC"&gt;On the sports watch side, there are about 30 activities you can choose from, including running, walking, hiking, pool swim, strength training, snowboarding, skiing, and others, but it doesn’t come anywhere close to the offerings from most dedicated sports watches, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22446410/garmin-enduro-review"&gt;Garmin Enduro&lt;/a&gt; or Fenix 6. For example, there is no option for trail running, open water swimming, or surfing (which are some of my most common workouts), and there isn’t really a good reason why. The Venu 2 has all the necessary sensors, and it has plenty of storage for those tiny apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OYF9Ay"&gt;The Venu 2 also lacks not only maps but even a simple track-back feature for runs and hikes to help you find your way back to your starting point, something I sorely missed when I got lost on a run and ended up straining my knee while finding my way back. It does have a “Back to Start” feature, but that just tells you your distance back to your starting place and has an arrow to point you in the (allegedly) right direction. In practice, it’s essentially useless. Because it doesn’t display the path you took, the arrow would frequently lead me down dead-end streets. Often, it pointed in the exact opposite direction of where I started, even though the distance was consistent. This leads you to play colder / hotter as you’re trying to find your way back. It’s just bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NhfdynzEdqYiN94WwjFL5wJTCzg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22646135/20210604_081928.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Venu 2 has no onboard maps and its “Back to Start” breadcrumb feature does not work well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uSh5Gm"&gt;These are some big omissions in my book, and it seems like Garmin only made these choices because it doesn’t want to cannibalize its sales of its higher-end sports watches, which is extremely disappointing. This watch could attract far more people if it just included more apps. For me, the lack of my favorite workouts would be a deal-breaker, but that begs the question: who is this watch really intended for? It includes things like treadmill, indoor rowing, yoga, Pilates, stair stepper, and indoor climbing, but not kayaking or mountain biking. The watch also has downloadable HIIT and strength training workouts with a muscle map to show you what you’re going to work, clever animations to guide you, and automatic rep counting, but there is no attempt at outdoor route-finding or navigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rbmgdo"&gt;It seems like this watch is more aimed for city folk rather than those who want to get out in the dirt. Garmin effectively confirmed that to me, saying the Venu 2 was designed for more of an “active lifestyle” versus an adventure / outdoor customer in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ybcWb"&gt;If you look at the list of activities and you see that all of your favorites are covered, then this watch is liable to be an excellent workout companion for you. The smart features are nice, the battery life is fantastic, and the activity tracking is highly accurate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="HJtrex"&gt;But if you, like me, prefer to get your exercise out in nature, then it’s worth shelling out the extra money for a Fenix 6. It’s a real shame because this watch could have been great for both, and it would be a better fit for far more people if it just had more activity options. We’ll update this review if Garmin has a change of heart and fixes that with a software update, but I wouldn’t hold your meticulously tracked breath. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Is there any way out of Clearview’s facial recognition database?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of a metallic face with illustrative facial tracking points over it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_dX4etEinNW_ykrpAYwWF3uwNVY=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69417399/VRG_4614_8_ClearviewAI.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Maria Chimishkyan&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7Cy93x"&gt;In March 2020, two months after &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition.html?utm_source=Memberful&amp;amp;utm_campaign=41977c2de4-daily_update_2020_01_21&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_d4c7fece27-41977c2de4-111021813"&gt;exposed&lt;/a&gt; that Clearview AI had scraped billions of images from the internet to create a facial recognition database, Thomas Smith &lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/i-got-my-file-from-clearview-ai-and-it-freaked-me-out-33ca28b5d6d4"&gt;received a dossier&lt;/a&gt; encompassing most of his digital life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJIKP3"&gt;Using the recently enacted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21549514/california-prop-24-data-privacy-2020-election-andrew-yang"&gt;California Consumer Privacy Act&lt;/a&gt;, Smith asked Clearview for what they had on him. The company sent him pictures that spanned moments throughout his adult life: a photo from when he got married and started a blog with his wife, another when he was profiled by his college’s alumni magazine, even a profile photo from a Python coding meetup he had attended a few years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1809hX"&gt;“That’s what really threw me: All the things that I had posted to Facebook and figured, ‘Nobody’s going to ever look for that,’ and here it is all laid out in a database,” Smith told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lBSyey"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“All the things that I had posted to Facebook... here it is all laid out in a database”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BOSLo0"&gt;Clearview’s massive surveillance apparatus claims to hold 3 billion photos, accessible to any law enforcement agency with a subscription, and it’s likely you or people you know have been scooped up in the company’s dragnet. It’s known to have scraped sites like &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/clearview-ai-fbi-ice-global-law-enforcement"&gt;Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, and Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, and is able to use profile names and associated images to build a trove of identified and scannable facial images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VmqPOy"&gt;Little is known about the accuracy of Clearview’s software, but it appears to be powered by a massive trove of scraped and identified images, drawn from social media profiles and other personal photos on the public internet. That scraping is only possible because social media platforms like Facebook have consolidated immense amounts of personal data on their platforms, and then largely ignored the risks of large-scale data analysis projects like Clearview. It took Facebook until 2018 and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/10/17165130/facebook-cambridge-analytica-scandal"&gt;Cambridge Analytica scandal&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/facebook-news-data-scraping-mark-zuckerburg"&gt;lock down developer tools&lt;/a&gt; that could be used to exploit its users’ data. Even after the extent of Clearview’s scraping came to light, Facebook and other tech platforms’ reactions came largely in the form of strongly worded letters &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21126063/facebook-clearview-ai-image-scraping-facial-recognition-database-terms-of-service-twitter-youtube"&gt;asking Clearview to stop&lt;/a&gt; scraping their sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MdZHhF"&gt;But with large platforms unable or unwilling to go further, the average person on the internet is left with a difficult choice. Any new pictures that feature you, whether a simple Instagram shot or a photo tagged on a friend’s Facebook page, are potentially grist for the mill of a globe-spanning facial recognition system. But for many people, hiding our faces from the internet doesn’t feel like an option. These platforms are too deeply embedded in public life, and our faces are too central to who we are. The challenge is finding a way to share photos without submitting to the broader scanning systems — and it’s a challenge with no clear answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="58hqCc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They’ve put an end to privacy by obscurity”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6nIHdy"&gt;In some ways, this problem is much older than Clearview AI. The internet was built to facilitate the posting of public information, and social media platforms entrenched this idea; Facebook recruited a billion users between 2009 and 2014, when posting publicly on the internet was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/22/5739744/facebook-changes-default-privacy-of-posts-from-public-to-friends"&gt;its default setting&lt;/a&gt;. Others like YouTube, Twitter, and LinkedIn encourage public posting as a way for users to gain influence, contribute to global conversations, and find work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9bkSCZ"&gt;Historically, one person’s contribution to this unfathomable amount of graduation pics, vacation group shots, and selfies would have meant safety in numbers. You might see a security camera in a convenience store, but it’s unlikely anyone is actually watching the footage. But this kind of thinking is what Clearview thrives on, as automated facial recognition can now pick through this digital glut on the scale of the entire public internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SO0STu"&gt;“Even when the world involved a lot of surveillance cameras, there wasn’t a great way to analyze the data,” said Catherine Crump, professor at UC Berkeley’s School of Law. “Facial recognition technology and analytics generally have been so revolutionary because they’ve put an end to privacy by obscurity, or it seems they may soon do that.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C2FWsX"&gt;This means that you can’t rely on blending in with the crowd. The only way to stop Clearview from gathering your data is by not allowing it on the public internet in the first place. Facebook makes certain information public, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/203805466323736"&gt;without the option to make it private&lt;/a&gt;, like your profile picture and cover photo. Private accounts on Instagram also cannot hide profile pictures. If you’re worried about information being scraped from your Facebook or Instagram account, these are the first images to change. LinkedIn, on the other hand, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/public-profile/settings"&gt;allows you&lt;/a&gt; to limit the visibility of your profile picture to only people you’ve connected with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fR1NQS"&gt;Outside of Clearview, facial recognition search engines like &lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/this-simple-facial-recognition-search-engine-can-track-you-down-across-the-internet-518c7129e454"&gt;PimEyes&lt;/a&gt; have become popular tools accessible to anyone on the internet, and other enterprise facial recognition apps like &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2020/01/29/findface-rolls-out-huge-facial-recognition-surveillance-in-moscow-russia/"&gt;FindFace&lt;/a&gt; work with oppressive governments across the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="P7xfHI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;subtly altering the parts of an image that facial recognition relies on&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZeC0DS"&gt;Another key component to ensuring the privacy of those around you is to make sure you’re not posting pictures of others without consent. Smith, who requested his data from Clearview, was surprised at how many others had been scooped up in the database by just appearing in photos with him, like his friends and his college adviser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CHohtH"&gt;But since some images on the internet, like those on Facebook and Instagram, simply cannot be hidden, some AI researchers are exploring ways to “cloak” images to evade Clearview’s technology, as well as any other facial recognition technology trawling the open web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Usl9UE"&gt;In August 2020, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21353810/facial-recognition-block-ai-selfie-cloaking-fawkes"&gt;project called Fawkes&lt;/a&gt; released by the University of Chicago’s SAND Lab pitched itself as a potential antidote to Clearview’s pervasive scraping. The software works by subtly altering the parts of an image that facial recognition uses to discern one person from another, while trying to preserve how the image looks to humans. This exploit on an AI system is called an “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/2/16597276/google-ai-image-attacks-adversarial-turtle-rifle-3d-printed"&gt;adversarial attack&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ii1ZbY"&gt;Fawkes highlights the difficulty of designing technology that tries to hide images or limit the accuracy of facial recognition. Clearview draws on hundreds of millions of identities, so while individual users might be able to get some benefit from using the Windows and Mac app developed by the Fawkes team, the database won’t meaningfully suffer from a few hundred thousand fewer profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ExEByD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Evading Clearview will take more than just one technical fix&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3zgTMS"&gt;Ben Zhao, the University of Chicago professor who oversees the Fawkes project, says that Fawkes works only if people are diligent about cloaking all of their images. It’s a big ask, since users would have to juggle multiple versions of every photo they share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OyMk9C"&gt;On the other hand, a social media platform like Facebook could tackle the scale of Clearview by integrating a feature like Fawkes into its photo uploading process, though that would simply shift which company has access to your unadulterated images. Users would then have to trust Facebook to not use that access to now-proprietary data for their own ad targeting or other tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VpsA4G"&gt;Zhao and other privacy experts agree that adversarial tricks like Fawkes aren’t a silver bullet that will be used to defeat coordinated scraping campaigns, even those for facial recognition databases. Evading Clearview will take more than just one technical fix or privacy checkup nudge on Facebook. Instead, platforms will need to rethink how data is uploaded and maintained online, and which data can be publicly accessed at all. This would mean fewer public photos and fewer opportunities for Clearview to add new identities to its database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zG6Z2H"&gt;Jennifer King, privacy and data policy fellow at Stanford’s Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence, says one approach is for data to be automatically deleted after a certain amount of time. Part of what makes services like Snapchat more private (when &lt;a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/snapchat-privacy-settings-you-need-to-change-to-secure-your-account/"&gt;set up properly&lt;/a&gt;) than Facebook or Instagram is its dedication to short-lived media posted mainly to small, trusted groups of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Oe4XA"&gt;Laws in some states and countries are also starting to catch up with privacy threats online. These laws circumvent platforms like Facebook and instead demand accountability from the companies actually scraping the data. The California Consumer Privacy Act allows residents to ask for a copy of the data that companies like Clearview have on them, and similar provisions exist in the European Union. Some laws mandate that the data must be deleted at the user’s request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dykZuN"&gt;But King notes that just because the data is deleted once doesn’t mean the company can’t simply grab it again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="60qe6P"&gt;“It’s not a permanent opt-out,” she said. “I’m concerned that you execute that ‘delete my data’ request on May 31st, and on June 1st, they can go back to collecting your data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X8oORo"&gt;So if you’re going to lock down your online presence, make sure to change your privacy settings and remove as many images as possible before asking companies to delete your data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nNTdM7"&gt;But ultimately, to prevent bad actors like Clearview from obtaining data in the first place, users are at the mercy of social media platforms’ policies. After all, it’s the current state of privacy settings that has allowed a company like Clearview to exist at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tkc9CP"&gt;“There’s a lot you can do to safeguard your data or claw it back, but ultimately, for there to be change here, it needs to happen collectively, through legislation, through litigation, and through people coming together and deciding what privacy should look like,” Smith said. “Even people coming together and saying to Facebook, ‘I need you to protect my data more.’”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden revokes Trump bans on TikTok and WeChat</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-POLITICS-BIDEN-HEALTH-VIRUS-AID" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jw7wWzalXQmK2iN_5KOdoBZBzdI=/0x1:5708x3806/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69427579/1231650547.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d1IX7x"&gt;President Joe Biden signed an executive order Wednesday revoking the Trump-era bans on TikTok and WeChat. In place of the Trump order, Biden will direct the commerce secretary to investigate apps with ties to foreign adversaries that may pose a risk to American data privacy or national security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="98Se4T"&gt;The order takes the place of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/10/21358505/trump-tiktok-wechat-tencent-bytedance-china-ban-executive-order-legal-sanctions-rules"&gt;a series&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215961/trump-executive-order-prohibiting-transactions-eight-chinese-apps-alipay-tencent-qq-wechat-pay"&gt;executive orders&lt;/a&gt; instituted by President Trump last year, which blocked apps like TikTok, WeChat, and Alipay from US app stores and took further measures to prevent them from operating in the US. The most extreme effects of those orders were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22160239/tiktok-ban-judge-trump-administration-us-commerce-department"&gt;forestalled by ongoing court challenges&lt;/a&gt;, but Wednesday’s order will revoke the orders outright. Instead, Biden’s order will institute a new framework for determining the national security risks of transactions that involve apps that are connected to the governments or militaries of foreign adversaries, like China, or collect sensitive data from US consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iNveEr"&gt;TikTok and WeChat did not immediately respond to a request for comment by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3maa05"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The CFIUS action remains under active discussion by the US government”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RTLhG0"&gt;“The administration is committed to promoting an open, interoperable, reliable, and secure internet and to protecting human rights online and offline, and to supporting a vibrant global digital economy,” a senior administration official said Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1DlPdG"&gt;“The challenge that we’re addressing with this EO is that certain countries, including China, do not share these commitments or values and are instead working to leverage digital technologies and American data in ways that present unacceptable national security risks,” the official continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QKi1jY"&gt;Wednesday’s order calls on the Commerce Department and other federal agencies to work together to craft recommendations to protect against the collection, sale, and transfer of sensitive US consumer data to foreign adversaries. The Commerce Department is expected to then make recommendations for future executive actions or legislation to address these concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDSNug"&gt;Still, the order does not address actions or investigations taken by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS. Under the Trump administration, CFIUS set several deadlines for apps like TikTok to divest itself from its Chinese owner ByteDance. For several months, Oracle was reportedly set to purchase TikTok in order to stave off the former administration’s ban, although the deal never came to fruition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0BubeQ"&gt;“The CFIUS action remains under active discussion by the US government,” a senior administration official said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WVITSf"&gt;Wednesday’s order is just the latest move from the Biden administration to address challenges posed by China. Last week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22516719/biden-executive-order-american-investment-chinese-firms-huawei-zte"&gt;Biden signed a separate order&lt;/a&gt; expanding a Trump-era ban on American investment in Chinese companies with alleged ties to China’s military. The order laid out 59 companies barred from investment, including those that create and deploy surveillance technology used against Muslim minorities and government dissidents in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tIStf4"&gt;A senior administration official said Wednesday to expect additional actions against China as Biden &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/09/us/politics/biden-europe-g7.html"&gt;makes his first trip in office&lt;/a&gt; to meet with leaders of the Group of 7 nations, NATO, and the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UVJSwU"&gt;The latest Apple Watch model is $70 off at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1742942349565041958#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-40mm-Blue-Aluminum-Case-with-Deep-Navy-Sport-Band-Regular%2F435851135%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-40mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5RBMRN/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. You can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch Series 6&lt;/a&gt; in the color of your choice starting at $329 for the 40mm GPS model or $359 for the 44mm version. As usual, Best Buy has the biggest selection of colors in both sizes as well as the advantage of being able to pick up your order in-store at your convenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1oOE0i"&gt;Depending on the color you’re after, this is likely the cheapest that the one you want has been. The red Series 6 has been the lone colorway to have seen even better discounts before, including one in late April that saw it selling for just $249.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="z9qWtT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="MYwuDS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10598305"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xNYHsE"&gt;LG’s 32-inch 1440p gaming monitor with a 165Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and AMD FreeSync Premium &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08LLF9NS1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costs $297 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a great deal for a big monitor that’s capable of fast refresh rates for PC gaming as well as console gaming on the Xbox Series X. PC can take full advantage of its 165Hz refresh rate over DisplayPort, but it tops out at 144Hz in QHD on Series X via HDMI (assuming you have the right cable, which this monitor doesn’t include). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PUqUeN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10598341"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5mz1Gi"&gt;Prime members can get a home security bundle at Amazon containing its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22429549/amazon-echo-show-8-5-camera-update-price-kids-edition" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;brand-new Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; with an improved built-in camera and two Blink Outdoor 2 security cameras &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08ZN8JP3G/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $115&lt;/a&gt;. It’s another one of Amazon’s pre-Prime Day 2021 deals that Prime members can snag ahead of the big shopping event that starts on June 21st and lasts through June 22nd. This new Echo Show 5 usually costs $85 by itself, and the camera kit is priced at $180, so you’re getting a great deal here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use a two-factor security key</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of a key ring with a regular house hold type key, small flash drive, and a key that has the connector of a flash drive all on the ring.

  &lt;p id="sxRuF1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22215571/factor-authentication-2fa-apple-microsoft-google-how-to"&gt;Two-factor authentication&lt;/a&gt; is a good way to add an extra layer of security to online accounts. It requires the use of your smartphone, however, which is not only inconvenient, but can be a problem if your phone is lost or breached. Hardware security keys can offer an additional layer of security to password-protected online accounts and, in turn, your identity. They’re also not hard to install. Here’s how to set them up for your Google account, Facebook, and Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="meYeBu"&gt;Security keys can connect to your system using USB-A, USB-C, Lightning, or NFC, and they’re small enough to be carried on a keychain (with the exception of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yubico.com%2Fproduct%2Fyubikey-5c-nano%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22458935%2Ftwo-factor-security-key-how-to-yubico" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Yubico’s 5C Nano key&lt;/a&gt;, which is so small that it’s safest when kept in your computer’s USB port). They use a variety of authentication standards: FIDO2, U2F, smart card, OTP, and OpenPGP 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u4lNXQ"&gt;When you insert a security key into your computer or connect one wirelessly, your browser issues a challenge to the key, which includes the domain name of the specific site you are trying to access. The key then cryptographically signs and allows the challenge, logging you in to the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gZwZKK"&gt;Many sites support U2F security keys, including Twitter, Facebook, Google, Instagram, GitHub, Dropbox, Electronic Arts, Epic Games, Microsoft account services, Nintendo, Okta, and Reddit. The best thing to do is to check the website of your security key of choice and see which services are supported — for example, here’s a link to the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yubico.com%2Fworks-with-yubikey%2Fcatalog%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22458935%2Ftwo-factor-security-key-how-to-yubico" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;apps supported by YubiKeys&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="MHEFjG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to set up two-factor authentication on all your online accounts","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/17/15772142/how-to-set-up-two-factor-authentication"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="K86EvZ"&gt;A setup process is necessary before you can use a security key. After that, securely accessing your online profile on a site is a simple matter of entering your password, inserting the key, and tapping the button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mulK53"&gt;Keep in mind that you can’t copy, migrate, or save security-key data between keys (even if the keys are the same model). That is by design, so keys can’t be easily duplicated and used elsewhere. If you lose your security key, you can use two-factor authentication on your cellphone or an authenticator app. Then, if you want to use a new key, you will have to go through the process of reauthorizing your accounts all over again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Vmb5YQ"&gt;Which security key should I use?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="u1XD6d"&gt;Several brand choices are available. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yubico.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22458935%2Ftwo-factor-security-key-how-to-yubico" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Yubico&lt;/a&gt;, one of the developers of the FIDO U2F authentication standard, sells several different versions. Google sells its own U2F key, &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/titan_security_key?hl=en-US"&gt;called the Titan&lt;/a&gt;, which comes in three versions: USB-C, USB-A / NFC, or Bluetooth / NFC / USB. Other U2F keys include Kensington’s USB-A &lt;a href="https://www.kensington.com/en-ca/p/products/data-protection/biometric/kensington-verimark-fingerprint-key-supporting-windows-hello-fido-u2f-for-universal-2nd-factor-/"&gt;fingerprint-supporting key&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://thetis.io/#home-faq"&gt;Thetis USB-A key&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X0AaYF"&gt;For this how-to, we used the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yubico.com%2Fproduct%2Fyubikey-5-nfc%2F%23yubikey-5-nfc&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22458935%2Ftwo-factor-security-key-how-to-yubico" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;YubiKey 5C NFC&lt;/a&gt; security key, which fits into a USB-C port but also works with phones via NFC. The process is pretty similar for all hardware security keys, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="257sw8"&gt;Pairing a key with your Google account&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4zm2Hh"&gt;In order to use a security key with your Google account (or any account), you need to have already set up two-factor authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="2O2Qws"&gt;Log in to your Google account, and select your profile icon in the upper-right corner. Then choose “Manage your Google Account.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HyBFWy"&gt;In the left-hand menu, click on “Security.” Scroll down until you see “Signing in to Google.” Click on the “2-step Verification” link. At this point, you may need to sign in to your account again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Go to “Security” &amp;amp;gt; “Signing in to Google” &amp;amp;gt; “2-step Verification.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FeuSbM5nu16LmDBRQxP83_JdasU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/14156594/Google_setup_for_security_key.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go to “Security” &amp;gt; “Signing in to Google” &amp;gt; “2-step Verification.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="QbRkUc"&gt;Scroll down until you see the “Add more second steps to verify it’s you” heading. Look for the “Security Key” option and click on “Add Security Key.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jLZnSn"&gt;A pop-up box will list your options, which include devices that have built-in security keys and the option to use an external security key. Select “USB or Bluetooth / External security key.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gAP2bQ"&gt;You’ll see a box telling you to make sure the key is nearby but not plugged in. You’ll also see an option to use only the security key as part of Google’s Advanced Protection Program (which is for users with “&lt;a href="https://landing.google.com/advancedprotection/"&gt;high visibility and sensitive information&lt;/a&gt;”). Assuming you don’t fall into that category, click “Next.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TlLpJF"&gt;The next box lets you register your security key. Insert your key into your computer port. Press the button on the key, then click “Allow” once you see the Chrome pop-up asking to read the make and model of your key. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AEbekp"&gt;Give your key a name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VdnTXx"&gt;Now you’re set! You can come back to your Google account’s 2FA page to rename or remove your key. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="c62Wla"&gt;Pairing a key with your Twitter account&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="P9Gc5P"&gt;Log in to your Twitter account and click on “More” in the left-hand column. Select “Settings and privacy” from the menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="02FoY7"&gt;Under the “Settings” heading, select “Security and account access” &amp;gt; “Security” &amp;gt; “Two-factor authentication.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1v5jOa"&gt;You’ll see three choices: “Text message,” “Authentication app,” and “Security key.” Click on “Security key.” You’ll probably be asked for your password at this point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NuGHt2"&gt;Select “Start.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Once your security key is registered, you receive a just-in-case backup code (deleted here)." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PPBV9TQmyzR6VScuN6MgJ51oTCk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22553159/Screen_Shot_2021_06_01_at_4.37.21_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once your security key is registered, you receive a just-in-case backup code (deleted here).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="TusM7s"&gt;Insert your security key into your computer’s port, then press the key’s button. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EaDJjV"&gt;The window should refresh to say, “Security key found.” Type in a name for your key and click “Next.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IBzlD3"&gt;The window will now read “You’re all set.” It will also give you a single-use backup code to use if you don’t have access to any of your other log-in methods. Copy that code and put it somewhere safe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zPGk6o"&gt;If you’ve changed your mind and want to remove the security key, go back to the “Two-factor authentication” page and select “Manage security keys.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OXnh27"&gt;Click on the name of the key, and then choose “Delete key.” You’ll need to enter your password and verify that you want to delete the key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UbSacP"&gt;Pairing a key with your Facebook account&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="FOGyWg"&gt;Log in to your Facebook account. Click on the triangle icon on the upper-right corner and select “Settings &amp;amp; Privacy” &amp;gt; “Settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zhCCUN"&gt;Now you’re at “General Account Settings.” Select the “Security and Login” link from the left sidebar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0uGwMT"&gt;Scroll down until you see the section labeled “Two-Factor Authentication.” Click “Edit” on the “Use two-factor authentication” option. You may be asked for your password.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="x0xxlW"&gt;If you don’t have 2FA set up, you’ll be given three choices: “Authentication App,” “Text Message (SMS),” and “Security Key.” It’s recommended that you use an authenticator app as your primary security, but if you prefer, you can just click on “Security Key.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can use a security key as your main authentication method." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z_P-GuUNQn3T0vhk0Oj4luUo024=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22554571/Screen_Shot_2021_06_02_at_9.43.00_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can use a security key as your main authentication method.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="SSAniS"&gt;If you do have 2FA set up, then you’ll find the “Security Key” option under “Add a Backup Method.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iZTKTe"&gt;Either way, you’ll get a pop-up box; click on “Register Security Key.” You’ll be instructed to insert your security key and press its button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zjPPTR"&gt;And that’s it. If you don’t use 2FA, you’ll now be asked for the security key if you log in from an unrecognized device or browser. If you do, you can use your key if you don’t have access to your authentication app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vhQUMe"&gt;If you no longer want to use the key, go back to “Two-Factor Authentication,” find “Security Key” under “Your Security Method,” and click on “Manage my keys.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Fastly claims single customer responsible for widespread internet outage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Media And Government Websites Temporarily Offline" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J0-xBQr-EA6hjNCRfvYlkAxq95w=/5x0:5189x3456/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69427364/1322484486.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Leon Neal/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JPlO7Q"&gt;The Fastly content delivery network (CDN) — a major middleman in internet traffic — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523953/twitch-reddit-down-fastly-outage-issues"&gt;took a nap for around an hour early Tuesday morning&lt;/a&gt;, and effectively knocked a huge number of major websites offline in the process. The company is now claiming the issue stemmed from a bug and one customer’s configuration change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dA7Bvz"&gt;“We experienced a global outage due to an undiscovered software bug that surfaced on June 8 when it was triggered by a valid customer configuration change,” Nick Rockwell, the company’s SVP of engineering and infrastructure wrote &lt;a href="https://www.fastly.com/blog/summary-of-june-8-outage"&gt;in a blog&lt;/a&gt; post last night. “This outage was broad and severe, and we’re truly sorry for the impact to our customers and everyone who relies on them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="meMbgq"&gt;Apparently, whatever the request was, it triggered a bug that had only been introduced to Fastly’s systems by an update in mid-May. Clearly the fault lies with Fastly for not catching that it borked its own code, but we have to ask: Who did it? Valid change or no, some specific, unnamed customer triggered the bug. It’s obvious why Fastly has not named the customer or the exact set of circumstances that created this undesirable outcome, but we just want to know: What does it feel like to take down half the internet by accident?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bpR8Ih"&gt;And on the off chance it wasn’t an accident... please spare &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; next time.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto G Stylus 5G features a 6.8-inch screen and a large 5,000mAh battery.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Motorola&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9MXtRt"&gt;Motorola has announced the Moto G Stylus 5G, a new version of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311690/motorola-moto-g-stylus-2021-review-price-specs"&gt;very good, non-5G budget-friendly stylus phone&lt;/a&gt;. It offers broadly similar hardware to the 4G version, with notable exceptions in the new Snapdragon 480 5G chipset with sub-6GHz 5G connectivity and a bigger 5,000mAh battery. Priced at $399, it’s at the higher end of the budget range and will go on sale June 14th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rH8DV4"&gt;Like its 4G peer, the G Stylus 5G features a large 6.8-inch 1080p screen, ready for your notes and doodles courtesy of a built-in stylus. It includes 4GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and ships with Android 11. There’s a 3.5mm headphone jack, and a charging brick is included in the box. The Stylus 5G is a little bigger and heavier than the 4G version, but not by much — it’s about four grams heavier and 0.3mm thicker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iVBHoG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10597540"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZSK7b6"&gt;The G Stylus 5G offers a rear triple-camera array that’s very similar to the 4G G Stylus’, with a 48-megapixel f/1.7 standard wide, 8-megapixel ultrawide, and 5-megapixel macro, plus a 2-megapixel depth sensor. Around front, there’s a 16-megapixel selfie camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IitoSD"&gt;The G Stylus 5G isn’t the most aggressively priced 5G phone in the budget market. OnePlus says its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522711/oneplus-n200-5g-specs-screen-price"&gt;upcoming N200 5G&lt;/a&gt; will cost less than $250, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22370189/samsung-galaxy-a52-a42-a32-5g-a12-a02s-price-specs-price"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy A32 5G&lt;/a&gt; is currently selling for $279. It’s also surprising to see the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22204586/qualcomm-snapdragon-480-5g-android-smartphone-price"&gt;Snapdragon 480 5G chipset&lt;/a&gt; used here, since it’s intended for more affordable 5G devices well under the Stylus 5G’s $400 price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aaIEjl"&gt;On the other hand, the G Stylus 5G is quite a bit cheaper than the other prominent 5G phone with a built-in stylus, the $999 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21506471/samsung-galaxy-note-20-review-price-stylus"&gt;Galaxy Note 20&lt;/a&gt;, if you want to look at things that way.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The classic Simpsons arcade cabinet is getting rereleased thanks to Arcade1Up</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mb-qEnQ9OvGZ78uNVN_dMR5WeV0=/0x148:1400x1081/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69427226/The_Simpsons_Lifestyle__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arcade1Up’s &lt;/em&gt;The Simpsons &lt;em&gt;arcade machine.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Arcade1Up&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uVzVNb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Simpsons &lt;/em&gt;arcade game, a classic four-player brawler that I personally spent an untold amount of quarters on growing up, is getting a rerelease in celebration of the game’s 30th anniversary thanks to Arcade1Up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jYFfc7"&gt;In the game, which was first released by Konami in 1991, you and up to three of your friends fight waves of oncoming baddies as Homer, Marge, Bart, or Lisa Simpson in a quest to save Maggie. I always liked &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/-BFYzVNgRRQ"&gt;playing as Bart&lt;/a&gt; because you traveled around on your skateboard &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; used it as a weapon, which I thought was the coolest thing ever when I was a kid. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BzUjHw5T67vqdJOaB5naBUF1jMU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22646312/Simpsons__5_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Arcade1Up&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m not sure I’d put this right next to a couch, personally.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qsBD4B"&gt;If you decide to get the machine, you should know that it actually comes with &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; games: &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt; and a bonus game that will be announced when preorders start on July 15th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kfFfyg"&gt;Arcade1Up hasn’t announced pricing for the cabinet, but the company’s four-player &lt;em&gt;NBA Jam&lt;/em&gt; machine &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Ftoys-collectibles%2Fcollectibles%2Fseasonal-items-novelty-gifts%2Fproducts%2Fnba-jam-wi-fi-enabled-arcade-cabinet-with-riser-and-stool%2F11100302.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costs $499.99 from GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s possible &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt; could be similarly priced. While that might seem expensive, vintage arcade cabinets can cost thousands of dollars, so Arcade1Up’s rerelease could be a comparably affordable way to get &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt; machine for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti review: a loss to AMD</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A solid 1440p card, but only entry-level 4K&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="xV8vq7"&gt;When I reviewed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21534142/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-review"&gt;Nvidia’s RTX 3070 last year&lt;/a&gt;, I called it the sweet spot for 1440p gaming. At $499, it arrived as a more budget-friendly option for those not ready to move to 4K. Now, Nvidia has another option: the $599 RTX 3070 Ti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x6cbB1"&gt;Compared to the standard version, the RTX 3070 Ti has been redesigned and comes with 8GB of newer and more efficient GDDR6X RAM instead of GDDR6. Like all of Nvidia’s 30-series cards, the RTX 3070 Ti also supports ray tracing and AI-powered DLSS technology to improve frame rates and maintain image quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="An2n21"&gt;The bump to performance is small, though. I spent the last week testing out the RTX 3070 Ti at both 1440p and 4K, and in most titles, it falls behind &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21572796/amd-radeon-rx-6800-review-4k-gaming-test-benchmarks"&gt;AMD’s cheaper RX 6800&lt;/a&gt; card. I wasn’t expecting the RTX 3070 Ti to come close to the RTX 3080, but there’s a big enough performance gap here where it makes more sense to buy AMD’s RX 6800 or be willing to pay extra for the RTX 3080.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2W4HD"&gt;None of this pricing really matters, though. We’re in the middle of a global chip shortage that’s driving GPU prices to ridiculous levels way beyond $1,000 a card. You’ll probably end up buying whatever GPU is available to buy at your ideal price point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ky3ivY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10597382"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="onjV0a"&gt;Hardware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="sfgoEx"&gt;Nvidia has turned the RTX 3070 Ti into what looks like a smaller version of the RTX 3080. It’s a design bump over the RTX 3070, which results in the 3070 Ti being slightly longer and requiring more power. The RTX 3070 Ti has one fan on either side of the card, with a push-pull system in place. The bottom fan pulls cool air into the card, which then exhausts on the opposite side that’s closest to your CPU cooler and rear case fan. A traditional blower cooler also exhausts the hot air out of the PCIe slot at the back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AmFmrj"&gt;It’s the same system found on the RTX 3080, and it keeps the RTX 3070 Ti humming along quietly. Just like the RTX 3070 before it, Nvidia is using its new 12-pin single power connector. It’s designed to replace existing 6- or 8-pin connectors, and there’s an adapter in the box. Due to the new power requirements, you’ll need to use two single 8-pin connectors with the adapter. I’d highly recommend just getting a single new cable (they’re around $20) from your PSU supplier to connect directly to this card, as it’s way less clunky than the included adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/COGhx0VuigFq6wgi2BvIbTw4AMY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645494/twarren_20210607_4625_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The RTX 3070 Ti looks more like a RTX 3080.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cgV6HW"&gt;The RTX 3070 Ti has all the ports you’d expect to find on a modern GPU. There’s a single HDMI 2.1 port and three DisplayPort 1.4a ports. While the RTX 3070 design was simple, I much prefer the look of the 3070 Ti. It doesn’t have light-up LEDs like the RTX 3080, but it still looks great inside a case with a window.&lt;/p&gt;

The RTX 3070 Ti pulls up to 290 watts by itself, a more than 30 percent jump over the RTX 3070. This also means Nvidia is recommending a 750W power supply here, instead of the 650W requirement for the RTX 3070. That pushes the 3070 Ti up to the same power supply requirements as the RTX 3090, even though it consumes far less power. It’s a big jump considering the RTX 2070 only needed a 550W power supply.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The RTX 3070 Ti and RTX 3070.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zkzT01"&gt;1440p testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="rBTfbO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10528861"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5bOs47"&gt;I’ve been testing the RTX 3070 Ti with Intel’s latest Core i9 processor. For 1440p tests, I’ve also paired the GPU with a 32-inch Samsung Odyssey G7 monitor. This monitor supports refresh rates up to 240Hz, as well as Nvidia’s G-Sync technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qhyQ2a"&gt;I compared the RTX 3070 Ti with the previous RTX 3070, the RTX 3080, and AMD’s RX 6800 to figure out where it fits into the $599 price point. I tested a variety of AAA titles, including &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Control, Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Metro Exodus&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, and many more. You can also find the same games tested at 4K resolution below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AgzD1Z"&gt;All games were tested at max or ultra settings on the RTX 3070 Ti, and nearly all of them comfortably exceeded 60fps, with some reaching 100fps and beyond. &lt;em&gt;Gears 5&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; saw the biggest gains over the RTX 3070 here, with more than 10 percent improvement each. But &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt; were the same or very close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qdvFeh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10597405"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eoO0c2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt; were the best performing games at 1440p, and with DLSS enabled, both exceeded 150fps averages. The RTX 3070 Ti is extremely capable at 1440p, and if you’re willing to lower settings in favor of high frame rates, then this card will pair very well with 144Hz or faster monitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oPgc4W"&gt;Where the RTX 3070 Ti really disappoints is when you compare it to the AMD competition. AMD’s RX 6800 beats the RTX 3070 Ti in nearly every game at 1440p, with &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Metro Exodus&lt;/em&gt; being the rare exceptions. Some of AMD’s beats here are significant, with &lt;em&gt;Gears 5&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; both seeing more than 20 percent performance increases. I tested all cards with Nvidia’s Resizable Bar enabled and AMD’s Smart Access Memory enabled. Both are identical technologies designed to boost frame rates, and it’s clear certain games favor AMD’s card here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HNicSMTpG1jZXmFSUfS-ijEJP4I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645495/twarren_20210607_4625_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The RTX 3070 Ti uses a push-pull cooling method.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1M5c75"&gt;4K testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="SPiIye"&gt;Over on the 4K side, performance is less impressive. I used Acer’s 27-inch Nitro XV273K, a 4K monitor that offers up to 144Hz refresh rates and G-Sync support for all of the testing. None of the games came close to maxing out the 144Hz refresh rate, and if you really want high frame rate 4K gaming, then you’ll need an RTX 3080 or RTX 3080 Ti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5qPYw"&gt;Only half of the games I tested managed to hit 60fps or beyond at 4K, and you’ll need to drop settings to high or mid levels to achieve playable frame rates. Like always, DLSS helps, but ray tracing alone is too much for this card at 4K. &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt; ran at just 10fps and was unplayable at ultra settings and with ray tracing on. DLSS helped bump that to a slightly more playable 26fps, but that’s still not a very smooth experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RYgQyI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10597408"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UPXPoZ"&gt;Much like at 1440p, AMD also beats Nvidia here with the RX 6800. &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt; all manage more than 20 percent improvements over the RTX 3070 Ti. Where the RTX 3070 Ti really excels against AMD is when you enable DLSS, but with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22462659/amd-dlss-fidelityfx-super-resolution-fsr-supersampling-release-date"&gt;AMD’s answer to DLSS&lt;/a&gt; arriving later this month, that could soon change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6niyes"&gt;Some of the gaps in performance between the RTX 3070 Ti and RX 6800 are likely down to AMD’s Smart Access Memory performing well in certain titles, compared to Nvidia’s more limited Resizable BAR support. I also noticed during &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt; tests that the average frame rate varied heavily during tests, in what could be some type of driver or game bug. Nvidia is currently investigating whether this is a bug or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dHml5jxsunJVvSFwvvWLPXoG1BI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645492/twarren_20210607_4625_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nvidia’s RTX 3070 Ti keeps quiet during demanding games.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hEDBhm"&gt;With a $599 retail price, I was expecting more from the RTX 3070 Ti. AMD’s RX 6800 is still technically priced lower than the RTX 3070 Ti, and my tests showed it surprisingly outperformed the Nvidia card. On the Nvidia side, you get the addition of DLSS and with that better ray-tracing performance if you couple them together. Nvidia’s NVENC and professional tooling support is also extremely useful if you’re video editing or streaming to Twitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5BzMyR"&gt;But for games, AMD’s RX 6800 takes the edge at this price point. Nvidia’s RTX 3070 Ti also only ships with 8GB of VRAM, compared to the 16GB found on the RX 6800. I can’t help but feel like 8GB will be challenging at some point during the lifetime of this card, so it’s a shame Nvidia only bumped the memory spec and not the size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uusm0y"&gt;Not that the retail pricing of either card really matters right now. The chances are very slim that you’ll be able to find the RX 6800 or RTX 3070 Ti in stock this week. That means, once again, the best GPU you can buy right now is often whatever you can actually buy.&lt;/p&gt;
