    <title>Luminar’s LIDAR will take flight in new partnership with Airbus</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YfPgSq"&gt;Luminar, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/24/21398974/luminar-lidar-startup-spac-ipo-reverse-merge-blank-check"&gt;newly public&lt;/a&gt; LIDAR company, is teaming up with the largest aircraft manufacturer in the world to bring its laser-guided mapping and perception technology to new heights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nYmUzu"&gt;LIDAR, the laser sensor that sends millions of laser points out per second and measures how long they take to bounce back, is seen as a key ingredient to autonomous driving. But it hasn’t seen as much traction in the world of aviation. Luminar and its new partner, the French aerospace giant Airbus, are out to fix that by applying the laser sensor’s 3D mapping capabilities to the aerospace company’s helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft in the hopes of making flying a lot safer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CGg3Mf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“making overall transportation safe and autonomous”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mFrA9Z"&gt;Specifically, Luminar’s work with Airbus will fall under the aircraft manufacturer’s two innovation-focused projects: its &lt;a href="https://www.airbus.com/innovation/innovation-ecosystem/airbus-upnext.html"&gt;UpNext subsidiary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.airbus.com/innovation/innovation-ecosystem/airbus-flightlab.html"&gt;FlightLab&lt;/a&gt;, which uses flight testing as the “principal means of achieving proof of concept for a variety of future technologies developed at Airbus.” Engineers from both companies will work together to “enhance sensing, perception, and system-level capabilities to ultimately enable safe, autonomous flight,” the companies said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvNVn8"&gt;This will be Luminar’s first foray into anything outside the world of autonomous vehicles, Austin Russell, the founder and CEO of Luminar, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Russell said he sees linking up with Airbus as an extension of his mission of “making overall transportation safe and autonomous — it’s the same exact story.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IrbKm4"&gt;While the number of airplanes that crash every year has been steadily dropping, helicopter crashes — like the one that killed NBA star Kobe Bryant in 2020 — are becoming more common. The rate of fatal helicopter accidents per 100,000 flight hours jumped from 2016 to 2018, according to data &lt;a href="https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/general-aviation/2019-03-05/fatal-helicopter-accident-rate-climbing"&gt;released in March 2019 by the US Helicopter Safety Team&lt;/a&gt;, a volunteer team of government and industry leaders. The number of fatalities per 100,000 hours also rose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBj7wj"&gt;Russell is convinced that Luminar can help prevent some of those fatal crashes. “A double-digit percentage of helicopter crashes happen by just landing on things like wires that are totally avoidable,” he said. “If you can actually just have a 3D map and see what’s going on hidden underneath you would be an improvement. Even some of the best pilots have a hard time being able to see these kinds of things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ahlS6L"&gt;Luminar was founded by a then 17-year-old Russell in 2012 and counts among its backers Peter Thiel and Volvo, which will begin using Luminar technology to power autonomous driving in its cars &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21248415/volvo-luminar-lidar-self-driving-highway-pilot-spa2"&gt;beginning in 2022&lt;/a&gt;. Luminar also supplies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/18/18144506/audi-self-driving-car-volkswagen-luminar-lidar"&gt;Audi&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16849422/toyota-self-driving-car-platform-3-lexus-lidar"&gt;Toyota Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;, and it has announced partnerships with &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east-africa/mobileye-looks-build-its-own-lidar-drive-down-self-driving-costs-2020-12-15/"&gt;Mobileye&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-30/daimler-isn-t-relying-solely-on-waymo-for-self-driving-trucks"&gt;Daimler’s trucking division&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lhsI3X"&gt;In addition to making giant passenger planes, Airbus also has an interest in small, battery-powered air taxis that are commonly referred to as “urban air mobility.” These would essentially be small helicopters with electric powertrains that could be used for short-hop flights within cities, such as Manhattan to JFK airport. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4j68lE"&gt;The aerospace company has funded several electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) projects over the years, including Vahana and CityAirbus. The former was an egg-shaped single-pilot eVTOL demonstrator, while the latter can carry four passengers and has a range of 60 miles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yWmCHZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces new $1 billion North Carolina campus and $80 billion additional US spending</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BA4XXy5oykpjVDYUdVabyCqF1Qs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69186197/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HctfLO"&gt;Apple has announced &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapple-commits-430-billion-in-us-investments-over-five-years%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F26%2F22403407%2Fapple-us-spending-new-north-carolina-campus" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new spending plans&lt;/a&gt; for the US, including the establishment of a 3,000-employee “campus and engineering hub” in North Carolina and the commitment of an additional $80 billion in investment across the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QVTPiv"&gt;Back in 2018, the firm said it would spend more than $350 billion in the US over the next five years, but today, it announced it is increasing that figure by 20 percent to $430 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UuMnJs"&gt;“At this moment of recovery and rebuilding, Apple is doubling down on our commitment to US innovation and manufacturing with a generational investment reaching communities across all 50 states,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook in a press statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pBGFeQ"&gt;And why not? Like many big tech firms, Apple has done &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/technology/tech-company-earnings-amazon-apple-facebook-google.html"&gt;very well during the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, when other industries have suffered and investors have sought safe places for their money. The company likes to spin these investment announcements as a sort of largesse, but they are, of course, par for the course for a hugely successful and ambitious firm like Apple. As today’s press release notes, the $80 billion will go toward “direct spend with American suppliers, data center investments, capital expenditures in the US, and other domestic spend — including dozens of Apple TV+ productions across 20 states.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tA4QfA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple will invest in basic infrastructure like roads, bridges, and broadband&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rn2Ug4"&gt;The new campus in North Carolina is noteworthy and part of an ongoing trend among tech firms to look outside their traditional California homes. Google is currently &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/17/google-to-invest-1-billion-in-new-campus-in-new-york-city.html"&gt;investing&lt;/a&gt; $1 billion in a New York City campus; Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262149/amazon-helix-arlington-virginia-design-hq2-campus"&gt;building&lt;/a&gt; its second HQ in Virginia; and Oracle &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=oracle+move+headquarters&amp;amp;oq=oracle+move+headquarters&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.2768j0j7&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; last year it’s moving its headquarters from Silicon Valley to Austin, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="03fjHs"&gt;Apple’s North Carolina campus will be part of the state’s Research Triangle (named after the trio of nearby universities: Duke University, North Carolina State University, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill). The company will invest more than $1 billion in the area and pledges to create at least 3,000 new jobs in “machine learning, artificial intelligence, software engineering, and other cutting-edge fields.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3HlVqX"&gt;Notably, Apple also says it will establish a $100 million fund to support “schools and communities” in North Carolina and will contribute more than $110 million to 80 of the state’s poorest counties to help fund critical infrastructure like “broadband, roads and bridges, and public schools.” The Biden administration has made such infrastructure spending a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/business/economy/biden-infrastructure-plan.html"&gt;critical part&lt;/a&gt; of its plans for the US, but it seems that when government lags behind, private firms will step in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WvD22z"&gt;You can read Apple’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapple-commits-430-billion-in-us-investments-over-five-years%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F26%2F22403407%2Fapple-us-spending-new-north-carolina-campus" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;full press release&lt;/a&gt; for further details, including the companies expanding hiring in its teams in California, Colorado, Massachusetts, Texas, Washington, and Iowa, and its investments in new clean energy projects in the US and abroad. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>These USB-C earbuds are a trojan horse for Deezer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/784Ijo0juGyEP5qgWaR7TYe2mA8=/157x0:1845x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69186013/deezer__2_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When used with a compatible Samsung device, the headphones launch a custom Deezer theme.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Deezer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FYRo3d"&gt;As part of a &lt;a href="https://www.deezer-blog.com/press/deezer-preinstalled-on-mobeek-hifi-earphones/"&gt;new partnership&lt;/a&gt;, Deezer will be available “pre-installed” on a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XX6ZYCK?ref=myi_title_dp&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new pair of USB-C earbuds from Mobee-K&lt;/a&gt; when they’re used with select Samsung Galaxy devices. Plugging the headphones into phones like the Galaxy S21, Note 20, or Z Flip effectively side-loads the music streaming service, without you having to visit the Google Play Store. It’s an interesting marketing tactic that could encourage listeners to give Deezer a try over bigger competitors like Spotify and Apple Music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tVJZro"&gt;As well as offering access to the streaming service itself, Deezer advertises that syncing the earbuds with Samsung’s devices gives access to a “customized Deezer theme” which includes “wallpapers, exclusive playlists, and shortcuts to Deezer” via the phone’s lock and home screens. Galaxy devices going back to 2019’s S10 and Note 10 are supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gSGsMb"&gt;If you’re not interested in giving a new streaming service a try, then the $22.70 headphones should still work with all of your other music sources. Mobee-K’s product listing advertises that they’re compatible with “most” USB-C devices, including smartphones, tablets, and laptops. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Inventive grandson builds Telegram messaging machine for 96-year-old grandmother</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3M1gR6q3YvOsfe5hkA--Ts-LopQ=/0x0:1820x1213/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69185832/telegram_machine.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Yayagram looks and works like an old-fashioned physical phone switchboard. &lt;/em&gt; | Twitter: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/mrcatacroquer/status/1386318806411325440" target="_blank"&gt;@mrcatacroquer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yKcEPl"&gt;Making sure elders can keep in contact with children and grandchildren has never been more important in a time of global lockdown. That’s why Twitter user @&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mrcatacroquer/status/1386318806411325440"&gt;mrcatacroquer&lt;/a&gt;, Manuel Lucio Dallo, built the Yayagram — a DIY project that makes sending and receiving voice and text messages over Telegram a physical process just like using an old-fashioned phone switchboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0v5EU8"&gt;It’s important, of course, not to generalize about the ability of older generations to get to grips with new technology. But speaking from personal experience, I know my own grandparents struggled with the digital interfaces of modern phones and smartphones. They much preferred physical buttons and switches to apps and touchscreens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lbMh2J"&gt;That’s why the Yayagram is so compelling (“Yaya” is slang for “granny” in Castillean, says Dallo, “a warm way to refer to your grandmother”). To send a message, the user physically plugs in a cable next to the recipient’s name. They then press and hold a button to record audio and speak into the integrated microphone. The message then appears on the recipient’s phone like a regular voice note. And when the operator of the Yayagram receives a text message, it’s printed off using a built-in thermal printer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VlZgMC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;To send a new voice message you need first to choose the destination grandchild, the selection is made using a Jack connector, like the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/cablegirls?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#cablegirls&lt;/a&gt; used to do! &lt;a href="https://t.co/raLdl0seDC"&gt;pic.twitter.com/raLdl0seDC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Manu (@mrcatacroquer) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mrcatacroquer/status/1386318820529217540?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="mH7dLk"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;And, what happens when you send a text message back to your Granny? Well, the Yayagram prints it on thermal paper so they can touch it and read it, like the old telegrams. &lt;a href="https://t.co/ljcRkBaBIM"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ljcRkBaBIM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Manu (@mrcatacroquer) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mrcatacroquer/status/1386318835968532482?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Lr8KQS"&gt;Dallo, who’s a senior engineer for software firm Plastic SCM, goes into some detail about how the device was made in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mrcatacroquer/status/1386318806411325440"&gt;this Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt;. It’s powered by a Raspberry Pi 4, runs on Python, and uses several third-party software libraries to tie everything together. The microphone is a cheap USB one and the printer similar to those used in cashier tills. He notes that he chose to use Telegram rather than WhatsApp or another messaging service as it’s more open (and he doesn’t like Facebook).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f4vbIG"&gt;Speaking to &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;Dallo says his grandmother is 96 and lives with his parents in Burgos, a city in Spain where he also resides. He says he was inspired to build the device because of the pandemic lockdowns.  “Most of the grandchildren live outside of Burgos and because of covid movement restrictions they can’t visit us and her,” said Dallo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H0Xtk6"&gt;Dallo adds that his grandmother is hard of hearing, which makes regular phone calls and video calls difficult. The Yayagram, by comparison, gives her the independence to make and receive messages by herself. “It empowers her and builds communication bridges with the rest of her grandchildren who are not lucky enough to live nearby,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PDR0gX"&gt;It’s a fantastic project and you can see Dallo and his Yaya using the device below: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DFaCij"&gt;

    <title>Pixel 5A camera sample leaks, hints at similar specs to the Pixel 5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LCACWXmndGxHJUKjB6Zv2lQ4b3o=/0x168:4032x2856/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69185712/pixel_5a_ultrawide.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The since-removed photo, which appears to have been taken with the Pixel 5A.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ljHMMa"&gt;Google seems to have accidentally shared a photo sample from its upcoming Pixel 5A, giving us some hints about what to expect from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375780/google-announces-pixel-5a-5g-denying-rumors-cancelled"&gt;barely announced&lt;/a&gt; device. The photo appeared in an album posted alongside a &lt;a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2021/04/hdr-with-bracketing-on-pixel-phones.html?m=1"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about Google’s HDR+ Bracketing technology, which aims to reduce noise in HDR photos (via &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/04/23/our-first-potential-pixel-5a-camera-sample-looks-like-it-comes-from-a-very-familiar-sensor/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The EXIF data for most of the photos said they were captured by existing Pixel phones including the Pixel 5, Pixel 4A 5G, Pixel 4, and Pixel 4 XL, but in among them was one image apparently taken with a Pixel 5A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w2MvhN"&gt;Google recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375780/google-announces-pixel-5a-5g-denying-rumors-cancelled"&gt;confirmed the existence of the Pixel 5A 5G&lt;/a&gt; in response to rumors that the device had been cancelled. However, beyond confirming that the device will be available later this year in the US and Japan, it didn’t offer any more details about the phone’s specs or cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pSjVsi"&gt;The image labeled as coming from a Pixel 5A has since been removed from &lt;a href="https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPILk1LAjCRKAx7mfmgr_QNQmJ4U6zqhiFTwL88eTsXic8tSeS7dfTiswq1C-nEjw?key=eHJpUFgxOVBNaHVjSFZDMFE3OE5aZmlUZ0d5R1lR"&gt;the album&lt;/a&gt;, but offered several details about the camera performance of the upcoming device while it was up. First is that it appears to have been taken with an ultrawide camera, which corroborates &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/22/google-pixel-5a-renders-leak/"&gt;previous reports&lt;/a&gt; that the 5A will have two rear cameras — a main camera and an ultrawide. That’s similar to the Pixel 4A 5G, while the Pixel 4A had just the one rear camera.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AqA5mi221HihuIROcaTN3Qg-ank=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470037/image__6_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Google Photos&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot of the photo’s EXIF data before it was removed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cFpbQk"&gt;Its resolution is also listed as 12.2 megapixels, which is similar to the photos we saw from the Pixel 5. Although the sensor in the Pixel 5’s ultrawide camera is technically 16 megapixels, it produces 12.2-megapixel shots by default. The 5A’s EXIF data also shows it has the same f/2.2 aperture as the 5. Given that the photo was attached to a blog post about HDR+ Bracketing, it seems likely that the 5A will also offer support for the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxe0qu"&gt;Combined with previous rumors, it looks like the Pixel 5A could be a very similar device to last year’s Pixel 5. Reports suggest it’ll use the &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/21/google-pixel-5a-5g-chip/"&gt;same Snapdragon 765G processor&lt;/a&gt;, and have &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/22/google-pixel-5a-renders-leak/"&gt;a similar design&lt;/a&gt; with a 6.2-inch OLED display with a hole-punch selfie camera. Like Google’s previous A-series devices, however, the rear panel is expected to be made of plastic rather than glass, and the phone will also reportedly feature a 3.5mm headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qtQvBG"&gt;According to the leaked photo’s EXIF data, the photo itself was taken last October just before the Pixel 5 was released. Without official confirmation from Google there’s no guarantee it’s representative of the 5A’s final camera hardware, but the fact that the photo has now been removed suggests it wasn’t a simple labeling mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Video game industry wins first Oscar with documentary short Colette</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qib7IMgjm6ZjTnT56NdPGt23484=/0x0:780x520/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69185502/colette.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ixwc5U"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Colette&lt;/em&gt;, a short film featured in the Oculus VR game &lt;em&gt;Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond&lt;/em&gt;, has won this year’s Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject). Presented by Oculus Studios and Electronic Arts’ Respawn Entertainment, and later acquired and distributed by &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;, it’s the first time a video game industry project has won an Oscar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iCUJ5Z"&gt;Directed by Anthony Giacchino, &lt;em&gt;Colette&lt;/em&gt; features a French Resistance survivor, Colette Marin-Catherine, returning to Germany for the first time since the end of World War II to visit a slave labor camp where her brother was killed. The documentary is presented in a traditional 2D format whether you watch it in the Oculus TV app or elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cqgAxM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The real hero here is Colette herself.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pDCFsK"&gt;“The real hero here is Colette herself, who has shared her story with integrity and strength,” Oculus Studios director of production Mike Doran says in a statement. “As we see in the film, resistance takes courage, but facing one’s past may take even more. Allowing us to preserve this pilgrimage for future generations was a true act of bravery and trust. We hope this award and the film’s reach means, as Colette says, that Jean-Pierre’s memory, as well as all of those who resisted, are no longer lost in the ‘Night and Fog’ of Dora.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SbSkag"&gt;“It’s true what they say: It really is an honor just to be nominated. And it’s an incredible moment to win. We’re humbled by this recognition from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and would like to extend our sincere congratulations to all of our fellow nominees. It’s a privilege to stand alongside you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jypwag"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163762/medal-of-honor-above-and-beyond-virtual-reality-vr-review-steam-oculus"&gt;was not well-received as a video game&lt;/a&gt;, with many reviews highlighting its huge system requirements and 170GB installation size — much of which was down to the inclusion of extensive historical and documentary footage. Now that one of those films has won an Oscar, the project may get more positive attention than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZvwkNY"&gt;You can watch &lt;em&gt;Colette&lt;/em&gt; for free online &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7uBf1gD6JY"&gt;on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2Fdeveloper-post%2F454929399107984%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Oculus TV&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/nov/18/colette-a-former-french-resistance-member-confronts-a-family-tragedy-75-years-later"&gt;at &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ingenuity takes its third flight on Mars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xeQAFs1AJK-vrldW4v9dqjQ9ytY=/36x0:1428x928/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69184344/ingenuity_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Ingenuity lifts off from the Martian surface | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka7S42EXPq0&amp;amp;t=1s&amp;amp;ab_channel=NASAJetPropulsionLaboratory" target="_blank"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;/JPL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1WZuqp"&gt;NASA’s tiny Ingenuity helicopter made its third &lt;a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8930/nasas-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-flies-faster-farther-on-third-flight/"&gt;successful flight on Mars&lt;/a&gt; early Sunday, and flew higher and faster than it did even when it was being tested on Earth. At about 1:31 AM ET, the helicopter ascended 16 feet and flew 164 feet during its 80 second third flight, at a top speed of 6.6 feet per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="56rAML"&gt;NASA received the flight data shortly after 10AM ET. “Today’s flight was what we planned for, and yet it was nothing short of amazing,” NASA’s Dave Lavery said in a statement. “With this flight, we are demonstrating critical capabilities that will enable the addition of an aerial dimension to future Mars missions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="idrzQK"&gt;In its second mission on Thursday, Ingenuity made a 51.9-second flight, traveling seven feet. For &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391496/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-mars-flight-success"&gt;Ingenuity’s first flight&lt;/a&gt; on April 19th, the little craft lifted 10 feet off the surface of Mars for 39 seconds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d56BMM"&gt;Ingenuity arrived on Mars February 18th with its parent rover Perseverance, whose mission is to look for signs of life and take Martian soil samples. While Ingenuity isn’t the main focus of the Perseverance mission, its ability to fly in Mars’ thin atmosphere will provide data useful for future explorations of Mars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BqmXP4"&gt;NASA says it’s planning a fourth flight for Ingenuity in a few days.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Trailers: Ted Lasso, Fathom, Annette, The Conjuring, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="27th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AKrsNUueXMk8mDl_JgMmWfWsFYw=/459x0:4679x2813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69184273/1310834710.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Ted Lasso returns | Photo by SAGAwards2021 via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CmCS8F"&gt;The Oscars are tonight and despite my best efforts I still haven’t seen all the Best Picture contenders, so will hold off on making predictions (but honestly not sure how anyone beats Chadwick Boseman as Best Actor). Lots of good trailers this week including the return of the most wholesome show on all of streaming and the next big Marvel movie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4GzBVA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ldLYIo"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/auxeLrtk7tk?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="3Q4Mqy"&gt;Ted Lasso Season 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="l1kA0H"&gt;You know when you really love a show and it gets popular and everyone else likes it... and you brace for its sophomore season to be not quite as good as its debut? I am hopeful that &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; will not fall into this pattern, and the trailer for season two looks extremely promising (Ted: “Back home if a team was playing poorly, we don’t call them unlucky, what do we call ‘em, Coach?” Beard: “New York Jets.”) Jason Sudeikis, Brendan Hunt, Hannah Waddingham, and Juno Temple return along with others from season one for &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;, which drops on Apple TV Plus July 23rd. And if you’re interested in a little bonus Ted Lasso content, developer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/24/22401368/ted-lasso-shortbread-recipe-apple-spring-loaded"&gt;David Smith managed to figure out the recipe&lt;/a&gt; for the shortbread cookies Ted makes for Hannah. So wholesome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TOyvfq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fKPdgr"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/giWIr7U1deA?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntvp1"&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="f8WmqO"&gt;The next big Marvel movie is the first to center an Asian superhero (and has an almost entirely Asian cast) and it looks very, very fun even if you don’t know the backstory and &lt;a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Shang-Chi"&gt;connection to the Marvel Cinematic Universe&lt;/a&gt;. Simu Liu plays Shang-Chi, whose father trained him as a child to be an assassin. He tries to escape and live a normal life but as anyone who has ever watched a superhero movie knows, it ain’t that easy. Tony Leung, Michelle Yeoh, and Awkwafina also star in &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,&lt;/em&gt; coming to theaters September 3rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FG26RZ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/On4v1gNJkrE?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="oZMzpo"&gt;Annette&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="kPckMD"&gt;Adam Driver and Marion Cotillard play a comedian and opera singer who fall in love and have a child they name Annette, “a mysterious little girl with an exceptional destiny.”  The trailer has that French cinema feel, for sure, which makes sense, since &lt;em&gt;Annette&lt;/em&gt; is the English-language debut of French director Leos Carax. &lt;em&gt;Annette&lt;/em&gt; will open the 74th Cannes Film Festival on July 6th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yYkxUl"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y-Mmnk0LZLU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="wrXtlc"&gt;Fathom &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6HDsVS"&gt;Scientists Michelle Fournet and Ellen Garland embark on separate research trips in opposite hemispheres to try to better understand the songs of humpback whales. No one really knows why whales “sing,” despite decades of research. It’s challenging work that one of the scientists compares to “pointing all of our satellites skyward and listening from a sign from outer space.” The trailer is just beautiful (obviously watch with the sound on).  &lt;em&gt;Fathom&lt;/em&gt; arrives on Apple TV Plus June 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sALjCB"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="CWRzzU"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U3v8n_8-QqA?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="GE0M4W"&gt;Here Today&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="9eszwm"&gt;Billy Crystal wrote, directed, and stars in this movie about an aging comedy writer who befriends a woman (Tiffany Haddish) whose boyfriend bet on a date with him at an auction. Who would not be content to just watch Haddish and Crystal just bounce jokes off each other for 90 minutes? The underlying premise, though, is that Crystal is losing his memory and Haddish steps up to help him. &lt;em&gt;Here Today&lt;/em&gt; arrives in theaters May 7th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yVXoUU"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h9Q4zZS2v1k?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="8fA9eW"&gt;The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="uxBpNr"&gt;I continue to be surprised at the endurance of The Conjuring movies, which continue to be quite scary. I have to be honest that I’m not a super big fan of these movies because of the way they often put children in terrifying situations, a theme which seems to persist in this latest installment. Paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) are back to investigate a murder committed by a young man who claims he was possessed by the devil. &lt;em&gt;The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It&lt;/em&gt; premieres on HBO Max and in theaters on June 4th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clubhouse is partnering with the NFL for draft week programming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Clubhouse App Photo Illustrations" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XkDEQ3sBHBC61VKEtYSTb5L4UJ8=/0x0:3543x2362/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69183494/1232148642.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EDvW3o"&gt;Audio social platform Clubhouse is partnering with the National Football League for some exclusive programming during the upcoming NFL draft, the company announced Sunday. This is the first sports partnership for Clubhouse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LlrD86"&gt;The NFL will host a series of &lt;a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/club/NFL"&gt;draft-themed rooms&lt;/a&gt; on Clubhouse beginning Monday and throughout the week, which will include player assessments, a mock draft for fans, and a conversation with football team alumni from the University of Alabama. Football fans can drop into the NFL rooms on Clubhouse to follow the picks as they’re announced and listen to “discussions featuring key NFL figures—from athletes and coaches to network personalities,” according to a release from Clubhouse, and fans could be invited on stage by moderators to ask draft questions or share reactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9506HW"&gt;Clubhouse had a huge first year, with more than 10 million downloads, and sparked a raft of competing audio products from Twitter, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22359332/linkedin-clubhouse-clone-social-audio-networking-room"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22356682/discord-stage-channels-clubhouse-like-feature-voice"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356993/spotify-locker-room-clubhouse-launch-acquisition"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/slack-wants-to-be-more-than-a-text-based-messaging-platform/"&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276645/facebook-clubhouse-social-audio-app-develop"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. Its March 2020 debut came at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, when people were isolating and turning to online platforms to keep in touch with friends and family. Earlier this month, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported Clubhouse was valued at around $4 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fhgMoO"&gt;Clubhouse is still invitation-only, and is not yet available on Android devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="t6h35G"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Can Clubhouse keep the party going?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22380290/clubhouse-social-audio-twitter-facebook-platforms"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="BKuhVn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="2uEFcT"&gt;We’ve known that Brazilian soccer star Neymar was coming to &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; since March, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22332371/fortnite-chapter-2-season-6-primal-battle-pass-tomb-raider-neymar"&gt;when he was teased as part of the battle royale’s latest season&lt;/a&gt; — and now we finally know what he’ll look like. Today, Epic revealed Neymar’s video game look, which, in traditional &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; fashion, gets pretty outlandish, with unlockable outfits that look ripped straight out of Power Rangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHI89T"&gt;Curiously, Neymar isn’t sporting jerseys for either the Brazil national team or his club, Paris St. Germain, despite the fact that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22231705/fortnite-soccer-skins-manchester-city-juventus-ac-milan-faze-clan"&gt;licensed team kits were introduced earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. You can check out Neymar’s accessories in the image below. Neymar and his gear — including some new quests — will be available on April 27th for anyone who purchased the current pass.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qTxlFA"&gt;Neymar is the first pro athlete to be featured in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, but he’s far from the first celebrity. In addition to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22242696/fortnite-predator-marketing-brands-cross-promotion"&gt;plenty of fictional characters&lt;/a&gt;, the battle royale has added skins based on music stars like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;Travis Scott&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/2/18208223/fortnite-epic-games-marshmello-concert-exciting-bizarre-future-music"&gt;Marshmello&lt;/a&gt;, along with streamers, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/2/18208223/fortnite-epic-games-marshmello-concert-exciting-bizarre-future-music"&gt;Ninja&lt;/a&gt;, Loserfruit, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225416/thegrefg-record-fortnite-viewers-icon-skin-reveal-eu-heretics"&gt;TheGrefg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
