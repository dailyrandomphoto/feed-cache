    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JztUV6"&gt;Disney’s &lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt;, a new show focused on the iconic &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; bounty hunter, will premiere on &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1155720/9358?subId1=VergeBobaFett092921&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; on December 29th, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/disneyplus/status/1443229083924672512"&gt;Disney announced Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d3m0MT"&gt;Disney revealed that the show was in the works after a post-credits scene during the season 2 finale of &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;. Shortly after that big reveal, we learned that the show &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188516/boba-fett-disney-plus-show-2021-release-date-mandalorian-finale"&gt;would premiere in December 2021&lt;/a&gt;, but now we have an official date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4VPsz4"&gt;Here’s the official synopsis, from Disney:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="yTZvRx"&gt;“The Book of Boba Fett,” a thrilling Star Wars adventure, finds legendary bounty hunter Boba Fett and mercenary Fennec Shand navigating the Galaxy’s underworld when they return to the sands of Tatooine to stake their claim on the territory once ruled by Jabba the Hutt and his crime syndicate.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="aUlDfm"&gt;Beyond that, though, we don’t know much, so we’ll have to wait for Disney to share more to get a better picture of what to expect. (Here’s hoping that the date announcement means a trailer is coming soon.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7I4Zga"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt; is just one of many &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; shows on Disney Plus. This month saw the premiere of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/star-wars/22684843/star-wars-visions-anime-anthology-disney-plus-interview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Visions&lt;/em&gt;, an anime anthology&lt;/a&gt;, and there are many in the works, including &lt;em&gt;Obi-Wan Kenobi &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Andor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram Reels are now widely available on Facebook in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Facebook Reels" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DJoms85O9a-ccp6N0HGMOoRcrY0=/454x0:2050x1064/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69925914/Facebook_Reels_Experience_20_0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p5mg3d"&gt;A little over a month after Facebook announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632223/facebook-reels-update-app-test-launch"&gt;a test&lt;/a&gt; blending Instagram Reels’ short-form video content with its main Facebook app, the company &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/launching-reels-on-facebook-us/"&gt;is ready to roll it out fully&lt;/a&gt; in the US. Now, the creators who use it can create reels on Facebook, and Facebook is testing suggestions that will push the videos to its users.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Facebook Reels recommendation" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SM7K0PkpHNNgOFQS_X-13LfxNYc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22887512/NRP_Facebook_Reels_Recommendations_600.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook Reels recommendation&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fODs46"&gt;A big part of the Reels effort is appealing to the people who make entertaining content, and with its news feed, Facebook can offer potential levels of exposure that are bigger than anyone else, including competition like TikTok and Snapchat. To drive the point home, Facebook announced a Reels Play bonus program, which will invite certain creators to get paid based on the performance of their reels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vEVs6P"&gt;Interested parties can sign up for the bonus program, but even if you’re not yet a pro at going viral, you can still create a Reel on Facebook. If you’re not familiar with the feature that Instagram &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21354117/instagram-reels-tiktok-vine-short-videos-stories-explore-music-effects-filters"&gt;added a year ago&lt;/a&gt;, it’s very similar to TikTok, with tools for you to easily edit videos with your own audio or popular song clips from the library, AR effects, and stitching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="WdPgPx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Instagram Reels’ biggest problem is replicating what TikTok does best ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21362382/tiktok-reels-for-you-page-algorithm-instagram-paradox-choice-streaming"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="tGkjiW"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ffacebook%2Fvideos%2F4356148171148569%2F&amp;amp;show_text=0&amp;amp;width=267" width="267" height="476" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>With its next feature Encanto, Disney swaps pure fantasy for magical realism</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kWLYyQpWlsmCtuTjAUlpBBIZRWc=/182x0:1739x1038/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69925837/ENCANTO_ONLINE_USE_240.0_018.00_0001_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CHtP1h"&gt;Disney’s next animated feature, &lt;em&gt;Encanto&lt;/em&gt;, has a lot of what you’d expect from the studio. It’s bright and colorful, telling the story of a magical family living in the mountains of Colombia, most of whom have been blessed with superpowers. It’s even a musical with songs written by Lin-Manuel Miranda. But despite the familiar fantasy trappings, it explores new territory for Disney: the narrative tradition of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_realism"&gt;magical realism&lt;/a&gt;. “The magic is born out of a human need or drive,” &lt;em&gt;Encanto&lt;/em&gt; co-writer and co-director Charise Castro Smith tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It’s all generated by relationships and what these characters are going through.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nwKRpp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Encanto&lt;/em&gt; tells the story of the Madrigal family, who lives in a magical home and go through a very unique experience at the age of five: they’re each granted a special power tied to their personality. Isabela, the favorite child, makes flowers sprout wherever she goes; Luisa, the rock of the family, has strength like The Hulk. The story centers on 15-year-old Mirabel, the only one who wasn’t bestowed with a magical gift. According to co-writer and director Jared Bush, the goal with each character was to create a familiar familial archetype first, and then figure out what power suited them best. “We were constantly making sure that we didn’t push too far into superhero versus relatable, human archetypes,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DbbtFl"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CaimKeDcudo?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8VdYjN"&gt;This idea of being relatable and grounded in reality is central to what &lt;em&gt;Encanto&lt;/em&gt; is — despite the fact that it’s about a superpowered family living in a magical house. That’s where the concept of magical realism comes into play. Though Charise Castro admits that “magical realism can mean lots of different things to lots of different people,” the core conceit is that having a more grounded or realistic world can heighten those magical or supernatural elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8i8swG"&gt;“It absolutely has to be grounded; otherwise, it’s pure fantasy, where anything can be happening at any time,” says Bush. “I think the notion of why this family was given a miracle, how that happened, why it’s important; those have to be based, at least in our story, on something that is very concrete and feels visceral and emotional. That allows you to then have the contrast of the whimsy and the fun and this amazing fantasy that happens. But you have to have both of those pieces to function correctly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ceAmkf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There are some more challenging human elements to this movie.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1CoLjK"&gt;Typically magical realism gets dark and gritty; it’s something Charise Castro has plenty of experience with, having previously worked as a producer and writer on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/28/17911720/haunting-of-hill-house-review-netflix-shirley-jackson-mike-flanagan"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Haunting of Hill House&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But it takes on a slightly new tone in an animated Disney musical. It was “different,” Charise Castro says of the process, but she believes that this kind of fantasy framing also helps make &lt;em&gt;Encanto&lt;/em&gt; feel distinct from past Disney features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vKMDpK"&gt;“This movie is really bright and colorful, and funny and wonderful, but it does have some more grounded, different themes than traditional Disney movies,” she says. “There are some more challenging human elements to this movie. We did try to keep in mind that it is a tradition that is born out of the need to tell tall tales, sometimes about difficult things. This movie is not devoid of that.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RxJtXodi3e8-exciXMPXIcq2bI4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22885628/ENCANTO_ONLINE_USE_149.0_001.00_0343_copy.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1yw90F"&gt;In order to make it work, one of the things the creative team had to do was cut lots of ideas that might be too outlandish for the movie’s tone. One early idea involved a party animal-type character who created a scene wherever he went; balloons would mysteriously appear when he walked into a room. “This is probably not a fit for this movie,” director Byron Howard admits. “But it was hilarious for about two weeks.” Meanwhile, an earlier version of the super-strong Luisa was indestructible and would occasionally travel large distances by being shot out of a cannon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wTchJg"&gt;“We’ve actually created eight different versions of this movie internally, as we progressed and honed things,” says Howard. “Sometimes we try things, and it breaks it. But I think the fact that we were willing to push those boundaries was great because we always wanted it to be heavily inspired by magical realism, but we also knew that it had to be light and entertaining sometimes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZOyuUD"&gt;According to Bush, this iterative form of moviemaking is integral to the studio’s process, even if it requires lots of time — and tossing away plenty of ideas. “To have the luxury of time to really invest in ideas that might initially sound nuts is, I think, one of the hallmarks of our process at Disney Animation,” he explains. “Because sometimes you’ll find something spectacular, and you’ll hold on to it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dbe94y"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Encanto &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is due to hit theaters on November 24th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s most affordable true wireless earbuds switch to a more traditional design</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7tc9OLeNwHU3NTHFl8QMyyuiAfA=/0x48:1200x848/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69925834/01._WF_C500_Black_Standard_Mid__1_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K2KVoI"&gt;They’re not audiophile earbuds by any means, but I’ve been a fan of Sony’s “extra bass” WF-XB700 earbuds since they were released. A big part of that is their unconventional shape, which twists into my ear canal deeper than most other earbuds for a sturdy fit that also manages to remain comfortable. But today, Sony is introducing the replacements for those earbuds, and while there are notable improvements like app support (with EQ), longer battery life, and easier controls, the overall design of the new $100 WF-C500 earbuds is definitely playing it safer. They also cost less out of the gate than the XF-XB700s did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wr0LkE"&gt;Sony says it decided to go for a more compact style this time, but it has maintained the IPX4 water and sweat resistance of the WF-XB700s. Battery life has increased to 10 hours of continuous playback (up from 9) and 20 hours counting case recharges (from 18). Somewhat surprisingly, the new earbuds ditch Sony’s “extra bass” sound tuning. But since the CF500s work with Sony’s mobile app, you should be able to pump up the bass using the adjustable EQ for a similar result. The company is really trying to position these as ideal for people buying their first set of true wireless earbuds. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/35Cx7VZgTlgNP9U97V0eqg_NZrQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22887342/04._WF_C500_Black_insitu_Mid__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can see through the top half of the case to know when the earbuds are done charging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FTwLJq"&gt;I’m happy Sony did preserve one thing about the XB700s, though. Well, two, actually. The earbuds still have an excellent, grippy matte finish. And the top half of the charging case is still semi-translucent, so you can easily tell when the individual earbuds and case are all done charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cpuzrE"&gt;The new buds also have Sony’s DSEE (digital sound enhancement engine) for upscaling audio, but that’s always come off as a little gimmicky to me — especially when we’re talking about $99.99 earbuds. What’s more useful is that they support both Fast Pair on Android and Swift Pair for quick setup on Windows. The WF-C500 earbuds are available for preorder today, and there’s a spread of exclusive colors depending on where you buy them. &lt;a href="https://electronics.sony.com/audio/headphones/truly-wireless/p/wfc500"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; will sell them in black, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09CFP6J6D?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; has black and white, &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsony-wf-c500-true-wireless-in-ear-headphone-green%2F6479334.p%3FskuId%3D6479334&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; gets them in black and green, and Target is selling black and orange. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vL16qFsyiDp9KfS7pX-mjpS4PBg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22887388/04._WH_XB910N_Black_insitu_Mid.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The WH-XB910N headphones have noise cancellation and up to 30 hours of battery life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nBDoLs"&gt;Sony is also introducing a new mid-range set of noise-canceling headphones. Priced at $249.99, the WH-XB910N headphones have that extra bass oomph and up to 30 hours of continuous battery life. They also carry over support for multipoint (two simultaneous Bluetooth connections), a feature that came to Sony headphones starting with the flagship WH-1000XM4s. Like those pricier headphones, these have tap and swipe controls. The enormous Sony logo is a little much for me, but that comes down to personal taste. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6hxarE"&gt;It’s the same story as the WF-C500s with exclusive colors at different stores: &lt;a href="https://electronics.sony.com/audio/headphones/headband/p/whxb910n"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; keeps it simple with black, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09CGB6VRR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; offers black and blue, &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsony-wh-xb910n-extra-bass-wireless-noise-cancelling-over-the-ear-headphones-gray%2F6479557.p%3FskuId%3D6479557&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; has black and green, and Target is selling them in black and orange. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube bans vaccine misinformation </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HwFvdJjRlIn8rwJqCXERzGNOQBs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69925721/acastro_210309_1777_vaccine_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uoXAgg"&gt;In a new attempt to stem the flow of anti-vaccine misinformation, YouTube said Wednesday that it &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/11161123"&gt;won’t allow videos&lt;/a&gt; that claim vaccines approved by health authorities are dangerous or don’t work. The platform is also banning prominent anti-vaccine accounts, including Joseph Mercola’s channel and the Robert F. Kennedy Jr.-linked Children’s Defense Fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vxHclE"&gt;YouTube pulled ads from anti-vaccination content &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/22/18236839/youtube-demonetization-anti-vaccination-conspiracy-videos-dangerous-harmful-content"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and said in October 2020 that it would remove videos that pushed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21515796/youtube-covid-vaccine-misniformation-policy"&gt;misinformation around COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt;. The new policy expands to block misinformation around other vaccines, including the flu shot, the HPV vaccine, and the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Videos that inaccurately claim that the MMR vaccine causes autism or that the flu shot causes infertility, for example, will not be allowed under the new policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ibtnR2"&gt;There are some exceptions: YouTube will still allow videos that include people sharing their personal experiences with vaccination. It’ll remove that content if the channels they’re on “demonstrate a pattern of promoting vaccine misinformation.” The guidelines say that the platform will also allow videos with information violating the policy if that video includes other context, like statements from medical experts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BmS7BT"&gt;Along with the new policy, YouTube is also terminating the channels of major anti-vaxxers, a YouTube spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Those include Joseph Mercola, the Children’s Health Defense Fund, Erin Elizabeth, and Sherri Tenpenny. Channels for two other major figures, Rashid Bhuttar and Ty and Charlene Bollinger, were terminated a few months ago, the spokesperson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NnVYYO"&gt;Those anti-vaccine figures are all part of the “Disinformation Dozen,” a group identified by the Center for Countering Digital Hate as &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/05/13/996570855/disinformation-dozen-test-facebooks-twitters-ability-to-curb-vaccine-hoaxes"&gt;responsible for the bulk&lt;/a&gt; of misleading claims about vaccines on social media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZZdql"&gt;YouTube expanded its vaccine policies after noting that misinformation around all vaccines could contribute to mistrust around the COVID-19 vaccine, Matt Halprin, YouTube’s vice president of global trust and safety, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/09/29/youtube-ban-joseph-mercola/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Over the past few months, the backlash to COVID-19 vaccinations has been expanding to target other vaccines: the Tennessee Department of Health temporarily suspended outreach around childhood vaccinations &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578519/vaccine-politicization-tennessee-covid-hpv-flu"&gt;this summer&lt;/a&gt;, and a Florida state senator &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tommybeer/2021/09/23/florida-gop-state-senator-reportedly-wants-to-review-non-covid-vaccine-mandates-for-schoolchildren/?sh=20057532545d"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; he wants to “review” school vaccination requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vlbn07"&gt;Facebook similarly expanded its vaccine misinformation policy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272883/facebook-covid-19-vaccine-misinformation-expanded-removal-autism"&gt;in February&lt;/a&gt; to block claims that the shots are dangerous. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blue Origin ‘gambled’ with its Moon lander pricing, NASA says in legal documents</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Blue Origin is backed by the world’s richest man — why didn’t it just offer NASA a cheaper lunar lander?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="xRFYvC"&gt;Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin “gambled” with its Moon lander proposal last year by hoping NASA would be willing to negotiate its $5.9 billion price tag, agency attorneys argued in blunt legal filings obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;NASA, cash-strapped with a tight budget from Congress, declined to negotiate and turned down Blue Origin’s lunar lander in April and picked SpaceX’s instead, sparking ongoing protests from Bezos’ space company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hwy3T9"&gt;NASA officials haven’t talked much about Blue Origin’s legal quarrels beyond occasional acknowledgements that the company’s protesting — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404528/nasa-bezo-blue-origin-protest-spacex-contract"&gt;first at a watchdog agency&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22623022/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-sue-nasa-lawsuit-hls-lunar-lander"&gt;now in federal court&lt;/a&gt; — is holding up the agency’s effort to land humans on the Moon by 2024. But in hundreds of pages of legal filings &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;obtained in a Freedom of Information Act request, agency attorneys exhaustively laid out NASA’s defense of its Artemis Moon program&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and doubled down on its decision to pick one company, SpaceX, for the first crewed mission to the lunar surface since 1972.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vlGuEC"&gt;Round 1: A Costly Bid&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="f7StwS"&gt;In NASA’s main response to Blue Origin’s protest,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;filed in late May, senior agency attorneys accused the company of employing a sort of &lt;a href="https://dictionary.apa.org/door-in-the-face-technique"&gt;door-in-the-face&lt;/a&gt; bidding tactic with its $5.9 billion proposal for Blue Moon, the lunar lander Blue Origin is building with a “National Team” that includes Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. Blue Origin was “able and willing” to offer NASA a lower price for its lunar lander but chose not to because it expected NASA to ask and negotiate for a lower price first, the attorneys allege, citing a six-page declaration written by the company’s senior vice president Brent Sherwood in April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="AolJ6H"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“a well-funded private space company backed by Jeff Bezos”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wsMDJ1"&gt;In the declaration, Sherwood complains that NASA “did not afford Blue Origin, a well-funded private space company backed by Jeff Bezos, any opportunity to submit a revised business position” when NASA found out it wouldn’t have enough money from Congress to fund two lander proposals. He said Blue Origin had already committed “almost one billion dollars” of corporate contributions and private investments to the Moon lander bid, and “had the financial potential to increase” that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZjXzG"&gt;Backed by the world’s richest man, Blue Origin indicated in its protest that the $5.9 billion price — nearly double SpaceX’s proposal — was partially based on an assumption that NASA would have more than enough money from Congress to pay for the proposal, even as Congress &lt;a href="https://spacenews.com/senate-bill-offers-nasa-only-a-fraction-of-requested-lunar-lander-funding/"&gt;had been indicating&lt;/a&gt; a month before Blue Origin &lt;a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/news/national-team-submits-moon-proposal-to-nasa"&gt;submitted&lt;/a&gt; its proposal last December that it wouldn’t give NASA all the funding it said it needed. In NASA’s response, the attorneys said companies were instructed to submit their best proposal first. They pointed to seven instances where NASA told bidders its award decision, and whether to pick one or two companies was based on how much funding it’d end up getting from Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4zuaTu"&gt;But Blue Origin argued that NASA should’ve canceled or changed the terms of the program when Congress voted to give the agency only a quarter of what it requested.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Blue Origin has also argued that it was unfair of NASA to only invite SpaceX to tweak parts of its proposal after selecting it for a potential award, one of many claims that NASA attacked over hundreds of pages of legal rebuttals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KY4TC8"&gt;Overall, NASA effectively called BS on that argument, saying “Blue Origin made a bet and it lost.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="LpP5U3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Blue Origin made a bet and it lost.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TvTtFQ"&gt;Blue Origin “made an assumption about the Agency’s HLS budget, built its proposal with this figure in mind, and also separately made a calculated bet that if NASA could not afford Blue Origin’s initially-proposed price, the Agency would select Blue Origin for award and engage in post-selection negotiations to allow Blue Origin to lower its price. All of these assumptions were incorrect,” the four NASA attorneys wrote in the so-called Agency Report, dated May 26th. “Realizing now that it gambled and lost, Blue Origin seeks to use GAO’s procurement oversight function to improperly compel NASA to suffer the consequences of Blue Origin’s ill-conceived choices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BPrFfT"&gt;The company disagrees with NASA’s&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;assessment.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“I wouldn’t say that we didn’t offer our best offer when we put in our proposal ... I think we did give a great offer,” Megan Mitchell, Blue Origin’s vice president of government relations, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an interview. “I’m not going to comment on NASA characterizing it as gambling — we disagree with that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3LISLa"&gt;The lunar lander program is the centerpiece of NASA’s efforts to get humans on the Moon under a speedy 2024 timeline, set two years ago by the Trump administration. SpaceX, the sole awardee of the Moonshot phase of the program, will carry out two core missions: a demonstration mission to the Moon’s surface without any astronauts and a subsequent mission &lt;em&gt;with &lt;/em&gt;astronauts. Blue Origin’s National Team and defense contractor Dynetics were the two bidders with lunar lander proposals that lost to SpaceX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="CdelNB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This time, the bet simply did not work out in Blue Origin’s favor.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gJl3bK"&gt;Blue Origin executives may have thought that the negotiation tactic would work because it had in the past. In April 2020, a year before&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;SpaceX’s $2.9 billion award was made, all three bidders were awarded some NASA development funding in an initial phase of the program intended to help the companies build up their respective lunar landers. SpaceX got $135 million, Dynetics got $253 million, and Blue Origin’s National Team got $579 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wE6JlU"&gt;Blue Origin had initially proposed roughly $879 million for those development contracts when proposals for the award were due in November 2019, NASA filings indicate. Blue Origin offered a roughly $300 million discount and dropped the price by about 35 percent, to $579 million, after NASA requested meetings to negotiate. The agency attorneys said the outcome of these discussions, where Blue Origin ended up winning the biggest chunk of funding, inspired Blue Origin’s “gamble” with the subsequent competition, where it pitched its Blue Moon lander for $5.9 billion. “But NASA had no obligation to make this request” for a negotiation that time around, they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJx1aw"&gt;“This time, the bet simply did not work out in Blue Origin’s favor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i51dO2"&gt;Sherwood’s declaration from April was one of several attempts to show that NASA was prejudiced in favor of SpaceX and acted unfairly against Blue Origin. But NASA said “a vague commitment to a sizeable, non-specific discount is not enough to demonstrate prejudice.” Months later, and just four days before the Government Accountability Office (GAO) ruled on Blue Origin’s protest, Bezos himself stepped in and got specific in an unusual &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594038/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-nasa-lunar-lander-2-billion"&gt;open letter to NASA administrator Bill Nelson&lt;/a&gt;. Bezos said he would give the agency a $2 billion discount on Blue Origin’s proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UJanR6"&gt;But it wasn’t enough to change minds at NASA. The GAO ultimately sided with the agency, saying that showing examples of prejudice “is an essential element of any viable protest,” and that Blue Origin failed to do so. As for Blue Origin’s argument that NASA’s discussions with SpaceX were unfair, since Blue Origin didn’t get the same chance to talk, the GAO brushed it off, saying agency officials have “broad discretion” to meet when and with whom they please under the type of contracting rules involved. “An agency’s decision not to initiate discussions is a matter we generally will not review,” GAO attorney Thomas Armstrong said in a ruling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5W1FXh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A tiny win at the GAO, and a springboard to federal court&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e3Z9ZQ"&gt;Blue Origin’s protest, though, wasn’t a &lt;em&gt;complete&lt;/em&gt; failure. It alleged that one of the ways NASA gave SpaceX an unfair advantage was when the agency, for SpaceX only, “waived” its requirement to schedule government safety reviews before each launch of its Starship vehicle in its proposal. These safety reviews, called Flight Readiness Reviews, should come 14 days before each rocket launch within the company’s plan to get to the Moon, per the rules of the competition. Blue Origin’s proposal had indicated it could send Blue Moon to the lunar surface in as much as three commercial rocket launches with a safety review for each launch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iFxRc81IhFKZaHCN3BEeBPVZ8ww=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22887128/Sep_29_2021_08_42_36.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: SpaceX&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SpaceX’s Starship prototype, the top-half portion designed to land on the Moon, sticks its first clean test landing in May at SpaceX’s private facilities in Texas.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2BENtb"&gt;SpaceX’s proposal involved 16 launches, with just one official safety review. The 16 launches include one launch of an orbital fuel station, 14 launches of “fuel tankers” to fill up the fuel station in orbit, and one launch of the Moon-bound Starship that will fill up at the fuel station to travel the rest of the way to the lunar surface (launching off Earth uses up a lot of fuel, so Starship will need a top-off before it carries on to the Moon). SpaceX said each of the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1425473261551423489?s=20"&gt;roughly&lt;/a&gt; 14 fuel tankers would launch 12 days apart, a cadence that NASA officials said was “logically inconsistent” with its requirement to have a safety review 14 days before each launch. So when NASA invited SpaceX to negotiate the terms of its proposal, they agreed to have three reviews in all, one for each &lt;em&gt;type &lt;/em&gt;of rocket launch — one for the orbital depot, one for all the tankers, and one for the Moon-bound Starship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v3X8W6"&gt;But that’s where NASA messed up, Blue Origin claims. And for once, the GAO’s Armstrong partially agreed. NASA attorneys said the agency’s rules were broad enough to allow flexibility with the reviews, but Armstrong sided with Blue Origin’s interpretation that a single review had to come before each launch. Still, Armstrong denied Blue Origin’s overall argument because the company didn’t explain how NASA’s alleged screwup gave SpaceX an unfair advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sLdYPx"&gt;Round 2: Suing NASA&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5Ul3V3"&gt;To Blue Origin attorneys, the GAO ruling was valuable feedback for a &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; legal challenge, this time in the US Court of Federal Claims — the last venue capable of hearing contract grievances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iDpQzt"&gt;Blue Origin sued NASA in court weeks after the GAO rejected its protest. In its complaint, which was shrouded under seal until last week, the company centers its new fight on the main area it fell short on during the GAO dispute: proving NASA was prejudiced against Blue Origin and gave SpaceX an unfair advantage. The debates over SpaceX’s Flight Readiness Reviews, where the GAO signaled its support for Blue Origin, is the basis for its unfair advantage argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JbYqOp"&gt;“That is not what SpaceX proposed, it is not in the final architecture, and that’s the problem,” Blue Origin’s Mitchell said of the revised safety reviews. “For Blue Origin, and I think more broadly for our entire industry, this is a serious safety issue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="t2H4tP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“These claims from a losing bidder are patently inaccurate”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0z3JBr"&gt;Pushing back on Blue Origin’s arguments in a white paper sent to lawmakers earlier this month, a copy of which was obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, SpaceX said it plans to conduct safety reviews prior to every Starship launch, as it has in the past “for every single operational launch and test flight,” and that Blue Origin is conflating mere contract payment dates with actual safety reviews. It dismissed Blue Origin as a sore loser: “These claims from a losing bidder are patently inaccurate.” And SpaceX CEO Elon Musk tweeted last week: “We always do flight readiness reviews! This argument makes no sense.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="68WxZu"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We always do flight readiness reviews! This argument makes no sense.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1440736242195329028?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TqJRLE"&gt;Blue Origin argues in its &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.uscfc.44185/gov.uscourts.uscfc.44185.47.0.pdf"&gt;59-page complaint&lt;/a&gt; that, had the company known NASA was going to be flexible on the safety review requirements, it would’ve “engineered and proposed an entirely different architecture” for a lower price that would’ve given it a “substantial chance for award.” Specifically how NASA’s flexible safety review requirements would allow Blue Origin to change its proposal of just three review-worthy launches is unclear. The company attempted to explain how in a small paragraph in its complaint, but it was mostly redacted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cEXTRb"&gt;NASA made little to no mention of Blue Origin’s safety review argument in its main response to the GAO protest, and it’s unclear what the agency is saying in court, because much of it is under seal. But when it invited SpaceX to revise its proposals in April, NASA said it believed three safety reviews for each type of rocket launch “meets the intent of” the review requirements outlined in NASA’s competition rules. In other words, NASA figured its modified safety review arrangement is good enough, considering how novel and unexpected SpaceX’s approach of launching several Starships in such a rapid cadence is. And in another recently unsealed filing, SpaceX says its unconventional Starship approach is the result of NASA encouraging companies to have the “liberty to propose a different architecture.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/63jhKfeRjA0uf_z_UgLlawZO9q0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22887143/51369631902_ce4f03c26a_k.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: SpaceX&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Using cranes, SpaceX workers in Texas guide the top half of Starship onto its Super Heavy booster for a “full stack” demonstration in August, in this composite image tweeted by Musk at the time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t2127p"&gt;Now, NASA wants all the litigation to stop as soon as possible so the gears of its lunar lander program can start turning. The agency agreed last month to pause SpaceX’s contract while the lawsuit carries on only if Blue Origin agreed to a quicker litigation schedule that wraps up November 1st. Blue Origin, NASA, and SpaceX are currently duking it out before the court, most recently arguing over Blue Origin’s request to add more documents and internal NASA emails into the court’s record for review. The company also wants the judge to approve the release of a less-redacted version of its complaint, but NASA and SpaceX are pushing back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gBRNv4"&gt;If the court ultimately agrees with Blue Origin and finds NASA messed up, the agency would likely have to cancel SpaceX’s contract, as Blue Origin requests, and reopen the competition to allow the companies to submit new proposals — a significant setback for the agency’s Moon program. If Blue Origin loses, the monthslong hold on SpaceX’s contract would disappear, allowing work with NASA on Starship to begin, and Blue Origin would be invited to pitch its lander for a future Moon lander competition. But the delay itself already poses risks for NASA. In one of its filings to the GAO, NASA attorneys laid out their fears: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b5KrTC"&gt;“What begins as a mere procurement delay all too easily turns into a lack of political support, a budget siphoned off for other efforts, and ultimately, a shelved mission.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dmTXmr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22887155/r_76c___MOL_Blue_Origin_B_419783.1__Final_Corrected_Copy__Public_Redacted.pdf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read the lightly redacted version&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; of NASA’s “Agency Report” to the GAO, filed in May in response to Blue Origin’s protest.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>League of Legends’ biggest stars turn into anime heroes in Worlds 2021 music video</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SDanQE41N7GdfpHVHRMPKAkYsaw=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69925467/BIAD_ClientThumb.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iv2c0W"&gt;Every year ahead of the &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; World Championship, developer Riot tries to get everyone excited with a new song. This year’s anthem is called “Burn It All Down” from American band Pvris, and it definitely fits into the tradition of music to get players amped up. But it also comes with a bonus: a music video that turns some of the game’s best players into anime heroes. (Journalist Ashley Kang has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AshleyKang/status/1443006521089028098"&gt;a great thread&lt;/a&gt; detailing who is who.) It’s the kind of short that makes you want a full &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; esports anime, and it even transitions to a 3D art style at the end, in a nod to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22688837/netflix-arcane-league-of-legends-trailer-show-riot-games-release-date"&gt;the upcoming Netflix series &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LKcEzI"&gt;This year’s iteration of Worlds &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22649691/league-of-legends-world-championships-2021-europe"&gt;will take place in Iceland starting October 5th&lt;/a&gt;; it was originally slated for China but was forced to move due to pandemic-related restrictions. Even if you aren’t into competitive &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt;, it’s usually worth tuning in for a bit to see the technical wizardry on display. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/24/21529317/league-of-legends-world-championship-high-tech-stage-riot-mandalorian"&gt;Last year featured a virtual stage built using the same tech behind &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and past opening ceremonies have showcased &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/11/20959206/league-of-legends-worlds-2019-opening-ceremony-holograms-holonet"&gt;concerts using holograms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/31/21541871/league-of-legends-world-championship-worlds-2020-opening-ceremony-ar-kda"&gt;augmented reality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Don’t be fooled — Amazon’s Astro isn’t a home robot, it’s a camera on wheels</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1Hd254s6u05cgMrW-6QNIkFZxss=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69925420/amazon_astro_home_robot_4773_9.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="E12dOp"&gt;Yesterday, Amazon announced its “home robot” — a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22697244/amazon-astro-home-robot-hands-on-features-price"&gt;wheeled device named Astro&lt;/a&gt; that has a display, an array of sensors, and a camera that periscopes out the top of its body like a mast. In &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/sj1t3msy8dc"&gt;advertisements for Astro&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon presents the device as an engineering breakthrough and the realization of a long-held sci-fi dream: to build a robot that can help around the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gf9Q35"&gt;This is rubbish, of course. What Astro is — for better or worse — is a camera on wheels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0fFgk3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Astro definitely can’t get a beer for you&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="woa5WA"&gt;The physical limitations of Astro are obvious. It has no arms or manipulators; no way to interact with the world other than bumping into objects at shin height. It can’t navigate steps, and, according to employees who worked on the robot and &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93ypp8/leaked-documents-amazon-astro-surveillance-robot-tracking"&gt;spoke to &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it is fragile and prone to self-destruction. “Astro is terrible and will almost certainly throw itself down a flight of stairs if presented the opportunity,” one told the publication. (Oh, and it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/22699251/amazon-astro-robot-cannot-fetch-your-beer"&gt;absolutely cannot get a beer for you&lt;/a&gt; — a recurring meme when companies try to hype home robots). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="picD5q"&gt;But Amazon is still offering customers quite a bit with Astro, and for those worried about the privacy implications of this technology, the basic usefulness of the device needs to be reckoned with. Amazon says Astro will use facial recognition to identify people in your home and recognize intruders. (Again, though, &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; reports that this feature works poorly in the real world.) The bot can be set to “patrol” your house at night and can be activated and steered remotely, letting you peek through its periscope camera via your phone. In Amazon’s ad, a couple use this feature to double check they turned the stove off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HOmxxA"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sj1t3msy8dc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BHsdiv"&gt;This is silly stuff, but it’s useful, too. These are features many people will want. Everyone cares about keeping their home safe and, if you’re already investing in home surveillance but don’t want to put a camera in every room, then Astro may seem like an attractive solution. (Whether people will pay $999 for the pleasure, and whether Astro will actually work as promised, are open questions.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z5qz3L"&gt;It’s also worth remembering that although many people distrust or dislike Amazon because of its consistently appalling mistreatment of workers, its union-busting, and its tax avoidance, the company actually remains fairly beloved by the American public. In a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21144680/verge-tech-survey-2020-trust-privacy-security-facebook-amazon-google-apple"&gt;survey &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; ran in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon had the most favorable impression in the US of any tech firm and was judged to be second-most trustworthy after Microsoft. So the fact that &lt;em&gt;Amazon&lt;/em&gt; is selling this roving camera won’t necessarily put people off the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eTl3PU"&gt;Astro is also important for Amazon’s grand strategy. The company’s vision for tech is one of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696187/amazon-alexa-ambient-disappearing-computer-limp-interview"&gt;ambient computing&lt;/a&gt; — of rigging together a network of sensors, smart speakers, cameras, and digital assistants that are integrated into users’ homes. The company wants to provide convenience by organizing customers’ lives, ideally for a recurring subscription fee, just like with its Prime delivery service. And since it acquired video doorbell firm Ring in 2018, home security and surveillance have been an increasingly important part of this offering. So while many will complain that Astro is essentially a surveillance device, that suits Amazon fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EjdYFW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon has an extremely shady history when it comes to surveillance&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZxTc0y"&gt;Personally, I think Astro is a half-baked concept and part of a dangerous trend of ubiquitous and unthinking surveillance. Although I accept the fact that many people want this sort of technology in their home, Amazon in particular has repeatedly shown a lack of care and honesty in how it develops this sort of tech. In the past, the company has sold &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18197137/amazon-rekognition-facial-recognition-bias-race-gender"&gt;racially biased facial recognition systems&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/12/20/21031758/amazon-ring-hack-security-login-username"&gt;hackable security cameras&lt;/a&gt;; it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/31/22258856/amazon-ring-partners-police-fire-security-privacy-cameras"&gt;aggressively partners with law enforcement&lt;/a&gt; and uses &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/ywaa57/how-ring-transmits-fear-to-american-suburbs"&gt;scare tactics to push its products on consumers&lt;/a&gt;. Looking at this history, I’m not sure why &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; would trust Amazon to oversee these sorts of systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Sa7Nx"&gt;But this is where Astro’s guise as a “home robot” becomes useful. For many people looking at Astro, it may appear to be just a novelty — indeed, it’s already drawn comparisons to robot “pets” like Aibo. But I think, like Facebook’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21439929/facebook-ar-smart-glasses-ray-ban-announcement"&gt;camera-equipped Ray-Ban glasses&lt;/a&gt;, the purpose of Astro is not to solve any particular problem but to neutralize the underlying concept: to get people used to having a camera that moves constantly around their home. Astro isn’t a home robot, it’s a camera on wheels, and that’s just what Amazon wants. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to find your lost iPhone — even if it’s off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A purple iPhone 12" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xxmdXDJ2xj6wpidTTrR5CzNWgyg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69925408/vpavic_4547_20210421_0021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fJ0xk1"&gt;Apple’s Find My app has been a very useful (and reassuring) feature, allowing you to locate a misplaced (or stolen) phone so that you can retrieve it (or contact the authorities, if that’s safer). With the expansion of Find My to a variety of other objects, especially via &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;Apple’s AirTags&lt;/a&gt;, it’s become even more useful. And now that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"&gt;iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; brings with it the capability to locate your phone even if the battery has run out or it’s been turned off, the utility of Find My has become even greater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JISZ2u"&gt;(Note: you can also use the Find My app to help with your own security — to share your location with individuals and send recurring notifications of when you leave and arrive. You can find directions for setting that up in our article “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22676312/ios-iphone-apple-location-tracking-turn-off-on"&gt;How to use iPhone’s location tracking&lt;/a&gt;.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="czJIfR"&gt;If you’re new to the iPhone or have never set up the Find My app yet, here’s how you start:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="zIfTal"&gt;Go to your settings, tap on your name, and then on “Find My.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LuzA3e"&gt;Tap on “Find My iPhone.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mIyfi6"&gt;Toggle “Find My iPhone” on. If you have upgraded to iOS 15, you can also activate “Find My network,” which will let you find your phone even if it’s offline. “Send Last Location” will send the location of your iPhone to your Apple account when the battery is about to die.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Turn on the Find My feature in your settings." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hEyLTj__UBAbTD4HpxYhdYbZFn0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884575/IMG_49615EE7ED8B_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turn on the Find My feature in your settings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Turn on “Find My network” to find your phone when it’s off." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RNDYVuILGJl6ncQVRmWvCChpZxc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884577/IMG_E77E43DD93EA_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turn on “Find My network” to find your phone when it’s off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IAs1td"&gt;And that’s it! After that, if you can’t find your iPhone, then you can track it either by using the Find My app on a Mac (or another iPhone, if you have one) or on any browser by going to &lt;a href="http://iCloud.com/find"&gt;iCloud.com/find&lt;/a&gt; and signing in using your Apple ID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0WCkuy"&gt;If you’re using the web version, then you’ll see a green dot that locates your iPhone. Select the dot and then the circled “i” (for information), and you’ll be given the choice of having your phone play a sound, erasing it, or putting it on “Lost Mode.” In “Lost Mode,” you can enter a phone number where you can be reached and a message (“Please return this phone asap!”). After that, the phone will be locked until you re-enter its passcode.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Find My app lets you locate your phone, send a notification, or erase it. (Note: the map has been blurred for privacy reasons.)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DtyCr1Ryk_qdHRUm_kBoMOlC5oE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884619/Screen_Shot_2021_09_28_at_10.10.46_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Find My app lets you locate your phone, send a notification, or erase it. (Note: the map has been blurred for privacy reasons.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XMD6QL"&gt;If you’re using the Find My app, you’ll get basically the same features (except in a more aesthetically pleasing form), along with map directions on how to get to your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTXF7S"&gt;And yes — if you’re using iOS 15 on your iPhone, you will be able to locate it even if it’s run out of battery power or has been shut off. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Find My can locate a phone even if it’s off — as long as it has iOS 15 installed." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2Gh52_nYw0SlvCzEQB_hNMpsde4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884670/Screen_Shot_2021_09_27_at_4.50.43_PM.png"&gt;

    <title>Bose QuietComfort 45 review: comfortably familiar</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A masterclass in going back to what works&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="57iLed"&gt;Bose’s Noise Cancelling Headphones 700, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review"&gt;released in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, are a perfectly fine pair of premium noise-canceling headphones. They’re Bose’s attempt to leapfrog Sony and other competitors with a revamped, sleek design and more powerful active noise cancellation. But for some of the company’s most loyal fans, they veer off a little too far from what they expect Bose headphones to be. The NCH 700s don’t have the same feather-light comfort as the QuietComfort lineup, they annoyingly can’t be folded for easy carrying, and generally, it seems like Bose needlessly tried to fix something that wasn’t broken. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ifa8HA"&gt;But with the new $329 QuietComfort 45 noise-canceling headphones, there’s no reinventing the wheel. This time, Bose is sticking much closer to the formula that led to such success for the QuietComfort 35 and 35 II. That model became an essential piece of kit for combatting the din of cities or hushing the train commute, and you see them on every flight. The QC45s aren’t considered Bose’s flagship headphones anymore, but with additions like USB-C, improved ANC, and longer battery life, they’re just what some people have been waiting for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ljreX1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10779029"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iwyyH0"&gt;With the QC45s, Bose is moving away from the flashy, “modern” style of the Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 and going back to what worked. The steel headband, which seamlessly continued down into metal rods that made for a much smoother motion when adjusting the fit, is gone. Now, we’re back to the proudly plastic QuietComfort aesthetic that feels surprisingly durable (thanks to metal hinges at the pivot points) and the familiar ratcheting when you extend the ear cups has also returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L8OUtt"&gt;The swipey touchpad controls of the NCH 700s are also history. Bose has essentially just copied and pasted the physical buttons of the QC35 IIs: on the underside of the right earcup are dedicated controls for volume and a multi-function button for track controls and summoning a voice assistant. On the left is a button that switches between ANC and Bose’s “aware” (transparency) mode; the latter is a feature that the QC35s didn’t offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kgeEn8QS5fmt3RpAGVjzP1b7lgI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883429/cwelch_202109_4775_5635.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The QuietComfort 45 headphones look very similar to their predecessors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tdrH49"&gt;The look and in-hand feel of the QC45s and QC 35 IIs are extremely similar. The only telltale sign that distinguishes the new headphones from older models is the USB-C port at the bottom of the right ear cup. A more subtle clue is that the Bose logo is no longer raised and is now just stamped onto the ear cups. Otherwise, it’s difficult to tell them apart by eyeballing it. The newer headphones weigh slightly more (8.5 ounces compared to 8.3), but that’s not a difference I ever noticed when wearing them. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/elZHFrgmyXUCuG0habSuXVHvUOo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22887195/DSCF5714_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s WH-1000XM4 headphones at left, Bose’s QC45 at right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PrFUtd"&gt;Staying true to their predecessors, the QC45s are splendidly comfortable. I’ve worn them for stretches of three to five hours without any hint of unpleasant aching or soreness at the top of my head. The clamping force is very gentle, so you won’t feel them squeezing on the sides of your dome — even if you’re like me and have an oversized head. Bose says it has eliminated some “pleats and puckers” and reduced gaps between components, but crucially, none of these minor tweaks have had a negative impact on comfort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TgXlalI_izzjDTJhluluEO1YDBM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883427/cwelch_202109_4775_5625.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bose has made minor design tweaks to the ear cushions and headband.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fsfe4dYJrFIShsAVvbJHpM5F23s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883430/cwelch_202109_4775_5637.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;But other aspects of the hardware stick to a familiar formula.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IkfoBf"&gt;Aside from their physical design contrasts, the QC45s and Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 also approach noise cancellation differently. With the more expensive headphones, Bose gives you precise control over the amount of ANC applied, so you can dial in exactly the level you want. But on the newer pair, you only get two choices: “quiet” is standard ANC mode, and “aware” is a transparency feature that pipes in environmental sound. Bose uses voice prompts to tell you which mode you’re in, and the “quiet” one amusingly sounds like you’re being scolded to shush. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RkBxYb"&gt;Strangely, at least right now, there’s no way to switch off both noise cancellation and transparency. You’ve got to pick one or the other, so you can’t listen to the QC45s in a more basic mode that would rely only on their natural passive noise isolation. This seems like a very weird thing to leave out, so I’m hoping Bose will add a simple “ANC off” option down the line. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mHkiXDu6qgODOi5epwiq-FC2wf4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883431/cwelch_202109_4775_5643.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s no way to turn ANC off unless you activate aware mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vnOBKI"&gt;That noise cancellation is a step up in its effectiveness from the QC35 IIs, and it’s right about on par with the Noise Cancelling Headphones 700, Sony’s WH-1000XM4s, and the Apple AirPods Max. All of these headphones now do a tremendous job of quieting your surroundings and putting you in a private bubble with your music, podcasts, movies, or whatever else you’re using them for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gi70ac"&gt;And when you activate Bose’s aware mode, it’s designed not to overwhelm you with a sudden cacophony of outside noise. The company says it aimed for a balanced volume that lets you hear your environment without taking anything away from your tunes. I appreciate the intention — and the mix does work well — but this is another area where letting people dial in the level of ambient sound would’ve been nice. And again, that’s something the Noise Canceling Headphones 700 will give you, but not these. Wind noise is very noticeable and can get aggravating when you’re in aware mode, but it’s handled much better when ANC is enabled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yxvxe6VF9qPqH6WPKp_lxLFnWcg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884900/DSCF5660_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The QC45s can fold down for efficient storage in a bag.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wgr0aV"&gt;Bose also decided to forgo other nice-to-have features like automatic pausing when you remove the headphones. And the company doesn’t seem interested in matching Sony’s “speak to chat” trick where the headphones will temporarily pause audio whenever they detect that you’re speaking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nIgKE7"&gt;I can do without those, but I’m more annoyed by other omissions. You still can’t use the QC45s while they’re plugged in and charging. And charging is all that happens when you attach a USB-C cable; Bose doesn’t support audio over that connection, which is disappointing for headphones that cost over $300. There’s still the Bose-standard 2.5mm audio jack for wired listening with the included 2.5-to-3.5mm cable. So long as the battery isn’t dead, ANC also works in wired mode. You can even continue to listen plugged in when the battery is depleted — albeit with no noise cancellation and much worse sound quality since Bose’s Active EQ doesn’t work without power. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b-iZV9xEFUKiJDZhGMNARZ1brkY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883424/cwelch_202109_4775_5647.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It would’ve been nice to see some EQ options in the Bose Music app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="klsuuF"&gt;Speaking of EQ, Bose doesn’t currently let you customize it on the QuietComfort 45s, but you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; on the Noise Cancelling Headphones 700. Considering the price of the QC45s, there’s no excuse not to add EQ adjustments to these headphones. It’s too important of a feature to be positioned as some differentiator when both of these cans are so expensive. The adjustable noise cancellation is enough to set the NCH 700s apart. Bose tells me there are no immediate plans for firmware updates or pending new features for the QC45s. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TYfHRYTdCFMDEdI-n4_c21gXLkU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22887196/DSCF5709.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll have a hard time finding a more comfortable pair of headphones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="765PNx"&gt;And then there’s the sound, which from what the company tells me, hasn’t changed one iota from the QuietComfort 35 IIs — at least not on purpose. There are &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dms3tv/status/1441178996096462851?s=21"&gt;some early technical measurements&lt;/a&gt; that show Bose has cleaned up the tuning a bit, but to my ears and those I’ve let demo both headphones, they’re very, very close. And to me, that’s a good outcome. If there’s one consistency among Bose headphones, it’s that they’re remarkably &lt;em&gt;listenable&lt;/em&gt;. The bass is subdued compared to Sony’s 1000XM4s, and the high end is similarly laid back and never too sharp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bose has made the switch to USB-C.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The headphones come in black or “smoke white.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sUtykDR4PMUFukcSKFt0yrYwkRY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883432/cwelch_202109_4775_5610.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This button toggles between ANC and transparency modes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NiGnIYP7OPocgnfM7T0ro51iKso=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883428/cwelch_202109_4775_5630.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The volume and multi-function buttons are very similar to the controls from the QC35 IIs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8xnsTy"&gt;These aren’t headphones that are going to fill your ears with captivating detail or a sophisticated soundstage, but unless you need a ton of boom from the bass, there’s really nothing I’d label underwhelming about the audio. Bose continues to support multipoint for two simultaneous connections, and the QC45s now have Bluetooth 5.1 for expanded range and more robust performance. As for codecs, they stick to the very status quo SBC and AAC, leaving out more advanced options like aptX Adaptive or LDAC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="3mY0uA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10779967"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XpWwpB"&gt;Sound quality might be largely unchanged, but Bose &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; made refinements to microphone performance. There’s now a fourth external mic that aids with voice pickup, and Bose says a noise-rejecting algorithm filters out background sounds for clearer calls than were possible on the QC35 IIs. Everyone said I came through clearly and that nothing sounded muffled when making phone calls or chatting over Zoom with the QC45s. Battery life has also very modestly improved from 20 hours to 24 on the new headphones. They can be fully charged up in 2.5 hours, and in a low-battery pinch, a 15-minute top-off should get you three hours of listening time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CfwxVOxP9R5WhpCDNHgKf8id3m4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883435/cwelch_202109_4775_5619.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other supported features include multipoint and synced audio with Bose’s soundbars.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="QT2a1g"&gt;The QuietComfort 45s are Bose at its best. They’re not some grand departure, and they adhere so closely to what’s come before that it’s easy to perceive them as less ambitious than the Noise Cancelling Headphones 700. But with their enhancements to noise cancellation, a useful new aware mode, and other tweaks, Bose has added ample appeal to what was already a solid foundation. And you’re not simply going to find a more comfortable pair of noise-canceling headphones. I just hope the company unlocks their fullest potential with some firmware updates in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
