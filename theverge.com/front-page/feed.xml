    <title>Google says it’s working to get ‘Hey Google’ working on Wear OS again</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YeHoGE"&gt;Activating the Google Assistant by saying “Hey Google” has been broken for months, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/24/wear-os-hey-google-assistant-broken/"&gt;according to a report from 9to5Google&lt;/a&gt;. Google tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it’s now working on a fix, saying that it’s “aware of the issues some users have been encountering” and will help its partners “address these and improve the overall experience.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LVjWHn"&gt;There are a good number of users reporting the issue — a post &lt;a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/172776291"&gt;on Google’s Issue Tracker&lt;/a&gt; has almost a thousand stars. Reading through the thread, it’s clear that many users with different smartwatch models are all reporting the same issue going back to November 2020. They say the assistant isn’t completely unusable, as users are still able to trigger it with a long button-press, but if the voice-activation feature hasn’t been working for that long, it likely doesn’t help the perception &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21518580/youtube-music-apple-watch-app-wear-os-wearable-problems"&gt;that Google doesn’t care about Wear OS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vsPAbp"&gt;Google’s statement doesn’t make it clear how long it’ll be until the issue is fixed, but hopefully it’s getting attention now. While Wear OS may not be core to Google’s strategy, the Assistant seems to be, and it’d be nice for people who have chosen to put Google’s OS on their wrists to have easy access to it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this story about a plane crash survivor who researches memory and trauma</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UI2MSbPZQJLAQmhXvJFICoZcsu4=/0x112:2040x1472/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68871177/SUBNET_Final_1.0.1412976335.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="http://www.darpa.mil/NewsEvents/Releases/2014/05/27a.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;DARPA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="58DX8b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; has done &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/remember-disaster-without-being-shattered-ptsd-covid/?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;mbid=social_twitter&amp;amp;utm_brand=wired&amp;amp;utm_social-type=owned&amp;amp;utm_medium=social"&gt;an amazing piece on Margaret McKinnon&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher who survived a traumatic plane crash, then went on to become a leader in the field of memory and trauma. The article starts off with a harrowing recounting of the accident, but then goes on to explain her research around it, as she gathered other survivors from the crash to conduct a study on how people remember a disaster — one which she participated in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="isgr0z"&gt;And so it was that, in 2004, as a guinea pig in her own research, McKinnon found herself lying face-up inside of a magnetic resonance imaging machine, staring up at a mirror reflecting a projection of B-roll from &lt;em&gt;Dateline NBC&lt;/em&gt;: A plane taking off from a runway. A map of the flight route. Clips from &lt;em&gt;Chocolat&lt;/em&gt; interspersed between plane animations. McKinnon’s own &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/video/2002-passenger-relives-air-transat-flight-236-318699075750"&gt;younger face&lt;/a&gt; flashed before her eyes too—her barely-there makeup, blue eyes, and bob haircut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="nBf8Gl"&gt;The article gets into the mechanics of PTSD, many of which were revealed in part thanks to McKinnon’s research. It’s a topic that often gets talked about (though arguably still not enough), but &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; goes in deep to explain the difference between simply remembering and reliving. It also touches on the different ways people react to traumatic situations, and some of the underlying causes of those reactions — part of what inspired McKinnon’s work was the very different reactions she and her husband had during and after the crash, which happened just a few weeks before 9/11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Vlr1x"&gt;McKinnon is now turning her attention to the pandemic and its impact on frontline healthcare workers, in hopes that she will be able to help the ones that end up traumatized. The article is not only the story of a woman who, remarkably, turned a terrifying experience into a way to help others, but it helps shed light on an important mental health issue, that unfortunately may become more relevant as the long-term effects of the pandemic start to manifest. It’s &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/remember-disaster-without-being-shattered-ptsd-covid/?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;mbid=social_twitter&amp;amp;utm_brand=wired&amp;amp;utm_social-type=owned&amp;amp;utm_medium=social"&gt;definitely worth a read&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Everything to know about Paramount Plus, ViacomCBS’s new version of CBS All Access</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r9lO2sGnFNotUHUPH9mO-pjtHDk=/528x0:1920x928/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68870758/paramount_plus.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="80do4r"&gt;In just over a week, CBS All Access will become &lt;a href="https://cbsallaccess.qflm.net/c/482924/1001331/3065?sharedid=VergeEverythingtoKnowAboutParamountPlus&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paramountplus.com%2F"&gt;Paramount Plus&lt;/a&gt;, a rebranded version of the streaming service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238502/paramount-plus-launch-date-cbs-all-access-streaming-event-shows-movies"&gt;launching on March 4th&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WM5WO3"&gt;Paramount Plus will use combined franchises and assets from Viacom and CBS (who remerged in 2019) to offer more than 20,000 episodes of television and films from a number of networks. These networks and studios include BET, CBS, Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon, Paramount Pictures. Every announcement made today can be read &lt;a href="https://www.viacomcbs.com/files/2021/02/Paramount-Content-Addendum-2.24.21.pdf"&gt;on ViacomCBS’ site.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6iMsll"&gt;The streaming service will launch at two separate pricing tiers: an ad-supported version that includes full breadth of Paramount movies, Paramount Plus originals, a “massive portion of library,” according to streaming CEO Tom Ryan, and current seasons of CBS shows for $4.99. This is launching in June. The premium tier will have live sports supplemented with even more options, live CBS news feeds, and a live CBS TV experience for $9.99. The company will have more information about bundle options “soon,” according to Ryan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EWR2II"&gt;Customers on premium CBS All Access plans should just automatically roll into Paramount Plus. By the time that Paramount Plus launches, the $5.99 CBS All Access plan will no longer be offered, but existing customers on that plan will be grandfathered into All Access. It’s unclear if they’ll revert back to the ad-supported plan once that option becomes available in June. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has asked for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oLn7EE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what does that get people?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3PCfoN"&gt;Let’s start with TV fans. Paramount Plus will carry a number of older popular shows, like &lt;em&gt;SpongeBob SquarePants&lt;/em&gt;, as well as new originals based around popular franchises like &lt;em&gt;Criminal Minds &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Godfather. &lt;/em&gt;Nickelodeon is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22297512/avatar-last-airbender-korra-studios-paramount-plus-streaming-netflix"&gt;launching an Avatar Studios&lt;/a&gt; to make more TV series and films based on the world of &lt;em&gt;Avatar: The Last Airbender &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Korra. &lt;/em&gt;Nickelodeon fans, Paramount Plus is also working on a live-action Dora the Explorer series and a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/paramountplus/status/1364718671034273796"&gt;live-action &lt;em&gt;Fairly OddParents&lt;/em&gt; show.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AxuPVu"&gt;Some of the original series announced today include a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299973/frasier-reboot-paramount-plus-streaming-kelsey-grammer"&gt;new &lt;em&gt;Frasier &lt;/em&gt;revival&lt;/a&gt; with Kelsey Grammer set to reprise his role as Dr. Frasier Crane, and several series based on popular Paramount movies, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299958/italian-job-sequel-series-flashdance-fatal-attracion-shows-paramount-plus-streaming"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Italian Job, Flashdance, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Fatal Attraction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;em&gt;Criminal Minds &lt;/em&gt;revival — and all 15 seasons of the original CBS crime procedural — will also stream exclusively on Paramount Plus. Finally, a reboot of &lt;em&gt;Inside Amy Schumer &lt;/em&gt;and a weekly spinoff of &lt;em&gt;The Daily Show &lt;/em&gt;were also ordered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6MPZGk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nickelodeon is &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22297512/avatar-last-airbender-korra-studios-paramount-plus-streaming-netflix" target="_blank"&gt;launching an Avatar Studios&lt;/a&gt; to make more TV series and films based on the world of &lt;em&gt;Avatar: The Last Airbender &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Korra&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PGd9kj"&gt;These series join previously announced titles heading to Paramount Plus. &lt;em&gt;The Offer&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;a limited series based on the making-of process behind &lt;em&gt;The Godfather&lt;/em&gt;; &lt;em&gt;Lioness&lt;/em&gt;, a show about a young marine who is recruited to befriend a terrorist in order to bring down the organization; a reimagining of MTV’s &lt;em&gt;Behind The Music; &lt;/em&gt;a documentary series based on FBI profilers; a revival of BET’s &lt;em&gt;The Game; &lt;/em&gt;a new SpongeBob SquarePants series called &lt;em&gt;Kamp Koral; &lt;/em&gt;and a new version of &lt;em&gt;The Real World&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CPfXFa"&gt;Today’s event also brought with it a ton of movie news. CEO Bob Bakish noted that many Paramount films will go to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21355563/mulan-disney-plus-streaming-exclusive-cost-own-movies-theaters"&gt;Paramount Plus 30 to 45 days&lt;/a&gt; after their theatrical release, with others appearing 90 days after their theatrical release. For example, &lt;em&gt;A Quiet Place 2 &lt;/em&gt;will be available on Paramount Plus just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299995/mission-impossible-7-quiet-place-2-paramount-plus-45-days-after-theaters"&gt;45 days after it’s released&lt;/a&gt; in theaters this September. &lt;em&gt;Mission Impossible 7 &lt;/em&gt;and the &lt;em&gt;Paw Patrol &lt;/em&gt;film will also appear on Paramount Plus 45 days after their theatrical releases. MGM movies will go to Paramount Plus once they’re out of the theatrical window — that could mean films &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21499362/james-bond-no-time-to-die-delay-april-2021"&gt;like &lt;em&gt;No Time To Die&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; Also, some new movies, including feature projects based on &lt;em&gt;Beavis and Butt-head, Workaholics, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Pet Semetary,&lt;/em&gt; will be made exclusively for Paramount Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3NP5iM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Today, ViacomCBS announced it has &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299240/cbs-all-access-subscriber-numbers-paramount-plus-showtime" target="_blank"&gt;19.2 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt; between CBS All Access and Showtime &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vKmVso"&gt;Much like CBS All Access, Paramount Plus will also carry some aspect of live sports, news, and events for subscribers. Currently, All Access customers can watch national NFL games carried on CBS via the streaming service, as well as events like the Grammy’s when they air on the network. The company is expanding its sports offering on Paramount Plus, including hosting UEFA soccer games, and other sports that will find a home on the digital service. Paramount Plus will also carry a 24/7 news channel, according to Bakish, and local news and weather updates for subscribers depending on their region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k8OwrJ"&gt;Today, ViacomCBS announced it has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299240/cbs-all-access-subscriber-numbers-paramount-plus-showtime"&gt;19.2 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt; between CBS All Access and Showtime (plus 30.1 million monthly active users for free streaming platform, Pluto TV) domestically, but the goal is to use the plethora of franchises and networks to really compete in the streaming wars. Disney Plus is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278874/disney-plus-94-9-million-subscribers-q1-2021-earnings"&gt;nearing 100 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt;, and HBO Max has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252069/hbo-max-subscribers-wonder-woman-1984-att-earnings"&gt;17.2 million activations&lt;/a&gt;. Peacock, one of Paramount Plus’ biggest competitors in terms of similar offerings, has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253988/peacock-nbcuniversal-comcast-streaming-broadband"&gt;33 million users&lt;/a&gt;, although it’s unclear how many are paid subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fRfQmN"&gt;ViacomCBS executives also addressed an international rollout for Paramount Plus. It will launch in Latin America and Canada on the same day as the US, with Australia and the Nordics in the weeks and months to follow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="x3be1s"&gt;

    <title>Nvidia made $5 billion during a GPU shortage and expects to do it again in Q1</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BPblJRq3sMkPnXCeUEq2wuoYTcs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68870718/acastro_180529_1777_nvidia_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y1AzJK"&gt;Nvidia has shared &lt;a href="http://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/02/24/2181882/0/en/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-2021.html"&gt;its Q4 2021 earnings&lt;/a&gt;, and despite the company’s GPUs being in extremely low supply, it didn’t seem to hurt how much money the company made. In fact, it reported a record $5 billion in revenue, which is up 61 percent year-over-year. What’s more impressive is that Nvidia expects to make another $5 billion in revenue during Q1 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="53eXog"&gt;This positive outlook is surprising given that Q1 is generally slower than other quarters, even for the biggest tech companies, as it follows the rush of people buying lots of products during the holiday period. It’s generally a slower period in general for product releases across tech and gaming. Also, let’s not forget the GPU shortage is still happening. Nvidia reiterated that sparse supply will continue through the next quarter, but that’s likely factored into its rosy revenue prediction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aYPRBs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sparse GPU supply will continue through the next quarter&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CnTsUU"&gt;Nvidia says it expects most of that $5 billion revenue estimate in Q1 2022 to come from the gaming market, despite being the segment it’s currently having the toughest time serving. Since the launch of the RTX 30-series desktop graphics cards, leading with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21435926/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-review"&gt;RTX 3080&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/1/21417048/nvidia-rtx-3090-gpu-flagship-8k-pc-gaming-price-specs"&gt;3090&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21534142/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-review"&gt;3070&lt;/a&gt;, and followed by other products, Nvidia hasn’t been able to meet the demand — though it’s not the only company affected. AMD has also struggled, perhaps more than Nvidia, to keep a steady stock of graphics cards heading to retailers. My colleague Sean Hollister &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227040/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-3070-3060-ti-3090-rx-6800-xt"&gt;got comments from both companies on the shortage&lt;/a&gt;. The ongoing pandemic has certainly played a role in this, and possibly the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278431/biden-administration-global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-executive-order"&gt;shortage of semiconductor chips&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8hOEGO"&gt;Nvidia recently announced that it’s trying to make it easier for gamers, not cryptocurrency miners, to get its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280277/nvidia-rtx-3060-graphics-card-release-date-time"&gt;RTX 3060 desktop graphics card that’s releasing tomorrow for $329&lt;/a&gt;. It’s doing that by implementing GPU driver &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289154/nvidia-rtx-3060-ethereum-mining-drivers-limit-cryptocurrency"&gt;software that weakens its ability to farm Ethereum by half&lt;/a&gt;, in an effort to discourage crypto miners from buying it. It will also introduce its CMP dedicated mining processor in March, which Nvidia is making to serve the mining community with the hope that they’ll leave more of the gaming GPUs for gamers to purchase. Interestingly, Nvidia said during its investor call that cryptocurrency-related sales accounted for a small slice of its total revenue — just $300 million of $5 billion, suggesting that miners didn’t play a major role in the GPU shortage.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch the trailer for the Rugrats reboot headed to Paramount Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T5vYZFFJTxk_3V9NqGkSWcZcaKY=/384x0:4536x2768/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68870487/PressArt_Rugrats_Babies_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nickelodeon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a2B3im"&gt;A &lt;em&gt;Rugrats&lt;/em&gt; reboot is headed to the new streaming service Paramount Plus this spring, ViacomCBS announced today. The show is described as a “reimagining of the classic ‘90s hit,” and you can see a preview of the new CG-animated style in this trailer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0Nolcb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sNky0GJG1x0?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4Osq5R"&gt;But even though the animation might look different, many of the characters should sound the same — Tommy Pickles, Chuckie Finster, Angelica Pickles, Susie Carmichael, and Phil and Lil DeVille will all be voiced by their original voice actors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dsLR2x"&gt;The new show is produced by Nickelodeon Animation Studio, according to a press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hJN3NP"&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Rugrats&lt;/em&gt; is one of the most iconic cartoons recognized by fans around the globe, and this original version is one we are taking great care and pride in creating for a brand-new audience,” said Ramsey Naito, President, Nickelodeon Animation, in a statement. “Having the voice cast behind these special characters come together is one of the essential pieces to making the show recognizable and we can’t wait to watch this talented group bring them to life again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GDNQFB"&gt;The original show debuted in August 1991, and was a staple of my childhood. I’m curious to see how this reboot turns out. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nickelodeon creates Avatar Studios to create new Avatar, Legend of Korra content</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Avatar: The Last Airbender" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_ANYol0bMRLn6zaTXMv4vF04fUM=/5x0:2366x1574/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68870437/Screen_Shot_2020_07_21_at_9.38.25_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Nickelodeon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X0uJwa"&gt;ViacomCBS has announced a new studio based entirely around &lt;em&gt;Avatar: The Last Airbender &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Korra&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rJzdxd"&gt;Avatar Studios will create “original content spanning animated series and movies,” according to a press release. &lt;em&gt;Avatar &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Korra&lt;/em&gt; original creators, Michael DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, are joining Nickelodeon as co-chief creative officers of Avatar Studios. The first project is an animated theatrical title set to begin production soon. More information will be announced soon, according to the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0NxMBb"&gt;Having exclusive &lt;em&gt;Avatar &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Korra &lt;/em&gt;content is pretty key for Nickelodeon and ViacomCBS’ new streaming service, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238502/paramount-plus-launch-date-cbs-all-access-streaming-event-shows-movies"&gt;Paramount Plus&lt;/a&gt;. While the company’s business strategy is to license out a number of its shows and films on a non-exclusive basis, by the time &lt;em&gt;Avatar &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Korra &lt;/em&gt;returned to Netflix, subscribers may have associated the show specifically with the streaming platform. The show became the most watched title on Netflix around May 22nd, when it returned to Netflix. The series&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;was also &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLastAirbender/comments/6y9ofw/no_spoilers_i_think_amazon_just_took_down_avatar/"&gt;previously available on Amazon Prime Video&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TYZsnw"&gt;Having those licensing agreements is financially beneficial to ViacomCBS right now, according to comments CEO Bob Bakish has made on previous earnings calls. Some of Netflix’s most watched shows in the US remain ViacomCBS titles, including &lt;em&gt;Criminal Minds&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Shameless&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; NCIS&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Schitt’s Creek&lt;/em&gt;. In order to bring people in and get them to subscribe, however, Paramount Plus needs its own exclusives. This is where having a new &lt;em&gt;Avatar &lt;/em&gt;series could ultimately be very beneficial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hM7hsN"&gt;Paramount Plus is ViacomCBS’s rebranded entry into the streaming space. It will launch on March 4th. After Viacom and CBS merged again in 2019, the unified company set out to find a way to use its entire breadth of programming and franchises to make a true competitor to Netflix, Amazon, HBO Max, and Disney’s empire (Disney Plus and Hulu). The new streaming service will have more than 30,000 TV episodes and films from across its various brands, including BET, CBS, Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon, and Paramount Pictures, alongside some aspect of live sports and news. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fY8lDO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Star Trek: Prodigy will debut on Paramount Plus first before heading to Nickelodeon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N1WDU2RRWuQXmHC2ZY91TDrEyHA=/0x4:620x417/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68870370/star_trek_prodigy_logo_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="efZtjj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cbsallaccess.qflm.net/c/482924/1001331/3065?sharedid=VergeStarTrekProdigyParamountPlusNic02242021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbs.com%2Fcbs-all-access%2Finterstitial%2F1%2F"&gt;Paramount Plus&lt;/a&gt; is getting another &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; show, the company announced at its kickoff event: &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Prodigy&lt;/em&gt;, the animated kid-friendly spinoff of the iconic franchise. &lt;em&gt;Prodigy&lt;/em&gt; was originally set to debut on Nickelodeon, but it will instead air all ten episodes of its first season on Paramount Plus before eventually heading over to the cable channel at a later date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZlgoZ"&gt;In addition to the shift in location, Paramount also announced more details on the upcoming series, which will feature a group of teens adventuring on an abandoned starship throughout the &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; universe. Kate Mulgrew will return to voice Captain Kathryn Janeway, her character from&lt;em&gt; Star Trek: Voyager&lt;/em&gt;. But &lt;em&gt;Prodigy&lt;/em&gt; — the first &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; show intended for kids — will also feature a new crew of younger characters who, in a &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; first, will be entirely made up of alien species (&lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/star-trek-universe-paramount-plus-prodigy-1234914526/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hQDUpmNpMxuxOmt-GJmIfRZU1Jk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22326837/PRODIGY_BRIDGE_CREW_2.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The main characters of Star Trek: Prodigy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="13s558"&gt;The new show joins an increasingly crowded lineup of &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; shows available on the streaming service, including &lt;em&gt;Star Trek Discovery&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Picard&lt;/em&gt;, the animated &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Lower Decks&lt;/em&gt;, the already announced &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&lt;/em&gt;, and the Section 31-focused spinoff starring Michelle Yeoh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XdB2ZX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; is one of Paramount and CBS’s most important brands, so its no surprise to see that the company will be looking to the science fiction franchise to help anchor its service as it begins it rebranding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gaX2qR"&gt;And much like CBS All Access before it, Paramount Plus will be relying on the &lt;em&gt;Trek&lt;/em&gt; shows and films to help flesh out its library, too. The service is already a near-complete one-stop shop for all things &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;, featuring every TV series, both past and current (a list that includes &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: The Original Series&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; The Animated Series&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; The Next Generation&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Deep Space Nine&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Voyager&lt;/em&gt;, and&lt;em&gt; Enterprise&lt;/em&gt;), along with a fair chunk of the films (although several of the earlier movies in the franchise, as well as the rebooted “Kelvin timeline” trilogy, aren’t available yet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ptLTBq"&gt;Paramount Plus is set to debut on March 4th. In addition to a wide catalog of &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; shows and films, the streaming service will also feature content from the company’s lineup of brands, including BET, CBS, Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon, and Paramount Pictures, as well as live sports and news. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mission: Impossible 7 will stream on Paramount Plus just 45 days after it hits theaters </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7e4aRQMXnDdKZ7Dg5hM9-Sk9cMw=/360x0:1554x796/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68870364/Screen_Shot_2018_02_04_at_7.30.08_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Paramount Pictures&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5lfMRS"&gt;Paramount is dramatically shortening the space between theatrical and streaming releases for some of its biggest films, with the company announcing that &lt;em&gt;Mission: Impossible 7&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; A Quiet Place Part II&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Paw Patrol: The Movie&lt;/em&gt; will debut on Paramount Plus just 45 days after they first hit theaters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FrI5hM"&gt;The rapid jump to streaming mirrors moves by other companies, like Universal (which has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21345713/amc-universal-movies-theaters-digital-rentals-pvod-streaming-agreement"&gt;a deal with AMC&lt;/a&gt; to offer films as paid digital rentals just 17 days after they hit theaters) or Warner Bros., which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;debuting all of its 2021 blockbusters&lt;/a&gt; day-and-date on &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;source=Verge&amp;amp;aff_sub=MissionImpossibleSeven022421"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; with their theatrical bows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yNg16m"&gt;Paramount also promised that future films from the studio will stream exclusively on Paramount Plus after their theatrical runs, including &lt;em&gt;Snake Eyes&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Clifford&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Top Gun: Maverick&lt;/em&gt;, the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons&lt;/em&gt; film, and more — although the studio isn’t making the same 45-day promise for those films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g1t8F3"&gt;Additionally, Paramount has licensed films from MGM, like the upcoming James Bond film &lt;em&gt;No Time To Die&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Creed 3&lt;/em&gt; to stream on &lt;a href="https://cbsallaccess.qflm.net/c/482924/998964/3065?subId1=VergeMissionImpossibleSeven022421&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbs.com%2Fall-access%2F%3Fintcid%3DCIAb4ac575"&gt;Paramount Plus &lt;/a&gt;in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Frasier revival in development for Paramount Plus </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EuZfw2bqnf_t8NP40iJ9d-yUX04=/85x0:1015x620/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68870276/frasier.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vDIDI6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frasier &lt;/em&gt;is &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2021/02/frasier-reboot-kelsey-grammer-paramount-plus.html"&gt;coming back&lt;/a&gt; — this time to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238502/paramount-plus-launch-date-cbs-all-access-streaming-event-shows-movies"&gt;Paramount Plus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ye0aMK"&gt;Kelsey Grammer will play the famous psychiatrist that found a legion of fans when the show aired on NBC in the ‘90s in a new revival series. Details about the series are limited right now, but the show will exist exclusively on Paramount Plus. It’s unclear if characters like Niles, Roz, and Daphne will return for the show. The show was first rumored in 2018. What remains unclear is if the entire &lt;em&gt;Frasier &lt;/em&gt;library will be available on Paramount Plus exclusively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MLSXxc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frasier &lt;/em&gt;is just one of many shows ViacomCBS announced today as part of its upcoming Paramount Plus lineup. A series based on &lt;em&gt;The Italian Job&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Flashdance&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Fatal Attraction&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and more are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299958/italian-job-sequel-series-flashdance-fatal-attracion-shows-paramount-plus-streaming"&gt;also heading to the platform&lt;/a&gt;. Paramount Plus, which is a rebrand of &lt;a href="https://cbsallaccess.qflm.net/c/482924/998964/3065?subId1=VergeFrasierRevivalParamountPlus022421&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbs.com%2Fall-access%2F%3Fintcid%3DCIAb4ac575"&gt;CBS All Access &lt;/a&gt;that uses all of ViacomCBS’s franchises and networks, will launch on March 4th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cyberpunk 2077’s next big patch delayed to second half of March after studio hack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cyberpunk 2077" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FtvImbX9KA246udBhI-xlVDSYgk=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68867769/Cyberpunk_2077_screen_5.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6BgMK6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077’s&lt;/em&gt; next big patch has been delayed following developer CD Projekt Red’s disclosure that it fell victim to a ransomware attack earlier this month. The next big patch, 1.2, is now scheduled for a release sometime in the second half of March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jUZgzo"&gt;“While we dearly wanted to deliver Patch 1.2 for Cyberpunk 2077 in the timespan we detailed previously, the recent cyber attack on the studio’s IT infrastructure and extensive scope of the update mean this unfortunately will not happen — we’ll need some additional time,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1364607741680115717"&gt;CD Projekt Red said&lt;/a&gt; via the &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; Twitter account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8WQsdR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Our goal for Patch 1.2 goes beyond any of our previous updates. We’ve been working on numerous overall quality improvements and fixes, and we still have work to do to make sure that’s what you get. With that in mind, we’re now aiming for release in the second half of March. 2/3&lt;/p&gt;— Cyberpunk 2077 (@CyberpunkGame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1364607743399755780?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NFMupz"&gt;The ransomware attack has been a source of considerable disruption for CDPR, as it included both source code and personal details of employees and other sensitive information that was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278121/cd-projekt-red-ransomware-hack-cyberpunk-2077-the-witcher-3-auction-sale"&gt;allegedly later sold on the internet&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-24/cd-projekt-hack-severely-disrupts-work-on-cyberpunk-game-updates"&gt;a new report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;, the hack has made it nearly impossible for some CDPR employees to effectively perform their jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L21hEm"&gt;Here’s Jason Schreier for &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reporting the level of disarray the hack has left the studio in: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="kQR2Yc"&gt;CD Projekt has said it refused to pay a ransom to the hackers. As a result, employees remain unable to log onto the company’s virtual private network, making it impossible to access the systems and tools needed to do most of their jobs, said the people, requesting anonymity because they weren’t authorized to talk publicly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpyWAR"&gt;And here’s more information on how the leaking of personal identification data in the hack has caused havoc on the personal lives of employees: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="q0rN1Q"&gt;Despite the unplanned vacation, the hack has been a nightmare for employees. The invaders had access to their personal information including Polish identification numbers and passport details, leading the company to tell staff to freeze their accounts and report the security breach to the government and their banks, said the people familiar with the matter. Workers were also asked to ship their computers to the company’s IT staff to be scanned for malware or other intrusions, the people said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="nUgv92"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; launched in an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197547/cyberpunk-2077-glitches"&gt;extremely buggy state&lt;/a&gt;, which led Sony to take the drastic step of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188007/sony-cyberpunk-2077-removed-playstation-store-full-refunds-policy"&gt;removing the game from the PlayStation Store&lt;/a&gt;.
