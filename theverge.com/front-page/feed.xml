    <title>Online researchers scramble to identify Capitol raid participants</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3rOPcb"&gt;For years, police have been warning about the dangers of crowdsourced detective work — but on Thursday morning, the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) of Washington, DC decided to do just that. In the wake of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217601/congress-capitol-building-takeover-coup-photos-pro-trump-mob"&gt;an unprecedented mob attack on the Capitol building&lt;/a&gt;, the MPD has released an open call for help identifying subjects. The department has circulated &lt;a href="https://mpdc.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/mpdc/publication/attachments/POIs%20of%20Interest_1.7.21.pdf"&gt;a digital booklet&lt;/a&gt; featuring 26 pages of faces from the attack, with a hotline number for anyone who can help identify them. The FBI has &lt;a href="https://tips.fbi.gov/digitalmedia/aad18481a3e8f02"&gt;made a similar request&lt;/a&gt;, although neither agency has produced any arrests as a result of the photos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fhuaYd"&gt;The alarming nature of the attack, combined with the failure of Capitol Police to detain or process the intruders, has led to a nationwide digital manhunt. The event was captured in hundreds of photos, videos, and live streams, revealing the faces of dozens of perpetrators. Now, researchers are rushing to identify and prosecute those faces as a way to reassert control, drawing a wealth of tweets, live streams, and Instagram posts into an open-source almanac of everyone who can be reliably tied to the attack. It’s a more reliable version of the internet detective work that crashed and burned in earlier online communities — but this time, the footage is spread across hundreds of different sources, and the police are in on the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YvJEGW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We aim to collect enough information to understand what happened.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2ypm5a"&gt;There’s so much available footage of the rally that simply collecting it has proven to be a challenge. Since the attack began, the open-source intelligence outlet Bellingcat has been collecting first-hand media from the attack, a process they opened up to volunteers &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YdYWj-LQ5mAg3je0bogfrm5IjXjviyiX0yUu4M7ZSD8/edit#gid=560421713"&gt;as a Google sheet&lt;/a&gt; when the severe scale of the attack became clear. There are now more than 100 videos and a dozen full-length live streams in the spreadsheet, all ruthlessly monitored for duplicates and any identifiable faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kYotV6"&gt;“We aim to collect enough information to understand what happened,” says Bellingcat researcher Nick Waters, who is running the project. “A major part of that will be to examine who led this attack against the Capitol. We’ve already seen multiple notable members of the far-right who were part of it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M3V9ni"&gt;A parallel project has formed &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/krx449/megathread_archiving_the_capitol_hill_riots/"&gt;on Reddit’s Data Hoarders forum&lt;/a&gt;, where a volunteer effort has begun scraping and archiving content at a massive scale. Launched last night, a thread shows 100 tweets and more than 12GB of data added to a collectively managed torrent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5Pa0r2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are basically doing their job.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tHUqE0"&gt;When one commenter offered a link to the FBI’s tips page, another shot back that there was no point. “Dude, the FBI has been all over this thread for hours,” &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/krx449/megathread_archiving_the_capitol_hill_riots/gif2rhq/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;he wrote&lt;/a&gt;. “We are basically doing their job.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="quzemZ"&gt;It’s a new look for Reddit, which once represented the irresponsible side of online detective work. In 2013, the platform was at the center of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/18/4238768/online-witch-hunt-for-boston-bomber-leads-to-ny-post-cover-photo-mess"&gt;a chaotic search&lt;/a&gt; for the perpetrator of the Boston Marathon bombing. Poring through publicly available footage of the moments leading up to the explosion, volunteer investigators ended up identifying two innocent men as perpetrators of the crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kl2zjD"&gt;This time, the work seems to be proceeding more carefully and successfully. In fact, many of the people in the MPD’s digital lineup have already been identified through this kind of open-source detective work. One of the most prominent figures in the Senate chamber — seen both roaming the halls and posing on the Senate dais — was identified early by journalist Will Sommer, who &lt;a href="https://www.statesman.com/story/news/politics/politifact/2021/01/07/face-painted-man-horned-fur-cap-capitol-riot-supports-trump-and-qanon-not-antifa/6578929002/"&gt;recognized him as QAnon promoter Jake Angeli&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2021/01/07/capitol-riots-indiana-connections-chaos-washington-d-c/6579234002/"&gt;Others like Jason Tankersley&lt;/a&gt; (a member of the Maryland Skinheads) were identified by anti-fascist activists who recognized the man from previous white supremacist rallies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0nh7JQ"&gt;In each case, the identification was important not just as a potential lead for police but for establishing a clear record of the attack. Already, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2021/01/07/conservative-media-capitol-breach-reaction-tucker-carlson-sean-hannity/"&gt;right-wing pundits&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218601/matt-gaetz-antifa-capitol-hill-riot-xrvision-facial-recognition-washington-times-story-false"&gt;sitting members of Congress&lt;/a&gt; have suggested the attack was an antifa false flag, disregarding the widespread Trump paraphernalia and clear connection to the Trump rally earlier that day. But the identifications so far show how hollow that claim really is, with most identified participants having clear ties to either QAnon or white supremacist groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1oYr0T"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TreWardWBAL/status/1347226070085480448"&gt;Several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/followgoosehead/status/1347195897650819072"&gt;companies&lt;/a&gt; have publicly cut ties with employees spotted at the raid, but they are careful to avoid naming the employee in public statements, mindful of doxxing concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NkO10h"&gt;In other cases, the identifications have been more chaotic. On Instagram, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/homegrownterrorists/"&gt;accounts like Homegrown Terrorists&lt;/a&gt; have dedicated themselves entirely to soliciting tips and identifying participants— in some cases &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CJuuMQfng9K/c/17894290423817490/r/17880492959040249/"&gt;matching incorrect names to photos&lt;/a&gt;. In theory, Instagram has a policy against any content that “threatens to release an individual’s private phone number, residential address, or email address” — but enforcement is spotty in practice, and the account has remained up, growing to 60,000 followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="otqsFp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217421/capitol-building-trump-mob-protest-live-stream-youtube-twitch-facebook"&gt;Facebook has pledged&lt;/a&gt; to actively remove video taken by raid participants, seeing it as an incitement of violence. But those platform policies have meant that much of the content used to identify the crowd is already disappearing, despite the best efforts of the Reddit archivists — sometimes from Facebook and Twitter moderation and other times from mob participants catching on to the growing dragnet. Waters says he’s already seen videos disappear from prominent streamers, and “I have zero doubt others will too.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GGAVCP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>App-based banking service Simple is shutting down</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7aoXZQi9--xdb3V7nTcOvcrALMk=/0x131:1200x931/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68634808/simple_card.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Simple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vkaTaE"&gt;Online-only bank Simple is shutting down, its parent company announced in an email to customers Thursday. BBVA USA, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/20/5429916/bbva-acquires-simple-117-million-cash"&gt;acquired Simple in 2014&lt;/a&gt; for $117 million, said it would be transitioning Simple customers to BBVA accounts but did not provide details about when the change would occur. BBVA USA was &lt;a href="https://pnc.mediaroom.com/2020-11-16-PNC-Announces-Agreement-To-Buy-BBVA-USA-Bancshares-Inc"&gt;acquired by Pittsburgh-based PNC Bank&lt;/a&gt; in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wZ8boF"&gt;In the email to users, which many shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, BBVA said the decision to close Simple was a strategic one and said customers did not need to take any immediate action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="J2YLLq"&gt;There is no immediate impact to your accounts at Simple and nothing you need to do at this time. Since your deposits are already housed at BBVA USA, they will remain in FDIC insured accounts there, up to the applicable limits. In the future, your Simple account will become exclusively services by BBVA USA, but until then you can continue to access your account and your money through the Simple app or online at Simple.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="43ooDO"&gt;Stimulus payments and other direct deposits won’t be affected, according to the note to customers. “We will provide ongoing transparent and open communication, so you know what to expect each step of the way,” the company wrote. More details will be coming in the future, according to the emails. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QP3nKr"&gt;At the time of the BBVA acquisition, Simple had about 100,000 users. When it launched in 2010, Simple quickly amassed a waiting list of 125,000 people attracted to the online-only, streamlined experience Simple promised. When Google Wallet shut down in 2016, Google &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/google-ending-support-for-wallet-cards/"&gt;recommended Simple&lt;/a&gt; as a possible replacement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zB2Uvn"&gt;BBVA said in a &lt;a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/news/bbva-usa-shuts-down-neobank-simple"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; Thursday that it was closing Simple as part of the PNC acquisition, as it was “accelerating some changes and stopping work on others.” Once that acquisition closes, the former Simple customers will become PNC customers, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1pT4xb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hlsM3Q"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VftVES"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Play this long-lost Tomb Raider remake</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sACjQw9JN4WQnRk8puccYkvldlo=/9x0:1118x739/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68634789/Screen_Shot_2021_01_07_at_10.46.05_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9jkP9e"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider: 10th Anniversary&lt;/em&gt;, a remake of the original &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; game for Sony’s PSP that was canceled in 2006, has recently resurfaced as a playable alpha, &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/a-lost-tomb-raider-remake-has-resurfaced-and-you-can-play-it/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The game was being developed by Core Design before it was shuttered in favor of Crystal Dynamics’ cross-platform &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider: Anniversary&lt;/em&gt; and&lt;em&gt; Tomb Raider: Legend, &lt;/em&gt;a reimagining of the origin story of treasure-hunter Lara Croft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ARYp4w"&gt;The playable alpha features the climbing, swimming, and general platforming of the original game minus dialogue and enemies. It’s a neat throwback to an older style of &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; in contrast to the more cinematic and realistic approach the newer games take. The alpha includes levels set in Greece, Peru, and Croft Manor. You can see a sample of gameplay of the game in the YouTube video below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tdrQz9"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gf2_0L6rRzs?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xw909o"&gt;The journey the alpha files and assets have taken to get here hasn’t been an entirely straightforward one. Core Design, the original creators of &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raide&lt;/em&gt;r, was ultimately sold by its publisher Eidos to Rebellion following the canceled remake. The unfinished game was then reskinned as a demo for &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-01-07-original-developer-of-tomb-raider-tried-to-salvage-cancelled-10th-anniversary-edition-with-indiana-jones-and-national-treasure-pitches"&gt;an &lt;em&gt;Indiana Jones&lt;/em&gt; game for LucasArts&lt;/a&gt; and as a &lt;em&gt;National Treasure &lt;/em&gt;game. Neither pitch was ultimately picked up, and the PSP game faded into history and the memories of fans — until now. If you’re curious about the development of &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; and Core Design’s history, &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-10-27-20-years-on-the-tomb-raider-story-told-by-the-people-who-were-there"&gt;&lt;em&gt;EuroGamer &lt;/em&gt;has a great feature&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BnHy4w"&gt;To try out the game for yourself, you’ll have to download the files from &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/IndyTRAEbuild"&gt;the Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt; and follow the instructions on &lt;a href="https://www.tomb-of-ash.com/trae-indy-build/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tomb of Ash&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(a &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider &lt;/em&gt;fan site) to get the game patched and playable. From there, you’re ready for a taste of gaming history that never came to pass.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch is having a partial outage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5GIdHu56GdzTV9SZHX6AEZBXZGE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68634683/acastro_190812_1777_twitch_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="08btwY"&gt;Twitch is experiencing a partial outage as of Thursday afternoon. “We are investigating an issue causing various features on Twitch not to load,” the company said in a statement &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitchSupport/status/1347286791544565760"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. “Stay tuned!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TMSV00"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;  We are investigating an issue causing various features on Twitch not to load. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;— Twitch Support (@TwitchSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitchSupport/status/1347286791544565760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MfqgsM"&gt;&lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/twitch/"&gt;Downdetector shows&lt;/a&gt; that user reports began to rise at 3:35PM ET. I was able to navigate to the site’s homepage, but the carousel of featured streams didn’t load. In one instance, when I clicked into a stream, it briefly loaded before the site showed an error message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3FRGBG"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://status.twitch.tv/"&gt;Twitch status page&lt;/a&gt; says that the company has “identified an issue causing Twitch to fail to load in some cases.” While the status page only notes “degraded performance” for the web, I was also seeing errors while navigating the iOS app.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max to get Weathering with You, Promare, and the latest Studio Ghibli film</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UNhCSoahnJjrL1N_0V_FuyClVKo=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68634651/Promare_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Studio Trigger&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MrJ3Vp"&gt;HBO Max is continuing its strong anime streak with the addition of four new films, two documentaries, and an upcoming Studio Ghibli movie this month, courtesy of distributor GKIDS Films, which is best known for running the international distribution of works from legendary director Hayao Miyazaki. Some of these can be seen on Netflix, but only outside the US due to licensing restrictions as HBO parent company WarnerMedia &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/17/20919325/studio-ghibli-stream-hbo-max-spirited-away-kikis-delivery-service-my-neighbor-totoro"&gt;secured the US rights to most (but not all) of Ghibli’s catalog&lt;/a&gt; and works closely with GKIDS for rights to non-Ghibli titles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZxKA0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Earwig and the Witch&lt;/em&gt;, the latest Ghibli movie and the third directorial work from Miyazaki’s son Gorō, will &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/studio-ghiblis-earwig-and-the-witch-gets-theatrical-hbo-max-release-dates"&gt;debut on HBO Max on February 5th&lt;/a&gt;, following a limited theatrical release two days prior. The film is based on the work of British fantasy novelist Diana Wynne Jones (who also penned the book which was then adapted into Ghibli’s &lt;em&gt;Howl’s Moving Castle&lt;/em&gt;), and it will be made available in both Japanese with subtitles and English dub. It marks Ghibli’s &lt;a href="https://gkids.com/films/earwig-and-the-witch/"&gt;first foray into computer-generated animation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YE9CwQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Kick off the new year with these beloved movies coming to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hbomax?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@HBOMax&lt;/a&gt; this month! &lt;a href="https://t.co/knKrhaf99J"&gt;pic.twitter.com/knKrhaf99J&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— GKIDS Films (@GKIDSfilms) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GKIDSfilms/status/1346199726341943297?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zE1rzI"&gt;As for the previously released films coming to HBO Max, they include some major names. The biggest of the bunch is Makoto Shinkai’s &lt;em&gt;Weathering with You&lt;/em&gt;, one of the most popular films ever released in Japan and the follow-up to Shinkai’s worldwide success with 2016’s &lt;em&gt;Your Name&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="weNZ9C"&gt;Also included is Studio Trigger’s &lt;em&gt;Promare&lt;/em&gt;, a visually astonishing action film from the animators now working on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21303233/cyberpunk-2077-anime-edgerunners-netflix-studio-trigger-2022-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 &lt;/em&gt;spinoff anime &lt;em&gt;Edgerunners&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and best known for producing TV series &lt;em&gt;Kill la Kill &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Darling In the Franxx&lt;/em&gt;. HBO Max subscribers will also get access to romantic comedy &lt;em&gt;The Night is Short, Walk on Girl &lt;/em&gt;(from &lt;em&gt;Devilman Crybaby &lt;/em&gt;director Masaaki Yuasa) and the surfing-centric drama &lt;em&gt;Ride Your Wave&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T6El5T"&gt;Included in all of these new additions to HBO Max are two Miyazaki documentaries. The first is 2013’s &lt;em&gt;Never-Ending Man: Hayao Miyazaki&lt;/em&gt;, a Japanese television documentary directed by Kaku Arakawa that first aired after Miyazaki’s &lt;a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/studio-ghibli-founder-hayao-miyazaki-confirms-no-longer-retired-1990162#:~:text=News%20Film%20News-,Studio%20Ghibli%20founder%20Hayao%20Miyazaki%20confirms%20he%20is%20no%20longer,making%20his%2012th%20feature%20film.&amp;amp;text=Studio%20Ghibli%20co%2Dfounder%20Hayao,officially%20come%20out%20of%20retirement."&gt;premature retirement announcement nearly a decade ago&lt;/a&gt;. The second is &lt;em&gt;The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness&lt;/em&gt;, another documentary released in 2013 that follows Miyazaki and other Ghibli co-founders as the studio produced &lt;em&gt;The Wind Rises&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Tale of the Princess Kaguya&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7b8Ptr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Weathering with You &lt;/em&gt;is available now in English dub only, although GKIDS Films says it’s working to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GKIDSfilms/status/1346231639492407301"&gt;add the original Japanese language option to the stream&lt;/a&gt;. The other additions will be coming to HBO Max throughout the month. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Boeing criminally charged for lying about 737 Max crashes, fined $2.5 billion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lf-rtfKoiB2aiLIvHO4wSNztRbc=/0x0:6240x4160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68634639/1132062499.jpg.0.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KOXOJM"&gt;Boeing has been criminally charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States by the Department of Justice and will have to pay a $2.5 billion fine for lying to the Federal Aviation Administration before and after the fatal 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aygU1K"&gt;The Justice Department &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/boeing-charged-737-max-fraud-conspiracy-and-agrees-pay-over-25-billion"&gt;announced the charges and fine&lt;/a&gt;, which were part of a deferred prosecution agreement, on Thursday. The $2.5 billion fine includes a $243.6 million “criminal monetary penalty,” $1.77 billion that will be paid out to airlines that were customers of the plane, and $500 million that will go to a fund to help families and relatives of the people who died in the two crashes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1KFO9a"&gt;Boeing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/3/20681261/boeing-737-max-fund-families-crash-victims"&gt;previously announced a $100 million fund&lt;/a&gt; for families and loved ones of the 346 people who died in the crashes. Boeing &lt;a href="https://investors.boeing.com/investors/investor-news/press-release-details/2019/Boeing-Reports-Record-2018-Results-and-Provides-2019-Guidance/default.aspx"&gt;generated $100 billion in revenue and $12 billion in profit&lt;/a&gt; in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="O88zJ2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Boeing generated $100 billion in revenue and $12 billion in profit in 2018&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lwTY6l"&gt;“The misleading statements, half-truths, and omissions communicated by Boeing employees to the FAA impeded the government’s ability to ensure the safety of the flying public,” US Attorney Erin Nealy Cox said in a statement. “This case sends a clear message: The Department of Justice will hold manufacturers like Boeing accountable for defrauding regulators – especially in industries where the stakes are this high.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WiKJz2"&gt;Boeing’s 737 Max was supposed to be a plane that helped the company keep pace with a new, more fuel-efficient offering from rival Airbus. But the company rushed the design, and as a result, the plane was susceptible to dangerous stalls in certain takeoff situations. Boeing created a piece of software to counteract this design flaw by automatically pushing the plane’s nose down. But the company never told the FAA, airlines, or pilots about the software in order to save time and money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fiUbQf"&gt;What’s worse, this software worked off of readings from a lone sensor on the plane’s exterior — meaning there was no way to know if it was acting with bad information if the sensor was damaged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1AjquW"&gt;It was this series of design flaws and Boeing’s lack of candor that led to the two fatal 737 Max crashes, as was discovered in subsequent Congressional investigations and reporting. By not disclosing them to regulators or the airlines, Boeing left the pilots of Lion Air flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 fighting software they didn’t even know existed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mdpGkR"&gt;Some Boeing employees were well-aware that what they were doing was wrong, as was documented in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/9/21059420/boeing-employees-messages-737-max-investigation-simulator-crash"&gt;internal chat messages and emails released by Congress in early 2020&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l4zROU"&gt;The 737 Max has since been allowed back into the air after Boeing worked to fix these problems, and airlines around the world are slowly reintroducing the plane to their fleets. But in a Senate report released just last month, it was discovered that Boeing &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the FAA &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189609/faa-boeing-737-max-senate-report-coverup-tests-whistleblowers"&gt;worked to manipulate some of the tests that were done during the recertification process&lt;/a&gt;. The FAA’s lax approach to regulation has also been blamed for contributing to the problems that led to the two fatal 737 Max crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dLV30B"&gt;No individuals have been criminally charged in the government’s investigation into Boeing, which was led by the FBI and the Department of Transportation’s Office of the Inspector General. Dennis Muilenburg, who was CEO when the crashes happened, was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/23/21035019/boeing-ceo-muilenburg-resigns-737-max-crisis-chairman"&gt;ousted in late 2019&lt;/a&gt;. He left with more than $60 million in stock options and other assets, though Boeing did not give him a severance.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Duracell isn’t secretly paying Microsoft to put AA batteries in Xbox controllers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L83DM8B7rHNZFrX8WogmT-xSPTU=/9x0:2631x1748/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68634562/twarren_xboxseriesxcontroller_VLS_3616_2_4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Cu5LXi"&gt;“Xbox Controllers Still Use AA Batteries Due to ‘A Constant Agreement’ with Duracell,” &lt;em&gt;Stealth Optional&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;headline reads. The headline spotlights the &lt;a href="https://stealthoptional.com/feature/why-does-xbox-series-x-s-console-still-use-aa-batteries-duracell/"&gt;outlet’s recent interview&lt;/a&gt; with Duracell’s UK marketing manager, Luke Anderson, who told &lt;em&gt;Stealth Optional&lt;/em&gt; that there’s “always been this partnership with Duracell and Xbox... It’s a constant agreement that Duracell and Microsoft have in place.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j8AgUj"&gt;After this interview was published, &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-controllers-apparently-still-use-aa-batteries-beca-1846007558"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/xbox-controllers-are-still-using-aa-batteries-because-of-long-term-duracell-deal-spokesperson-claims/"&gt;outlets&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/xbox-wireless-controllers-may-still-use-aa-batteries-because-partnership-duracell?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+wmexperts+%28Windows+Central%29"&gt;cited&lt;/a&gt; the article, theorizing that this could be the reason why Microsoft still uses AA batteries to power some of its wireless gaming controllers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w5Ydjj"&gt;This isn’t true. “We intentionally offer consumers choice in their battery solutions for our standard Xbox Wireless Controllers,” a Microsoft spokesperson &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-01-07-no-microsoft-isnt-forced-to-use-batteries-in-xbox-controllers-because-of-a-deal-with-duracell"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;as a reason why its standard wireless Xbox controllers still use AA batteries instead of building a battery inside the controller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bHHbDF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We intentionally offer consumers choice in their battery solutions for our standard Xbox Wireless Controllers.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CFJ1By"&gt;“This includes the use of AA batteries from any brand, the Xbox Rechargeable Battery, charging solutions from our partners, or a USB-C cable, which can power the controller when plugged in to the console or PC.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="amlwvI"&gt;Of course, this is not the first time Microsoft has mentioned its decision to stick with AA batteries for some of its wireless controllers. Speaking with &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2020-constructing-xbox-series-x-a-revolution-in-console-design"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry&lt;/em&gt; in April&lt;/a&gt;, Xbox partner director of program management, Jason Ronald, explained that a “large chunk of Xbox owners” still preferred to use batteries. Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/16/17665126/my-xbox-one-controller-console-battery-free-reliance"&gt;even told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in 2018&lt;/a&gt; that the standard controllers' reliance on batteries is because the company likes to offer a choice to its player base.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GXWrzn"&gt;I don’t mind using AA batteries in these controllers; I can understand the confusion some could have on why Microsoft relies on batteries in its controllers when its competitors have turned to built-in batteries that charge using cables. It’s certainly not &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/4/20992240/e-waste-recycling-electronic-basel-convention-crime-total-reclaim-fraud"&gt;the most environmentally friendly option&lt;/a&gt;, yet it provides a happy medium for those who still prefer batteries while also having an option for those who prefer using a rechargeable battery pack instead. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s unlocked Pixel 4A 5G will soon be available in white</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lsm8XRv9v47E2sr0kORo1lLksKA=/0x3:1710x1143/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68634458/Screen_Shot_2021_01_07_at_3.35.11_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lj5MDZ"&gt;Up until this point, Google’s unlocked &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514296/google-pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-speed-video"&gt;Pixel 4A 5G&lt;/a&gt; has only been available in black for those who want the unlocked phone. A white option was exclusive to Verizon’s more expensive version of the device — more expensive because it includes millimeter-wave 5G. But soon, Google will be releasing a white model of the standard $499 unlocked Pixel 4A 5G for people who don’t want to pay the mmWave tax. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C1OeAu"&gt;I was browsing B&amp;amp;H Photo earlier today when I noticed &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1595334-REG%2Fgoogle_ga02294_us_pixel_4a_128gb_5g.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F7%2F22219305%2Fgoogle-pixel-4a-5g-unlocked-white-price-specs-release-date#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a listing for it&lt;/a&gt;, clearly labeled as a “new release.” Since there are photos of the phone, this didn’t seem to be a mistake — and Google has since confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the unlocked white Pixel 4A 5G will begin shipping on January 28th. Aesthetically, it’s identical to the Verizon version with a mint green power button. But you’re still only getting sub-6 5G — no surprise considering it’s the regular price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fv4Fh4"&gt;There were some decent discounts and sales on the Pixel 4A 5G over the holidays, so some of you might be bummed about making a purchase before this one came around. But at least you saved some cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3PgxTx"&gt;If you’re keeping score, with the release of this version, that means the 2020 Pixel lineup will now be available in these color choices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z3irrJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pixel 5, $699&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Green&lt;br&gt;Black&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GdJZzR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pixel 4A 5G UW, $599&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Black (with millimeter-wave 5G), &lt;em&gt;Verizon exclusive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;White (with millimeter-wave 5G), &lt;em&gt;Verizon exclusive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gV52W0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pixel 4A 5G, $499&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Black (unlocked, sub-6 5G only)&lt;br&gt;White (unlocked, sub-6 5G only)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Aht4z"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pixel 4A, $349&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Black&lt;br&gt;Blue, &lt;em&gt;Google Store exclusive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Trump tax means you’ll pay even more for Nvidia and AMD’s impossible-to-find graphics cards</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UAoYWPURNNZb0zh6IxkUxt6k3Kw=/13x0:2040x1351/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68634444/twarren_200909_4184_0008.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Le4UJL"&gt;“Don’t Build a High-End Gaming PC Right Now,” &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/dont-build-gaming-pc-now"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt; declared&lt;/a&gt; in November. “This Is a Bad Time to Build a High-End Gaming PC,” &lt;a href="https://www.extremetech.com/computing/318119-this-is-a-bad-time-to-build-a-high-end-gaming-pc"&gt;ExtremeTech echoed&lt;/a&gt; last month. But it’s looking like the &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt; time to build a new gaming rig is still to come. That’s because a perfect storm is pushing the price of components like must-have Nvidia or AMD graphics cards even further skyward — and because Donald Trump is now part of that storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9O3AeU"&gt;The Trump administration is now imposing a 25 percent tax on graphics cards imported from China, and at least one PC component manufacturer has announced it’ll pass along part of that cost to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZy4ja"&gt;We’ve known for two years that PC components were being swept up in Trump’s trade war on China. In 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.gamersnexus.net/industry/3368-manufacturers-on-tariff-impact-to-pc-prices"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GamersNexus,&lt;/em&gt; in particular, explained in depth&lt;/a&gt; how PC parts might see a price increase between 10 and 25 percent due to the categories the Trump administration tried to tax. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/20/20973991/trump-tim-cook-apple-friendship-tax-cuts-china-tariffs-manufacturing-jobs"&gt;Apple famously cozied up to Trump&lt;/a&gt; to avoid some (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/30/20892201/apple-25-percent-tax-five-imported-mac-pro-parts-trump-tariffs"&gt;but not all&lt;/a&gt;) of the import taxes on PC parts, allowing it to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/23/20880043/apple-mac-pro-us-manufacturing-austin-texas-trump-tariff"&gt;build its Mac Pro in the United States&lt;/a&gt; using parts imported from China. (Apple didn’t reply to a request for comment on the tariffs.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tvx9yQ"&gt;But PC gamers and other graphics card buyers &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; managed to dodge the bullet of higher prices back in September 2019, when the Trump administration granted specific exemptions for “graphics processing modules” and “accelerator modules.” And as &lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/31/business/economy/china-tariffs-exclusions-expire.html"&gt;reported last week&lt;/a&gt;, the government extended many of its tariff exemptions until the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gAP2YSGKq2X6nGcvZKyNKADRxj8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22220402/gpu_tariffs_excemptions.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="x34YRh"&gt;But December 31st, 2020, came and went with any additional extensions — and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; can confirm the exemptions for graphics cards and motherboards (classified under reporting number 8473.30.1180) were among those that expired at the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a3VBPN"&gt;According to the US government’s Harmonized Tariff Schedule, &lt;a href="https://hts.usitc.gov/?query=84733011"&gt;those PC components &lt;/a&gt;would normally be free of import taxes. Now, &lt;a href="https://ustr.gov/issue-areas/enforcement/section-301-investigations/section-301-china/200-billion-trade-action"&gt;under the “list 3” tariffs&lt;/a&gt; that were designed to tax $200 billion worth of Chinese products, graphics card and motherboard vendors have to figure out where to find the additional 25 percent to pay for tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v3jDrU"&gt;I’ve reached out to the major GPU and motherboard manufacturers, and they’ve all either declined to comment (Nvidia, Asus, MSI) or failed to respond to my emails (Gigabyte, EVGA, Zotac, XFX, PNY). It’s a little weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hngi2A"&gt;“MSI cannot respond to your questions at this time. Thank you for your interest and understanding,” an MSI rep told me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="00qhri"&gt;I’m still waiting for an answer from AMD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0C946W"&gt;Intel says the tariffs haven’t had an impact — yet. “With regard to the tariffs, so far, it is not significant and hasn’t impacted our prices,” a spokesperson tells me. But Intel doesn’t make a lot of motherboards or GPUs yet, and it’s not speaking for partners there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p7VmMh"&gt;But we don’t really need to speculate whether this might affect the price you pay because Asus, the largest motherboard manufacturer and a noted GPU supplier, has said it will &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; has already increased some of its prices, &lt;a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/asus-officially-increases-graphics-cards-and-motherboards-pricing"&gt;as reported by &lt;em&gt;Videocardz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Here’s the statement the publication received: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="eY5CMr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update regarding MSRP pricing for ASUS components in 2021.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y1Vauu"&gt;This update applies to graphics cards and motherboards*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vbfFav"&gt;We have an announcement in regards to MSRP price changes that are effective in early 2021 for our award-winning series of graphic cards and motherboards. Our new MSRP reflects increases in cost for components. operating costs, and logistical activities plus a continuation of import tariffs. We worked closely with our supply and logistic partners to minimize price increases. ASUS greatly appreciates your continued business and support as we navigate through this time of unprecedented market change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KMJZwg"&gt;*additional models may see an increase as we moved further into Q1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f8LMG6"&gt;— Juan Jose Guerrero III, ASUS’s Technical Product Marketing Manager&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="AuFYMg"&gt;Now, the bigger question is whether price hikes might become permanent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WPSkeo"&gt;When we reviewed this year’s batch of next-gen PC graphics cards, we needed to give Nvidia and AMD the benefit of the doubt that you’d actually be able to buy them at their sticker price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pYCU8H"&gt;That turned out to be an unsafe bet. While it’s clear from social media that &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; people have managed to buy them at retail, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay"&gt;it’s also clear from eBay that the true price&lt;/a&gt; of an RTX 3090, 3080, 3070, 3060 Ti, RX 6800 XT, or RX 6800 is far over MSRP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="BKXvr4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The true price of a PlayStation 5","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay"},{"title":"Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 review","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21435926/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-review"},{"title":"Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 review","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21534142/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-review"},{"title":"Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti review","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21726429/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-ti-review"},{"title":"AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT review","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21571414/amd-radeon-rx-6800-xt-review"},{"title":"AMD Radeon RX 6800 review","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21572796/amd-radeon-rx-6800-review-4k-gaming-test-benchmarks"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="7rZo35"&gt;AMD’s RX 6800 series cards, in particular, have never reappeared at retail for long enough to even make an impact. I’ve personally been waiting and watching to pounce on one ever &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21572796/amd-radeon-rx-6800-review-4k-gaming-test-benchmarks"&gt;since my review&lt;/a&gt;, and I’ve never even seen an opportunity — unlike Nvidia’s cards where I’ve simply failed to beat the swarm of buyers to the digital checkout counter nearly every time I’ve tried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UtkbDw"&gt;Trump’s tariffs aren’t the only thing that might make buying a GPU worse. Bitcoin prices are now at an all-time high, &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-tops-38k-for-first-time-a-day-after-racing-past-36k-37k"&gt;briefly crossing $40,000 for the first time ever&lt;/a&gt; earlier today. &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/ethereum"&gt;The price of Ethereum&lt;/a&gt; has doubled over the past month and is approaching its previous record, too. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T_2eqL-47Pju1HjN_7ZlaK0kwME=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22220324/bitcoin_coindesk_1_7.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Spb2yE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/gpu-shortages-worsen-cryptocurrency-coin-miners-ethereum"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware &lt;/em&gt;is pointing out&lt;/a&gt; that at any given graphic card’s MSRP, it could take significantly less than a year to make your GPU money back by mining. The last time bitcoin prices skyrocketed, it caused a huge GPU shortage that lasted for many months. It was news in May 2018 &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NVIDIAGeForce/status/994200342735732737"&gt;when Nvidia tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that you could finally find a graphics card again at MSRP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ky7cqz"&gt;But this time, we’re already in a GPU shortage due to pandemic manufacturing shortages and pent-up demand for the performance that the new wave of graphics cards and next-gen consoles offer. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22215786/video-games-covid-19-animal-crossing-among-us"&gt;More than half of Americans have turned to video games during the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, and graphically intensive games like &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; and&lt;em&gt; Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; inspired people to build new PCs that only the newest GPUs could run well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cwWkFh"&gt;Even if GPU manufacturers didn’t have a 25 percent tariff to deal with, the eBay prices make it clear they were already leaving money on the table. One way manufacturers can take advantage is to create pricier versions of the same exact graphics cards with fancier cooling systems and higher clocks, and many of the cards that gamers have actually been able to buy are that way. You can certainly pay $600 for a souped-up $400 RTX 3060 Ti if you can find that model at retail or $780 for a $500 RTX 3070. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eMQP8c"&gt;Now, though, I wonder if the base price of these cards is in jeopardy, too. In late November, &lt;a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-expects-aibs-to-sell-radeon-rx-6800-series-at-msrp-in-4-to-8-weeks"&gt;AMD told &lt;em&gt;Hardware Unboxed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the AMD RX 6800 XT should be available from its partners at the original $649 MSRP within eight weeks. Nearly six weeks later, it doesn’t seem that likely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PLLXEF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo chases dream of making a PC Nintendo Switch with the LaVie Mini concept</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3Mj39vDud-7qWPoUuhhWjH6dKLo=/0x219:7680x5339/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68634218/LAVIE_MINI_Gaming_Controller_Crystal_White.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Lenovo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="btPTHK"&gt;Every year at CES, we see devices meant to bridge the worlds of handheld and PC gaming. This year, it’s Lenovo and NEC that are still chasing that dream with the LaVie Mini. The device is a concept laptop-portable gaming console hybrid, and it includes a touchscreen, controller, and dock accessories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jIWLBn"&gt;For those unfamiliar with the name, LaVie is a joint venture between Lenovo and NEC, and although most of its products don’t make it to the US, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/5/7490411/lenovo-lavie-z-notebook-announced-at-ces-2015"&gt;had some hits&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/6/6/3067500/nec-lavie-z-hands-on"&gt;CES in the past&lt;/a&gt; focused on ultra-light laptops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FXnWOD"&gt;By itself, the LaVie Mini seems to be a reasonably powerful and compact computer. The device, if it were real, would have an 8-inch touchscreen with a resolution of 1920 x 1200 and an 11th Gen Intel Processor with Xe graphics. Of course, there’s not really space for a trackpad, but the concept design does make room for an optical touch sensor a la Blackberry.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tGi6NCJXXbq7ay5hfU1owK4K2I0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22220212/LAVIE_MINI_Facing_Forward_Crystal_White.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lenovo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This just goes to show that gold can look good on a computer if you do it right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kvbfHA"&gt;But acting as a laptop is not really the reason this concept exists. It exists to chase the dream of having a handheld gaming computer, one more powerful than the devices Nintendo has been famous for making. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f5TbBu"&gt;LaVie has also created a gaming controller accessory, which connects to the laptop after you fold the keyboard back. The controller has the same buttons and layout as the Xbox gamepad, so it’ll be familiar to many players, though the weight probably won’t be: the laptop weighs 1.28 pounds &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; the controller attached. For comparison, the Nintendo Switch is 0.88 pounds &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; the Joy-Con attached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JqrpI3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The LaVie Mini shows that the dream is still alive&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nkXFOG"&gt;Don’t start hitting the gym to beef up your forearms just yet, though. At the moment, there’s no announced price or release date for the Mini. We’ve seen many PC manufacturers come up with similar concepts and ideas for handheld gaming computers at CES. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CGhFdM"&gt;Most, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/1/6/21048262/alienware-concept-ufo-prototype-gaming-pc-nintendo-switch-ces-2020"&gt;like Alienware’s UFO concept from last year&lt;/a&gt;, don’t ever end up making it to market, as these prototypes are often less about making viable consumer products and more about experimenting with new ideas and form factors and getting the requisite press attention during CES. Some do go on sale but don't end up appealing to enough gamers to really make an impact, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/3/28/4155606/razer-edge-review"&gt;like Razer’s Edge&lt;/a&gt; or the initial &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/31/4573596/nvidia-shield-review"&gt;Nvidia Shield&lt;/a&gt; handheld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SB9R8v"&gt;Yet it’s easy to see why companies keep coming back to the idea of a computer that lets you play PC-quality games anywhere. The Nintendo Switch showed that, when done right, handheld gaming can offer a living room console-quality experience &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562530/nintendo-switch-lite-sales-october-2020"&gt;people can’t get enough of&lt;/a&gt;. Who doesn’t want to be able to play a game while they’re out and about, then come home, put the same device into a dock connected to their TV, and pick back up right where they left off? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UU1T8y"&gt;That’s an experience, by the way, that the LaVie Mini would support with its optional dock accessory if it ever comes to market.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yoq30pCtVJf9zkCdDAkQgO8_gmk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22220205/LAVIE_MINI_TV_DOCK_HDMI.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lenovo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Docked, the computer could output 4K 60Hz to a TV, though it likely wouldn’t have the power to run games at that resolution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ze2TQt"&gt;For now, that experience (at least for people who want that device to be a PC) will probably remain outside the realm of products they can actually buy. But the LaVie Mini shows that the dream is still alive and may actually come true sooner or later. For now, we’ll have to wait until next week’s CES to see if LaVie releases any more details about the Mini. &lt;/p&gt;
