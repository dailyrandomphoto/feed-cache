    <title>Netflix scrambled internally to suppress a controversial movie from search results</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The streaming giant kept &lt;em&gt;Cuties&lt;/em&gt; from appearing in some search results and recommendations after backlash to the poster&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="4VORrQ"&gt;In September 2020, Netflix was in turmoil as the company battled its most significant PR scandal to date. Earlier that year, the streaming platform had acquired the worldwide rights to the French film &lt;em&gt;Cuties &lt;/em&gt;after its lauded premiere at the Sundance Film Festival. Director Maïmouna Doucouré had made the movie as a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/cuties-director-maimouna-doucoure-why-i-made-the-film/2020/09/15/7e0ee406-f78b-11ea-a275-1a2c2d36e1f1_story.html"&gt;commentary on social media and the hypersexualization of young girls&lt;/a&gt;. But the poster Netflix released to promote it didn’t have that same self-awareness. Instead, it displayed the actors, some of whom were only 12 years old, in booty shorts and crop tops, striking provocative dance poses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTYqC4"&gt;The fallout was immediate. #CancelNetflix started trending on Twitter. QAnon conspiracy theorists claimed the company was distributing child porn and started tweeting about it with the hashtag #SaveTheChildren. A Change.org petition calling for the film to be removed &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2020/10/netflix-cuties-twerking-poster-drama-explained.html"&gt;had more than 40,000 signatures&lt;/a&gt;. Texas House of Representatives member Matt Schaefer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RepMattSchaefer/status/1304162860998823939"&gt;asked attorney general Ken Paxton&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the film “for possible violations of child exploitation and child pornography laws.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Irf9Mi"&gt;Netflix apologized for the poster but stood by the film. After all, the frenzied response was to the marketing, not to the movie itself. Co-CEO Ted Sarandos called the director, Maïmouna Doucouré, to personally own up to the mistake, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2020/09/cuties-director-death-threats-netflix-poster-backlash-ted-sarandos-called-apologize-1234569783/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kZPrU7"&gt;Behind the scenes, however, Netflix scrambled to minimize public backlash by suppressing the film in search results prior to its release. It removed &lt;em&gt;Cuties&lt;/em&gt; from the “coming soon” and “popular searches” categories and excluded it from queries for “cute.” It then adjusted its algorithm so searches for the film would not surface “steamy / sexual titles” or kids’ movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ZxRFX"&gt;The incident hints at how Netflix can manipulate its algorithm to navigate a PR crisis, walking a fine line between allowing for creative expression while tightly controlling a movie’s reach. Internal documents reviewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; detail how Netflix dealt with this PR crisis by, in the company’s own words, “suppress[ing] promotion and related search queries.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vOqcCp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We see ourselves as just a conduit for content”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T6R17I"&gt;In response to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Netflix spokesperson said: “Our recommendations help members find great titles to watch amidst all the choices on Netflix. Not every title gets promoted in the same way, just as every member’s homepage is different.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gh5pPH"&gt;Inside Netflix, the fallout from &lt;em&gt;Cuties&lt;/em&gt; has been compared to Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal — a moment of reckoning where the company realized it was going to be held responsible for anything that happened on its platform. “This incident demonstrated that we see ourselves as just a conduit for content,” read one analysis, called a “post mortem,” on the incident. “In contrast, our members see us as the source, as the author/presenter. As a result, we may unconsciously absolve ourselves of the need to view our content through this lens.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1zqBRV"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Cuties&lt;/em&gt; controversy also highlights why some employees have been disappointed by the executive response to Dave Chappelle’s comedy special &lt;em&gt;The Closer&lt;/em&gt;, which released earlier this year and has been widely criticized as transphobic. While the &lt;em&gt;Cuties&lt;/em&gt; backlash was partly driven by QAnon conspiracy theorists who likely hadn’t seen the film, &lt;em&gt;The Closer&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;criticism came from employees, trans activists, and prominent civil rights organizations, and Netflix did not appear to respond with the same level of urgency. Some at the company felt bad faith attacks were taken more seriously than criticism from Netflix’s own workers. This past month, Sarandos doubled down on his support of Dave Chappelle and defended his decision to keep &lt;em&gt;The Closer &lt;/em&gt;on the platform. The company also did not suppress the special in search results, recommendations, or on platform promotional materials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5XByz9"&gt;Until now, it was not publicly known the lengths at which Netflix went to suppress &lt;em&gt;Cuties&lt;/em&gt; prior to its release. But within the company, it has been a catalyst for change in how Netflix deals with potentially sensitive content — and a sign that these issues will only continue to get more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Wi5sh9"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="WAirxj"&gt;The warning signs came as early as January 16th, 2020. Netflix’s editorial creative team, responsible for reviewing films prior to release, watched &lt;em&gt;Cuties &lt;/em&gt;and wrote a summary of the potential issues American audiences might have with it: “The dance scenes are provocative, sexual in nature and can be sometimes uncomfortable to watch, featuring slow-motion shots of 11-year-old girls sucking on their fingers and close-ups on their crotches and behinds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iGizyS"&gt;This review process is supposed to prepare Netflix for potential backlash and make sure the right people have seen a film so there aren’t any surprises. But Netflix determined that &lt;em&gt;Cuties&lt;/em&gt; did not meet the bar for additional oversight. In France, the film received an All Public rating, deemed appropriate for everyone. In the US, it got a TV-MA rating, meant to be seen only by mature audiences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EQ2oVQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Netflix’s Spanish language translators couldn’t find a direct corollary to “twerking,” so they changed it to “sensual dance”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mvCbsJ"&gt;In March, a copywriter wrote the movie synopsis that appears on the Netflix platform when users click on the movie title: “Amy, 11, becomes fascinated with a twerking dance crew. Hoping to join them, she starts to explore her femininity, defying her family’s traditions.” Netflix’s Spanish language translators couldn’t find a direct corollary to “twerking,” so they changed it to “sensual dance.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ccfxTC"&gt;Netflix decided that the image that had originally been used for the film, showing young girls running up a hill with shopping bags, wasn’t going to do well on the platform. So the company created its own poster, as it often does for licensed films. This one was far more provocative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yFsqUe"&gt;The synopsis, combined with the poster, made some employees uncomfortable. Yet, few were willing to speak up, according to people familiar with the situation. Some felt that because the creative aspects of the film weren’t in their direct control, it wasn’t their place. Plus, Doucouré had won the Directing Award at Sundance in 2020 for the film. &lt;em&gt;Cuties &lt;/em&gt;had prestige. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oa90Pk"&gt;This hesitancy goes against a core Netflix value: courage. “You say what you think, when it’s in the best interest of Netflix, even if it is uncomfortable,” &lt;a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/culture"&gt;reads a public culture document&lt;/a&gt;. But it wasn’t totally clear where employees should turn if they wanted to flag the film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7H6DAB"&gt;Netflix has a number of resources for employees looking to find information about how to handle sensitive content. These include a Slack channel dedicated to sensitive assets and sensitive content guidelines for scenes that could be offensive in certain countries. At the time &lt;em&gt;Cuties&lt;/em&gt; came out, however, there wasn’t standardized guidance related to nuanced depictions of minors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s8HID2"&gt;The problems were exacerbated because the rollout was happening during the pandemic. Netflix employees were working remotely, making collaboration more difficult. By the summer, Netflix knew that Doucouré hadn’t yet seen the poster but decided to move forward anyway. This was typical for Netflix, where directors aren’t always made aware of how their films will be promoted. So, on August 18th, 2020, the film’s marketing materials went live, both on the Netflix platform and in the press. The movie was added to the “coming soon” category — a key traffic driver for upcoming titles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dyHSdA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The film is pedophile grooming and also an attack on Muslims and traditional morality”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qOwhWp"&gt;Almost immediately, the right-wing media latched on. “This is disgusting,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dailycaller/status/1296202990894940160"&gt;wrote the &lt;em&gt;Daily Caller&lt;/em&gt; on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. “How is this in any way okay?” “The film is pedophile grooming and also an attack on Muslims and traditional morality,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cernovich/status/1296656497007448064?lang=en"&gt;tweeted right-wing commentator Mike Cernovich&lt;/a&gt;. Soon, prominent Muslim-American activists joined in, criticizing the film for stereotyping the lead character’s family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CepuLb"&gt;Doucouré, who saw the poster at the same time as the American public, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2020/09/cuties-director-death-threats-netflix-poster-backlash-ted-sarandos-called-apologize-1234569783/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; that she started getting harassed online&lt;/a&gt;. “I received numerous attacks on my character from people who had not seen the film, who thought I was actually making a film that was apologetic about hypersexualization of children,” she said. “I also received numerous death threats.” According to Netflix’s internal documents, her young cast, some of whom were as young as 12, started getting attacked as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3w0sIC"&gt;Netflix believed it had a bit of distance from &lt;em&gt;Cuties&lt;/em&gt;. After all, it had acquired the rights to it after it was celebrated at Sundance — this wasn’t a Netflix original production. But the company quickly realized that the public didn’t see a strong distinction between films Netflix made and films it distributed. “Multiple people had concerns about the English title translation from the distributor, but they did not raise those concerns as strongly as they may have if this was a Netflix Original,” an internal Netflix analysis of the &lt;em&gt;Cuties&lt;/em&gt; incident says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fsFO8t"&gt;This had happened before. In June, Netflix had received criticism for a film called &lt;em&gt;365 Days&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/people-are-calling-for-netflix-to-remove-365-days-from-the-streaming-service"&gt;which some people felt romanticized sexual assault&lt;/a&gt;. As with &lt;em&gt;Cuties&lt;/em&gt;, the Netflix poster — which showed a topless woman being caressed by her kidnapper — made the situation worse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GXZzjF"&gt;Now, Netflix admitted that its “guidelines and review mechanisms, which we previously believed would have prevented such an incident from occurring,” were insufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TvJ3TL"&gt;By 3:30PM on August 19th, Netflix updated the &lt;em&gt;Cuties&lt;/em&gt; synopsis. “Amy, 11 years old, tries to escape family dysfunction by joining a free-spirited dance clique named &lt;em&gt;‘Cuties&lt;/em&gt;,’ as they build their self confidence through dance,” the new summary read. (Unfortunately, the Spanish translators changed “free-spirited” to “sensual,” which also then had to be updated.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HGd9GJ"&gt;By 6PM the same day, the movie had a new poster — this time just showing the main character's face and shoulder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2TaiPr"&gt;The following day, Netflix tweeted an apology:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gmWcCO"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We're deeply sorry for the inappropriate artwork that we used for Mignonnes/Cuties. It was not OK, nor was it representative of this French film which won an award at Sundance. We’ve now updated the pictures and description.&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix (@netflix) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1296486375211053057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 20, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hV1x2T"&gt;On Slack, a group of managers and directors involved with the film discussed the issue. It seemed to be causing Netflix customers to cancel their accounts. One mentioned that multiple employees had been working for days to fix the growing communications crisis. It was an all-hands-on-deck moment for the organization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EOUtO7"&gt;The group decided to focus in part on the algorithm. Netflix search results are controlled by what a user types into the search field, the country they’re in, and the titles available in that country. But the &lt;em&gt;Cuties&lt;/em&gt; documents reveal ways in which the company can take manual steps to hide a film from the platform. It removed the movie from the “coming soon,” “more like this,” “coming later,” “extras,” and “popular searches” categories. It also excluded the film from search results for “cute.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dJoVg7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Avoid looking like we have removed the film page from service”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i1lenO"&gt;The goal, according to the Netflix documents, was to “minimize press coverage” related to the poster and “avoid looking like we have removed the film page from service, are moving release date and/or not launch the film,” as “this could be seen as reactionary.” Netflix didn’t remove &lt;em&gt;Cuties&lt;/em&gt;, but it did its best to minimize its prominence on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Hi1vp"&gt;Netflix manually altered the search results so queries for “cuties,” “mignonnes,” (the title in French), or any variation thereof would exclude “steamy / sexual titles,” as well as kids' movies. Prior to this change, two overtly sexual movies, &lt;em&gt;365 Days&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;An Easy Girl&lt;/em&gt;, were surfacing on Netflix as movies similar to &lt;em&gt;Cuties&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eyKCp8"&gt;The company also made sure that searches for problematic terms like “pedo” wouldn’t surface results for &lt;em&gt;Cuties&lt;/em&gt;. Without oversight, that was a real possibility because Netflix’s algorithm takes into account behavioral data, which tracks what Netflix viewers actually watch in addition to what they search for. If members search for “pedo” but end up playing &lt;em&gt;Cuties&lt;/em&gt;, the French film would have eventually surfaced as a result for the search term “pedo.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rzRh62"&gt;Still, by August 21st, the controversy wasn’t dying down, and Netflix employees were starting to get harassed by QAnon conspiracy theorists online. “We do not believe QAnon is a sophisticated group with advanced offensive skills,” the Netflix security team wrote in an internal memo obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sjMy1"&gt;Elsewhere, the Netflix customer service organization was also in turmoil. The team fielded over 16,236 messages in the weeks following the movie’s release, making it one of the largest causes of incoming customer experience messages of all time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mkuX4X"&gt;In the aftermath of the scandal, Netflix promised to do better. The company compiled a list of hundreds of titles that had potentially sensitive content, which it flagged for further review. Most of the &lt;em&gt;Cuties&lt;/em&gt; blowup happened in less than a week, but its repercussions would be felt far in the future. In September 2020, after the film’s release, Netflix cancellations were eight times higher than the daily average a year before, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/cuties-backlash-netflix-cancellations-record-levels-1234769354/"&gt;according to an article in &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VBZ4tP"&gt;The controversy over &lt;em&gt;Cuties&lt;/em&gt; overshadowed the film itself. “I wanted to open people’s eyes to what’s truly happening in schools and on social media, forcing them to confront images of young girls made up, dressed up and dancing suggestively to imitate their favorite pop icon,” wrote Maïmouna Doucouré, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/cuties-director-maimouna-doucoure-why-i-made-the-film/2020/09/15/7e0ee406-f78b-11ea-a275-1a2c2d36e1f1_story.html"&gt;in an op-ed for the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, she and her cast were relentlessly harassed, slammed for oversexualizing young girls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MCauXO"&gt;Netflix took the &lt;em&gt;Cuties&lt;/em&gt; crisis extremely seriously, owning up to its mistake and overhauling its internal processes in the wake of the scandal. This, despite the fact that it wasn’t a Netflix original, and the company’s budget for the film was just $847,500.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="YFp7eK"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="KOYhxO"&gt;Just over a year later, on October 19th, 2021, Netflix had a quarterly earnings call, where it reported subscriber growth of 4.4 million, beating analysts’ expectations. No one asked about the controversy over Dave Chappelle’s &lt;em&gt;The Closer&lt;/em&gt;, which had occurred just a week prior, even though the story had become national news. Netflix employees were walking out of work the next day to protest the company’s handling of the crisis, and one activist had been fired for allegedly leaking documents about its cost and performance on the platform (the employee has categorically denied this allegation). But it apparently hadn’t translated into a serious business problem for Netflix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YwvlBL"&gt;Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos responded to employee concerns about the Dave Chappelle special by saying, “We have a strong belief that content on screen doesn’t directly translate to real-world harm.” He later admitted this was a “gross simplification” &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/10/netflix-ted-sarandos-speaks-up-dave-chapplle-the-closer-controversy-interview-1234858762/"&gt;in an interview with &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="cr7HWB"&gt;Netflix paid ​​$24.1 million for &lt;em&gt;The Closer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZzaId"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp’s iPhone-to-Android chat transfer is now available on Pixels and new phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0eokNaSp9B-H9bsj4lLIBmWdnKU=/193x0:1246x702/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70049386/Screen_Shot_2021_10_26_at_13.51.42.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hphf2u"&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/android/whatsapp-chat-history/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that WhatsApp’s chat history migration feature to bring your messages from iPhones to Android is now available on “all Pixel phones” and that it’ll “become available on new smartphones that launch with Android 12.” The feature was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22619664/whatsapp-android-ios-chat-history-transfer-cross-platform"&gt;already available for Samsung phones&lt;/a&gt; but will make the experience of switching from iOS to Android easier, as you won’t have to give up your messaging history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RwYNJK"&gt;The process should be relatively simple, as long as you’ve got WhatsApp up to date on both your iPhone and Android phone, and you’ve got a USB-C to Lightning cable handy. Google says that while setting up your Android phone, you’ll be prompted to scan a QR code with your iPhone, which will let you start the transfer process.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VsnZRcl9RuhTCPdNKO3gbNGB6OQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957797/WhatsAppBlogAsset_LightTheme.max_1000x1000.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A wired connection and QR code scan are all that’s required to start the process.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XZ4fwZ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22655753/migrate-iphone-whatsapp-data-chat-history-samsung-phone"&gt;Check out our how-to&lt;/a&gt; for more detailed instructions (they’re written for Samsung, but the process should be similar) and to read into the few caveats with the transfer. Google says that your iPhone won’t receive any WhatsApp messages while your messages are moving, so you shouldn’t lose anything in the switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RdlIkh"&gt;Given Google’s phrasing, saying that the feature would come to “new smartphones that launch with Android 12,” it’s a bit unclear whether existing phones getting an Android 12 update will be able to make use of it. We’ve reached out to Google for clarification and will update this story if we hear back. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo 64 games on Nintendo Switch are not too up to snuff</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JrubpogT6CsBarrjXeGKBbGlxfI=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70049297/IMG_0122.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Textures and environments are outputting inconsistently in the Switch version of Ocarina of Time&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Or3D5f"&gt;Monday evening, Nintendo released its latest features bundled into the Nintendo Switch Online subscription: Nintendo 64 and Sega Genesis games via an “Expansion Pack.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bGeVVY"&gt;As soon as players got a chance to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728113/nintendo-switch-online-plus-expansion-pack-price-n64-genesis-animal-crossing"&gt;throw down another $30 on top of their $20 / year sub&lt;/a&gt;, they immediately took to Twitter to share their disdain of the less-than-ideal emulation quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uZLICf"&gt;A particularly &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stopskeletons/status/1452901471553351680"&gt;fascinating set of images&lt;/a&gt; posted to Twitter by speedrunner ZFG1 comparing the Water Temple on N64, Wii Virtual Console, and Switch was a hot topic today. The Switch version was noticeably lacking fog, revealing terrible-looking textures that represent water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n86R1i"&gt;I launched &lt;em&gt;Mario 64, StarFox 64&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Zelda: Ocarina of Time &lt;/em&gt;for a quick test. Input speed for &lt;em&gt;Mario 64&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;StarFox 64&lt;/em&gt; seemed OK, but &lt;em&gt;Zelda &lt;/em&gt;had a noticeable input lag in movement (portable mode).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1qjR1l4KYy6X8R36QGoXCNFe4B8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957470/IMG_0123.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Pre-rendered backgrounds and texture maps never translated well to modern displays from their original intended look on old CRT displays.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ew02Nh"&gt;While the images of the missing fog from the tweet started a wildfire of disappointment towards Nintendo, games producer Jon Riesenbach had posted on Twitter to show that the fog-free look is much more akin to the Japanese version of &lt;em&gt;Zelda: Ocarina of Time&lt;/em&gt;. “This likely won’t matter to the people who have already written news articles and make up their minds about this, but that last screenshot is how JP Ocarina’s water has always looked,” he said. Reisenbach would later delete this tweet after ZFG1 &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zfg111/status/1453071674102857729"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that the two images were, in fact, both Japanese versions of the game running on Wii U and Switch, respectively. While both versions look quite similar — which is to say, not great — the six-year-old Wii U release still runs smoother than the Switch version released today.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Comparison shots of Japanese Zelda Ocarina of Time Wii U vs Switch" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4fP_RHJB2qS1ldF-7Ys2wIJjaB4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957631/zeldacompare.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Comparison shots of Japanese Zelda Ocarina of Time Wii U (left) vs Switch (right) Tweeted by @moriyoshijon and confirmed by @zfg111&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AWC0I8"&gt;The Nintendo library is among the deepest and most often revisited in the gaming industry, and fans tend to draw comprehensive comparisons of ports from the original releases (down to the scan lines on old CRT TVs). Efforts to bring the purest form of retro gaming exist as a business model for companies such as &lt;a href="https://www.analogue.co/super-nt"&gt;Analogue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.eongaming.tech"&gt;EON Gaming&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22323002/mister-fpga-project-retro-computer-console-early-pc"&gt;MiSTer&lt;/a&gt;, where there are options to play classic games in different resolutions on modern displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mckYdc"&gt;It would seem there is enough demand for the perfect nostalgic experience that Nintendo should do more to fine-tune each game and perhaps even release different region versions of games for a new generation to discover. Perhaps a world &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/30/17408346/nintendo-switch-virtual-console-mega-man-street-fighter"&gt;without&lt;/a&gt; a virtual console or game subscription service would be better for the fans. Being able to buy collections from various game publishers (think &lt;em&gt;Mega Man Legacy Collection&lt;/em&gt;) enables a higher level of nostalgic fan service by bundling multiple games, art, and maybe even some fine-tuned emulation (although, perhaps that&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nibellion/status/1437794471278792708?lang=en"&gt;does not always&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;work out). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ksJb2O"&gt;To Nintendo’s credit, half of the nostalgic experience of playing classic games is the controller you use. Nintendo released versions of the Nintendo and Super Nintendo controllers starting in 2018, and now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728144/nintendo-64-sega-genesis-controllers-switch-online-expansion-pack-buy-order"&gt;Nintendo 64 and Sega Genesis controllers&lt;/a&gt; are offered (although, &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-64-controller.html"&gt;currently&lt;/a&gt; sold out).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6AfMoe"&gt;The Nintendo Switch Online subscription service is normally $19.99 a year for an individual or $34.99 for a family and includes Nintendo and Super Nintendo games. To unlock the “expansion pack,” it costs another $30 for an individual or $45 for a family of eight.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DJI leak shows unreleased Mavic 3 Cine drone from pretty much every angle</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5CoQ6D9742-O9VJLYp1gcd5QKTA=/0x41:1500x1041/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70049248/Screen_Shot_2021_10_26_at_14.23.52.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RbuWR1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690821/dji-mavic-pro-drone-leak-twin-cameras-four-thirds"&gt;Rumors have swirled&lt;/a&gt; around DJI’s unreleased Mavic 3 drone, but it’s now thoroughly leaked ahead of its expected November launch, with images, spec sheets, and more. The leaks come to us from &lt;a href="https://www.techniknews.net/en/news/dji-mavic-3-so-sieht-die-drohne-aus-exklusiv/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechnikNews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/screenshots/DJI-Mavic-3-Cine-Premium-Combo-24267-1.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;DroneXL’s &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://dronexl.co/2021/10/26/mavic-3-specs-leaked-launch-dji-drone/"&gt;Jasper Ellens&lt;/a&gt;. They show what the drone looks like from almost every angle and detail the three different Mavic 3 bundles that will be available (as well as the differences between them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jGvJ4C"&gt;Previous rumors indicated the Mavic 3 will have better battery life than its predecessor and USB-C charging, plus two cameras (one “main” wide-angle shooter with a Four Thirds sensor and one with a telephoto lens). Today's leaks suggest the drone will ship in both DJI’s standard “fly more” bundle and a new “Cine” bundle. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.dji.com%2Fproduct%2Fmavic-2-fly-more-kit&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F26%2F22747261%2Fdji-mavic-3-drone-cine-edition-leak-fly-more-november-controller" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;As with the current Mavic 2&lt;/a&gt;, leaks say the fly more add-on includes additional cables, batteries, propellers, a case, and other accessories that you don’t get with the standalone model. Just as we saw across &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/6/17826384/dji-mavic-2-pro-zoom-drone-review-specs-price"&gt;two models of the Mavic 2 (Pro and Zoom)&lt;/a&gt;, the Cine seems to have slightly different hardware and capabilities from the original, making it a different beast.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I_Bx7dOvSdA9q9YJLrIrN1NEGo4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957591/dji_mavic_3_render_4.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mavic 3 in its folded-up state, with its dual cameras.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-SRhfXOFbtmsGgW0JmSqlhpUmQw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957583/dji_mavic_3_render_11.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;em&gt;TechnikNews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mavic 3 Cine even gets its own branding on the drone itself.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dy1y52"&gt;Unlike the Mavic 2 Zoom, which had a different camera module (arguably less necessary now, given the Mavic 3’s second telephoto lens), leaks show that the Cine model includes extra internal features that should make it better for video. According to &lt;a href="https://dronexl.co/2021/10/26/mavic-3-specs-leaked-launch-dji-drone/"&gt;a leaked spec sheet shared by Jasper Ellens&lt;/a&gt;, the Mavic Cine will support ProRes, the video codec that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666884/iphone-13-pro-max-specs-price-release-date-cameras"&gt;recently made its way into iPhones&lt;/a&gt;. Photos also show it will come with DJI’s Smart Controller, which includes a screen — another leak from Ellens indicates &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JasperEllens/status/1453052649599819784"&gt;that it’s a new version&lt;/a&gt; with a different port configuration. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EvQxzdrPhZV3Q1dJIl_O9Ig8NBA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957588/dji_mavic_3_render_16.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;em&gt;TechnikNews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mavic 3 Cine bundle includes the Cine drone, a Smart Controller, and more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OciU1OzpkZIiYrJGoWDfgmo4pEk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957849/Screen_Shot_2021_10_26_at_14.24.53.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mavic 3 Cine taking to the skies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="A1OtD7"&gt;The specs also indicate that the Cine model will have 1TB of internal storage instead of the 8GB included with the standard model (though both will reportedly support microSD cards). If the Cine bundle does include these upgrades, it’s probably a safe bet that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690821/dji-mavic-pro-drone-leak-twin-cameras-four-thirds"&gt;previous rumors&lt;/a&gt; about its price being significantly higher than the base model’s are accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jOWe8m"&gt;Ellens &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JasperEllens/status/1452719455340044300?s=20"&gt;also implies&lt;/a&gt; that the Mavic 3 is coming out November 5th, with an image that appears to depict a battery indicator (lending credence to the idea that the next-gen Mavic will get more flight time). Previous rumors predicted its arrival on the 15th and that it’ll start at $1,600, the same as the Mavic 2.

    <title>TikTok and Snap want to prove they’re not Facebook</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Senate Committee Examines Protecting Kids Online" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FsFx3GtQ5ZSGIRYJOBVMPhkvnyw=/0x1:3600x2401/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70049017/1236142202.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hFAqJB"&gt;Snap, TikTok, and YouTube set out with one important goal for Tuesday’s Senate hearing on child safety: to convince lawmakers that they are nothing like Facebook. While lawmakers were encouraged by the companies’ transparency, their humble approach hasn’t dissuaded lawmakers from pursuing new legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZb8Vv"&gt;While YouTube’s parent company Google has testified before, it was the first time representatives from Snap and TikTok testified before Congress, and they came prepared to differentiate themselves from the social media giant at the center of yet another series of scandals. It was Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen’s leaks that led senators to pursue these hearings. The Facebook Papers loomed over the event, reinforcing Snap and TikTok’s desire to set themselves apart and promising Congress greater transparency into their internal research and algorithms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LqQEAM"&gt;“Snapchat was built as an antidote to social media,” Jennifer Stout, Snap’s vice president of global public policy, &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/services/files/0AACA9BA-49C8-4AC3-8C2E-E62ACC3F73BC"&gt;said on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, attempting to remove Snapchat from the Facebook comparison. “In fact, we describe ourselves as a camera company.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VA0mBw"&gt;“TikTok is a global entertainment platform where people create and watch short-form videos,” said Michael Beckerman, TikTok’s vice president and head of public policy for the Americas. Beckerman continued, noting that direct messages and other social features are turned off by default for young users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IhKFBk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Being different from Facebook is not a defense”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6U11zl"&gt;Still, the testifying companies’ statements did not quell lawmakers who feared these platforms could be used in the same harmful ways as Facebook and Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9lGbmp"&gt;“Being different from Facebook is not a defense,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), chair of the subcommittee, said in his opening remarks on Tuesday. “That bar is in the gutter. It’s not a defense to say that you are different.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p5tH2j"&gt;Before Tuesday’s hearing, lawmakers brought in Facebook head of safety Antigone Davis and whistleblower Frances Haugen to discuss how the company’s products, like Instagram, drive young users to content encouraging self-harm and unhealthy behaviors. For years, lawmakers have vowed to produce new legislation to protect children online, but recent &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reporting on a cache of internal Facebook documents leaked by Haugen breathed new life into their willingness to regulate tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L8tc3k"&gt;Specifically, lawmakers pointed to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739"&gt;internal research&lt;/a&gt; from Facebook noting that Instagram makes “body image issues worse for one in three teen girls.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BfG0Nd"&gt;At a September hearing, lawmakers noted Davis’ unwillingness to answer questions and her refusal to publish Facebook’s entire body of research on the effects its platforms have on young users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2jJXW"&gt;“I don’t understand, Ms. Davis, how you can deny that Instagram isn’t exploiting young users for its own profits?” Blumenthal asked her at the time. “This research is a bombshell. It is powerful, gripping riveting evidence that Facebook knows of the harmful effects of its site on children and that it has concealed those facts and findings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MkyrYX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Facebook knows of the harmful effects of its site on children”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UZPEuE"&gt;While Facebook may have refused to publish the research, reporters from a variety of different news publications gained access to additional documents leaked by Haugen and authored a deluge of articles on Monday examining Facebook’s own research and documents on teens and other issues like content moderation lovingly titled the “Facebook Papers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4mP7G"&gt;Clearly, Snap, TikTok, and YouTube didn’t want to be on the receiving end of their own “Papers” scandals. During Tuesday’s hearing, all three companies committed to releasing research, data, and independent studies they have conducted to Congress. Lawmakers like Sen. John Thune (R-SD) said that the committee could send these documents to independent experts to review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P1aUzD"&gt;In a press call with reporters Tuesday, Blumenthal said that his subcommittee would “hold them” to that promise and that lawmakers were “going to pursue legislation,” including updates to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/9/21058562/eraser-button-childrens-data-coppa-walberg-rush-hawley-markey-congress-house"&gt;the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act&lt;/a&gt; (COPPA) and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/5/21166705/youtube-kids-act-markey-blumenthal-coppa-tiktok-ryans-toy-review"&gt;potential markup on the KIDS Act&lt;/a&gt;. The latter bill would place new limits on the types of features and content tech companies could provide for children under the age of 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xWuw8t"&gt;Even as Snap, TikTok, and YouTube try to remove themselves from Facebook’s toxic regulatory groundswell, CEO Mark Zuckerberg &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745622/facebook-young-adults-refocusing-teams"&gt;tried to pull them closer&lt;/a&gt; in the company’s latest earnings call on Monday. Zuckerberg explained that the company has made changes to its services to support older users, many of whom don’t use platforms like Snap and TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5MOecf"&gt;“So much of our services have gotten dialed to be the best for the most people who use them, rather than specifically for young adults,” Zuckerberg said. Later, he called TikTok “one of the most effective competitors we’ve ever faced.” He also announced that the company would refresh Instagram’s app design, making its Reels product “a more central part of the experience.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21354117/instagram-reels-tiktok-vine-short-videos-stories-explore-music-effects-filters"&gt;Reels is Facebook’s answer&lt;/a&gt; to TikTok’s growing popularity with young people, allowing users to post videos in a similar style. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PQt9Jq"&gt;Still, it’s unclear when the companies that testified Tuesday plan to release the internal reporting. Snap, TikTok, and YouTube did not immediately answer requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;regarding the timing of these disclosures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v4r7ys"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J7Vics"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="2s3sEE"&gt;Microsoft posted the first quarter of its 2022 &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2FInvestor%2Fearnings%2FFY-2022-Q1%2Fpress-release-webcast" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;financial results today&lt;/a&gt;, reporting revenue of $45.3 billion and a net income of $20.5 billion (GAAP). Revenue is up 22 percent, and net income has increased by 48 percent. Microsoft has seen strong revenue performance in its cloud, server, and Office businesses this quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xslOYU"&gt;Microsoft might have just launched Windows 11 earlier this month, but in the months ahead of this new version of Windows, PC sales have started to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722151/us-pc-market-decline-supply-issues-windows-11-launch"&gt;decline in the US due to supply issues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1IrO88"&gt;That doesn’t seem to have impacted Microsoft’s Windows revenues, though. Windows OEM revenue has increased by 10 percent this quarter, despite what Microsoft calls “continued PC demand impacted by supply chain constraints.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s new Surface Laptop Studio.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VgqJw6"&gt;Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue has also increased by 12 percent, thanks to demand for Microsoft 365. Windows 11 has only just arrived on new devices earlier this month, so Microsoft and OEMs will be hoping the supply issues improve and that the new operating system drives even more demand for laptops and PCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ahxtpe"&gt;Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella believes the PC is key right now. “The PC will be more critical than ever,” said Nadella during an earnings call today. “There has been a structural shift in PC demand emerging from this pandemic.” Microsoft is also now anticipating Windows OEM revenue growth during Q2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xNTwE5"&gt;Over on the Surface side, we’re now into the second quarter of Surface Laptop 4 and Surface Pro 7 Plus sales for Microsoft’s Surface revenues. Surface revenue has decreased by 17 percent this quarter, and Microsoft says that’s related to a stronger prior year by comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XLVPqk"&gt;It doesn’t seem like Surface revenue will improve next quarter, either. Microsoft CFO Amy Hood warned that Microsoft’s Q2 outlook includes an expected dip of Surface revenue in the “single digits.” It appears Microsoft is feeling the effects of PC component supply issues.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox Series S and X consoles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7TSd1d"&gt;It’s nearly been a year since Microsoft’s Xbox Series X and Series S consoles have been on the market, and they’ve been continually growing hardware revenue for Xbox in recent months. Hardware revenue is up again this quarter by 166 percent, thanks to continued demand for Xbox Series X and Series S consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="71fQ6h"&gt;Hood says Microsoft was “able to ship more Xbox Series X and S consoles than expected, even as demand continues to exceed supply.” It’s not clear if this better than expected console supply will last into Q2, and Microsoft’s Xbox chief has already warned supply constraints &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22701878/xbox-phil-spencer-supply-constraints-2022"&gt;will last into 2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bU7Ley"&gt;Microsoft’s overall gaming revenue is also up by 16 percent, nearly $3.6 billion for the quarter and a record Q1 for Xbox. But Xbox content and services revenue has only increased by 2 percent. Microsoft says there has been some “growth in Xbox Game Pass subscriptions,” but the company isn’t listing a new figure for its subscriber count. The last publicly disclosed one was 18 million Xbox Game Pass subs in January 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bsidyT"&gt;We could get an Xbox Game Pass numbers update once &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; have had an impact on subscriber numbers. Hood says Microsoft expects Xbox content and services revenue growth “in the mid teens” for Q2, thanks to the back to back Xbox Game Pass releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMpsu2"&gt;As always, it’s the cloud growth that has been impressive for Microsoft’s revenues, particularly as businesses adjust to hybrid work. Revenue in intelligent cloud is up 31 percent year over year, including Azure and other cloud services revenue growth of 50 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KE7hjJ"&gt;Office has also had a strong quarter, with Office consumer products and cloud services revenue up 10 percent, and Microsoft 365 consumer subscribers up 19 percent to 54.1 million in total.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3HUxDhWeKppfdEe8NhmBmC9Jor4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957612/GgVRXki.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s business highlights for Q1, 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NwczEo"&gt;Microsoft’s business versions of Office and associated cloud services are also up 18 percent in revenue year over year, with Office 365 commercial revenue up 23 percent. If you’re wondering whether businesses are moving to the cloud, Office commercial products revenue dipped 13 percent year over year, thanks to the ongoing shift to cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3JQTYX"&gt;While Microsoft’s three core business segments are still well balanced in terms of revenue, the intelligent cloud business is gradually pulling away. Productivity and Business Processes, which includes Office, LinkedIn, and Dynamics, makes up around 33 percent of Microsoft’s revenues. Intelligent Cloud, which includes Auzre, server products, and cloud services, now generates 38 percent of Microsoft’s revenues. That leaves More Personal Computing, which includes Xbox, Windows, and Surface, with around 29 percent of Microsoft’s overall revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google just had another record quarter because or in spite of everything going on</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nsIWe2CVI-_vdDt5LWdjvBQQNYw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70048824/acastro_180130_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="APmJv3"&gt;Google has done it again — raking in more money than ever before for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596592/google-q2-2021-record-revenue-profit-youtube-ad-cloud-search"&gt;the second quarter in a row&lt;/a&gt; as the COVID-19 pandemic continues on. Alphabet’s Q3 2021 earnings show an all-time record revenue of $65.1 billion and record profits for the &lt;em&gt;fifth &lt;/em&gt;quarter in a row at $18.9 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4uluIU"&gt;As we mentioned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596592/google-q2-2021-record-revenue-profit-youtube-ad-cloud-search"&gt;last quarter&lt;/a&gt;, the growth we’re seeing in 2021 is unusually large: a huge leap over 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="i8DibB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="fr" dir="ltr"&gt;Google’s revenue in Q3&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2021: $65.1 billion&lt;br&gt;2020: $46.2 billion&lt;br&gt;2019: $40.5 billion&lt;br&gt;2018: $33.7 billion&lt;br&gt;2017: $27.8 billion&lt;br&gt;2016: $22.5 billion&lt;br&gt;2015: $18.7 billion&lt;br&gt;2014: $16.5 billion&lt;br&gt;2013: $13.8 billion&lt;br&gt;2012: $13.3 billion&lt;br&gt;2011: $9.7 billion&lt;br&gt;2010: $7.3 billion&lt;br&gt;2009: $5.9 billion&lt;/p&gt;— Jon Erlichman (@JonErlichman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JonErlichman/status/1453089818402041857?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="49nLLH"&gt;Revenue increased 41 percent year over year; profits increased nearly 69 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qzkKr2"&gt;Proportionally, Google’s businesses seem to all be doing roughly the same was they were last quarter, just slightly better in each case — like $37.9 billion for Google’s all-important search business this quarter compared to $35.8 billion last quarter. (It’s the jump year-over-year that’s boggles the mind: search is pulling in &lt;em&gt;$11 billion more&lt;/em&gt; this year than it did last year at this time.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ome97u"&gt;YouTube advertising revenue went up from $7 billion last quarter to a record $7.2 billion this quarter, despite some fears that Apple’s iOS Ad Tracking Transparency would have hit YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738940/snap-q3-2021-earnings-ios-ad-tracking"&gt;like it hit Snap&lt;/a&gt; as users get the ability &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;to easily opt out&lt;/a&gt;. But it sounds like YouTube would have seen even bigger gains without the feature; CFO Ruth Porat reportedly said it had a “modest” impact on ad revenue. Last quarter, we saw YouTube revenue nearly double year over year and add $1 billion over the previous quarter, so this isn’t quite as impressive growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1TlPVU"&gt;Google Cloud is still not yet profitable, and is actually bleeding very slightly more, with operating losses of $644 million instead of the $591 million it lost last quarter. Still, cloud revenues grew by an entire $1.5 billion year over year to $4.99 billion from $3.44 billion in 2020, and that’s still an improvement over last quarter’s $4.6 billion in revenue as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, which won’t factor in these earnings because they’re brand-new, but may not next quarter either because Google doesn’t break out hardware.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AG9Lw7"&gt;As usual, the way Google reports earnings makes it impossible to tell whether its hardware products like the Pixel phone, Nest, Chromecast, and Android in general are doing OK or not. Android, Chrome and all of Google’s hardware initiatives are bundled into a catch-all “Google Services” category that includes big hitters like Search and YouTube. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sE0sWt"&gt;One contributor to the growth: Google chief business officer Philipp Schindler explained on the call that while shoppers are returning to physical stores, the company’s also seeing “strong growth in local shopping queries” at the same time. CFO Ruth Porat says the growth is a combination of continued “broadbased” ad spending and continued consumer interest. (Both of these been high since the middle of the pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348652/pandemic-earnings-antitrust-google-facebook-apple-amazon"&gt;but Big Tech has been doing fine throughout&lt;/a&gt;.) Porat says that Google expects less growth from the Google Play app store next quarter due to the impact of &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=google+play+fee+verge&amp;amp;rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS968US968&amp;amp;oq=google+play+fee+verge&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i64j69i60.2707j0j7&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;the new lower fees for subscription apps&lt;/a&gt; that it announced last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xr0MtB"&gt;Google is facing down &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22186994/google-search-antitrust-lawsuit-colorado-nebraska-state-ags"&gt;a bevy of antitrust lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; arguing that at least some of its profits are ill-gotten gains. They suggest Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/11/22378296/google-secret-project-bernanke-ad-buying-competitors-texas"&gt;boosted its own ad buying system over competitors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/13/22329240/judge-rules-google-5-billion-lawsuit-tracking-chrome-incognito-privacy"&gt;that it tracked users even in incognito mode&lt;/a&gt;, collected location data &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/29/22460070/google-difficult-android-privacy-settings-arizona"&gt;even after users turned off location sharing&lt;/a&gt;, tried to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632804/epic-google-lawsuit-unredacted-complaint-antitrust"&gt;pay off phone makers and app developers&lt;/a&gt;, and more. Most recently, it was accused of &lt;a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-throttled-amp-page-speeds-created-format-to-hamper-header-bidding-antitrust-complaint-claims-375466"&gt;throttling webpage load speeds&lt;/a&gt; to promote its own AMP competitor.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s MacBook Pro is a GPU-shaped warning to Nvidia and AMD</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="New MacBook Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mmlVNDsKIAhqUza-_i6xJ_8tdt4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70048510/akrales_211020_4803_0047.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iPuU28"&gt;Apple hit Intel hard with its first M1 chips, offering a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;rare step-change improvement in performance&lt;/a&gt; with its 2020 MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro. Less than a year later, it’s already starting to compete with the best GPUs from AMD and Nvidia as well. The new MacBook Pros with M1 Pro and M1 Max offer a first glimpse at how well Apple’s M1 chips can scale to provide raw performance that rivals the discrete graphics cards we typically find inside Windows-powered laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RLeQQw"&gt;Nvidia has been trying to woo many of Apple’s professional and creative customers with its Studio laptops, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22734645/apple-macbook-pro-2021-ports-magsafe-touch-bar-usb-c-future"&gt;Apple has not only managed to fix the mistakes it made&lt;/a&gt; with its MacBook port selection and keyboard, but it’s also scaled up its M1 chips to meet the performance expectations of 14- and 16-inch laptops, too. The result has creative professionals excited, and it’s easy to see why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2UUNIH"&gt;While Windows laptops had looked increasingly tempting to the Mac crowd over the past five years, Apple’s new M1 Pro and M1 Max chips &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22733328/apple-macbook-pro-ports-professional-specs"&gt;shift the balance&lt;/a&gt;, particularly in the GPU realm. They look like early warning shots at the AMD- and Nvidia-powered competition. Apple seems confident it can deliver the same performance as a top discrete graphics card while consuming a lot less power. This is all part of Apple’s ambitious plan to transition its Mac lineup fully to Apple Silicon by the end of 2022 and just a glimpse at what the company must have coming to its most powerful Mac, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161358/mac-pro-review-apple-display-xdr-adobe-hardware-software-price-video"&gt;the towering Mac Pro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3NMZD146QLPkU6KkUTonwrSOcxQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22956209/appleGPUcomparison.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple has compared its M1 Max to two RTX 3080 laptops.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7V070m"&gt;Apple proudly compared &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22726444/apple-m1-pro-max-chip-processor-arm-macbook-fastest"&gt;its new M1 Max chip&lt;/a&gt; to two high-end Windows laptops last week, claiming the M1 Max is able to use 100W less power and offer the same relative performance at close to or above Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 3080 mobile chip. While the M1 Max might be Apple’s largest chip it has ever made, it’s still integrating the graphics into a system-on-a-chip (SoC) architecture, compared to the dedicated and separate RTX 3080 cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m8k7Ko"&gt;While there are caveats, it wasn’t just talk: early reviews seem to back up some of Apple’s claims. &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/17024/apple-m1-max-performance-review/6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anandtech &lt;/em&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that both the M1 Pro and M1 Max perform well on productivity-focused loads, with a GFXBench test even putting it close to beating an RTX 3080 laptop equipped with Intel’s Core i9-11980HK &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22423545/intel-tiger-lake-h-mobile-processors-11th-gen-laptops"&gt;flagship notebook processor&lt;/a&gt;. These are the types of loads you’d expect the M1 Max to perform well in, especially given Apple’s work on improving its chips for productivity tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rHZKCi"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhqCC70ZfDM"&gt;YouTuber Dave2D found&lt;/a&gt; the M1 Max was slightly slower than a comparable RTX 3080 system for Adobe Premiere Pro tasks and that M1 Max performance depends on the work involved. While an Adobe Premiere Pro render took 10 minutes and 17 seconds in Dave2D’s testing, an identical render took just 4 minutes and 16 seconds using Apple’s Final Cut Pro software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eqiWIb"&gt;Where the M1 Max and M1 Pro really fall down is in gaming. The M1 Max performs similarly to an RTX 3060 system in &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider. &lt;/em&gt;While midrange gaming might be impressive for an SoC, it’s disappointing compared to Apple’s claims because an RTX 3060 is a notable step down from an RTX 3070, let alone an RTX 3080. &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/17024/apple-m1-max-performance-review/6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anandtech&lt;/em&gt;’s tests&lt;/a&gt; also show the flagship M1 Max offering less than half the performance of an RTX 3080 laptop in &lt;em&gt;Borderlands 3&lt;/em&gt;. We’re still reviewing Apple’s latest MacBook Pros, but we’ve also found the M1 Max is mostly comparable to an RTX 3060 notebook for gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Fi17v5i2_3h2Opzpj16rn7JBP4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22948080/akrales_211020_4803_0024.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s new MacBook Pros include some impressive GPU performance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yAArlN"&gt;Given most macOS cross-platform games are still x86 and the fact macOS has never really been a platform for gaming, it’s no surprise to see the M1 Max struggling here. So another way to think about it is that Apple’s &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; matching the RTX 3060 without the benefit of game developers optimizing for its M1 chips. That’s an impressive start for Apple, even if there’s no indication yet that the Mac will attract optimized games in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rUD5Qj"&gt;It’s also impressive when you consider the power draw and thermal headroom involved. We’ve already seen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21559228/apple-new-macbook-air-pro-difference-arm-m1-fan-thermal-performance"&gt;the difference a fan can make&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;MacBook Pro 13-inch model&lt;/a&gt; compared to the fanless MacBook Air. Now, we’re seeing what it can do with a 140W power adapter and a larger 14- or 16-inch chassis to dissipate the heat. What could Apple do in an iMac or Mac Pro, with plenty of time and plenty of room to build an even bigger and better GPU with fewer thermal and power constraints? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JNGgfz"&gt;“It’s clear that Apple’s ongoing experience with GPUs has paid off with the development of their A-series chips, and now their M1 family of SoCs,” writes &lt;em&gt;Anandtech’s&lt;/em&gt; Andrei Frumusanu. “Put succinctly, the new M1 SoCs prove that Apple can build the kind of big and powerful GPUs that they need for their high-end machines. AMD and NVIDIA need not apply.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="An5Yv9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1450233957350576129"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reporter Mark Gurman says&lt;/a&gt; those bigger chips are already coming, with Apple designing two variations for the next desktop Mac Pro that offer “2x and 4x the number of CPU and GPU cores as the M1 Max.” That will result in up to 40 CPU cores and up to 128 GPU cores on the very high-end Mac Pro models, and it will be the real test of Apple’s ability to scale its M1 advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="j1U9aP"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;For those who think the M1 Pro and M1 Max in the MacBook Pro are impressive, the new Mac Pro desktop is expected to come in at least two variations: 2X and 4X the number of CPU and GPU cores as the M1 Max. That’s up to 40 CPU cores and 128 GPU cores on the high-end.&lt;/p&gt;— Mark Gurman (@markgurman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1450233957350576129?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dZeXgC"&gt;AMD currently supplies Radeon Pro GPUs inside Apple’s existing Mac Pro models, and if Apple’s core count and performance can scale well on the GPU side, then it’s easy to see how Apple’s own GPUs could blow past &lt;a href="https://www.amd.com/en/graphics/radeon-apple-w6000x-series"&gt;AMD’s Radeon PRO W6000X&lt;/a&gt; cards. Apple is already close to mobile RTX 3080s in some tasks with the M1 Max — we’re looking forward to seeing what it will do when Apple’s chip designers can focus less on mobility and more on cooling its hardware for maximum performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xKTRDh"&gt;If more software and even games become optimized to take advantage of the M1 Pro and M1 Max chips, and Apple’s desktop chips deliver the performance improvements we’ve seen so far with M1, Apple could be on course to redefine the performance expectations of desktop PCs, just like it redefined the expectations around laptop chips late last year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blizzard will ‘pause’ plans for an online BlizzCon event in 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g6XSGA"&gt;The pandemic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22455077/blizzcon-canceled-global-event-blizzconline-blizzard"&gt;canceled BlizzCon 2021&lt;/a&gt;, and it appears that a planned online event next year from Blizzard will also be a scratch. An &lt;a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/blizzcon/23738004/reimagining-blizzcon"&gt;uncredited blog post&lt;/a&gt; says, “We’ve decided to take a step back and pause on planning the previously announced BlizzConline event scheduled for early next year.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MJVSzm"&gt;It didn’t specifically cite a reason, but after revelations surfaced about a company culture rife with sexual harassment and discrimination, the last several months have seen an employee walkout, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607356/blizzard-president-leaving-harassment-protest-brack"&gt;the departure of president J. Allan Brack&lt;/a&gt;, and several competing investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zVYylW"&gt;Most recently, Blizzard &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/22/22740836/blizzard-overwatch-jesse-mccree-name-change-cole-cassidy"&gt;renamed the cowboy hero in &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; to Cole Cassidy&lt;/a&gt;. The employee the character got his name from was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620800/activision-blizzard-departures-lawsuit-diablo-4-director"&gt;one of several high-profile departures following the filing of a sexual harassment lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;. He was also pictured in a room dubbed the “Cosby Suite” during an earlier BlizzCon event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KBo1w4"&gt;Now, Blizzard says that it still sees a role for BlizzCon in communicating with its players, saying after 16 years, “we would also like to take the time to reimagine what a BlizzCon event of the future could look like.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung announces cloud gaming for Tizen TVs, offers no further details</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/25mxnt_k7UwTLdSILEeOcd6kzEQ=/459x0:2880x1614/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70048327/Screen_Shot_2021_10_26_at_11.09.32.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SEqnMp"&gt;Samsung &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/ElMqHkG26sM?t=1517"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s jumping into the cloud gaming arena with an offering for its Tizen smart TV platform. The news came during its Samsung Developer Conference keynote, and the company didn’t provide any more details about what games would be available, what other platforms it would be available on, if any, or when it will launch. Cloud gaming is an area that many of its big tech competitors are getting into, but it’s also an area Samsung has dabbled in before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JJoENz"&gt;In the early 2010s, Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/6/5/3066544/samsung-gaikai-cloud-gaming-service"&gt;worked with a game streaming company called Gaikai&lt;/a&gt; to bring an early version of cloud gaming to its high-end TVs. The pitch was basically the same as it is these days — Samsung Cloud Gaming would let you play games with only a TV, internet connection, and controller. The system &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/7/4/3137144/gaikai-cloud-gaming-samsung-smart-tv-beta-launched"&gt;even launched in beta&lt;/a&gt;, but then Gaikai’s new owner decided to go in a different direction. That owner, by the way, was Sony, and the tech was &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/1/7/5284504/sony-playstation-now-gaikai-based-streaming-service-ps-ps2-ps3"&gt;eventually folded into&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20993828/sony-playstation-now-cloud-gaming-gaikai-onlive-google-stadia-25th-anniversary"&gt;underwhelming PlayStation Now service&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1RP9cf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Samsung will face more competition in 2021 than it would’ve in 2012&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fOkpkf"&gt;In 2021, Samsung will face more competition than it would’ve in the early days from some big tech rivals — Google runs its Stadia service, Amazon is working on Luna, and more gaming-focused companies like Microsoft and Nvidia have their own offerings as well. Generally, though, the goal is to get game streaming services on as many platforms as possible, offering the same gaming experience on phones and TVs. &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/changing-the-daily-life-of-the-future-sdc21-experts-discuss-next-generation-technologies"&gt;On a Q&amp;amp;A on its website&lt;/a&gt;, Samsung says that its goal with its cloud gaming service is allowing “users to play the latest games on their Samsung Smart TV equipped with the Tizen platform.” To me, that reads as a pretty exclusive service, though that could change in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k2kD12"&gt;Samsung also says that it’s working with partners on the service and that it’s using web tech to power it. Samsung didn’t immediately respond to a request for more information about the service, but we’ll update if we hear back. &lt;/p&gt;
