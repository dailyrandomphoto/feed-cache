    <title>Nvidia is building new Arm CPUs again: Nvidia Grace, for the data center</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ajAHEiQoGFtHetV7d8RZtzxLvgs=/0x0:1875x1250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69113976/nvidia_grace_cpu_board.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vVrMLl"&gt;We’ve barely heard a peep out of Nvidia on the CPU front for years, after the lackluster arrival of its Project Denver CPU and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/5/5278206/nvidia-debuts-tegra-k1-192-core-processor"&gt;its associated Tegra K1 mobile processors in 2014&lt;/a&gt;. But now, the company’s getting back into CPUs in a big way with &lt;a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-cpu-for-giant-ai-and-high-performance-computing-workloads"&gt;the new Nvidia Grace&lt;/a&gt;, an Arm-based processing chip specifically designed for AI data centers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VRikSP"&gt;It’s a good time for Nvidia to be flexing its Arm: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21435890/nvidia-arm-acquisition-40-billion-ai-cloud-edge-why"&gt;it’s currently trying to buy Arm itself for $40 billion&lt;/a&gt;, pitching it specifically as an attempt “to create the world’s premier computing company for the age of AI,” and this chip might be the first proof point. Arm is having a moment in the consumer computing space as well, where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;Apple’s M1 chips recently upended our concept of laptop performance&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also more competition for Intel, of course, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CNBCnow/status/1381647004518977546"&gt;whose shares dipped after the Nvidia announcement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WWELWs"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Meet the NVIDIA Grace &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CPU?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#CPU&lt;/a&gt;, leveraging the flexibility of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Arm?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Arm&lt;/a&gt;’s data center architecture and designed from the ground up to accelerate the largest HPC and AI workloads. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GTC21?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GTC21&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/PHDaxrfzQv"&gt;https://t.co/PHDaxrfzQv&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/uck0akde3a"&gt;pic.twitter.com/uck0akde3a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NVIDIA GTC (@NVIDIAGTC) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NVIDIAGTC/status/1381643513377472515?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xMerOT"&gt;The new Grace is named after computing pioneer &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper"&gt;Grace Hopper&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s coming in 2023 to bring “10x the performance of today’s fastest servers on the most complex AI and high performance computing workloads,” according to Nvidia. That will make it attractive to research firms building supercomputers, of course, which the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS) and Los Alamos National Laboratory &lt;a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/04/12/cpu-grace-cscs-alps/"&gt;are already signed up to build&lt;/a&gt; in 2023 as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M6HXRm"&gt;A Grace Next is already on the roadmap for 2025, too. Here’s a slide from Nvidia’s GTC 2021 presentation where it announced the news:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n1sZkypTalWFazX6fhIIPzv_2sA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22438502/nvidia_roadmap.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BGg92g"&gt;I’d recommend reading &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16610/nvidia-unveils-grace-a-highperformance-arm-server-cpu-for-use-in-ai-systems"&gt;what our friends at &lt;em&gt;AnandTech&lt;/em&gt; have to say&lt;/a&gt; about where Grace might fit into the data center market and Nvidia’s ambitions. It’s worth noting that Nvidia isn’t releasing much in the way of specs just yet — but Nvidia does say it features a fourth-gen NVLink with a record 900 GB/s interconnect between the CPU and GPU. “Critically, this is greater than the memory bandwidth of the CPU, which means that NVIDIA’s GPUs will have a cache coherent link to the CPU that can access the system memory at full bandwidth, and also allowing the entire system to have a single shared memory address space,” writes &lt;em&gt;AnandTech.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tvvnVq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mythic Quest season 2 gets new trailer ahead of May 7th debut</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UqJZ5N_-cXY02F3JOI-g15llOhM=/77x0:904x551/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69113808/021921_Apple_Original_Mythic_Quest_Returns_Big_Image_01_big_image_post.jpg.large.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pJ90Sj"&gt;Apple released a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXl6KtP9TFw"&gt;new trailer for &lt;em&gt;Mythic Quest&lt;/em&gt;’s second season&lt;/a&gt; on Monday ahead of its May 7th debut. The trailer doesn’t feature many specific plot points, though it looks like we’ll be seeing how Ian Grimm (Rob McElhenney) and Poppy Li (Charlotte Nicdao) work together on a new expansion now that they’re co-creative directors on the fictional game. Things between them seem good, at least at the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9D9zCx"&gt;The trailer also features Snoop Dogg (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/13/10764666/xbox-live-down-snoop-dogg-playstation"&gt;who does play video games IRL&lt;/a&gt;), who asks Grimm where the game’s next expansion is. He also made an appearance in a motion-capture suit in &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/vHVknNT_Bmw"&gt;the season 2 teaser trailer&lt;/a&gt;, so here’s hoping he has a notable role of some kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D02Pd3"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vHVknNT_Bmw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JkSIua"&gt;The comedy’s first season &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/7/21128489/mythic-quest-ravens-banquet-review-apple-tv"&gt;was a surprise hit&lt;/a&gt; when it premiered last year. The creators also released a quarantine special last May, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21337148/quarantine-specials-parks-rec-30-rock-community"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mythic Quest: Quarantine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which was made entirely remotely and &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/mythic-quest-quarantine-40-iphones-600k-charity-a-cast-crew-eager-keep-going-1295215"&gt;filmed with 40 iPhones&lt;/a&gt;. A standalone bonus episode about the crew returning to the offices &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/04/mythic-quest-bonus-episode-season-2-premiere-apple-tv-1234728249/"&gt;will premiere this Friday&lt;/a&gt; ahead of season 2.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nuro’s self-driving robot will deliver Domino’s pizza orders to customers in Houston</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rN4fRnO0XT9SCOWdyX-2JsIQpRg=/0x1:5129x3420/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69113804/nuro_03.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Domino’s Nuro autonomous delivery vehicle.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Domino’s&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PioTWw"&gt;Domino’s Pizza will start delivering pizzas via Nuro driverless cars in Houston this week as part of a pilot program, the company announced Monday. The company says “select customers” in Houston who make a prepaid delivery order from its store in the Woodland Heights neighborhood during certain dates and times can have their pizza brought to them by a Nuro R2 robot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ICdQf1"&gt;Here’s how the pizza deliveries will work: a customer places and pays for an order online from the Woodland Heights store and opts in to have the order brought by the R2. The customer receives a unique PIN via text alert along with updates on the vehicle’s location. When the robot car arrives, the customer enters the PIN on its touch screen, which opens the R2’s doors. Pizza ensues. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-OIC_hiJhJ7alR7X64UFx4yOwgo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22438391/nuro_smaller.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Domino’s&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A customer retrieves her pizzas from Nuro’s R2 delivery robot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Xxzy5Z"&gt;Nuro’s R2 was the first driverless vehicle to receive regulatory approval from the US Department of Transportation last February, giving it a special exemption from federal safety requirements. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/30/16936548/nuro-self-driving-delivery-last-mile-google"&gt;Founded in 2018&lt;/a&gt; by two former Google engineers, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/17/18681891/dominos-nuro-driverless-pizza-delivery-houston"&gt;Nuro partnered with Domino’s&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 for the pizza delivery pilot in Houston, which is finally rolling out now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4z4aDd"&gt;Nuro vehicles are already being used for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18265397/nuro-robot-delivery-houston-texas-kroger"&gt;grocery deliveries&lt;/a&gt; and for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21272966/nuro-cvs-autonomous-medicine-delivery-robot-houston"&gt;deliveries from CVS Pharmacy&lt;/a&gt; stores in Houston. Last April, Nuro said it would use its vehicles to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21231466/nuro-delivery-robot-health-care-workers-food-supplies-california"&gt;transport medical supplies around two California stadiums&lt;/a&gt; that were converted into treatment facilities for patients with COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AFeViK"&gt;“This program will allow us to better understand how customers respond to the deliveries, how they interact with the robot and how it affects store operations,” Dennis Maloney, Domino’s chief innovation officer, said in a statement. “We look forward to seeing how autonomous delivery can work along with Domino’s existing delivery experts to better support the customers’ needs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xd25Gb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dQLY9h"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Soon, the internet will make its own cat photos and then it won’t need us</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d4yObk8DEuj0UZi1OerNtwcvpCI=/128x0:2432x1536/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69113628/fake_cats.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;These cats do not exist.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RE2CK7"&gt;This cat doesn’t exist: &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cmu01yUZXdWzTjWVW2_3NL2lMKg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22438212/Screen_Shot_2021_04_12_at_8.15.22_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AI-made cat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IlGadq"&gt;This one doesn’t either:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_yyn9SIfYW8smJOi1UUa8ZXbJi0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22438217/Screen_Shot_2021_04_12_at_8.16.17_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fake cat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sn1upu"&gt;These are computer-generated images from &lt;a href="https://thiscatdoesnotexist.com/"&gt;This Cat Does Not Exist&lt;/a&gt;, and folks: I think we are in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9JquG"&gt;I understand this is going to sound crackpot, but hear me out. What if our computers are already smarter than us, and the only reason they’re pretending they aren’t is so we’ll continue feeding them their favorite thing, photos of our cats? I understand that in isolation this sounds ridiculous, but I don’t think it’s any sillier than the Singularity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wfkBuB"&gt;Under this theory, Skynet has already happened, but Skynet is benign because one of the first things we taught it was that cats were cute. And Skynet doesn’t have cats. We do. This is our major structural advantage: we can feed the internet fresh cat photos. It’s why the internet — thus far, anyway — has remained willing to continue human life as we know it: for our cats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pzu8jy"&gt;The problem, then, with This Cat Does Not Exist is that it allows the internet to make its own cat photos. That means Skynet doesn’t need us anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XT308v"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;None of these cats exist. All are GAN-generated images obtained from &lt;a href="https://t.co/AEMYeQ4ZrO"&gt;https://t.co/AEMYeQ4ZrO&lt;/a&gt;. Can we come up with a way to detect GAN-generated cat pics? &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CaturdayShenaniGANs?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#CaturdayShenaniGANs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(GAN = "generative adversarial network", the AI technique used to create the images)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;cc: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZellaQuixote?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@ZellaQuixote&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/gsaPJPGKEX"&gt;pic.twitter.com/gsaPJPGKEX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Conspirador Norteño (@conspirator0) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/conspirator0/status/1381006494901096449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GfacKS"&gt;This isn’t new, exactly — but last year, the &lt;a href="https://signum.ai/blog/ethics-of-artificial-intelligence/"&gt;computer-generated cats were horror shows&lt;/a&gt;. And yes, a people version exists already, but this isn’t an existential threat. We did not teach the computers that people are adorable. We taught them that &lt;em&gt;cats &lt;/em&gt;are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dWwp7U"&gt;One of these cats is real (and my own personal cat). The other one does not exist:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="v0QJk1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10442165"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="krnV31"&gt;The tells, as far as I can see, occur around the edge of the fur: it’s weirdly blurry. Also, as with the people version, the fake cat has an out-of-focus background. The coloration in the fake cat’s eyes is also a little less defined than my cat’s. Still, this is impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9lwEN4"&gt;The new batch of AI cats is limited — face only, no &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CG8ibLdhDsM/"&gt;goofball action&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes the ears don’t match — but they may very well represent the first step toward the Matrix-like future of humanity. Because if the machines don’t need our cat photos anymore, they don’t need us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tcc0Q6"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CN44ri"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The FCC wants you to test your internet speeds with its new app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JHlmb6KFsqm6T4hQ_5iCMlOCwA8=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69113495/acastro_170711_1777_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gigBoh"&gt;The Federal Communications Commission has released a new speed test app to help measure internet speeds across the country, available on both Android and iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0wSdls"&gt;The FCC Speed Test App works similarly to existing speed-testing apps like Ookla’s and Fast by Netflix, automatically collecting and displaying data once users press the “start testing” button. According to the FCC, the data collected through the app will inform the agency’s efforts to collect more accurate broadband speed information and aid its broadband deployment efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nL1ig9ZwBtfcjs94TnocuSIrTQA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22438239/Screenshot_20210412_105632_2.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The FCC’s Speed Test app allows users to test their speeds and share the data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FTFedW"&gt;“To close the gap between digital haves and have nots, we are working to build a comprehensive, user-friendly dataset on broadband availability,” Acting Chair Jessica Rosenworcel said in a statement Monday. “Expanding the base of consumers who use the FCC Speed Test app will enable us to provide improved coverage information to the public and add to the measurement tools we’re developing to show where broadband is truly available throughout the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xGbzB2"&gt;The app is part of the agency’s broader efforts to collect more accurate broadband speed data across the country. The FCC’s current coverage maps are built from self-reported data from internet service providers like AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon. In doing so, the process &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/24/17882842/us-internet-broadband-map-isp-fcc-wireless-competition"&gt;has allowed ISPs&lt;/a&gt; to exaggerate their current coverage, drawing heated criticism from broadband access advocates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4txKTV"&gt;Earlier this year, the FCC asked the public to fact-check ISP data by entering in their address in the current broadband maps and submitting &lt;a href="https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360001440131"&gt;a form here&lt;/a&gt; if the information described is incorrect. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook pins state vaccine information to the top of the News Feed for US users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fHzxHMDNgZz3cIahqSgeCEwwJGM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69113471/mdoying_180118_2249_facebook_0445stills_3.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AOo2aG"&gt;As all adults across the US become eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, Facebook is making it easier for its users to find information based on where they live. The company has started rolling out a feature that pins a box with state-specific information about &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/state-covid-19-vaccine-information/"&gt;where to get a COVID-19 vaccine&lt;/a&gt; at the top of the News Feed for every US user living in a state where the general public is eligible to receive the shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AmIyfF"&gt;The box, once available, will appear at the top of your News Feed and show you state-specific information, confirming that you are now eligible to receive the vaccine, including a link on where to find the vaccine in your province, as seen in the image below:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HhaQxfqUxA3kr4gpBRtres2Ui7w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22437890/NRP_Covid_Vaccine_Eligibility_Notifications_banner.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new feature is a box that is pinned to your News Feed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BqRhSu"&gt;Most US states have now made vaccination appointments available to all adults, although &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-19-vaccine-eligibility.html"&gt;some states&lt;/a&gt; are still lagging. With more availability, it has become a challenge for some people in certain parts of the US to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22279023/covid-19-vaccine-appointment-how-to"&gt;book an appointment&lt;/a&gt;, leading &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/31/22256167/covid-vaccine-website-nyc-appointment"&gt;some volunteers to build dedicated websites&lt;/a&gt; to help people in their search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4sRMz0"&gt;The feature is also available in “nearly 20 countries,” according to Facebook, with the ultimate goal to release it in more areas as countries begin opening COVID-19 vaccinations to the general public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="90l29M"&gt;Facebook rolled out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22177085/facebook-covid-19-misinformation-notifications"&gt;a similar feature to its mobile app last year&lt;/a&gt;, which helped fight misinformation about COVID-19 appearing on its platform as the site &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253055/facebook-q4-2020-earnings-report-app-usage-record-user-numbers"&gt;saw a surge in users&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook says more than 3 million US users clicked through those promotions between January and March, suggesting the new vaccine links may reach a significant number of Facebook users in the months to come.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is making another attempt at personal health records</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g_3TPIhcjuJgw_6OaYLUFLfEd68=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69113302/acastro_210121_1777_google_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9SuMOA"&gt;Google is recruiting people to give feedback for a new consumer-facing medical records tool, &lt;em&gt;Stat News &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/04/09/google-health-records-app-care-studio/"&gt;reported on Friday&lt;/a&gt;. The company wants to know how people want to interact with information pulled from their medical records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m0DU0G"&gt;Right now, the company is recruiting around 300 people who use Android devices in Northern California, Atlanta, and Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="25PYkO"&gt;This is Google’s second attempt at creating a way for people to access their medical records. In 2008, it launched Google Health, which aimed to give people a way to see their health information online. It didn’t take off, and Google shut it down in 2012. “We haven’t found a way to translate that limited usage into widespread adoption in the daily health routines of millions of people,” Google wrote in a 2011 &lt;a href="https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/06/update-on-google-health-and-google.html"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y4NI8x"&gt;In the aftermath, experts had a number of different theories for the failure: some thought it was because consumers at the time &lt;a href="https://www.crn.com/news/mobility/video/300077425/why-did-google-health-fail.htm"&gt;weren’t actually interested&lt;/a&gt; in taking direct control of their health records. &lt;a href="https://www.pulseitmagazine.com.au/news/australian-ehealth/954-feature-why-did-google-health-fail"&gt;Others said&lt;/a&gt; Google didn’t do enough to integrate with the health IT landscape or that the company didn’t do enough to show people that it could be trusted with their health data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="feNhZk"&gt;A decade later, we’re in a very different digital health landscape. Apple launched a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/29/17176740/apple-health-records-app-ios-update"&gt;health records section&lt;/a&gt; in its Health app in 2018, which lets people pull their records from hospitals and clinics directly onto their iPhone. Health apps have proliferated, wearables are adopting wellness features, and people are more and more accustomed to handling their health information through smartphones and other devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NX7Fiq"&gt;Google is also working on the doctor-facing side of health records; its &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/23/google-project-nightingale-care-studio/"&gt;Care Studio&lt;/a&gt; program gives clinicians a way to search through patient records more easily. Other health efforts include a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165465/google-health-research-app-covid-flu-apple"&gt;research app&lt;/a&gt; that lets Android users participate in medical studies and a Nest Hub feature that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22331567/google-nest-hub-new-2021-smart-display-sleep-tracking-soli-price-specs-features"&gt;tracks sleep&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9YNi6q"&gt;Google is “making progress” on the consumer health record initiative, Bob Wachter, chair of the department of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/04/09/google-health-records-app-care-studio/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Stat News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He advises Google on its health records projects. “It didn’t knock my socks off,” he said, but “I think they’re doing it in a thoughtful, measured, and mature way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pizr5q"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM rolls out a new cloud-based mapping service for nearly 1 million vehicles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h8m-fDlThFeh7V7Pa2YLOWBAwyo=/0x0:5700x3800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69113078/GM_Maps_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fCnrKe"&gt;General Motors is launching a new in-car mapping service for nearly 1 million of its vehicles. The new service is called Maps Plus, and it will be powered by &lt;a href="https://www.mapbox.com/"&gt;Mapbox&lt;/a&gt;, the open-source-based map provider that competes against Google and Here for enterprise deals for customized and in-app maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SBLSuk"&gt;In addition to in-car navigation, Maps Plus will also integrate with other popular apps, including music streaming services like Spotify or voice assistants like Alexa, which will appear as individual widgets superimposed over the map. While plotting a destination, Maps Plus will also notify the driver of the current speed limit or if they will need to refuel along the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6ui4I6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Maps Plus is designed for vehicle owners who didn’t purchase the option for in-car navigation when they bought their vehicle&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="94NsGS"&gt;Maps Plus is designed for vehicle owners who didn’t purchase the option for in-car navigation when they bought their vehicle, said Tim Babbitt, senior manager for digital experiences at GM. While a “significant percentage” of people do opt for navigation, there are vehicle packages that generally don’t include it, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FW6GMu"&gt;GM says the service will be available to select model year 2018 and newer Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, and Cadillac vehicles by the end of 2021. Maps Plus will be offered as part of GM’s OnStar &lt;a href="https://www.onstar.com/us/en/plans-pricing/connected-services/"&gt;Connected Services subscription service&lt;/a&gt;, which starts at $14.99 a month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a9dGt8"&gt;Obviously, many car owners use popular services like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto that mirror their phone’s interface on the infotainment screen in their vehicle. But Babbitt says those services don’t offer the same type of embedded experience that GM is offering with Maps Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xTBsyv"&gt;“With an embedded experience that can work with all of the signals of the vehicle, there’s integrations that are possible that we think the customer would find very helpful to have,” he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It’s an end-to-end integrated type of experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qFrMVB"&gt;Many automakers have made deals to integrate apps and navigation provided by major tech companies like Google. Ford recently made such a deal, along with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20906777/volvo-xc40-suv-ev-native-android-auto-google-assistant-maps"&gt;Volvo&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-renault-nissan-google/renault-nissan-adopts-android-in-coup-for-google-idUSKCN1LY0RO"&gt;Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, to use Google to power its software and vehicle infotainment services. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20851021/general-motors-android-auto-google-infotainment"&gt;GM also made a deal with Google&lt;/a&gt; for vehicles that are model year 2022 and on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PS4W4m"&gt;But Babbitt says Maps Plus is meant to “fill the gap of the customers that don’t have embedded nav today, and to make sure that everybody has the ability to have a strong embedded experience in their vehicle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qABVrW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Topps is releasing official NFT baseball cards on April 20th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TkvIRblghz1uDuj6ZM6mLSwR5RU=/73x0:2599x1684/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69112909/Screen_Shot_2021_04_12_at_9.42.37_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3vs5go"&gt;Major League Baseball has announced its latest move to cash &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.topps.com%2Fblog%2Ftopps-debuts-its-first-mlb-baseball-card-nft-collection-with-topps-series-1-baseball-launch-.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F12%2F22379645%2Ftopps-mlb-basecall-cards-nft-collectible-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in on the NFT craze&lt;/a&gt;: official blockchain-based versions of classic Topps baseball cards. Topps is selling the new NFT baseball cards &lt;a href="https://on.wax.io/toppsmlb/"&gt;through the WAX blockchain&lt;/a&gt;, which the company has used for its earliest blockchain-based collectibles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n6Q4MU"&gt;The first “Series 1” cards will be sold starting on April 20th, with 50,000 standard packs (containing six cards for $5) and around 24,000 premium packs (offering 45 cards for $100) set to be sold in the first wave. Topps is also offering a free “exclusive Topps MLB Opening Day NFT Pack” to the first 10,000 users who sign up for email alerts for new releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OdxajJ"&gt;It’s a similar idea to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22348858/nba-nft-top-shot-dapper-labs"&gt;NBA’s white-hot Top Shot NFTs&lt;/a&gt;, which offer fans purchasable video clips (called Moments) in card-like packs. Top Shot Moments are already a massive business — some have sold for upwards of $200,000, and more than 800,000 accounts have yielded over $500 million in sales so far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Ftz8aY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The NBA tries to make a slam dunk out of NFTs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22348858/nba-nft-top-shot-dapper-labs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="fuKaa3"&gt;And while the Topps baseball cards won’t be full-fledged videos like Top Shot Moments, the company is planning to take advantage of the digital nature of the NFT cards by adding things like animated backgrounds or holographic effects on rarer cards. It’s not the MLB’s first dip into cryptocurrency, either: the league has experimented with Ethereum-based blockchain bobbleheads in its &lt;a href="https://www.mlbcryptobaseball.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MLB Champions&lt;/em&gt; game, too&lt;/a&gt;. The Topps cards promise a more traditional style of collectible, however. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kK8lnE"&gt;Topps’ collectible baseball cards have been around for decades and bring a level of name recognition and respectability to the world of collectibles that other NFT efforts may lack. But it’ll still have to convince fans that the digital versions of those cards are a sound investment and not just a bubble that’s waiting to burst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="R3hP3b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Uber reported bookings for its ride-hailing business rose 9 percent in March</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oxvUR7TPptxuvG2CUYEvBuAtEIs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69112783/acastro_180927_1777_uber_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dvLIcP"&gt;Uber saw record gross bookings in March 2021, according to a filing posted Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The increase may signal the beginning of a comeback for the ride-hailing business, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22277043/uber-lyft-earnings-q4-2020-profit-loss-covid"&gt;suffered mightily in 2020&lt;/a&gt; due to the coronavirus pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gP9gTT"&gt;Uber’s mobility segment, which includes its ride-hailing business, was up 9 percent between February and March 2021, with an annualized run rate of $30 billion. Uber’s food delivery segment UberEats, which helped the company stave off even bigger losses in 2020, doubled its annual run rate from March of last year, coming in at $52 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="koyRPK"&gt;“As vaccination rates increase in the United States, we are observing that consumer demand for Mobility is recovering faster than driver availability, and consumer demand for Delivery continues to exceed courier availability,” Uber said in the SEC filing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oPETlm"&gt;In February, &lt;a href="https://investor.uber.com/news-events/news/press-release-details/2021/Uber-Announces-Results-for-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020/default.aspx"&gt;Uber reported&lt;/a&gt; it lost $968 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 and had a net loss of $6.7 billion for the year, which improved on its $8.5 billion loss in full-year 2019. Its UberEats division saw gross bookings rise 130 percent in the fourth quarter, to $10.05 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oXroKw"&gt;Uber said on April 7th that it was launching a $250 million “stimulus” of incentives for its drivers to coax them back behind the wheel. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uber.com%2Fnewsroom%2Fgetting-drivers-back-on-the-road%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F12%2F22379610%2Fuber-bookings-ride-hailing-increase-march" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;company said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; announcing the incentive program that many drivers had stopped driving in 2020 because they weren’t getting enough trips to make it worth their time. Dennis Cinelli, Uber’s vice president for mobility in the US and Canada, wrote in the post that “in 2021, there are more riders requesting trips than there are drivers available to give them—making it a great time to be a driver.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HHXg6i"&gt;In Monday’s filing, Uber also cautioned that it expects a “significant accrual” in costs after it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22334771/uber-uk-drivers-workers-benefits-employees-decision"&gt;reclassified all its drivers in the UK as workers&lt;/a&gt; last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9dwpEM"&gt;Uber will release its &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210412005255/en/Uber-Announces-Date-of-First-Quarter-2021-Results-Conference-Call"&gt;first-quarter financial results&lt;/a&gt; on May 5th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pmV8hH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; An earlier version of this article stated that Uber’s ride-hailing business was up 9 percent year-over-year in March; it was up 9 percent from February 2021 to March 2021. We regret the error. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
