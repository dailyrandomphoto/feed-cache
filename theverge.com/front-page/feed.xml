    <title>GitHub reportedly fired a Jewish employee who warned co-workers to stay safe from Nazis</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Microsoft Acquires GitHub : Illustration" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HZmoUgT5Zif1ggIMSV7pvAooa8k=/0x48:4675x3165/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68657931/967199986.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Chesnot/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7gUmJe"&gt;GitHub reportedly fired a Jewish employee after he posted a message in Slack that said “stay safe homies, Nazis are about” the day of the attack on the US Capitol, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-github-backlash-jewish-employee-termination-2021-1"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="duOMMw"&gt;The message sparked controversy inside the company, with one colleague criticizing him for using divisive language. GitHub’s HR team chastised the employee for using the word “Nazi” in a company Slack channel. Two days later, GitHub allegedly fired him, citing vague patterns of behavior. The employee asked &lt;em&gt;Business Insider &lt;/em&gt;to remain anonymous for fear of online harassment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KFGQdP"&gt;The move shows a lack of understanding on the part of GitHub management, both about the gravity of the attack on the US Capitol and the contextual use of the word Nazi. After &lt;em&gt;Business Insider &lt;/em&gt;published its report, the company was widely criticized on Twitter for trying to “both sides” the issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oivAJ1"&gt;Now, roughly 200 of GitHub’s 1,700 employees have signed a letter asking executives to take a stronger stance against anti-Semitism and white supremacy. They also want to know why the employee was fired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VhdsGZ"&gt;GitHub CEO Nat Friedman told workers that “the company is actively looking into the circumstances surrounding the separation of an employee last week and will take any and all appropriate action following a thorough investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ugllTz"&gt;The employee said he posted the message because he was concerned for his relatives and co-workers living in Washington, DC. He had family who died in the Holocaust and saw that some of the rioters were associated with neo-Nazi organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VaBDSw"&gt;GitHub, an open-source developer platform, was acquired by Microsoft in 2018. The day of the attack on the US Capitol, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/us-capitol-siege-business-leaders-react-jamie-dimon-alexis-ohanian-2021-1"&gt;Microsoft President Brad Smith retweeted a statement&lt;/a&gt; calling on President Trump to “put an end to the chaos and to facilitate the peaceful transition of power.” &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/11/facebook-halts-political-donations-after-capitol-riot.html"&gt;Microsoft also said it would pause political contributions&lt;/a&gt;, much like Facebook and Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gnBVpU"&gt;Before his Slack account was deactivated, the employee expressed bewilderment at the blowback he’d received from his message. “I did not know that, as a Jew, it would be so polarizing to say this word,” he said in a Slack channel for Jewish employees. “We grew up saying [Nazi]. It was a story we told because we had to— the decimation of whole lines of ancestry were at the hands of people who went by that title.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kkhWhx"&gt;This is the second time GitHub has faced significant criticism from employees in recent years. In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/10/9/20906605/github-ice-contract-immigration-ice-dan-friedman"&gt;more than 150 workers signed a letter asking the company to cancel a  $200,000 contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement&lt;/a&gt;. It also comes on the heels of recent employee activism at companies like Twitter and Google. In December, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150355/google-fires-timnit-gebru-facial-recognition-ai-ethicist"&gt;Google fired AI ethicist Timnit Gebru&lt;/a&gt;, prompting a wave of condemnation from tech workers across Silicon Valley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SaqB4i"&gt;GitHub did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Arlo has a touchless doorbell, too — can’t we just update existing ones to do this?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QOKhTBaBqKm9cJ-9Ktf4_pCalsU=/0x0:3600x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68657905/5H1A7164.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;No, not like this. (This is Arlo’s previous doorbell.)&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Arlo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="or9KUW"&gt;“Finally, a doorbell for the pandemic era,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224537/alarm-touchless-video-doorbell-doormat"&gt;we remarked&lt;/a&gt;, as Alarm.com introduced its sub-$200 Touchless Video Doorbell yesterday. But what was once a curiosity has now become a trend: Netgear spinoff Arlo has its own Touchless Video Doorbell, right down to the same product name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WrlUIO"&gt;Arlo doesn’t have a price, release date, or even a picture of the new doorbell, which got me to thinking: why does it need to be any different than the doorbells that Arlo (and Google’s Nest and Amazon’s Ring, etc.) already offer today? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="438GtT"&gt;Here’s how Arlo &lt;a href="https://www.arlo.com/en-us/about/press-releases/2021/arlo-earns-two-2021-ces-innovation-award-honoree-distinctions-highlighted-by-recognition-for-the-arlo-essential-indoor-camera-with-built-in-privacy-shield.aspx"&gt;describes the idea&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="EbAVZj"&gt;Leveraging precise Proximity Sensing Technology to gauge a visitor’s distance, the Arlo Touchless Video Doorbell zeros in on a visitor’s approach. Once detected, the guest hears an audible chime and sees a visible light, signaling the doorbell has been “pressed” and the homeowner has been alerted – all before they come into physical contact with the device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="2KkdI4"&gt;Most smart doorbells already have cameras with some form of motion detection. Some even let you fine-tune motion detection zones, and many already have lights and sounds that let a visitor know when they’ve pressed the button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D1ZCP4"&gt;Why not just fire off a software update to existing doorbells, ones that automatically ring the doorbell when the camera detects a visitor? It could play an audio message like “We’re ringing the doorbell for you, please wait a moment,” too. Arlo’s video doorbells &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/17/20918750/arlo-video-doorbell-price-date"&gt;already support sending pre-recorded audio messages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fDTPKM"&gt;The humble webcam &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22173744/webcam-gadget-of-the-year-2020"&gt;became 2020’s most important gadget&lt;/a&gt; when the pandemic hit, and most DSLR and mirrorless camera makers responded to the webcam shortage by releasing software &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21523161/phone-camera-webcam-how-to-iphone-android-dslr"&gt;to let you turn them into webcams, too&lt;/a&gt;. Do doorbell makers think they can entice enough people to buy a brand-new doorbell just for this, at a time when people aren’t supposed to be visiting each other’s houses? If I’m right and existing cams can do this, it might be more effective to try to sell more of those existing models by building some goodwill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QodQFi"&gt;Arlo introduced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21437592/arlo-essential-wire-free-video-doorbell-price-release-date-battery-powered-security-camera"&gt;its first battery-powered doorbell&lt;/a&gt; late last year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla’s Model Y is the company’s latest five-star safety rated car</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JBI8kbvDM5A42EPHj3M7O3RXH9c=/48x0:663x410/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68657805/v11292P148.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0zT58T"&gt;Tesla’s vehicles have been acing the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s (NHTSA) crash tests for years, and the Model Y is now the latest to join those ranks, with the midsize &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2020/TESLA/MODEL%252520Y/SUV/AWD"&gt;SUV scoring five stars in every category&lt;/a&gt; that the group tests for crash safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ERgFCT"&gt;NHTSA grades cars on a variety of crash test metrics, including frontal crashes (with subcategories for both the driver and passenger seats), side crashes (for crashes into both a barrier and a pole), and rollover scenarios. The Model Y scores five-star results across the board — although, as with the NHTSA’s previous tests, these results are only for regular, human-piloted scenarios, not Tesla’s self-driving Autopilot mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gYB8js"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z212QloYwnw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H8t6B5"&gt;Of course, pictures and star ratings are all well and good, but if you’re more of a visual learner, you can enjoy the video footage of the Tesla SUV smashing into things in soothing slow motion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mjizej"&gt;The new results mean that the Model Y joins the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/20/17882634/tesla-model-3-nhtsa-five-star-safety-rating"&gt;Model 3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/13/15791740/tesla-model-x-crash-test-nhtsa-5-star-rating"&gt;Model X SUV&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/8/20/4639082/teslas-model-s-nabs-top-us-safety-rating"&gt;Model S&lt;/a&gt; in perfect crash test scores. (The Model S was originally granted a 5.4-star rating, before the NHTSA &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/23/5135258/nhtsa-tesla-star-safety-advertising-guidelines"&gt;revised its guidelines&lt;/a&gt; to get rid of “impossible” scores.) &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FBI received over 100,000 pieces of digital evidence after Capitol attack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-POLITICS-JUSTICE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x53KaMaBzxfJNtedwYQczJjR40Q=/0x0:3936x2624/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68657797/1230553222.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P4gzoW"&gt;The Justice Department has received over 100,000 pieces of digital evidence following last week’s deadly attack on the US Capitol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sQX2Wl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22221669/what-just-happened-this-week-trump-social-media-capitol-twitter-facebook-parler"&gt;Shortly after a pro-Trump mob&lt;/a&gt; stormed the Capitol last Wednesday, the FBI posted a tweet requesting any information that could help identify people who participated in the riot. As of Tuesday, the FBI said it received more than 100,000 pieces of digital evidence in the wake of that request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8n0WJ7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The FBI is seeking to identify individuals instigating violence in Washington, D.C. We are accepting tips and digital media depicting rioting or violence in and around the U.S. Capitol on January 6. If you have information, visit &lt;a href="https://t.co/buMd8vYXzH"&gt;https://t.co/buMd8vYXzH&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;— FBI (@FBI) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FBI/status/1347175086432907272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VBCqZT"&gt;It’s not clear how much of this evidence is unique, but FBI officials said Tuesday that the bureau had opened around 170 cases into individual rioters. &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/who-has-been-charged-us-capitol-riot-4523babc6d058229c789b4a9e1f6787c"&gt;Of those 170 cases&lt;/a&gt;, the US Attorney for the District of Columbia has brought federal charges against 20 people. Forty others have been charged in DC’s Superior Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHQHrO"&gt;“You will be found,” an FBI official said at Tuesday’s press conference. “The FBI has a long memory and broad reach. Even if you’ve left DC, agents from our local field offices will be knocking on your door.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="53S1Bn"&gt;In the days following the Capitol attack, tech companies and social media platforms have removed thousands of conspiratorial accounts and individuals. Over the weekend, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22221730/apple-removes-suspends-bans-parler-app-store"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221648/google-suspends-bans-parler-play-store"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; removed the right’s favored social media app, Parler, from their app stores. Shortly after, Parler’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22223335/parler-amazon-terminates-web-hosting-aws-google-apple-capitol"&gt;domain registrars&lt;/a&gt; pulled the plug on the site as well, forcing it offline &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/parler-moves-to-epik-domain-known-for-hosting-far-right-2021-1"&gt;until it found new hosting&lt;/a&gt; on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KPed7Z"&gt;Twitter banned over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226503/twitter-qanon-account-suspension-70000-capitol-riots"&gt;70,000 accounts&lt;/a&gt; for pushing QAnon-fueled conspiracies on its platform. &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/11/trump-twitter-ban/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week that a large amount of QAnon followers took part in last week’s pro-Trump riot at the Capitol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c3zMD7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fmYJ32"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Weber buys smart oven company June</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r0zey_43pLM_VcPu7eH3xBgBhkw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68657683/akrales_190131_3100_0071.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CWtppj"&gt;Weber has acquired June, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/8/7/17660618/june-countertop-smart-oven-version-two"&gt;a smart oven startup&lt;/a&gt; that sells countertop ovens with a camera and temperature sensor built in so that they can automatically bake, roast, and otherwise cook foods in a variety of ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PLAvzr"&gt;June, founded in 2013, has introduced three generations of its smart oven, with &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/junes-third-get-smart-goes-up-for-pre-order-starting-at-599/"&gt;the latest&lt;/a&gt; being announced in October 2020. You can’t actually buy one currently — June’s website says they’re only available on a waitlist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pcbs6k"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Weber wants to offer digital products that “make grilling more dynamic and exciting”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qlebxP"&gt;Development of the June Oven and other June products will continue after the acquisition, Weber says. June will operate as a distinct business unit within Weber, led by Matt Van Horn, a June co-founder and the current CEO. Weber says that the acquisition will let June broaden its product roadmap and help to scale its business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8QaTNE"&gt;June and Weber previously collaborated on the &lt;a href="https://www.weber.com/US/en/accessories/cooking/igrill-and-thermometers/3201.html"&gt;Weber Connect&lt;/a&gt;, a grilling gadget that uses temperature sensors and a smartphone connection to help owners precisely grill meat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VaHqEO"&gt;The acquisition is supposed to help Weber jump ahead when it comes to smart grilling tech. Weber says it plans to launch “digital products, services, and experiences that make grilling more dynamic and exciting.” June’s other co-founder, Nikhil Bhogal, will join Weber as the leader of its technology and connected devices division.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DrrBm8"&gt;Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Older adults struggle to access COVID-19 vaccine appointment websites</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-HEALTH-VIRUS-VACCINE-epidemic" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/usvbyJufkLiphdaM0mt6P4zaWyc=/0x29:5661x3803/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68657511/1230525423.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Kena Betancur / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ldq1rx"&gt;Buggy websites and complex online tools are being used to schedule COVID-19 vaccine appointments across the United States. The systems are hard to navigate for many people, but they’re particularly inaccessible for older adults. People over the ages of 65 and 75 are prioritized for early waves of vaccination and are most at risk from COVID-19 — but they’re also often uncomfortable and unfamiliar with technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1nTa4y"&gt;“The most vulnerable people are left behind even more so than if we hadn’t used more of a technology-oriented solution,” says Ethan Basch, a medical oncologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and physician-in-chief at the North Carolina Cancer Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A9KrrM"&gt;Across the country, registration websites for vaccine appointments have been slammed with demand as soon as they launch, filling up &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/10/world/vaccine-registration-sites-are-opening-across-the-country-and-filling-up-in-minutes.html"&gt;within minutes&lt;/a&gt;. Many Florida county health departments &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22213307/covid-vaccine-florida-eventbrite"&gt;turned to the event management platform Eventbrite&lt;/a&gt; to schedule &lt;a href="https://www.poynter.org/locally/2021/how-a-florida-reporter-became-a-one-woman-help-desk-for-anxious-seniors-navigating-the-covid-19-vaccine/"&gt;appointments&lt;/a&gt;. New York City has multiple registration websites, some of which have &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/new-yorkers-eligible-vaccine-report-frustrations-city-registration-websites"&gt;dozens of fields&lt;/a&gt; to fill out and ask people to upload attachments. Navigating those platforms quickly enough to secure an appointment slot may be challenging for anyone not comfortable with computers or the internet and impossible for someone who doesn’t have access to those tools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KSn4IO"&gt;Only around half of people over the age of 75 use the internet at all, says Susan Nash, a visiting scholar at the Stanford Center on Longevity studying digital literacy options for older adults. “The great irony of this problem is that the people we need to reach with the vaccine and get information to are the ones who are least likely to be online,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YnvcnI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The people we need to reach with the vaccine and get information to are the ones who are least likely to be online”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7HrPe0"&gt;Through the pandemic, gaps in internet access and digital literacy have made other aspects of health care delivery challenging for people who struggle to use technology. Many doctors moved to telehealth, but people without internet access — who tend to be older, non-white, and low income — are &lt;a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20200505.591306/full/"&gt;less likely&lt;/a&gt; to schedule telehealth appointments and are at risk for cracks in their care. They were left out of other services as well: someone without internet access wouldn’t have been able to order groceries through an online service, for example, Nash says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y3aEkp"&gt;“There have been these equity issues all the way through with older people. As we’ve experienced the pandemic, some of the easiest fixes have been to go online — and that leaves this whole population behind,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uhv1nn"&gt;During the vaccine rollout, the need for speed and scale pushed officials toward digital scheduling tools. But local health departments around the US have been underfunded for the last decade, and they haven’t been given the funding over the past few months to create vaccine distribution systems. When the shots first became available, many scrambled to set up platforms to allocate the doses to people who were eligible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pGuZXs"&gt;Many small departments, particularly in rural areas, are overwhelmed, says Charles Wallace, an associate professor of computer science at Michigan Technological University who runs digital literacy programs. “Some poor person has had to take some time out of what’s got to be an incredibly busy schedule to put this information on the web, and designing a good interface takes time,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WwmaJ8"&gt;Quickly developed, jury-rigged digital registration platforms are likely to have elements that are challenging or stressful to people less familiar with technology, Wallace says. One local Michigan health department, for example, sent people to a second webpage through a pop-up warning users that they were leaving the health department’s website. “These pop-ups and warnings are exactly the kind of thing that throws people off when we’re dealing with newcomers,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uyyib9"&gt;Many registration sites in Florida and New York City forced people to move as quickly as possible to input their information or they’d lose a selected appointment slot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="C9MDdL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We can easily lose sight of how thin people’s competencies are”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QnQhRA"&gt;“We can easily lose sight of how thin people’s competencies are,” Wallace says. “There’s a false sense of accomplishment. We put everything on the website and can say, great, we’re done. For a lot of people, the assumptions that people are up for adding attachments and things like that are wildly off.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WocAtx"&gt;Asking people to use these complex systems to schedule something as important as a COVID-19 vaccination appointment compounds the anxiety, Nash says. “There’s more to be worried about, and there’s more reason for someone to talk to a human to find out, ‘Do I really have an appointment? Tell me about the side effects,’” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZdJOkq"&gt;Basch and his colleagues recognized that problem for their patients at the North Carolina Cancer Hospital — a public facility that serves a rural population and groups with low levels of education and health literacy. The state just opened up vaccination to people over 75, and their patients in that age bracket who have cancer are especially in need of vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e1RZWp"&gt;The hospital planned to contact patients through their electronic health records and patient portals, but many patients don’t use that system to communicate with their physicians. “We realized that we would leave people behind,” he says. They’ve started compiling a list of every patient over 75 that doesn’t use the portal, and they plan to call them by phone to schedule vaccination appointments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jDj78m"&gt;Outsourcing to doctors to contact patients directly is one way to sidestep the problem of the digital divide, Nash says. But that puts the burden on already overtaxed health care providers. “It’s another thing to place on them, but it does work,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u9b1kq"&gt;Older adults are also turning to children or grandchildren to navigate webpages or schedule appointments on their behalf. That’s another temporary solution, Nash says — but it only solves the problem for people who have relatives who can access the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4JLnxh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There isn’t a defined group taking responsibility&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H1HY2t"&gt;In the chaos and inconsistency of the initial vaccine rollout, there isn’t a defined group taking responsibility for connecting people with vaccine resources. Guidelines are changing quickly, and there isn’t clear communication to support people who need help. Instead, many of the people who would benefit most from the vaccine are being left to figure out how to get one on their own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DuN0Bn"&gt;“Is it on the patient to make themselves aware, and get themselves connected? Or is it the health system, or the state?” Basch says. “There’s a lack of clarity about whose responsibility it is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TEzxk4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus updates Zephyrus G14 and G15 with latest AMD and Nvidia chips</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Zephyrus G15 in Moonlight White faces the camera, open. The screen displays the ROG logo." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zx9rp1AI7h3uu2wggbfYF9qLxbE=/0x764:5000x4097/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68657434/G15_white_03_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the Zephyrus G15 in “moonlight white.”&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Asus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OdEkT8"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;ROG Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best laptops we saw in 2020, in part due to its exceptional Ryzen 9 4900HS processor. Asus has updated the Zephyrus G14 (plus its larger sibling, the Zephyrus G15) with the latest chips from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225474/amd-ryzen-5000-series-mobile-processors-ces-2021"&gt;AMD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224490/nvidia-rtx-3000-mobile-laptops-gpu-launch-ces-2021"&gt;Nvidia&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPcm1l"&gt;In addition to the chip upgrades, both models have new display options. The G14 now comes with a 144Hz panel. There’s a 2K 120Hz model as well, which Asus says covers the full DCI-P3 color gamut. The G15 has a 165Hz QHD display, also with 100 percent DCIP-3 coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CB026m"&gt;Asus has also added new animations to its Anime Matrix (the grid of LED lights that cover the lid of the G14). There’s now a virtual pet that can live on the display and interact with you. That sounds very cute (and also potentially odd-looking to onlookers). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GXRFi2"&gt;The G15 has gotten a bit of a redesign. It’s inherited the G14’s ErgoLift hinge, which lifts the keyboard deck slightly off the ground to improve cooling (and conveniently hide some of the bottom bezel). It also has a bigger touchpad than its predecessor does — 20 percent bigger, to be precise. Asus also added an additional microphone (there were two, and there are now three).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Zephyrus G15 in Eclipse Gray open, angled to the right. The screen displays the ROG logo." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kaPTsdKEVEpNKc_Cux9XVnsklWI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22230913/G15_gray_05_copy.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here it is in “eclipse gray.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AjyFCF"&gt;Both models have bigger 90Wh batteries (and the G14’s battery life was already pretty good). Asus says you’ll get over 10 hours to a charge from the G15. Both also feature improved speakers with brand-new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225010/dolby-voice-audio-voice-calls-background-noise-levels-zoom"&gt;Dolby Atmos software&lt;/a&gt; and two-way AI noise cancellation. There are still no webcams to be seen, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r4slFR"&gt;The G14 and G15 will be available in Q1 of 2021. Asus hasn’t yet announced whether pricing will change. Current models start at $1,049.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dell updates its Alienware m15 and m17 laptops with Nvidia’s new RTX 3000 GPUs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HXfgBy3qlFA0CAw70Csbu8oeZtg=/0x1:1280x854/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68657236/Alienware_m15_lifestyle.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Alienware m15 R4 | Photo: Dell&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qWrWit"&gt;Alienware is upgrading its m15 and m17 gaming laptops with some boosted specs at CES 2021, with the new R4 models offering Nvidia’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226544/nvidia-rtx-3080-laptops-gpus-ces-2021"&gt;latest RTX 3000 series GPUs for laptops&lt;/a&gt;, faster memory options, more internal storage, and — for the m17 R4, specifically — an optional 360Hz display, a first for Alienware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LvpSZ1"&gt;Both the 15-inch and 17-inch models still offer Intel’s 10th Gen Intel Core i7-10870H and Core i9-10980HK CPU options, but they can now be configured with up to 32GB of 2,933MHz memory and up to 4TB of PCIe storage. There’s newly added HDMI 2.1 support for better output to your fancy new TV — especially for gaming. And the aforementioned 360Hz display option gives the 17-inch model a 1080p, 360Hz panel with G-Sync for folks who need the absolute fastest refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZLF8KsfKXEgM34av0l8mDVM3zpA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22230885/Alienware_m17_R4_White_with_Tobii_Faced_Left.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Dell&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alienware m17 R4.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SXe633"&gt;Of course, there’s the biggest update: Nvidia’s new RTX 3000 series GPUs, which should help boost gaming performance even more (although Dell hasn’t said which RTX 3000 options will be available just yet). Both the m15 R4 and m17 R4 will start at $2,150 and will be available on January 26th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>We gave this laptop a 7, then a Swedish metal band turned it up to 11</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Lenovo commercial" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4h3F9O21kejtOotldDDTaTRv8WE=/1x0:1494x995/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68657174/10thgen.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ckCm0j"&gt;If you’re interested in learning about the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21335740/lenovo-legion-5i-gaming-laptop-review-intel-nvidia"&gt;Lenovo Legion 5i&lt;/a&gt; gaming laptop, I now have &lt;em&gt;much more&lt;/em&gt; than a mere written review to share with you. Swedish metal band Iron Savages was paid by an ad agency that’s representing Lenovo to scream a few choice lines from my review, and producer Claudio Marino made the video above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xRNBUR"&gt;To be clear, this is an ad. The agency asked for my permission to use some quotes from our review, and I said yes. That was in early November, and I quite honestly forgot about what I had agreed to. Then today, at the height of our collective &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/ces"&gt;CES 2021&lt;/a&gt; grind at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, it appeared in my inbox. It gave all of us some much-needed dumb delight, and maybe you’ll get a laugh out of it, too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Lenovo commercial" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PMHuE2TYOt3VZKGCXKmeBC-dXEU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22230591/10thgen.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QektrP"&gt;There’s nothing like hearing the lines “10th Gen Intel Core processors” and “attractive, yet plainly designed gaming laptop” screamed in a guttural tone, while the Legion 5i just idly sits there during the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S2425p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T TV Now is now AT&amp;T TV — here’s what that means</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="AT&amp;amp;amp;T stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BX0aDnxWYKYdS2IYkkOtm6hoIUA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68657130/att1_2040.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dF3KyV"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T TV Now is no more. New customers can no longer sign up for telecom’s skinny bundle TV service, similar to YouTube TV or Hulu with Live TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fzMJnE"&gt;Instead, customers can only &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/att-tv-national-launch-directv-pricing-cord-cutting-1203520138/"&gt;sign up for AT&amp;amp;T TV&lt;/a&gt;. Simply put: AT&amp;amp;T now has one virtual TV service instead of two. Existing customers will be able to continue accessing the service and shouldn’t experience any disruptions, a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pebvro"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T has rolled in parts of AT&amp;amp;T TV Now into AT&amp;amp;T TV, including getting rid of the annual contract and not requiring people to own the AT&amp;amp;T TV hardware. Instead, people can use their own compatible devices (Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, etc.) to stream, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.atttvnow.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F12%2F22226881%2Fatt-tv-now-streaming-skinny-bundle-cord-cutting-youtube-hulu-fubo#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to AT&amp;amp;T’s website&lt;/a&gt;. There are three different pricing tiers that customers can choose from depending on what channels they want, including add-ons like additional sports and premium channels like HBO. Prices range from $70 to $95, more than double AT&amp;amp;T TV Now’s original starting price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Z8WFP"&gt;“We’re bringing more value and simplicity by merging these two streaming services into a single AT&amp;amp;T TV experience,” Vince Torres, senior vice president of marketing at AT&amp;amp;T, told &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9pKnWp"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T TV Now has been a tumultuous bet, even if you look beyond the fact that AT&amp;amp;T took an already confusing naming scheme (DirecTV and DirecTV Now) and made it &lt;em&gt;even worse &lt;/em&gt;(they became AT&amp;amp;T TV and AT&amp;amp;T TV Now, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/30/20747190/directv-now-rebrand-att-tv-streaming-app"&gt;respectively, in 2019&lt;/a&gt;). Launched in 2016 at $35 a month for 65 channels, the idea was to hop on the cord-cutting trend. It worked for a minute, but as AT&amp;amp;T faced continuous rising costs, licensing woes, and increased competition from new players, numbers started dropping. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZUyTViMSBgO7vK_Y6sovxYI3CEw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22230337/unnamed__16_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The light blue box keeps shrinking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CwVWIK"&gt;In September 2018, AT&amp;amp;T TV Now controlled 25 percent of internet TV subscriber market share; by September 2020, that dropped to just 8 percent, according to data from analytical firm Antenna. While Hulu with Live TV, YouTube TV, and Fubo are all seeing some growth, AT&amp;amp;T TV Now has radically shrunk. Throw in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/2/17525240/directv-now-price-att-40"&gt;rising prices&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradadgate/2019/11/12/tv-station-blackouts-are-accelerating-heres-why/?sh=38f9e74b7f6c"&gt;channel blackouts&lt;/a&gt; caused over licensing disagreements, and it’s not difficult to see why AT&amp;amp;T TV Now failed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8MxKsE"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T TV Now went from a peak of 1.86 million customers in the third quarter of 2018 to less than 685,000 in September 2020. More often than not, trying to find the balance between the cost to run skinny bundle TV services and keeping monthly subscription prices low results in a path to a profitless future. Even if former AT&amp;amp;T CEO Randall Stephenson thought otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z5Ri0h"&gt;“[We are absolutely convinced that this is going to be very, very attractive for a large group of customers who really aren’t even in the market today,” Stephenson said in 2016 ahead of DirecTV Now’s (then AT&amp;amp;T TV Now) launch, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/att-tv-now-shutting-down-1234883328/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZhMHKK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ztb66O"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AvKvtQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
