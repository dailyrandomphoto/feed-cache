    <title>Samsung imagines how its first AR glasses might look in these leaked concept videos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ifoICACRqJ731TOl3RHV-_exFaw=/215x0:2345x1420/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68851905/samsung_glasses_lite_4.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="okxZs2"&gt;Samsung has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/2/21/14682126/samsung-c-lab-ar-vr-projects-mwc"&gt;toying with AR glasses for years&lt;/a&gt;, most recently trotting out an extremely basic set of image-projecting goggles &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21052028/samsung-ces-2020-press-conference-ballie-smart-cities-ai-supercut"&gt;on the CES 2020 stage&lt;/a&gt;, but I’ve never seen the company suggest it might like to build an actually ambitious augmented reality wearable computing device — until perhaps today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NuIZNS"&gt;WalkingCat, a fairly reliable source of gadget leaks, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_h0x0d_/status/1363394302336847878"&gt;has published two new concept videos&lt;/a&gt; that show off some of the fun things a pair of “Samsung Glasses Lite” could do, like projecting a giant virtual screen where you can play your games, letting you kick back in your private movie theater, give you a giant virtual computer monitor, fire up an auto-dimming “sunglasses mode,” or act as an instant first-person-view screen for your DJI drone, complete with telemetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WhkjYU"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://streamable.com/o/8xiot5" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xT213I"&gt;The second video shows off the very similar “Samsung AR Glasses” concept, though this time it’s letting the user “see” 3D digital objects appear in the real world, a visual that should be instantly familiar to you if you’ve ever seen any of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVXH5V8MVQo"&gt;Microsoft’s HoloLens marketing.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yhfvpd"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://streamable.com/o/znub5d" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G51HlO"&gt;If you’ve never tried a Microsoft HoloLens or Magic Leap, though, you should know that reality is a long ways away from the visualizations you see here. Today’s waveguides, lasers, projectors and micromirror combinations usually give you a pretty small field of view with see-through AR glasses like these. If you’re standing right next to a virtual computer monitor, you’d only be able to see part of it at a time — the rest would be out of your field of view. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ryVT1U"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;and..... this is the 3D holographic version &lt;a href="https://t.co/PXDAHjDNWb"&gt;https://t.co/PXDAHjDNWb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— WalkingCat (@_h0x0d_) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_h0x0d_/status/1363404172201132034?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rJYWtq"&gt;To me, the most interesting part of these videos is how Samsung imagines you’ll be using a smartwatch to navigate the interfaces. Short-term, that might be more realistic than trying to tap on things that don’t actually exist or make midair gestures with your hands, and smartwatch control is a paradigm that other companies working on AR headsets are no doubt considering. Apple has both a smartwatch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266190/apple-vr-headset-ar-glasses-8k-displays-cameras-hand-tracking-details-report"&gt;and an AR headset in development&lt;/a&gt;, of course, and the Facebook hardware division that’s building AR glasses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280798/facebook-smartwatch-messaging-health-fitness-release-date"&gt;is reportedly now working on a smartwatch, too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sTpWqE"&gt;Speaking of Samsung and smartwatches, two known leakers &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-android-smartwatch-183330688.html"&gt;are now saying&lt;/a&gt; Samsung may go back to Android for its next smartwatch, instead of its own Tizen platform it’s used for watches for years now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s Blade 15 Base is $500 off today, but this Asus Zephyrus G14 deal is the one I’d pick</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fr4-UXpYImSvDK6LZYSexG3w4Yg=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68851657/awhite_200319_3954_4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Avery White / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WdEbTi"&gt;Pop quiz: which is the better deal, $500 off a Razer Blade laptop, or $150 off an Asus Zephyrus G14? It might hinge on whether you need a webcam, because in practically every other way the Asus is the laptop I’d buy today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5Xlkc"&gt;That’s not to say there’s anything particularly wrong with the Razer Blade 15 Base at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B086MGY9TZ/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;today’s unheard of price of $1,099 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (regularly $1,599): aside from the paltry 256GB of solid state storage, you’re looking at a speedy 6-core Core i7-10750H processor, GeForce GTX 1660 Ti graphics that should competently tackle yesteryear’s biggest titles, a 144Hz 1080p screen, plus plenty of ports packed into an attractive black CNC aluminum chassis with single-zone RGB lighting. The deal at midnight PT Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GMcPAxqZtHaUD38xNaWIsZDkzOo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22318899/blade_zephyrus.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uObDu2"&gt;But for just $100 more, you can currently get the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 at Best Buy for $1,199, which just so happens to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;our pick for the best ultraportable gaming laptop you can buy&lt;/a&gt;. While its Nvidia RTX 2060 Max-Q graphics can actually be slightly slower than the 1660 Ti (depending on the game) and there’s no Thunderbolt ports, you’re likely looking at nearly double the battery life from its 8-core AMD Ryzen 9 4900HS chip — plus a 1TB SSD that should be able to actually hold a decent selection of games. It weighs far less at just  over 3.5 pounds; compare to 4.7 pounds for the Razer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wGa3pG"&gt;That’s just based on the spec sheet: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;you can read our whole review for more&lt;/a&gt;, or our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21340554/razer-blade-stealth-13-review-keyboard-specs-price-features"&gt;Razer Blade Stealth 13 review&lt;/a&gt; where the Asus still managed to blow a newer and lighter Razer laptop out of the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oVVRlR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9505867"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2DZD8Z"&gt;All that said, I could still easily see you picking the Razer for the slightly more powerful graphics, the $100 cheaper price, the sleek profile, the blacked-out design, or that all-important webcam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w8phOs"&gt;And remember that neither of these machines have the latest and greatest graphics: Nvidia’s RTX 30-series laptop GPUs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226544/nvidia-rtx-3080-laptops-gpus-ces-2021"&gt;are only barely starting to roll out&lt;/a&gt;. If you don’t need a new machine soon, it might be worth waiting a while longer to see what an RTX 3060 laptop might do for you — like the upgraded Zephyrus G14, &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/633495/10014?prodsku=6452913&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fasus-rog-zephyrus-14-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-9-16gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-1tb-ssd-moonlight-white-moonlight-white%2F6452913.p%3FskuId%3D6452913%26ref%3D212%26loc%3D1&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on backorder for $1,499&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The FAA is no longer concerned with SpaceX’s Starship SN9 and SN8</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w2WswsojJsV6_nItjYskEqVUyJE=/45x0:435x260/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68851460/spaceship_crash_space_x.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T5RD5K"&gt;The FAA seems satisfied with its investigations into Elon Musk’s last two SpaceX Starship tests, each of which ended in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262937/spacex-sn9-starship-test-flight-successful-explode-landing"&gt;an explosive crash&lt;/a&gt;, and the conclusion of those investigations should clear the way for a new SN10 flight in the very near future. In fact, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1363600651712794624"&gt;Musk just tweeted &lt;/a&gt;there’s a “good chance of flying this week!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nSD9CZ"&gt;Late last month, we broke the news &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256657/spacex-launch-violation-explosive-starship-faa-investigation-elon-musk"&gt;that SpaceX had violated its launch license&lt;/a&gt; with its Starship SN8 launch in December, but an FAA spokesperson now says that matter has already been settled, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jackiewattles/status/1362888690586980353"&gt;according to CNN’s Jackie Wattles.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="QQeLlI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"SpaceX flies Starship prototype rocket to highest altitude yet — but doesn’t stick the landing","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22030125/spacex-starship-prototype-flight-test-12-5-kilometer-launch"},{"title":"Another SpaceX Starship nails clean test flight, but explodes on landing","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262937/spacex-sn9-starship-test-flight-successful-explode-landing"},{"title":"Elon Musk’s SpaceX violated its launch license in explosive Starship test, triggering an FAA probe","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256657/spacex-launch-violation-explosive-starship-faa-investigation-elon-musk"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="K9UMkS"&gt;As for the SN9, which similarly exploded during a landing attempt on February 2nd, the FAA says it “failed within the bounds of the FAA safety analysis” and “its unsuccessful landing and explosion did not endanger the public or property.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GK7H6p"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;"The FAA provided oversight of the SN9 mishap investigation conducted by SpaceX. The SN9 vehicle failed within the bounds of the FAA safety analysis. Its unsuccessful landing and explosion did not endanger the public or property." (2/4)&lt;/p&gt;— Jackie Wattles (@jackiewattles) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jackiewattles/status/1362888686216441857?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cdsFET"&gt;It’s not yet clear when the Starship SN10 might launch, but &lt;a href="https://www.cameroncounty.us/spacex/"&gt;Boca Chica is already closing the local highway and beach&lt;/a&gt; in preparation for “non-flight testing activities” on Monday, which some are interpreting to mean &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_vehicle_system_tests#Static_fire"&gt;a static fire test.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Orwg5Q"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A note, the paperwork filed for next week's closure specifies    -       activities.  For comparison, the SN9 flight was described as 'space flight activities' in the same part of the equivalent filing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Throttle expectations appropriately.&lt;a href="https://t.co/7Er5HdRaH6"&gt;https://t.co/7Er5HdRaH6&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/SZSwkOkLvn"&gt;pic.twitter.com/SZSwkOkLvn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Boca Chica Road Closures (@BocaRoad) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BocaRoad/status/1362598116461924352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q3Z5Wj"&gt;NASASpaceflight journalist &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BocaChicaGal"&gt;BocaChicaGal&lt;/a&gt; has been following progress at the launch site closely, and seems like a stellar follow if you’d like to keep tabs as well. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1360774866023112704"&gt;Elon Musk tweeted earlier&lt;/a&gt; that he thinks the SN10 has a 60 percent chance of actually landing. Better than a coin flip, I suppose? &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>United Airlines flight safely lands after dramatic engine failure caught on camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rz9R4z6sfx_wfuItgh6tmMpIsA4=/53x0:1988x1290/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68849369/UE328.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Hayden Smith / &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/speedbird5280/" target="_blank"&gt;speedbird5280 (Instagram)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8MCKWr"&gt;A United Airlines flight experienced a dramatic-looking engine failure just after takeoff from Denver International Airport on Saturday afternoon. UA328, originally headed to Honolulu, quickly circled back to the airport and made a safe landing after the pilots calmly &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DillonMThomas/status/1363239538185756673"&gt;made a “mayday” call&lt;/a&gt; to air traffic control. There were no injuries among the 231 passengers and 10 airline staff on board, according to the FAA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4pZAty"&gt;Since it’s 2021, the incident was thoroughly captured with both photos and video. Passengers shared video of what looks to be a significant right engine failure, with visible damage, flames, and trailing smoke:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="C5zJ0c"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Flight 328 &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/united?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@united&lt;/a&gt; engine caught fire. my parents are on this flight    everyone’s okay though! &lt;a href="https://t.co/cBt82nIkqb"&gt;pic.twitter.com/cBt82nIkqb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— michaela  (@michaelagiulia) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/michaelagiulia/status/1363241125495136267?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nYpUeM"&gt;That isn’t what I’d want to see looking out the window seat. Engine failures are rare, but do happen. Modern planes are designed so that they’re able to remain in the air for an extended period and safely land with only a single functioning engine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CfI9RS"&gt;Photographer Hayden Smith snapped a series of images of the Boeing 777-200 plane that offer a closer look at the damaged engine from the ground and posted them to Dropbox not long after the plane safely landed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/05IwDokARrXS3vCxRwxp2fcLRzs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22317735/plane2.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="V2zoLN"&gt;But even before that, a dash cam managed to get the moment that the engine seemingly blew out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pWTTAS"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oQ3xGE"&gt;Reports followed of engine debris landing in neighborhoods near the plane’s flight path, which was also caught on video. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rare’s unreleased N64 game Dinosaur Planet has leaked </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UmzsMQ8wnbi6URj3vwsdNXHvrDQ=/0x43:1024x726/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68848839/dinoplanet.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Forest of Illusion&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U0NPA4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dinosaur Planet&lt;/em&gt; is an unreleased Nintendo 64 game by Rare that ultimately evolved into &lt;em&gt;Star Fox Adventures&lt;/em&gt; for GameCube. But thanks to the preservationists at Forest of Illusion, it’s now possible to play that unfinished, original title. A build of the game from December 1st, 2000 — well into its development cycle — was retrieved from a disc purchased from a private collector. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xbx1Q4"&gt;Screenshots of the game feature Fox McCloud; as noted by &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-02-20-rares-unreleased-dinosaur-planet-for-n64-out-in-the-wild-gameplay-emerges"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Nintendo’s Shigeru Miyamoto was reportedly influential in pushing the developers to shift the game into a Star Fox title. &lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry’&lt;/em&gt;s John Linneman uploaded 20 minutes of gameplay, and here you can also see Fox replacing one of the original game’s intended protagonists, Sabre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yhaWrZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Today we have released Dinosaur Planet by Rare for Nintendo 64. The development was halted and moved to the GameCube, where it was then released as Star Fox Adventures. Enjoy! (More info in this thread).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Link to the dump:&lt;a href="https://t.co/gQGGcU4vJK"&gt;https://t.co/gQGGcU4vJK&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Orub7RU3fa"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Orub7RU3fa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Forest of Illusion (@forestillusion) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/forestillusion/status/1363090008916193282?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WmIhUU"&gt;Forest of Illusion notes that “the game will currently not run 100 percent perfectly on any emulator. Expect many graphical issues with shadows and lighting, and some slowdown. It should however, work perfectly fine with flashcarts.” Flashcarts allow for games to run on original N64 console hardware &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gdSlK0"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hH_Nn4QwHgU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6LYkFf"&gt;The influence of &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&lt;/em&gt; is evident, but it’s very interesting to get a look at the moody atmosphere that Rare was working on before &lt;em&gt;Dinosaur Planet&lt;/em&gt; became &lt;em&gt;Star Fox Adventures&lt;/em&gt; on the GameCube. Forest of Illusion also &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/dino_20210220"&gt;uploaded the game to the Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fy4rtf"&gt;February is proving to be a month of gems for Rare’s fans; earlier in February, the canceled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22267913/goldeneye-007-xbox-360-live-arcade-nintendo-64-remake-remaster-rare"&gt;Xbox 360 remake of &lt;em&gt;GoldenEye 007&lt;/em&gt; was leaked&lt;/a&gt; onto the web. Much like Dinosaur Planet, it’s very playable despite being unfinished. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Some viewers of Metallica’s BlizzCon performance heard the least metal music imaginable </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pmGgPnwIrkhXKRe832G_2QtQYUI=/215x0:2099x1256/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68848532/Screen_Shot_2021_02_20_at_12.02.48_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;That disclaimer at the bottom would prove relevant.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Blizzard&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gi56ia"&gt;Despite its later-than-usual timing and going completely virtual for the first time, yesterday’s BlizzCon keynote brought with it some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22285677/blizzcon-2021-news-trailers-diablo-wow-burning-crusade"&gt;big news and exciting trailers&lt;/a&gt;. It also featured a musical performance from Metallica. The band isn’t new to BlizzCon, having first appeared at the conference in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FYqIij"&gt;Viewers on many platforms (including Blizzard’s own Twitch and YouTube channels) heard a performance of Metallica’s 1984 tune “For Whom The Bell Tolls.” Several Twitch streamers broadcasting BlizzCon muted the feed during Metallica’s appearance to avoid &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525481/twitch-streamers-dmca-takedown-notices-riaa-copyright"&gt;any potential DMCA troubles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nDCJfy"&gt;But on the &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/920716549"&gt;Twitch Gaming feed&lt;/a&gt; that was &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; carrying the stream, well, things took an amazing turn. Within seconds of the song beginning, the audio was replaced by what &lt;a href="https://music.avclub.com/twitch-censors-live-metallica-concert-with-dorkiest-mus-1846314134"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AV Club&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; perfectly summed up as “the dorkiest, most &lt;em&gt;Zelda &lt;/em&gt;forest-ass music imaginable.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8n16R2"&gt;The transition really makes the whole story here, so please watch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6zmU5Q"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gKhc21Y0Xdw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iO6BB1"&gt;It would seem the music performance rights that Blizzard obtained for its own channels didn’t extend to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21271803/twitch-gaming-channel-exclusives-news"&gt;Twitch’s in-house gaming channel&lt;/a&gt;, so we were instead rewarded with this glorious moment. Could they have just cut the audio altogether? Sure, but that wouldn’t have been as fun. This version of the opening keynote stream currently has over 1.2 million views. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8vSihx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;the current state of Twitch: the official Twitch Gaming channel cut off the live Metallica concert to play 8bit folk music to avoid DMCA &lt;a href="https://t.co/sCn56So8Ee"&gt;pic.twitter.com/sCn56So8Ee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Rod Breslau (@Slasher) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Slasher/status/1362901765029527553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RnpnqH"&gt;If you want to see Metallica’s actual performance, it’s right at the 1:24:50 mark on either &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1AvJ0SRjw8"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/920697882"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;. But me? I’m always going to remember it the Twitch Gaming way. The right way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Dizj8S"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Twitch apologizes to streamers for its mishandling of music copyright ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21560913/twitch-streamers-dmca-copyright-tools-apology"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5bIBjv"&gt;And no, it’s not lost on anyone that this happened to a Metallica performance. There’s a lot to chew on there with Napster and the contentious DMCA quagmires that regularly pop up today. But let’s leave that for another day. For now, just imagine Lars Ulrich and company actually jamming out to this RPG adventure music. It all syncs up nicely at times.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Postmates workers are getting scammed out of their earnings by phishing schemes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Shake Shack Plans To Return $10 Million Loan To U.S. After Uproar" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ENqQiHP-WMdzfhs-MP7qZOtX1QE=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68848016/1210482601.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SoDRLL"&gt;Over at &lt;a href="https://themarkup.org/working-for-an-algorithm/2021/02/18/postmates-drivers-have-become-easy-prey-for-scammers-and-drivers-say-the-companys-not-helping"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an alarming story about a rash of phishing scams that have been targeting gig workers for Postmates. Drivers are receiving phone calls from people claiming to be Postmates employees, who urge the workers to give over their login details — usually under the guise that it’s necessary to keep a driver account in good standing or avoid claims of fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jvD5PH"&gt;Once the scammers obtain that info, they switch the debit card information on the account — Postmates makes weekly deposits of a worker’s earnings, but instant transfers can also be requested — and then drain the balance of everything that’s in there. &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; has spoken to many Postmates gig workers who’ve been preyed upon with this scam, and others are using Reddit and social media to warn their fellow drivers about the phishing and social engineering attempts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XkIjAx"&gt;The unknown call usually comes in right after an order. (Placing an order allows the perpetrators to easily reach their Postmates driver by phone.) Some scammers have gone so far as to involve restaurants in their scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XZvcmn"&gt;Drivers say that Postmates isn’t doing enough to make them aware of the phishing threat, which has only grown more common during the COVID-19 pandemic. Scammers are taking advantage of how busy and hurried these gig workers often are, so drivers are asking for more safeguards in the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0oRCks"&gt;One suggestion is an automatic hold on a driver account whenever the deposit information changes, just to give some more time to prevent a worker’s money from being siphoned out. Another measure that could help would be a caller ID that clearly identifies when a call is coming from a Postmates customer account. Postmates has &lt;a href="https://support.postmates.com/fleet/articles/360022299432-article-How-can-I-keep-my-account-safe-"&gt;this support page&lt;/a&gt; on protecting accounts, but several drivers told &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; they’d never seen it before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bbPxXJ"&gt;Postmates says it has implemented two-factor authentication and can block cashouts if fraud is suspected. But drivers that’ve been hit by the scam say the company is hard to reach, so they have little hope for recouping their lost earnings. The whole story at &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; is worth a read — and yet more reason to tip well whenever you lean on the gig economy. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stretched vaccine timelines re-enter the spotlight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vaccination process against COVID-19 begins in Colombia" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FV_Ru2IicYlPOiV2Bj44VEwstDg=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68847802/1231243754.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xkFQQR"&gt;As the pandemic drags on, experts are exploring ways to stretch still-limited vaccine supplies to get as many people protected as possible. One idea that’s resurfaced this week involves allowing more time in between the first and second doses of the two-dose vaccines. This time, though, there’s some additional data that suggests it might work.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VX0bZf"&gt;Here’s the idea: two leading vaccines, made by Pfizer / BioNTech and Moderna require two doses. But their early data &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/08/health/covid-vaccine-pfizer.html"&gt;showed pretty significant protection after the first dose&lt;/a&gt;. That got people thinking — is it worth giving more people partial protection with just one dose? Or should they stick to the schedule and fully vaccinate fewer people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="q5WGNa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7YTwEw"&gt;Back in December, some experts &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/18/opinion/coronavirus-vaccine-doses.html"&gt;encouraged researchers to set up trials&lt;/a&gt; to find out if a single dose of a two-dose vaccine would be effective. Around the same time, health authorities in the UK &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-delays-second-covid-19-vaccine-dose-as-europe-ponders-how-to-speed-up-immunization-11609334172?mod=article_inline"&gt;decided to plow ahead &lt;/a&gt;without those studies, and prioritized getting first shots in arms, allowing people to delay their doses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Y66g6"&gt;This week, we got more data that shows that a single dose of Pfizer / BioNTech actually does a pretty good job of preventing illness. A study in Israel found that a first shot was &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/pfizer-vaccine-may-offer-strong-protection-first-dose-israeli-study-fi-rcna300"&gt;85 percent effective&lt;/a&gt; at reducing symptomatic cases of COVID-19 in healthcare workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kpXv0h"&gt;There are some caveats. Here’s a major one: most of the people in the study ended up getting their second dose relatively quickly. That means researchers can only say that the first dose is effective between 15 and 28 days after a person gets that first shot. How long protection lasts beyond that is still unknown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2PGXTC"&gt;That’s why some experts are still urging caution when it comes to changing the schedule between those vaccines. “Until such time that there are good clinical trials that show that a single dose provides an equivalent level of protection, I don’t know that we should abandon our approach or create new policies,” &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/pfizer-vaccine-may-offer-strong-protection-first-dose-israeli-study-fi-rcna300"&gt;Jonathan Tempte told &lt;em&gt;NBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lQJmdS"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-25/why-delaying-the-second-covid-vaccine-shot-is-messy-quicktake"&gt;It’s messy&lt;/a&gt;, and researchers don’t agree. Some, including Anthony Fauci maintain that sticking to two on-schedule doses can &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/both-covid-vaccine-doses-critical-stay-ahead-variants-fauci-says-n1257041"&gt;help keep the US ahead of dangerous variants&lt;/a&gt; of the virus. Others lean towards taking a strategy more like the UK’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LfAaFZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s an old saying that we wouldn’t use parachutes or aspirin if we waited for randomized trials, either.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VkmD68"&gt;“I think this [strategy] is something on which reasonable people could disagree, but saying you should only do something supported by randomized evidence when there’s an emergency would have precluded us from using masks, social distancing, from doing all the things we know are good public health practices,” Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at Harvard told &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/02/experts-tout-delaying-2nd-covid-vaccine-dose-us-deaths-mount"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CIDRAP News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month. He added: “There’s an old saying that we wouldn’t use parachutes or aspirin if we waited for randomized trials, either.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pEoUfc"&gt;Here in the US, states are trying to speed up doses — and looking to the federal government for guidance. The CDC has already said that in extreme circumstances, providers &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html"&gt;can stretch the window&lt;/a&gt; between their patients’ shots from three to four weeks up to six. This week, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-16/cdc-advisers-weigh-guidance-for-delaying-second-covid-shots?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that a committee that advises the CDC was considering whether or not to recommend changing the schedule in a smaller working group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rz7XOw"&gt;That discussion might not make it to the full committee any time soon. The working group might decide that they need to see more data, or it might not make it to the next COVID-19-related meeting in favor of discussing more pressing issues — including their recommendations for the single-shot Johnson and Johnson vaccine. (Another meeting of that committee &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/agenda-archive/agenda-2021-02.pdf"&gt;is planned for this coming week&lt;/a&gt;, but its focus is on a host of other deadly diseases, including ebola, dengue, and rabies.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VKi80h"&gt;Even if the committee &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; take it up immediately, the question of when to administer doses is fascinating, and one we’ll be watching as the vaccine rollout accelerates, and more data just keeps pouring in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="um8S35"&gt;Here’s what else is happening this week.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best deals of the week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 5" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YZXNyuijx1zzHLTkuZtHbrh9Nrs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68847542/akrales_201012_4137_0020.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i7CkJf"&gt;This is the first time in recent memory where several deals we’ve written about through the week are still available. It’s always great when readers have an extended window of time to snag a deal. So, below you’ll find a few of our favorite picks from the week, along with one new exclusive deal for &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers. I won’t keep you in suspense, it’s on the Pixel 5. We worked with a partner to secure some refurbished units that are in great condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="AHTjVN"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 5 in “Sorta Sage” green" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kwtTHObhdNhcOLQIYTN5ZKz75zE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21955670/akrales_201012_4137_0117.0.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lVGfEG"&gt;Snag a refurbished Google Pixel 5 for under $600&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="m04iWf"&gt;The lowest price for a like-new refurbished Pixel 5 on Amazon is $610, but you can save more with this reader-exclusive deal from Daily Steals. It’s offering &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers a few options, actually. You can get either the unlocked or Verizon-locked phones in black or sage green (shown above). These units ship with a 90-day warranty and are in “Grade A” refurbished condition and may have minor scratches. They’ll ship with an aftermarket charger and cord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l62FQI"&gt;One thing to note, if you’re wondering which to get: Verizon’s policy says it locks phones for 60 days after they’re purchased as new, then they automatically unlock. So, there’s a very high likelihood that the lock is no longer in effect on these refurbs, which would let you use the phone with any carrier. Daily Steals couldn’t confirm what their status is. But it’ll either arrived unlocked, or at worst, you’ll need to wait 60 days post-purchase. If you’re not happy with that solution, you can return the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="DNmqDQ"&gt;

    <title>The Oatmeal’s creator says his new game is a way to ‘play the comic’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Comic-Con International 2014 - Day 2" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BrlV92tZLzkZlnYs9emVkFrDbxQ=/0x73:2000x1406/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68847517/452705690.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Daniel Knighton / WireImage&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="00tbrs"&gt;The creator of &lt;em&gt;The Oatmeal&lt;/em&gt;, Matthew Inman, released a new cat-themed mobile word game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278773/kitty-letter-mobile-game-ios-android-the-oatmeal-exploding-kittens"&gt;called &lt;em&gt;Kitty Letter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week that feels like playing one of his silly comic strips. That feeling was intentional, Inman told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pwvZN4"&gt;“My comics have always been rhetorical,” he said. “You don’t interact with the comic, you have no say in it, you’re just experiencing it. So, with [&lt;em&gt;Kitty Letter&lt;/em&gt;], I got a chance to introduce some elements where people get to play the comic, and I thought that was a lot of fun.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HtO5ki"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kitty Letter&lt;/em&gt; has a structure that Inman described as “&lt;em&gt;Scrabble&lt;/em&gt; combined with &lt;em&gt;Clash Royale&lt;/em&gt;.” Your goal is to beat your opponent by spelling words from a combination of letters at the bottom of your phone’s screen. When you spell a word, you’ll send a small army of cats up an invisible “lane” toward your opponent. Meanwhile, your opponent is sending armies of cats to try and defeat you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UFbbBu"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dbI4NA6K63I?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H6K8fD"&gt;The game was actually going to be multiplayer-only at first, Inman told me. This might be surprising for those who’ve played the game, since it has a robust story mode spanning 13 chapters. But that story mode was born from creating the game’s tutorial, said Inman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dQDdsc"&gt;“I started drawing this tutorial on how to play, and then the tutorial became that single-player mode, where you have this neighbor that moves in and tells the whole story about him,” Inman said. But then, he realized, “I got in too deep. I had written all this stuff, I was like, ‘I have to end this,’ and I ended up writing like 12 chapters. But it became my favorite part of the whole thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99w4WH"&gt;Inman also discussed the game’s free-to-play model, which is very generous. Unlike many free-to-play games, &lt;em&gt;Kitty Letter’s&lt;/em&gt; single-player story mode and multiplayer are completely free, with no restrictions. The decision to offer all of that came from what Inman disliked about other free games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43BnPa"&gt;“I play free-to-play games, but I play them because I like the games,” Inman said. “The actual mechanics involved, like grinding and unlocking chests and getting gems and coins, I hate them. I fucking hate them. If [developers] were like, ‘pay us $20 and we’ll give you everything,’ I would do that. I much prefer that model.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxNC8R"&gt;The game does offer paid cosmetics for multiplayer, but they don’t provide any gameplay benefit and they’re buried in a menu. And Inman says that revenue from them has been “pretty much non-existent.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="EfuEXM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Kitty Letter is a new mobile word game from the creator of The Oatmeal, and it’s good","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278773/kitty-letter-mobile-game-ios-android-the-oatmeal-exploding-kittens"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="n0IOEg"&gt;Inman acknowledged that he can offer the game largely for free because of his other successful ventures, which include&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Oatmeal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/28/7927121/exploding-kittens-most-backed-kickstarter-project-ever"&gt;hugely successful card game Exploding Kittens&lt;/a&gt;. “I’m not just some altruistic guy that doesn’t want to make a living from his work,” he said. “To be completely candid, we make a great living from our card games, and we make a great living from some of the other things that I do. With [&lt;em&gt;Kitty Letter&lt;/em&gt;], it felt like we could just get away with making it as enjoyable as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GTJ8Vt"&gt;“This app more generates that currency of — and this is so fucking corny — currency of love and joy, like you have a joyful experience with the game,” he said. “So, in turn, you love Exploding Kittens more, and maybe one day, if you want to buy a card game from us, you can.” It’s a business model similar to that of &lt;em&gt;The Oatmeal&lt;/em&gt;. Inman offers the comics for free online, but sells books and has offered merch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="utkPUl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It was cats from day one”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IBCcn6"&gt;Inman has a lot of ideas for what’s next for the game. He’d like to improve the arcade mode, add more single-player levels, and squash bugs. He’d also like to port the game to Steam and the Nintendo Switch, but those might be a little further away. “I would probably call it six months,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tz63Ig"&gt;And I had to ask: were cats always the focus of the game?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IUI9AQ"&gt;“It was cats from day one,” Inman said. “It was called &lt;em&gt;Cats Royale&lt;/em&gt;, originally.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rPYzum"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ztD67Q"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
