    <title>It fills me with glee that Canon printers now think Canon’s own toner is fake</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l1fi7F8742hPtI_YmQYLctnQgbM=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70376666/canon_printer_2400.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sadly, not for consumer inkjets like this one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tLZ9nT"&gt;Printers are the &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt;. They’re unreliable, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-printer-ink-so-expensive-2019-8"&gt;they guzzle reportedly $12,000-a-gallon ink&lt;/a&gt;, and their manufacturers have been known to use dirty tricks, scare tactics, and DRM to &lt;em&gt;strongly encourage &lt;/em&gt;you to buy cartridges exclusively from them. But Canon is now getting a taste of its own medicine. Some of Canon’s own toner cartridges are now being detected as fakes — and they’re forcing the company to teach customers how to bypass its own DRM (via &lt;a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20220110/06555048260/chip-shortage-forces-canon-to-issue-workarounds-own-obnoxious-drm.shtml"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Techdirt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PRwALM"&gt;According to Canon’s own support website (&lt;a href="https://www.canon-europe.com/support/business-product-support/interim-toner/"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.canon.de/support/business-product-support/interim-toner/#id2"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;), the company is “currently facing challenges in sourcing certain electronic components that are used in our consumables for our multifunction printers.” In other words, Canon’s been hit by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648372/willy-shih-chip-shortage-tsmc-samsung-ps5-decoder-interview"&gt;the great chip shortage&lt;/a&gt;, too — only the components Canon’s missing aren’t powering video game consoles &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/13/22780037/tesla-reportedly-shipping-cars-without-usb-ports"&gt;or your Tesla’s USB port&lt;/a&gt;; they’re the DRM for its own toner cartridges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Vf1jyu"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;  Semiconductor shortage leads to Canon selling toner cartridges without chips which usually identify them as genuine, so Canon now instructs customers on how to override the warnings for using "counterfeit" cartridges &lt;a href="https://t.co/rqcmXckPFp"&gt;https://t.co/rqcmXckPFp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Nils Adermann (@naderman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/naderman/status/1479529888977760258?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 7, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wdZfYN"&gt;But wait, there’s a simple solution, says Canon! See all our warnings about how your toner cartridge might be “malfunctioning”? Ignore them. Just hit the close button, and you’ll be good to go: &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/urVXXnFMKN29CNim_LZSggQushM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161960/Interim_Toner_Screenshot_1.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Canon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Canon explains how to bypass its own DRM: just ignore the warning and hit the close button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oRAf8e"&gt;If you’re hoping to experience an approved-bypassing-of-DRM on your inkjet home printer, though, you might be out of luck — we’re only seeing Canon’s big workplace multifunction printers (MFP) on the list of “affected models” at Canon’s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BENYmi"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Techdirt&lt;/em&gt; points out, &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nyed.470665/gov.uscourts.nyed.470665.1.0.pdf"&gt;Canon is currently facing down a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; involving some alleged behavior that seems even more egregious than the typical DRM tricks: Queens resident David Leacraft claims his Canon Pixma All-in-One doesn’t even scan documents unless it has ink. We checked, and Canon hasn’t yet issued a response to that lawsuit in court, but multiple posts on Canon’s official support forums suggest that the ridiculous restriction is real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i0kaGU"&gt;“The PIXMA MG6320 must have all ink tanks installed in the printer and they must all contain ink in order to use the functions of the printer. Replacing the empty ink tank with a new ink tank will resolve this issue. There is no workaround for this,” &lt;a href="https://community.usa.canon.com/t5/Desktop-Inkjet-Printers/one-ink-empty-can-t-scan/m-p/323046/highlight/true#M40538"&gt;wrote one rep in 2020.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v5GhcD"&gt; “If you are getting a ‘Ink Out’ error, you will not be able to use the unit until the ink is replaced,” &lt;a href="https://community.usa.canon.com/t5/Desktop-Inkjet-Printers/I-am-out-of-ink-and-would-like-to-scan-a-document-using-my-Canon/td-p/165982"&gt;they wrote in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dk2IvZ"&gt;The lawsuit is seeking class action status, and we’ll let you know if it goes anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California budget aims to clear up port congestion and pollution</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Southern California Ports Work Through Night To Help Ease Congestion" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HbPOqL_Qpy-MDxTkCdkrkDAPlBw=/12x0:7938x5284/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70376556/1349102611.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Southern California Ports Work Through Night To Help Ease Congestion | Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h4yCpc"&gt;California Governor Gavin Newsom’s newly proposed &lt;a href="https://www.ebudget.ca.gov/FullBudgetSummary.pdf"&gt;budget&lt;/a&gt; includes plans to tackle pollution choking portside communities while also expanding the state’s capacity to accommodate the nation’s growing hunger for imported consumer goods. The proposal comes as pandemic-fueled supply chain problems have created a crisis at California’s ports, thrusting them into the national spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H4fE3E"&gt;The draft budget released yesterday for the 2022–23 fiscal year proposes investing $2.3 billion in the state’s congested ports. That includes $875 million for zero-emission vehicles and infrastructure — with a majority earmarked for trucks. It also includes $1.2 billion for “port-related” projects, like rail yard expansions, meant to increase the flow of goods from ports to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j7DAVl"&gt;Southern California is home to the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, which together comprise the busiest port complex in the Western Hemisphere. Americans’ shopping habits have long saddled neighborhoods near these ports and others with pollution from ships, trains, and trucks transporting everything from electronics to furniture. But the COVID-19 pandemic has made things considerably worse, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22800410/black-friday-holiday-shopping-supply-chain-pollution-ports-warehouses-california"&gt;triggering toxic traffic jams&lt;/a&gt; as container ships piled up offshore and trucks struggled to keep up with the rush of imported goods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="j3AUfw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There is no time to waste”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1XeqGe"&gt;To alleviate the recent supply chain bottlenecks, state and federal officials have announced initiatives aimed at boosting port capacity. But those efforts, like Joe Biden’s decision last October to keep ports open 24/7, can also increase pollution unless ports turn to zero-emission vehicles at the same time. Emissions from container ships, which typically burn heavy bunker fuel and diesel, have been tied to &lt;a href="https://theicct.org/blog/staff/silent-deadly-case-shipping-emissions"&gt;60,000 premature deaths&lt;/a&gt; globally in a single year. Diesel-burning trucks, meanwhile, largely drove a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22876380/greenhouse-gas-emissions-2021-biden-climate-change-pledges"&gt;jump in US greenhouse gas emissions&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Without a transition to cleaner transportation,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;ports will continue taking a toll on nearby residents’ health and thwart climate goals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="etbQiM"&gt;“There is no time to waste in tackling the climate and environmental impacts that are happening at the ports,” Teresa Bui, state climate policy director at the nonprofit Pacific Environment, said in a statement. “Our frontline communities and public health depend upon it.”   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wZ5Ikx"&gt;Newsom’s proposed budget includes $475 million for short-haul trucks, with the goal of getting 1,000 zero-emission vehicles on the road. There’s another $400 million for port electrification, although there aren’t many details yet on what that might entail. The budget proposal also includes $200 million for demonstration and pilot projects across maritime, aviation, rail, and “other off-road” modes of transport. These are sectors that are harder to electrify and decarbonize. It’s all part of broader efforts to address climate change in the budget, to the tune of $22.5 billion for climate and clean energy programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="37jXR3"&gt;California ports already have some lofty &lt;a href="https://www.portoflosangeles.org/references/2021-news-releases/news_110421_ctf"&gt;environmental goals&lt;/a&gt;, although they’ve been called out for making slow progress on them. The twin ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, which together are the &lt;a href="https://www.aqmd.gov/nav/about/initiatives/clean-port"&gt;largest fixed source of pollution&lt;/a&gt; in Southern California, announced a plan in 2017 to transition to a zero-emissions truck fleet by 2035. “But they have done little since then to cut emissions in the near term,” The &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-11-22/supply-chain-issues-port-pollution"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Editorial Board wrote last November. “Freight pollution is a major, ongoing threat to public health, air quality and the climate, and we cannot settle for half-measures and hope they make a dent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Giw7sR"&gt;In April, the twin ports will start to &lt;a href="https://www.presstelegram.com/2022/01/10/how-newsoms-proposed-budget-will-help-la-long-beach-ports-shore-up-supply-chain-reduce-pollution/"&gt;impose a fee&lt;/a&gt; on shipping containers to help raise the estimated $10 billion it will take to hit that 2035 goal. They could soon get another infusion of cash if Newsom’s budget is approved by June. The state’s new fiscal year starts in July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lHGD7Z"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6tHe8x"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Amazon Echo deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6fR5pJ"&gt;When it comes to smart speakers, Amazon has a slew of voice-enabled Echo devices to choose from, one for practically every occasion. Maybe you want to add Alexa to a spare bedroom, for example, or you’re looking for an Echo device that will allow you to easily manage your lighting or other smart home devices. Regardless of the reason, this is one of the best times of the year to pick up an Echo device, even if Black and Cyber Monday are behind us. Below, we’ve curated a list of some of the very best Amazon Echo deals available right now, from the last-gen Echo Dot to Amazon’s latest Echo Show 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="868HqZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Kindle deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21539047/best-amazon-kindle-deals"},{"title":"The best smart displays for every home","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22535003/best-smart-displays-alexa-google-echo-nest"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="qblixW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10913993"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zNwIju"&gt;The best Echo Dot deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="maQ5h0"&gt;Last year, Amazon released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;fourth generation of the Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which looks more like a sphere than an actual dot. But if you prefer the previous design, don’t worry: Amazon has not discontinued the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;third-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which still retains the familiar dot shape and is currently on sale for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgoH6E6qPbd" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$24.99 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot/dp/B07FZ8S74R/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3BDRU5"&gt;We’ve recently seen the latest Echo Dot drop to an all-time low of $29.99, however, it’s currently only &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ8C8F5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Amazon for $34.99&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon is also selling a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-With-Clock-4th-Gen/dp/B085M66LH1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;model with a built-in LED display&lt;/a&gt; that showcases the time, weather, and other information for an additional $10 more, bringing the price to $44.99. Note, however, that both the base model and the LED-equipped variant are available 25 percent off at Amazon when you trade in select devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7P5bD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-smart-speaker-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795702%3Fclkid%3D8f237b25N38d111eca5f31be93c0cebf1%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDotDeals110921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733331480519791842" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, meanwhile, are also offering the fourth-gen Dot for $34.99, with the latter retailer taking $10 off if you buy two — meaning you’d pay $60 instead of $70 for a pair. The same Best Buy promotion applies to the fourth-gen Dot with the built-in LED display, which is available at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-smart-speaker-with-clock-and-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795704%3Fclkid%3D8f237b25N38d111eca5f31be93c0cebf1%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDotDeals110921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfYzQMDs5Oi" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $44.99, $15 off of the standard retail price. Best Buy is also throwing in a four-month subscription to SiriusXM Streaming Platinum, if you’re a new subscriber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EVsfiu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zX6pQw"&gt;The best Echo Dot Kids Edition deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LzhwpX"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fourth-gen Echo Dot Kids Edition&lt;/a&gt; is as spherical as its adult version but is designed to look like a tiger or panda. The device also comes with a year of Amazon’s Kids Plus service, which provides access to a slew of kid-friendly content, like audiobooks and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmKSqg"&gt;The Kids Edition is currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B084J4QQK1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling for $44.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, 25 percent off the original list price. If you prefer a different retailer, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-kids-edition-with-parental-controls%2F-%2FA-81795703%3Fpreselect%3D81502549%26clkid%3D8f237b25N38d111eca5f31be93c0cebf1%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDotDeals110921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgbfjoL52Lr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; are also selling the Kids Edition for $44.99, the latter with a four-month trial to SiriusXM Streaming Platinum. Best Buy is offering $10 off if you purchase two as well, dropping the final price of a pair to around $80.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MJlccr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9574374"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VgQp2M"&gt;The best Amazon Echo deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wOHvPj"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fourth-gen Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt; also received a makeover this year. Like the aforementioned fourth-gen Echo Dot, the 2020 Amazon Echo has a sphere-shaped design, but it’s noticeably bigger than the Echo Dot. That said, it also touts a built-in smart home hub and produces better sound, thanks to a pair of 0.8-inch tweeters and a 3-inch woofer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HdAa8S"&gt;We’ve seen the Echo drop to as low as $60 during shopping events like Amazon Prime Day and Black Friday, however, it’s only available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XKF5RM3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747624046492524210" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo--4th-gen----smart-home-hub-with-alexa---charcoal%2F-%2FA-80770246%2F%3Fclkid%3D8f237b25N38d111eca5f31be93c0cebf1%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDotDeals110921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; right now for $74.99, a discount of $25. Amazon is offering a 25 percent discount when you trade in select devices, though, and Best Buy is taking an additional $10 off the price of two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DbxI7Q"&gt;If you’re looking for a bundle, you can pick up the latest Echo at Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Echo-4th-Gen/dp/B08NSWKV7L/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;with a pair of fourth-gen Echo Dots for $144.97&lt;/a&gt; ($55 off), or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Echo-4th-Gen/dp/B08N6D9DYR/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;with a wall mount for $99.98&lt;/a&gt; ($25 off).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xR7jKq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508352"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="WiqTO4"&gt;If you are looking for a compact Echo device that functions more as a smart clock than an entertainment speaker, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18714432/amazon-echo-show-5-alexa-smart-alarm-display-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; is the Echo device to consider. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529891/amazon-echo-show-5-2nd-gen-alexa-smart-display-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;latest edition&lt;/a&gt;, which launched in June, features an always-on microphone, an upgraded 2MP camera, a 5.5-inch display, and a physical shutter, allowing you to block the camera’s view. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b8jLZ5"&gt;The latest Echo Show 5 is currently available for $44.99 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfAzhE7JLdJ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KJN3333/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, an all-time low and $35 cheaper than the first-gen model is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Echo-Show-Compact-Sandstone/dp/B07HZJ64WD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently selling for at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. You can also pick it up with a Blink Mini for $5 more through either retailer — which is a nice discount on the basic, 1080p security camera — or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09155JR3K/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;with an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon for $64.98 (normally $104.98). Like with other Echo devices, Amazon will take 25 percent off any aforementioned configuration if you trade in an eligible device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mVseNr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10609475"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FiYkkx"&gt;The best Echo Show 5 Kids Edition deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JGaEAZ"&gt;The Echo Dot isn’t the only Echo device with a kid-friendly design. The Echo Show 5 Kids Edition offers all of the same features as the standard, second-gen Echo Show 5, only with a vibrant print on the rear and a year of Amazon’s Kids Plus service, which grants your family access to a trove of videos, games, and other kid-friendly content. It even comes with a two-year warranty, providing a bit of protection from whatever your child might (literally) throw at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1db3Rn"&gt;The Echo Show 5 Kids Edition is available for $45 off ($54.99) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LMSC4WZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740551130085982176" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and other retailers. If you’re looking for add-ons, you can also pick up an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09345FQWY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 Kids Edition with an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $74.98 (normally $114.98) through Amazon. Once more, Amazon is also offering a 25 percent discount on each model and bundle if you trade in certain devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DwZKlk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10500490"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O97UD3"&gt;The best Echo Show 8 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="efoU4U"&gt;Like the Echo Show 5, the Echo Show 8 is available in two distinct models, both of which feature 8-inch displays and dual speakers. However, unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20983661/amazon-echo-show-8-review-alexa-smart-display-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen Echo Show 8&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new model&lt;/a&gt; is equipped with a 13MP camera and some unique software tricks, one of which grants it the ability to keep the subject centered in the frame as they move around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RNLpG4"&gt;When pitted against the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Home Hub&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22357214/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-assistant-smart-display-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;second-gen Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;, their closest competitors in terms of price and functionality, both iterations of the Echo Show 8 are better options for a few reasons: they feature slightly larger displays, better speakers, and cameras that allow you to use them as video chatting devices for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zoom calls&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; the Echo Show 8 to be better than other devices in Amazon’s current smart display lineup, which is why we think it’s the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22535003/best-smart-displays-alexa-google-echo-nest" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best smart display&lt;/a&gt; for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcMAEq"&gt;As far as deals go, the first-gen Show 8 is currently available for $69.99 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PF1Y28C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589734209430134" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and there are a few discounted bundles available for a few dollars more. For $74.99, for instance, you can pick up a first-gen Echo Show 8 and a Blink Mini security camera at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086ZND1QQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Alternatively, you can buy a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YD5WDCB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen Echo Show 8 with an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $90.98 instead of $130.98, or with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09DDXMXFT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;portable battery for $119.98&lt;/a&gt; instead of $159.98. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ovLiAu"&gt;Sadly, the second-gen Echo Show 8 is currently only available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084DCJKSL/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfLCe6zrQP2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $129.99, its full retail price. However, like the last-gen model, it is available as part of a discounted bundle at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08ZN82HH7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfLCe6zrQP2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; that contains a Blink Mini for $134.99 instead of $164.99. If you purchase through Amazon, the 25 percent trade-in discount is also applicable to all generations of the Echo Show 8 as well as the bundles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YdQbrX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9573987"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="NkSBNy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10611942"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QJ2PFl"&gt;The best Echo Show 10 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VVGDbb"&gt;Recently, Amazon released a third-gen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 10&lt;/a&gt;. The device features a 10.1-inch HD screen and, unlike the Show 5 and Show 8, the 2021 model allows you to adjust the angle of the screen. It’s also mounted on a motorized, swiveling base that allows the display to follow you as you move. If you plan on doing a lot of video calling, this is the model to get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z9Ka9y"&gt;We’ve seen the latest Echo Show 10 get discounted to as low as $200, but no active deals are available right now. But if you still want to pick it up, you can get it for its usual $249.99 price at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHZ41L8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733329406175831312" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08SQ2F8D2/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is also offering a discounted bundle, which includes an Echo Show 10 and a Blink Mini for $259.99 instead of $284.98. Again, trading in select devices at Amazon can net you 25 percent off on the Echo Show 10 and all aforementioned bundles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bA0Mnl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10362085"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Amazon workers will redo Bessemer union election on February 4th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eBbQjdt-8zaNK8TiXiWjfemG9C0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70375180/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The NLRB said Amazon broke labor laws in the original election.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4ob1ga"&gt;The second union election at an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama will begin on February 4th, according to a notice posted Tuesday by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which you can read below. The election is a redo of the one that was carried out in 2021, the results of which were declared invalid by the regulatory agency after reports that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22598004/nlrb-officer-new-election-amazon-bessemer-union-drive"&gt;Amazon had broken labor laws&lt;/a&gt; during the union drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yzk62X"&gt;The election will be carried out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272213/amazon-union-bhm1-alabama-rwdsu-vote-begins"&gt;almost a year after&lt;/a&gt; workers originally voted on whether to unionize Amazon’s BHM1 facility. The union &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22374540/amazon-union-vote-outcome-bessemer-alabama-rwdsu-bhm1"&gt;lost that election nearly two-to-one&lt;/a&gt; but disputed the results, taking issue with a mailbox that employees feared Amazon had access to. The mailbox was installed by the USPS, at Amazon’s request, and at one point had a “privacy tent” put up around it, which the NLRB says employees believed was monitored with video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6lGAQk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The redo is taking place because regulators found Amazon interfered in the first election&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5Cdllp"&gt;The NLRB cites the mailbox in its notice of the second election, saying that the results of the first are being set aside after the regulator “found the Employer interfered with the employees’ exercise of a free and reasoned choice by creating the appearance of irregularity in the election.” It also accuses Amazon of “improperly polling employees’ support during mandatory meetings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E83WXP"&gt;The redo will be carried out through the mail and supervised by the NLRB. In response to the notice, the Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Union (the organization behind the union drive in Bessemer) put out a statement saying that it’s “deeply concerned that the decision fails to adequately prevent Amazon from continuing its objectionable behavior in a new election.” The RWDSU says it “proposed to the NLRB a number of remedies that could have made the process fairer to workers, which were not taken up in the Notice of Election issued today,” and promises to “continue to hold [Amazon] accountable for [its] actions.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SvfXRn"&gt;The RWDSU’s specific request was detailed in the NLRB regional director’s order for a second election, which was released &lt;a href="https://foiaonline.gov/foiaonline/action/public/submissionDetails?trackingNumber=NLRB-2022-000389&amp;amp;type=Request"&gt;thanks to a Freedom of Information Act request&lt;/a&gt;. According to the document, which you can read below, the RWDSU asked that the second election be held at an off-site location where employees couldn’t be surveilled, and the NLRB would have more control. Conversely, Amazon asked for an on-site election and said it would provide “a large, climate-controlled tent in the parking lot” where its employees could vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5fANU"&gt;The RWDSU said its desired location could be made COVID-19 compliant, and Amazon cited lower infection rates of COVID-19 (the order is dated November 30th, 2021, pre-dating the spikes we’ve seen in recent weeks). However, the pandemic plays a large part in the NLRB’s argument as to why the election will be carried out by mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ElU4Tz"&gt;Amazon didn’t immediately reply to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AEzX5E"&gt;The NLRB says that it will start counting the ballots on March 28th, though ballots will have to reach its offices by March 25th to be counted. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/23/22851842/amazon-union-settlement-nlrb-email-electronic-post-rights"&gt;Due to a recent NLRB / Amazon settlement&lt;/a&gt;, organizers may have more opportunities this time around — the company has agreed to stop barring employees from being at their workplace more than 15 minutes before or after their shifts if they’re carrying out union activity and has promised to prominently post statements of workers’ rights in its facilities and employee apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zWqyB8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The NLRB notice of second election:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Judge says the FTC’s Meta monopoly lawsuit can go forward</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BwRySi41tbUsbM-NdK7CoCpm2lM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70376041/acastro_211101_1777_meta_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AifJ7H"&gt;A federal judge says the US Federal Trade Commission can proceed with an antitrust lawsuit against Meta, formerly known as Facebook, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554476/ftc-facebook-instagram-antitrust-case-whatsapp-federal-court"&gt;dismissing the suit&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hZejye"&gt;District of Columbia Judge James Boasberg &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21177063-memorandum-opinion"&gt;said in an opinion&lt;/a&gt; released today that the FTC’s first complaint had “stumbled out of the starting blocks.” But a revised version, Boasberg said, makes the same arguments with facts that are “far more robust and detailed than before.” As a result, he’s denying Meta’s motion to dismiss and allowing the case to proceed, although he states that the agency “may well face a tall task down the road in proving its allegations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tr0N24"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The FTC may still face a “tall task” proving its claims&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6hfyAy"&gt;Throughout the case, the FTC has alleged that Meta holds an unlawful monopoly in personal social networking services and maintained it by acquiring the competitors Instagram and WhatsApp. Today’s opinion says the agency has reasonably backed that allegation up with data about Meta’s market power, although like before, Boasberg held back on approving allegations involving older Meta interoperability policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PdOR4Z"&gt;“In stark contrast with its predecessor, this complaint provides reinforcing, specific allegations that all point toward the same conclusion: Facebook has maintained a dominant market share during the relevant time period,” the opinion says. If you accept the market definition and the reliability of the FTC’s data, “Facebook’s market share comfortably exceeds the levels that courts ordinarily find sufficient to establish monopoly power.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XNeYOU"&gt;Boasberg also shot down Meta’s new allegation that FTC head Lina Khan invalidated the complaint by prejudging Meta’s guilt, saying Khan’s previous public criticisms of Facebook don’t suggest an “axe to grind” based on personal animosity or a financial conflict of interest. Likewise, “although the court recognizes the importance of her vote, it is an exaggeration to treat Khan as the sole instigator of the current case.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C8sm0w"&gt;The FTC suit against Meta is one of several US government efforts to curtail the monopoly power of major tech companies, including a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22786079/google-jonathan-kanter-justice-department-antitrust-division-facebook-lina-khan"&gt;Department of Justice lawsuit against Google&lt;/a&gt; proceeding under antitrust chief Jonathan Kanter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PCpKmv"&gt;Today’s decision reverses a significant blow that Boasberg dealt the FTC in June, when he said the complaint contained “nothing” proving Meta’s monopoly power except for the “naked allegation” that it held a dominant share of personal social networking services. The new complaint amended that claim with Comscore data illuminating Meta’s market share of daily active users (DAUs) and monthly active users (MAUs) of social networks, as well as the relative time spent on these networks. While these numbers will likely be questioned as the case proceeds, they were convincing enough to let the FTC clear the first hurdle and proceed with discovery, where more details could come to light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HZvwmT"&gt;Meta responded in a statement sent to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; by Chris Sgro. “Today’s decision narrows the scope of the FTC’s case by rejecting claims about our platform policies. It also acknowledges that the agency faces a ‘tall task’ proving its case regarding two acquisitions it cleared years ago,” says the statement. “We’re confident the evidence will reveal the fundamental weakness of the claims. Our investments in Instagram and WhatsApp transformed them into what they are today.

    <title>T-Mobile identifies issue that prevented some iPhone users from using Private Relay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a679SQQpMlD7hp-oo9jH_r4cJPA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70372164/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4lX89e"&gt;T-Mobile said Tuesday that it had not blocked iCloud Private relay, and that it had identified what was causing some iPhone users to appear blocked from using the feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OE9nGi"&gt;“Overnight our team identified that in the 15.2 iOS release, some device settings default to the feature being toggled off. We have shared this with Apple. This is not specific to T-Mobile. Again though, we have not broadly blocked iCloud Private,” the company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1480987702363189248?s=20"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reporter Mark Gurman. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HhyPo0"&gt;iCloud Private Relay lets users hide the websites they visit from third parties, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/10/t-mobile-block-icloud-private-relay/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22573519/apple-private-relay-icloud-plus-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey-how-to"&gt;VPN-like Private Relay&lt;/a&gt; hides your web activity from any outside sources — including Apple and your carrier — and prevents anyone from identifying you or the sites you access. It’s currently available &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522998/apple-icloud-plus-subscription-vpn-scurity-wwdc"&gt;via a subscription to iCloud Plus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5ygsEB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TMobileHelp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TMobileHelp&lt;/a&gt; What the hey?  Why are you keeping us from using &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Apple&lt;/a&gt; ‘s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/icloud?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#icloud&lt;/a&gt; private relay? &lt;a href="https://t.co/EtdxkVSpWh"&gt;pic.twitter.com/EtdxkVSpWh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jon Guidry (@guidryjd) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/guidryjd/status/1480599787577696260?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 10, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hwCA9M"&gt;Private Relay is still in beta in iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, and it isn’t turned on by default. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22573519/apple-private-relay-icloud-plus-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey-how-to"&gt;You have to go into your iPhone’s settings to switch it on&lt;/a&gt;, which is where some T-Mobile customers first noticed the message above appearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z095du"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/guidryjd/status/1480631410239094797?s=20"&gt;a reply to that tweet&lt;/a&gt;, the user shows what happens when you click the “Learn More” button below the initial message — there, Apple explains why T-Mobile might be blocking the feature. “Networks that require the ability to audit traffic or perform network-based filtering will block access to Private Relay,” it reads. “Your cellular provider may be providing network-based services, such as Parental Controls, requiring them to view the traffic on your network.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7oYDJF"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://tmo.report/2022/01/t-mobile-blocking-icloud-private-relay-for-some-but-its-not-what-you-think/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The T-Mo Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;iCloud Private Relay conflicts with a number of T-Mobile services, but that doesn’t appear to be the case here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j4ZROa"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/10/european-carriers-seek-to-block-iphone-private-relay-feature/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;iPhone users in Europe were the first to notice that access to the Private Relay feature wasn’t working. T-Mobile, Vodafone, and Telefonica added their names to an open letter published in &lt;a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2022/01/09/apple-fire-iphone-encryption-tech/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that criticizes the feature. Carriers argue that Private Relay “will impair others to innovate and compete in downstream digital markets and may negatively impact operators’ ability to efficiently manage telecommunication networks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oWnp0v"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 11th, 4:48AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated with additional &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://tmo.report/2022/01/t-mobile-blocking-icloud-private-relay-for-some-but-its-not-what-you-think/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;reporting by The T-Mo Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k79kN0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 11th 3:00PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated throughout with comment from T-Mobile about the cause of the issue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s $19 polishing cloth is back in stock online</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3BFtKsVDD9wBdeVm05pluPcOn08=/0x167:1000x834/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70375574/MM6F3_AV2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can buy the cloth once again.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PGwWdl"&gt;Apple’s $19 polishing cloth is back in stock &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1235321/7613?subId1=Verge%252C%2520Apple%2520Polishing%2520Cloth%2520News%2520Post%252C%25201%252F11%252F22&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMM6F3AM%2FA%2Fpolishing-cloth" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at the company’s online store&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/11/the-nightmare-is-over-the-apple-polishing-cloth-is-back-in-stock-and-ready-to-ship/"&gt;as spotted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The very expensive piece of cloth was first introduced following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733198/apple-polishing-cloth-clean-devices"&gt;Apple’s October event&lt;/a&gt;, but it was quickly backordered — &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/11/apple-polishing-cloth-in-stock/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it was “impossible” to get one before the holidays — so if you’ve been waiting to get one, now’s your chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SIrJTx"&gt;“Made with soft, nonabrasive material, the Polishing Cloth cleans any Apple display, including nano-texture glass, safely and effectively,” reads Apple’s description of the cloth on its product page. Sounds perfect if you need to clean a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161487/apple-mac-pro-display-xdr-review-6k-lcd-screen-price-features"&gt;Pro Display XDR&lt;/a&gt; with the nano-texture glass screen. That already costs $5,999 — the nano-texture glass is a $1,000 upgrade from the &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1235321/7613?subId1=Verge%252C%2520Apple%2520Polishing%2520Cloth%2520News%2520Post%252C%25201%252F11%252F22&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fpro-display-xdr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;standard model&lt;/a&gt; — and if you want Apple’s official stand for the display, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/6/3/18651001/apples-mac-pro-xdr-display-monitor-stand-expensive-dongle-not-included-wwdc-2019"&gt;you’ll have to drop an additional grand&lt;/a&gt;, so what’s another $19 for the company’s polishing cloth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="StcXNF"&gt;It appears that the cloth isn’t in stock at the company’s retail stores; it isn’t available for in-store pickup at any of the stores near me. If you order one as I write this, though, Apple says it will be delivered by Friday. While you’re waiting for your order to arrive, don’t miss &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F54122%2Fmacbook-pro-2021-teardown%23cloth&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F11%2F22878673%2Fapple-polishing-cloth-in-stock-online" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iFixit’s actual teardown of the cloth&lt;/a&gt; — which is actually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22753184/ifixit-apple-polishing-cloth-19-repair-backorder"&gt;more interesting than you might expect&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>White House says that insurers are required to reimburse or pay for at-home COVID tests</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-HEALTH-VIRUS-ECONOMY-ELECTRONICS-CES" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T1fjM-WcXI9A11w5EPZgdfNkwKs=/0x0:5370x3580/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70375558/1237512337.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Db29zb"&gt;At a press conference on Monday, the Biden administration announced a policy that will require insurance companies to reimburse up to eight over-the-counter at-home COVID-19 tests for their customers beginning January 15th, as first reported &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-business-health-cb49a8458f33a698c3a4f3b721835270"&gt;by the &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The administration said in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1480639293756522502?s=20"&gt;a Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt; that the “update” is a part of a larger plan to “increase access to COVID-19 testing.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W5yEWe"&gt;Under the new policy, insured Americans will either have to purchase the test kits under their insurance or submit receipts to their insurance for reimbursement. A family of four under the same plan would be eligible to be reimbursed for up to eight COVID tests each, totaling 32 tests per month. The plan will also require consumers wanting reimbursement to do more work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xxs761"&gt;The plan “incentivizes” companies to cover upfront costs and make it easier for privately insured consumers to go online or to their local pharmacy or store, purchase a test, and get it paid for upfront or reimbursed, the US Department of Health and Human Services said in a Monday &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/01/10/biden-harris-administration-requires-insurance-companies-group-health-plans-to-cover-cost-at-home-covid-19-tests-increasing-access-free-tests.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wp1RLn"&gt;The update comes nearly a month after the administration announced that it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22848887/joe-biden-google-free-covid-test-near-me"&gt;working with Google&lt;/a&gt; to release a website to distribute 500 million free COVID-19 tests to Americans— a plan that came in the midst of a mass testing shortage in the US and the spread of the omicron variant. The website has yet to launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q0DFvq"&gt;At the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63_vd1MRNE"&gt;press conference&lt;/a&gt;, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that Americans should be able to order tests online later this month, but there are “several components” involved in manufacturing and distributing the tests that could spark further delays.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The excellent Beats Fit Pro earbuds are coming to many more countries on January 28th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7ayG7Wf6Tozvi1zlC44rD7MSdLg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70375456/DSCF6033_Edited.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fIDPIb"&gt;Beats’ best earbuds yet, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22753158/beats-fit-pro-earbuds-review-apple"&gt;Beats Fit Pro&lt;/a&gt;, were only available in the United States immediately upon their release a few months ago. Apple then launched the earbuds in China, but now they’re set to become much more widely available on January 28th. That’s when the Beats Fit Pro will launch across Canada, Europe, and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OV04z1"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/beatsbydre/status/1480947737118101506"&gt;a tweet from the Apple-owned brand&lt;/a&gt;, preorders for the “worldwide” release will begin on January 24th before the buds hit shelves on the 28th. The Beats Fit Pro include flexible wingtips that help them (comfortably) stay anchored in your ears without coming loose — even during exercise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oaoI5x"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-fit-pro-canada-europe-japan-release-date-161335850.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in Europe the Beats Fit Pro will be priced at £200 / €230; in Canada they’ll cost $250 CAD; and in Japan you’ll be able to get them for 24,800 yen. As in the US, the Fit Pro earbuds will be offered in black, white, gray, and purple. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ptNyqVVjvt3IM3On3kkY-q2tLvo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22973260/DSCF6027_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beats Fit Pro earbuds are basically a sportier version of the AirPods Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OYFwzG"&gt;They feature the same active noise cancellation system as the AirPods Pro, IPX4 water resistance, and also support head tracking when listening to spatial audio. Battery life is rated at up to six hours on a charge, with the case good for another 21 hours. They don’t check off all the bells and whistles: there’s no wireless charging, for example, and AirPods still perform better on voice calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tG3gc5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Beats Fit Pro review: sporty AirPods Pros with better sound","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22753158/beats-fit-pro-earbuds-review-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="gLqzYG"&gt;But they maintain most of Apple’s ecosystem tricks while delivering arguably better, more powerful sound in a fit that offers superior stability. They’re our top pick for workout earbuds, but I find myself using them just as regularly for everyday listening.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Best gaming laptop in 2021: seven laptops to get your game on</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Gaming Laptops 2021: Asus ROG Zephyrus G15 gaming laptop" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dFgjUrUVReawUz4BcRUID8XTWDI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68856650/akrales_210226_4440_0019.9.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The best gaming laptop is the Asus ROG Zephyrus G15.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales/ The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best gaming laptop at every size and price&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="23pZwg"&gt;The best gaming laptops are changing every year. The early days of mobile gaming were largely desktop replacements — clunky chassis, multiple power bricks, and RGB lighting galore. But the top contenders now are different. Manufacturers are finally putting powerful specs in sleeker, more portable, and more professional builds. They have excellent, fast refreshing screens that are necessary for a great gaming experience. These laptops aren’t just great for gaming, but for everyday work as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qiHviH"&gt;The best gaming laptop of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt;. It can handle the most demanding games on the market today and also makes a great daily driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VRi2QJ"&gt;We’ll be updating this page regularly as the best gaming laptops hit shelves throughout this year. Some exciting updates are on the way. AMD and Nvidia have announced their next-gen series of mobile processors and mobile graphics cards — the Ryzen 5000 series and the GeForce RTX 3000 series, respectively — and we’re already seeing them in premium gaming laptops across manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGRnFN"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22217171/gaming-laptops-qhd-screens-display-fast-refresh-rate"&gt;QHD screen&lt;/a&gt; is another feature to watch for in the best gaming laptops. A growing number of manufacturers are releasing configurations with 1440p displays, even in gaming laptops under $2,000. These options can hit a sweet spot for many gamers: a better experience than 1080p without the price premium or raw horsepower required for a 4K display. You can expect decently high refresh rates from these panels as well, depending on the model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5KtNO"&gt;One more thing to keep in mind with the best gaming laptops is the power you can expect. Not all chips with the same name are created equal — the RTX 3070 in one laptop may not deliver the same frame rates as the RTX 3070 in another laptop due to its wattage (as well as other factors like the processor and cooling). Nvidia now requires companies to disclose clock speeds and graphics power on each model’s product page, but plenty of manufacturers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266921/nvidia-requiring-companies-share-clock-speed-power-gaming-laptop-rtx-30-series-gpu-specs"&gt;haven’t done that yet&lt;/a&gt;. Your best bet, if you can’t find those numbers on a company’s website, is to read some reviews and make sure the model you’re considering will deliver the frame rates you’re looking for. We will note the wattage used in any laptops we review with the new RTX graphics cards. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus ROG Zephyrus G15 is the best gaming laptop of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oTToOm"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="dqOSgQ"&gt;Asus’s ROG Zephyrus G14 was our top gaming laptop pick for quite a while. It did just about everything right, and we weren’t sure whether Asus could ever replicate its resounding success. But somehow, the company managed to make the G14 just a bit bigger, and a heck of a lot better. In doing so, it’s created the ROG Zephyrus G15, the best 15-inch rig you can buy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsXGzm"&gt;At just over four pounds, the Zephyrus G15 is one of the lightest 15-inch gaming laptops you can buy. But you’re not making any compromises on performance for that portability: it’s powered by the top mobile chips that AMD and Nvidia have to offer, and includes a fast 165Hz QHD (1440p) display. Together, those components can handle even the toughest AAA titles at QHD resolution. The panel has excellent color reproduction as well, so your games will look great. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HMlhzT"&gt;But it’s not just the gaming; almost everything else about the G15 is great, too. The audio (pumped from a six-speaker array) has strong percussion and bass, the keyboard and touchpad have a satisfying click, the port selection leaves little to be desired, and the battery can last for a whopping eight and a half hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MktsFD"&gt;The G15 won’t be the laptop for everyone. There’s no webcam, which is a significant oversight, and some may prefer something more affordable, or with a flashier aesthetic. But as a package, the G15 is the one to beat. Not only is it the best gaming laptop you can buy, but it’s also one of the best laptops you can buy, period. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="jT5h16"&gt;The best big-screen gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E8Fdz3"&gt;The Blade Pro 17 delivers some of the best gaming performance you can find in a laptop — but that’s not even its superpower. What makes Razer’s 17-inch flagship so impressive is it packs that unbelievable power into a thin and attractive chassis. It’s just 0.8 inches thick and only requires one charging brick — so you can carry it around in a backpack or briefcase without compromising on power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kQQiQ0"&gt;This year’s model comes with an FHD 360Hz screen — the highest refresh rate you can get on a laptop. It also has a customizable per-key RGB keyboard, which adds a touch of color without being too intense for the office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsGaDN"&gt;The Blade Pro 17 certainly isn’t cheap, but it’s the laptop to buy if you want the best of the best.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Legion 5 Pro is a powerful device with a massive 16:10 display.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2kvoth"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529429/lenovo-legion-5-pro-review-gaming-laptop-price-specs-performance-features"&gt;Lenovo Legion 5 Pro&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="SAASF8"&gt;A gaming laptop with a 16:10 screen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Yc2Q91"&gt;The Legion 5 Pro is the best gaming laptop Lenovo has ever made. For well under $2,000, you get exceptional performance from AMD’s Ryzen 5000 processors in an attractive 16-inch chassis. It delivered respectable results on every game we tried, even at its native 2560 x 1600 resolution. And with the 165Hz display, you’ll be able to fully take advantage of the Legion 5 Pro’s power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QoThO"&gt;Performance aside, the highlight of the Legion 5 Pro is its 16:10 screen. A screen this tall is hard to find on the gaming laptop market these days, and it allows you more room for multitasking if you want to use the Legion 5 Pro as a daily driver. The keyboard is also a delight to use, with 1.5mm of travel and four-zone programmable backlighting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zoBjtO"&gt;The Legion’s main downside is its battery life. We only got about four and a half hours of continuous use in our testing. While that’s not the worst we’ve ever gotten from a gaming laptop, it’s nowhere near what you’ll see from the G15. However, it does charge very, very fast with the included 300W power brick. Overall, though the G15 will be a better option for folks who often work on the go, the Legion is still a solid choice—and we have to give Lenovo props for the 16:10 screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="BzyEj8"&gt;The best AMD gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HhOl4t"&gt;The ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition is one of the few gaming laptops you’ll find that includes both an AMD processor and an AMD GPU. Not to worry — it delivers gaming performance on par with what you’ll see from laptops with Nvidia’s top GPUs. It also delivers one of the best gaming battery experiences we’ve ever seen — it was able to maintain playable frame rates on &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2 &lt;/em&gt;for over an hour with no charger attached. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JHVLju"&gt;Speaking of battery, we averaged nine hours and 16 minutes of work use between charges, which makes the Strix G15 far and away one of the longest-lasting gaming laptops on the market. That’s doubly impressive because it’s powering a ton of flashy LEDs, including a per-key RGB keyboard and a colorful light strip around the front edge of the deck. If you’re looking for a jazzy, bold design and you’re all-in on AMD, the Strix G15 Advantage edition is a great gaming laptop for you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="OanWnj"&gt;If you’re looking for a powerful 14-inch device that can keep up with the best 15-inch gaming laptops on the market, the only place you’ll find that is the Razer Blade 14. This slim and portable device includes Nvdia’s RTX 3070 and RTX 3080, Nvidia’s top-of-the-line mobile GPUs, as well as a powerful eight-core AMD chip. It’s a gorgeous device, with a QHD 165Hz display option and a classy RGB keyboard. There’s even a reasonable port selection, including HDMI 2.1 as well as two USB-C ports.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="J74U3a"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22765258/alienware-x17-review-4k-17-inch-gaming-laptop"&gt;Alienware X17&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lzKwju"&gt;A gaming laptop with a 4K screen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="m6FWbU"&gt;There’s finally a laptop that can deliver an enjoyable gaming experience in 4K — as long as you’re prepared to fork over some real cash. The Alienware X17 (currently starting at $2,199) can run all kinds of modern titles at playable frame rates at its native 3840 x 2160 resolution. It could even stay close to 60fps with ray tracing on.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ULSQ9m"&gt;The X17’s power isn’t its only standout quality. Dell has also managed to cram that power into an impressively thin and sleek chassis. It’s just 0.84 inches thick, with an RGB keyboard that isn’t too obnoxious and a touchpad that lights up when you press it. And it’s quite cool and quiet, even under heavy gaming loads.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lpAXv8"&gt;On the other hand, the X17 would not be a good choice to double as a daily driver (though it did do well in our Premiere Pro testing). The webcam is mediocre, and the touchpad is a bit small, especially for a 17-inch notebook. Battery life only averaged around four hours in our testing. And while the chassis is compact, it’s still not light, weighing in at over six pounds. But if you’re looking for a 4K laptop that is, first and foremost, great at running games, this device should top your list. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="7lPrCK"&gt;The best laptop with flashy RGB&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="SK7elL"&gt;If you’re looking for a “traditional” premium gaming laptop with colorful, flashy panache, the ROG Strix Scar 15 is for you. The Strix’s keyboard isn’t just one of the most comfortable that we’ve ever tested on a gaming laptop; it also has some of the coolest per-key RGB lighting we’ve ever seen with all kinds of effects. There’s also a colorful light strip wrapped around the front of the deck (customizable as well) and a colorful glowing logo on the lid. In short: if you use this in public, people will notice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZuwqX"&gt;Of course, the Strix is great on the inside as well, delivering some of the best frame rates you’ll find from a 15-inch laptop with Intel’s and Nvidia’s top chips. You’ll get the full benefit of their power with a 300Hz screen option as well. And the Strix comes preloaded with various programs to help customize your gaming experience. You can personalize color profiles, bandwidth allocation, and more based on the type of game you’re playing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="wzRw2D"&gt;A great thin and light gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="EcPuJg"&gt;The Blade 15 isn’t as powerful as its 17-inch sibling, but it may be a more pragmatic purchase for many people. If you’re looking for a balanced combination of performance and portability, the Blade 15 may hit that sweet spot. It still packs the top chips on the market and comes with a 240Hz QHD display, but at just 4.39 pounds and 0.62 inches thick, it’s comparable in size to a number of 15-inch productivity machines like the Dell XPS 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w8vpQe"&gt;In addition to its reliable gaming performance, the Blade 15 works well as a productivity machine. We’re big fans of its keyboard, which is quite comfortable to use and has per-key RGB lighting, and the touchpad, which is roomy with a satisfying click. Our primary complaint is that this Blade got quite hot during our game testing. &lt;/p&gt;
