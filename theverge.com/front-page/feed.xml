    <title>Amazon is acquiring a podcast hosting and monetization platform</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PfFwq5QOFbzG4r8bNnNKsWbXUtI=/0x0:710x473/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69501005/amazonmusicart19.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Amazon Music&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MZAWyd"&gt;Amazon Music is getting more serious about its podcast endeavors. Today, the company &lt;a href="https://podcasters.amazon.com/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s acquiring Art19, a major podcast hosting and monetization platform for an undisclosed sum. This means Amazon will now have a hand in hosting podcasters’ shows as well as selling ads against them because Art19 operates an ad marketplace that targets and inserts ads into programming. We’ve reached out to Amazon Music to learn more about what this acquisition might mean for podcasters who host on the service and will update if we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cRZYor"&gt;This is a major step for Amazon as it looks to take on a bigger role in the podcasting world. Amazon Music only started offering podcasts in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21439531/amazon-music-podcasts-prime-titles"&gt;September last year&lt;/a&gt;, as did Audible &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536963/amazon-free-podcast-update-catalog"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt;. But in the time since, Amazon Music has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/30/22098312/amazon-music-wondery-acquire-buy-podcast-industry"&gt;acquired Wondery&lt;/a&gt;, one of the last major independent podcast networks. Today’s acquisition gives it a fuller role in the industry. Not only will it make content through Wondery and distribute shows through its app, but now, Amazon can host those podcasts, as well as third parties’, and sell ads against them. This gives Amazon even more data about what’s happening both inside and outside its app. (Amazon Music already &lt;a href="https://advertising.amazon.com/solutions/products/audio-ads"&gt;sells audio ads&lt;/a&gt;, so Art19’s business might complement that work.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9cPTvU"&gt;We’ve seen this same scenario already play out with Spotify. The company started out making content-based acquisitions, like that of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/6/18213462/spotify-podcasts-gimlet-anchor-acquisition"&gt;Gimlet Media&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/26/18282301/spotify-podcasts-parcast-acquisition-gimlet-media-anchor"&gt;Parcast&lt;/a&gt;, but then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21557458/spotify-megaphone-podcast-streaming-ad-insertion"&gt;acquired Megaphone&lt;/a&gt;, an Art19 competitor. In that case, Spotify has focused on bringing a proprietary ad-serving technology to the platform, called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/8/21056336/spotify-streaming-ad-insertion-technology-ces-launch"&gt;Streaming Ad Insertion&lt;/a&gt;, in order to encourage podcasters to move over to the hosting service and take advantage of its ad marketplace. Other companies in the space have also taken a similar position. iHeartMedia &lt;a href="https://www.tritondigital.com/news-item/February-17-2021/iheartmedia-to-acquire-triton-digital-from-scripps"&gt;acquired Triton Digital&lt;/a&gt;, and SXM Media acquired Midroll, an ad-serving marketplace and platform, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/13/21315911/siriusxm-stitcher-podcast-deal-buy-midroll-earwolf"&gt;in July&lt;/a&gt;. As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22287309/podcast-iheart-media-triton-digital-acquire-spotify"&gt;we said&lt;/a&gt; in February, the podcasting business isn’t only about the flashy exclusive content deals, but who can sell and monetize shows.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft will let devs keep every penny their Windows app makes — unless it’s a game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TJB6DMAmoyceCvC1nAVMTvyEH_w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69500961/acastro_180507_1777_microsoft_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LFZuGI"&gt;As part of its Windows 11 announcements on Thursday, Microsoft revealed &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/06/24/building-a-new-open-microsoft-store-on-windows-11/"&gt;a major policy change&lt;/a&gt; to incentivize developers to make apps for the Microsoft Store: starting on July 28th, if a developer uses their own or a third-party payment system in their app, Microsoft will let them keep 100 percent of the revenue. But the deal has one important caveat: it doesn’t apply to games, Microsoft confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Uher5"&gt;That omission further muddies the ongoing debate about the differences between an app and a game and app store policies around each — a distinction that is one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436014/apple-roblox-epic-fortnite-trial-what-is-game-name-change"&gt;core issues&lt;/a&gt; in the ongoing legal battle between &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;-maker Epic Games and Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FKSjej"&gt;Microsoft is largely on the side of apps and games being different because its bottom line depends on it. During the Epic trial, the company testified that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422691/microsoft-xbox-consoles-profit-software-services-revenue-apple-epic-games-trial"&gt;sells expensive Xbox hardware at a loss&lt;/a&gt; and makes its profits from the 30 percent cut it takes of game sales and subscriptions. But it also seemed like Microsoft was saying that PC games were different: the company recently announced that it would lower its cut of game revenues in the Microsoft Store &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409285/microsoft-store-cut-windows-pc-games-12-percent"&gt;from 30 to 12 percent starting on August 1st&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PXs1cS"&gt;It’s not clear if Epic CEO Tim Sweeney was aware of the caveat when &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1408094368918032386"&gt;he tweeted this&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jVlEs2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The 2021 version of Microsoft is the best version of Microsoft ever! &lt;a href="https://t.co/RTpFHpWazG"&gt;https://t.co/RTpFHpWazG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1408094368918032386?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2WzWEx"&gt;While the new 100 percent revshare option doesn’t apply to games, it’s still a significant policy shift — one that both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22546635/microsoft-windows-11-new-app-store"&gt;Windows chief Panos Panay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549007/microsoft-windows-11-satya-nadella-remarks-apple"&gt;Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella&lt;/a&gt; made a big deal about in their remarks at Thursday’s keynote. Now, we just have to see if the new model is enticing enough to bring more developers to the Microsoft Store and if the pressure will lead other platform holders like Apple and Google to make similar changes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft didn’t kill Skype, but Windows 11 is shoving it out of sight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GqoI_RRu6Fnfk5qIVQtM0K9RDOQ=/296x0:1916x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69500923/Panos_Panay_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VeaCGG"&gt;Today’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22546829/microsoft-windows-11-event-live-blog-updates-news"&gt;Windows 11 news&lt;/a&gt; is all about where Microsoft sees computing going over the next few years, but it’s just as much the story of how Skype has flourished and ebbed since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/10/14/2489611/microsoft-skype-deal-complete"&gt;its $8.5 billion acquisition&lt;/a&gt; a decade ago. Five years ago, Skype was the big name in internet calling and video, and Microsoft made it an “inbox app” for Windows 10 that was included at installation and launched at startup by default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftAfzH"&gt;Now, after a pandemic year that has had more people using their PCs for voice and video than ever before, Skype was nowhere to be seen in the Windows 11 presentation or materials. Instead, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548738/microsoft-teams-windows-11-integration-announcement-features"&gt;Microsoft Teams gets a highlight spot&lt;/a&gt; in the new center-aligned taskbar and deep integration into Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Windows 11 taskbar - Teams" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cYzD4KWLOukYAjnxxcVeaW2-Sd4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679800/Windows_11_Chat_Integration_Screen_1000x625.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 11 taskbar - Teams.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="e9cJTM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Skype is no longer an inbox app for new devices that run Windows 11.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qibL0d"&gt;The future vision that Microsoft had for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/18/8243879/microsoft-skype-for-business-video"&gt;Skype everywhere&lt;/a&gt; has turned into a reality — but that reality made competitors Zoom and FaceTime into household names instead. Back in June, when Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298766/microsoft-teams-personal-launch-preview-accounts"&gt;made Teams available for personal accounts&lt;/a&gt;, the company still paid lip service to Skype, saying, “For folks that just want a very purpose-built app, Skype is a great solution, and we support it and encourage it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="7leYsx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Microsoft’s Skype struggles created a Zoom moment","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21200844/microsoft-skype-zoom-houseparty-coronavirus-pandemic-usage-growth-competition"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="fJJuFq"&gt;But now, if you want to use Skype, you’re going to have to go find it in the Microsoft Store like any other app. A company spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;: “Skype is no longer an inbox app for new devices that run Windows 11. The Skype app is available to download through the Microsoft Store for free.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Skype Windows 8" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G74MFrdc8E7LT-HmXweIQaIDBeU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/885592/skypewindows8.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fnHCA9"&gt;You can see just how precipitously Skype has fallen over the last year when you consider which other apps Windows 11 will include out of the box; even Windows Terminal will be a pack-in. Skype joins OneNote, Paint 3D, and 3D Viewer as the apps that will no longer come with the OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JNA3kd"&gt;Even adding one-click “Meet Now” features &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21200844/microsoft-skype-zoom-houseparty-coronavirus-pandemic-usage-growth-competition"&gt;couldn’t help Skype compete early in the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. The sudden push to go remote saw regular users choose powerful enterprise-grade chat apps, with giants like Microsoft and Google opening their doors to encourage the trend. Now, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22538240/google-chat-allo-hangouts-talk-messaging-mess-timeline"&gt;just like Google&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft has a complicated array of conferencing tools to sort out, and Windows 11’s launch suggests it’ll cut the fat sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TPcyTp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 11’s Intel-powered Android apps will run on AMD and Arm processors, too</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a6mGBXP8__2x6BkHh5HnvuV5aHA=/114x0:1323x806/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69500917/7JTO7hJ.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mbafi7"&gt;One of the biggest announcements at today’s Windows 11 reveal was that Microsoft would offer the option to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548428/microsoft-windows-11-android-apps-support-amazon-store"&gt;run Android apps on its new operating system&lt;/a&gt;, powered by a new “Intel Bridge” compiler that helps those apps run on x86 systems. But despite being an Intel-developed system, Android apps on Windows 11 won’t just be limited to computers with Intel CPUs. AMD and Arm-based processors will also support Android apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yyt4a3"&gt;“Intel believes it is important to provide this capability across all x86 platforms and has designed Intel Bridge technology to support all x86 platforms (including AMD platforms),” Intel confirmed in a statement to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Microsoft further corroborated that Android applications will be available for all silicon providers, including Arm, although the company isn’t talking about how well those apps will actually run yet. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bQsWHzPy50glKWWo_pWUtfaCzW4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679872/lcimg_9abbdc71_7b16_4ba0_b22a_2e6b359bcd82.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Xmubfc"&gt;According to Intel, Bridge itself is a run-time post compiler that translates applications that are compiled for non-x86 platforms (in this case, Android applications) into x86 instructions (which can run on Windows 11 with Intel or AMD CPUs). It’s a bit like a reverse version of Apple’s Rosetta software for its M1 Macs — but instead of converting x86 applications to run on Arm, it’s letting Arm-based apps run on x86 chips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lo3RVC"&gt;Arm-based Windows 11 devices, which won’t need that extra translation layer, will presumably be able to run Android apps without Intel Bridge, although Microsoft hasn’t fully explained how that will work just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J2apmqBvj8UrUdfeSi8Iyijd_Nk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679133/androidappswindows.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GsndhM"&gt;Windows 11’s Android apps are offered through a new partnership with Amazon’s Appstore. Android apps like TikTok will be listed on the new Microsoft Store, although users will also have to log in to their Amazon accounts in order to be able to install the mobile applications. Once set up, though, Android apps will run similar to any other windowed application, including the ability to pin them to the taskbar or snap them alongside other apps. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ViacomCBS again restructures its leadership in its bid to win the streaming wars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ypISp02O941Mtaa7SwStQ3XMx-U=/88x0:1033x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69500899/Paramount_Plus.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: ViacomCBS&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g0tSRB"&gt;ViacomCBS is once again changing up leadership to emphasize its focus on streaming and ensure the success of its streaming services, particularly its late-to-the-party content giant Paramount Plus. The announcement comes just a day after &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/comcasts-ceo-built-a-cable-giant-can-he-build-a-streaming-giant-11624473722"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; NBCUniversal had approached ViacomCBS about joining streaming forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YCk3aJ"&gt;ViacomCBS &lt;a href="https://ir.viacomcbs.com/news-releases/news-release-details/viacomcbs-announces-enhanced-streaming-content-leadership"&gt;announced Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; title changes and additional oversight for several of its executives currently overseeing various ViacomCBS content properties, particularly for its recently launched Paramount Plus streaming service. Leadership reorganizations focused on streaming have become standard for major parent companies of recently launched services like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514728/disney-streaming-reorganization-plus-espn-hulu-studios-movies-network-tv-shows-pandemic"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/7/21359128/warnermedia-reorg-bob-greenblatt-kevin-reilly-hbo-max-jason-kilar-streaming"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; — and ViacomCBS has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21524771/viacomcbs-all-access-paramount-plus-reorganization-disney-netflix"&gt;previously seen&lt;/a&gt; internal shifts meant to prop up Paramount Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CBIfdJ"&gt;In a statement, ViacomCBS boss Bob Bakish said Paramount Plus’ first few months “have demonstrated the power and potential of our platform, as well as audiences’ appetite for a broad and diverse array of content, all in one place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gn5InD"&gt;Tanya Giles, who serves as the general manager of MTV Entertainment Group, has been promoted to chief programming officer of streaming at the company and will specifically focus on content for Paramount Plus and Pluto TV. ViacomCBS reported reaching &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/viacomcbs-grows-global-streaming-subscribers-paramount-plus-1234948505/"&gt;36 million global paid subscriptions&lt;/a&gt; back in May. But that figure is towered over by services like Disney Plus and Netflix, which have zoomed past the 100 million- and 200 million-subscription mark, respectively. Giles’ new role, while one of several announced this week, is among the more significant changes in the company’s leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OIyGv9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Paramount Plus’ first few months “have demonstrated the power and potential of our platform”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ScfU8i"&gt;CBS president and CEO George Cheeks now additionally holds the title of chief content officer of news and sports at Paramount Plus. Chairman and CEO of Paramount Pictures, Jim Gianopulos, is now also chief content officer of movies at Paramount Plus. Bruce Gillmer, who is president of music, music talent, programming, and events will oversee music at the service, while MTV Entertainment Group president Chris McCarthy now also holds the title of chief content officer of unscripted entertainment and adult animation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R6jYjf"&gt;Chairman and CEO of Showtime Networks, David Nevins, now additionally holds the role of chief content officers of scripted originals at Paramount Plus. An &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/emmy-winner-david-nevins-joins-25036/"&gt;Emmy-winning producer&lt;/a&gt;, Nevins was attached to &lt;a href="https://www.viacomcbspressexpress.com/showtime/executives/view?id=23"&gt;award-winning productions&lt;/a&gt; that include &lt;em&gt;Arrested Development&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Law &amp;amp; Order: SVU&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Friday Night Lights&lt;/em&gt;, and his promotion as a key figure within the Paramount Plus C-suite seems smart on the part of ViacomCBS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QljTN7"&gt;Meanwhile, Nicole Clemens, president of Paramount Television Studios, will also oversee Paramount Plus’ original scripted series. Lastly, Brian Robbins, president of kids and family entertainment, will now also hold the title of chief content officer of kids and family programming at Paramount Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v74gdu"&gt;The restructure comes at an interesting time for the company. Paramount Plus, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300993/paramount-plus-streaming-wars-netflix-disney-launch-date-price"&gt;launched in March&lt;/a&gt;, is one of the now seemingly innumerable streaming services all competing for subscribers. It’s unclear whether ViacomCBS’s long-game strategy is an eventual merger along the lines of the recent deal between &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451111/att-ceo-stankey-unleash-assets-warnermedia-discovery-hbo"&gt;WarnerMedia and Discovery&lt;/a&gt;, but reports from &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/comcasts-ceo-built-a-cable-giant-can-he-build-a-streaming-giant-11624473722"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/nbcuniversals-streaming-strategy-raise-prospect-of-warnermedia-merger"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; indicated NBCUniversal had approached ViacomCBS about teaming up. According to the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;, ViacomCBS declined that offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vVSC6N"&gt;By the looks of it, ViacomCBS is instead amassing a leadership team to help its scrappy service compete in the streaming wars in earnest. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ADT and Ring reach settlement in trademark dispute over octagonal blue signs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1GaZZQm-j4yY0CL1jQWbNG2adqI=/86x0:1000x609/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69500850/PMP_desktop_outdoor_siren_alarm_2.0_3024x3024_e776dee7_766f_46bd_8a04_69e509429231_1000x.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ring&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jLpyaB"&gt;ADT has settled its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405245/adt-ring-blue-octagon-design-trademark-dispute-lawsuit"&gt;trademark dispute lawsuit against Ring&lt;/a&gt;, which it brought against the Amazon-owned company because of what it called a “striking similarity” between Ring’s Outdoor Siren and ADT’s blue octagon signs. According to &lt;a href="https://news.adt.com/news-releases/news-release-details/adt-and-ring-settle-trademark-dispute"&gt;ADT’s press release&lt;/a&gt; and a statement from a Ring spokesperson, Ring will stop selling the current design of its Outdoor Siren and release a new version.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zC8MnDwVjLfbIwKj_qL53r2v438=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22472686/msedge_hdavxHV40l.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;em&gt;ADT v. Ring&lt;/em&gt; court filing&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ring Outdoor Siren versus ADT’s sign.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jgPhR8"&gt;ADT filed the suit in April, asking a judge for both cash compensation and a halt on Ring selling products that looked like ADT’s blue sign. Neither company mentioned whether there was a monetary amount as part of the settlement, only that they were “pleased to have reached a mutually agreeable resolution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZCONIU"&gt;Currently, Ring’s US page for the Outdoor Siren leads to a 404, but the product &lt;a href="https://en-uk.ring.com/products/alarm-security-outdoor-siren"&gt;is still available in the UK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c7STuH"&gt;The two home security companies have had disagreements before: in 2017, Ring was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/5/16609880/ring-barred-from-selling-security-system-adt-lawsuit-z1"&gt;ordered to stop selling certain products&lt;/a&gt; after ADT claimed the company had benefited from proprietary information. The two companies &lt;a href="https://www.securitysales.com/automation/smart-home/ring-reaches-settlement-with-adt-in-zonoff-lawsuit-plus-other-developments/"&gt;reportedly ended up settling&lt;/a&gt; that case. ADT had also previously asked Ring to make &lt;a href="https://ring.com/collections/accessories/products/solar-security-sign"&gt;its outdoor sign&lt;/a&gt; look less like ADT’s.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Steam’s summer sale is here to relieve you of your money</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gCzt1HhbdwwlJKXs9npDPwzd0xw=/547x275:2814x1786/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69500824/Screen_Shot_2021_06_24_at_3.53.12_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

The &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/forgeyourfate"&gt;Steam summer sale&lt;/a&gt; will continue through July 8th, with quite a few beloved titles well below market rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sC3qIf"&gt;Which ones? Glad you asked. &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/976730/Halo_The_Master_Chief_Collection/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo: The Master Chief Collection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172620/Sea_of_Thieves/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sea of Thieves&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Supergiant’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22159911/hades-best-game-2020-nintendo-switch-supergiant-pc"&gt;beloved&lt;/a&gt; roguelike &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, From Software’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/22/18277376/sekiro-shadows-die-twice-review-xbox-ps4-pc"&gt;punishing ninja game&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/814380/Sekiro_Shadows_Die_Twice__GOTY_Edition/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21363127/horizon-zero-dawn-pc-port-review-performance"&gt;recently PC-ported&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1151640/Horizon_Zero_Dawn_Complete_Edition/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/976310/Mortal_Kombat11/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat 11&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/25/18021082/red-dead-redemption-2-review-xbox-one-ps4"&gt;open-world coffee-drinking simulator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1174180/Red_Dead_Redemption_2/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are all at least 30 percent off. &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1238810/Battlefield_V/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battlefield V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is less than $13. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/28/12050342/inside-review-xbox-one-steam"&gt;Unsettling cinematic platformer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/304430/INSIDE/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inside&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is only $4.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="10PKTB"&gt;This sale also features a micro text adventure called &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/forgeyourfate"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forge Your Fate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (and by micro, I truly mean micro — each subsection has only two choices) that will net you some free digital stickers, if you’re into that sort of thing. The cosmetics continue with new &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/points/shop/c/profilebundles"&gt;profile bundles&lt;/a&gt; of backgrounds, avatars, and the like, purchasable with Steam Points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UwsKpu"&gt;Did I mention &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/632470/Disco_Elysium__The_Final_Cut/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disco Elysium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is 35 percent off? Because it is. Just wanted to make sure you knew.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the visual changes Microsoft showed off in Windows 11</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zKjQ5ptVeNWrJj3_fE5qTx0Y2RE=/242x0:2639x1598/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69500696/Screen_Shot_2021_06_24_at_9.30.02_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="72rbg2"&gt;Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22546791/microsoft-windows-11-announcement-features-updates"&gt;announced Windows 11 today&lt;/a&gt;, and one of the headline features of the “next generation” operating system is its visual overhaul. It’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7y1S3wIysg"&gt;released an entire video&lt;/a&gt; about how it designed its new OS, which shows off the new rounded corners, icons, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Nemj1J"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g7y1S3wIysg?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5iIUPo"&gt;Here’s a look at some of the UI changes Microsoft showed off in its presentation today (along with some that we got a look at from subsequent videos), and how they compare to Windows 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ncZdgc"&gt;The Start menu and taskbar&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="yJJXNT"&gt;Microsoft has moved the Start button from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/11/10923808/microsoft-windows-start-menu-20-years-visual-history"&gt;its time-honored place in the lower left-hand corner&lt;/a&gt; to the middle of the screen. While it’s a smaller change than what Microsoft did &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/6/28/3122873/windows-8-start-button-explanation-chaitanya-sareen"&gt;with the Start screen in Windows 8&lt;/a&gt;, it’s still likely going to take some getting used to — for some, it’ll be going against over 25 years of muscle memory. The pinned taskbar items are also moving with it, taking center stage on your screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g9qzVX"&gt;(Microsoft will let people move things back to the left if they don’t like the change, though, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/windows-11-a-guide-to-microsofts-next-big-release-11624549583?mod=latest_headlines"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BuTv28"&gt;Clicking that Start button reveals the updated Start menu, which Microsoft says is powered by the cloud and Office 365. Where the Start menu in Windows 10 mostly acted as a list of apps, the version in Windows 11 will recommend which apps and documents you may like to work on.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8Q_XbDjIUETb-Ie1vQRYWOmAb5c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679506/WIN_Start_GenZ_Light_16x10_en_US_1024x640.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Windows 11 Start menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8eLQKHYfZV9q7UxSwzENuKu8cXg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679505/2021_06_24_09_42_05_Window.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Windows 10 Start menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="l2KEoL"&gt;Widgets&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="4SHTjg"&gt;Live Tiles, which used to live in the Start menu, have been replaced by widgets, which get their own space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jkvZNbWOjf3SMPDbOiSLWdbNB9A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679436/WIN_Widgets_Light_Theme_16x9_en_US_1_1024x576.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 11’s widgets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LDaU2de0KvquElwtJPChSNDUAtE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679433/2021_06_24_10_16_14_Window.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 10’s Live Tiles in the Start menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="4RVNrU"&gt;The Microsoft Store&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="EX3DGQ"&gt;Microsoft says it’s rebuilt its store to make it faster and to give it a new design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RdEFen"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10622500"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="QliL96"&gt;More snaps for Windows Snap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="cNp05C"&gt;Windows 11 also has a new UI for selecting which layout you want to snap to. We’ve been able to easily snap apps side by side since Windows 7, and Microsoft’s added additional layouts over time, but we haven’t seen a built-in windowing manager with this many options  (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/6/20852451/microsoft-windows-10-powertoys-download-features"&gt;Microsoft’s FancyZones was a separate download&lt;/a&gt;). The older suggestion system &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/J8phSH6cuS0?t=240"&gt;does appear to still be in Windows 11&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LyF0tYJd8EOCRQZqI1LgOj43jVU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679449/WIN_SnapAssist_Light_16x9_en_US_1_1024x576.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Snap assistant in Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/80RJ1lenliOu9L1uT7zlofdfmbg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679454/2021_06_24_09_56_56_Window.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 10 would help with snapping by making suggestions about which apps could fit into the snap slots.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="BNnerl"&gt;Modern icons &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="x3fxfF"&gt;Microsoft is giving its icons some much-needed attention in Windows 11, finally overhauling some of the images that have been around since the ‘90s — though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422553/microsoft-windows-95-era-icons-removal-windows-10-update-sun-valley"&gt;they might still include floppy disks&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft shows off some of the new icons in the image below, but you can also find them throughout today’s videos and demos.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3Bq3NIBCourdSVX2eClxWowKBiQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679568/Screen_Shot_2021_06_24_at_11.13.00_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some of the new icons Microsoft showed off for Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="7bxHFw"&gt;File Explorer&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="geNxWH"&gt;File Explorer’s top bar has also seemingly got some tweaks — the tabs appear to be gone, replaced by a row of buttons that appear to be more optimized for touch. The aforementioned new icons also add to the updated look.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rxFCHEfbjFR63gpmEHUIPrmxK_Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679465/ZiM0K2r.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The File Explorer in Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LLdhQ5Q1bS77CIC3OQ3hwAkArl4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679556/2021_06_24_11_05_32_Downloads.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A similar view in Windows 10.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="YrsecS"&gt;Tablet mode&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="6Um5Wt"&gt;Microsoft also showed off Windows 11’s touchscreen prowess — while Windows 10 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/29/9055743/microsoft-windows-10-tablet-mode-mobile-os"&gt;did have a tablet mode&lt;/a&gt;, it’s now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548950/microsoft-windows-11-skype-onenote-live-tiles-cortana"&gt;being deprecated&lt;/a&gt; in favor of a subtle transition to a full-screen experience, where your taskbar simply spreads out the icons a bit more, adds “subtle visual cues” and increases the sizes of touch targets to make windows easier to drag and tap.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

&lt;p id="Nh4HBF"&gt;You can see what the transition looks like for yourself at &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/J8phSH6cuS0?t=226"&gt;3:47 in our video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="WZLkBL"&gt;Microsoft Teams integration&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="MKaWPy"&gt;Windows 11 will include Microsoft Teams, Microsoft’s communications app, right in your Start menu, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548738/microsoft-teams-windows-11-integration-announcement-features"&gt;and it’ll be integrated directly into Windows&lt;/a&gt;. Right-clicking the (redesigned) Teams icon in Windows 11 shows many more options than are available in Windows 10.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YzxiwkBq5FvoXha9yyShWdNUebs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22661987/windows11wallpapers.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The wallpapers in Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0xKmhg"&gt;Microsoft has a collection of new wallpapers for Windows 11, with the default one looking like a glassy, fabric-y piece of coral. We have a whole post &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536375/microsoft-windows-11-default-wallpaper"&gt;about the new wallpapers here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="xwjoto"&gt;The look and feel&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="P5qBdx"&gt;Of course, there are changes that apply to the entire OS, not just parts of it. Transparency, especially when it comes to color, seems to be a heavy part of Windows 11, and Microsoft says it’s literally rounding out all the sharp edges in the UI. The OS also just has a more glassy, clean look overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YY2feW"&gt;There are, however, times where it’ll likely be hard to tell Windows 10 and 11 apart. I was able to recreate one of Microsoft’s screenshots, and while there are differences, it does show that app design is also a big part of user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Optimum is dramatically reducing cable internet speeds to be better ‘aligned with the industry’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fpPbgj8QDx0m1TDreu8BIiNY-zQ=/0x1:1218x813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69500476/optimum.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ss7tPb"&gt;Internet service provider Optimum, owned by Altice USA, is &lt;a href="https://www.optimum.net/pages/optimum-packages-speed-details.html"&gt;dramatically reducing cable internet speeds&lt;/a&gt; for new subscribers starting on July 12th. For some Optimum Online plans, upload speeds will be cut from 35Mbps to as little as 5Mbps, &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/06/cable-isp-altice-slashes-upload-speeds-from-35mbps-to-as-low-as-5mbps/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica &lt;/em&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AeSpmA"&gt;The change impacts new customers still serviced by Optimum’s older, non-fiber network, and it will only impact current subscribers if they upgrade, downgrade, or otherwise change their service. Download speeds should remain the same, but you can see how upload speeds are slowed below:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-DUgbKCBurgfCsZLbfTVVFcJJK0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679209/Screen_Shot_2021_06_24_at_9.02.08_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Optimum’s speed reductions to their internet-only plans.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="73z4Oh"&gt;Lowering the speeds, sometimes by as much as 86 percent in the case of the basic Optimum Online plan, could impact a range of daily internet tasks, from uploading files to making video calls. It could be frustrating to anyone currently working from home, but it’s even more confounding because apparently there isn’t a great reason for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ztiKdj"&gt;Optimum’s owner Altice tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that increased traffic isn’t the justification for throttling its entire customer base. “Our network continues to perform very well despite the significant data usage increase during the pandemic,” a company spokesperson wrote. Changing the upload speeds, the spokesperson said, brings the plan “in-line with other ISPs and aligned with the industry.” When asked to confirm if that’s why the speeds were lowered, the Altice spokesperson reiterated the same statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="746DOJ"&gt;Actually verifying that claim is more than a little difficult. Many ISPs &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/03/comcast-hides-upload-speeds-deep-inside-its-infuriating-ordering-system/"&gt;aren’t particularly forthcoming&lt;/a&gt; with their upload speeds, presumably because none of them are great. Comcast’s Xfinity service, while not offering all of the same download speeds as Optimum, does match its 5Mbps upload speeds on a 100Mbps download plan and 35Mbps upload speeds on a Gigabit 940Mbps download plan, according to third-party site &lt;a href="https://www.cabletv.com/xfinity/internet"&gt;CableTV.com&lt;/a&gt;. Cox &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cox.com%2Faboutus%2Fpolicies%2Fspeeds-and-data-plans.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F24%2F22548774%2Foptimum-altice-reduced-cable-speeds-upload-throttling" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;has the same 35Mbps upload speeds&lt;/a&gt; on its “Gigablast” 940Mbps download plan as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GvKSt4"&gt;Optimum does offer symmetrical upload and download speeds on its “100 percent fiber network,” Altice says, but you might not find that coverage everywhere, and there are no guarantees that your neighborhood is one where the company will be expanding to next. Currently, fiber only covers 20 percent of Optimum’s total footprint, &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/opticalip/fttx/altice-usas-fttp-rollout-eclipses-1m-homes-passed/d/d-id/769122"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Light Reading&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which equates to about 1 million homes. That leaves a lot of people potentially dealing with the new slower speeds after July 12th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Big Tech edges closer to break up after deeply unhinged markup</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Second Impeachment Trial Of Donald J. Trump Continues In Senate" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5w-PKxgeI5rsE7k3Si27lJXyCDY=/0x0:4683x3122/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69500397/1231082774.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mvhFbP"&gt;After nearly two years of investigations, the House Judiciary Committee met Wednesday to push forward on a package of bills targeting the power large tech companies like Amazon and Facebook hold over the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1SQwBu"&gt;“With this package of historic legislation, we have the opportunity to take control of our own destiny to be a global leader in developing rules of the road for the digital economy,” Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY) said at the top of the hearing. “We cannot be complacent and we cannot delay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4nOEo5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We cannot be complacent and we cannot delay”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hbth64"&gt;But while all six bills were eventually approved out of committee... delay, delay, the lawmakers did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fI4GoA"&gt;The markup kicked off Wednesday morning and lasted through Thursday afternoon with a few short breaks in between. The package was introduced earlier this month with broad bipartisan support. But this week’s markup shows that there are still fractures in both the Republican and Democratic caucuses, signaling that the measures aren’t out of hot water yet and could still fail when they come up for an (undetermined) final vote on the House floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tiKCqe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OKAY, BUT WHAT DO THE BILLS SAY?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XJaARL"&gt;Lawmakers started off with some of the less controversial measures. At the top, they approved a bill that would update filing fees for mergers for the first time in nearly two decades. The bill, called the&lt;strong&gt; Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act&lt;/strong&gt;, would give the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission more money to take on antitrust cases against tech giants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t84Dh7"&gt;Another bill, called the &lt;strong&gt;State Antitrust Enforcement Venue Act&lt;/strong&gt;, was also approved favorably and heads to the House floor for a final vote. If it passes, the bill would make sure state attorneys general who file federal antitrust cases against a company like Facebook would be able to have that case heard in the court they select. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lhCIOt"&gt;Things got a lot testier once the committee reached the third bill, the&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ACCESS Act&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;— especially among Democrats representing California, the home of Silicon Valley. The bill outlines new standards for data portability and interoperability. Democrats like Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) and Republicans like Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) argued that the bill could make it easier for American companies to transfer user data to Chinese ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P7kVtd"&gt;The bill was later approved, but Democrats, like Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA), promised that their decision to push the bill through committee didn’t mean that they will vote for it later on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QSSDcR"&gt;Early Thursday morning, lawmakers moved on to the &lt;strong&gt;Platform Competition and Opportunity Act&lt;/strong&gt;. The measure would bar large tech platforms from buying up nascent competitors — think &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/04/09/facebook-to-acquire-instagram-for-1-billion/"&gt;Facebook buying Instagram&lt;/a&gt; in 2012. After hours of debate, it was approved, but with three California Democrats voting against the measure. Before ending at 5AM Thursday, lawmakers also approved the &lt;strong&gt;American Choice and Innovation Act&lt;/strong&gt;, a nondiscrimination measure&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;that bars companies like Google from giving preference to their own products on their own services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ARuElC"&gt;Finally, the &lt;strong&gt;Ending Platform Monopolies Act&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;made its way out of the committee. It would force large companies like Amazon to sell off different lines of business that conflict with one another. The bill eliminates the ability of large platforms to use the control they have in different lines of business to hurt competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dSH9bK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Vh0XpL"&gt;Well, they’re headed to the House floor! There will be over 400 lawmakers voting on these bills instead of the couple dozen who marked them up over the last couple hours. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) seems eager to approve these measures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jRlpOt"&gt;At a press conference Thursday, Pelosi told reporters, “There has been concern on both sides of the aisle about the consolidation of power of the tech companies and this legislation is an attempt to address that.” She continued, “We are not going to ignore the consolidation that has happened and the concern that exists on both sides of the aisle.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YsfjBk"&gt;Of the six bills, the merger filing fee measure is the only one headed into conference where House and Senate lawmakers will tinker with the language before it lands on President Biden’s desk. The other five will also need to be introduced in the Senate, move through the committee process, and reach at least 60 votes on the floor, so long as the filibuster stays in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="avDra4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senator-says-working-companion-bills-house-antitrust-measures-2021-06-15/"&gt;Earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) said she would be introducing companion legislation for some of those measures in the Senate. As of publication, it’s unclear when those bills will be introduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4pzuHl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 6/24/21 at 3:12 PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clarified that Klobuchar plans to introduce some companion bills, but hasn’t specified exactly which ones. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lu3S9J"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
