    <title>Oman blocks Clubhouse for not having a permit, but activists suggest it may be censorship</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9h0BVP"&gt;The middle eastern country of Oman has blocked the Clubhouse voice chat app saying it lacked the proper permit to operate, as some activists raised concerns that it was an act of censorship, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oman-clubhouse/oman-blocks-audio-app-clubhouse-citing-lack-of-permit-but-some-fear-censorship-idUSKBN2B607V"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3S34sY"&gt;The Omani Telecommunications Regulatory Authority &lt;a href="https://wafoman.com/2021/03/14/oman-bans-clubhouse/?lang=en"&gt;told news site WAF&lt;/a&gt; that communications applications operating in the country must get a permit from the authority. According to WAF, Oman “prohibits the use of several encrypted VoIP applications without an official license.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rymfBs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ochroman.org/eng/category/updates/"&gt;The Omani Association for Human Rights&lt;/a&gt; said in a statement that Oman’s government views “the authoritarian government of China as a role model,” and has banned the app even though it’s used by many Omanis “as a space to express their opinions freely without government censorship.” &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/08/world/asia/china-clubhouse-blocked.html"&gt;China blocked access to Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt; in February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T1iukQ"&gt;The popular app, which is currently invite-only and only available on iOS, has grown in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21325678/venture-capitalists-vc-media-silicon-valley-clubhouse-tech-journalists"&gt;popularity among the Silicon Valley&lt;/a&gt; crowd, many of whom are not shy about speaking their opinions to a listening audience. It’s been criticized for a lack of robust moderation tools, which as led to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21495419/clubhouse-conversation-antisemitism-content-moderation"&gt;some anti-Semitic rhetoric&lt;/a&gt; and COVID-19 misinformation spreading on the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XyrgCz"&gt;However, after barely a year in existence, Clubhouse recently did a funding round where it was &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/clubhouse-gets-investment-interest-at-1-billion-valuation"&gt;valued at $1 billion&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2SeQ3E"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTQRGT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Free streaming platform Tubi reportedly getting into original programming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wew5vdATk2Inza4LZPnvVRvMLJw=/78x0:923x563/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68961615/tubi.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kLe56r"&gt;Free streaming platform Tubi has plans to branch out into original programming, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-13/fox-s-tubi-made-millions-with-reruns-now-it-wants-original-programming?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, citing sources familiar with the company’s plans. The streamer will likely start with original movies, but is also exploring episodic TV shows, and is speaking with potential advertisers about partnerships, the report states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xpiz8q"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21184294/fox-tubi-acquisition-streaming-wars-news-sports-xumi-comcast-pluto-viacomcbs"&gt;Fox Corp. acquired Tubi for $440 million&lt;/a&gt; last March, in an attempt to get in on the streaming wars. Before the acquisition, Fox didn’t have its own streaming offering. Fox said at the time it planned to offer a large number of its older shows and movies to Tubi subscribers for free, as well as some sports programming. There was no talk at that time of Tubi creating original content to try to compete with the likes of established, paid streaming platforms like Netflix and Hulu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CksVL0"&gt;But Fox Corp. CFO Steve &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tubi-ad-revenues-to-eclipse-broadcast-entertainment-network-fox-corp-cfo-predicts"&gt;Tomsic said during an investors’ conference&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week that while the company would eventually create original content for Tubi, any shows or movies would be “cheap and cheerful,” not the big-budget offerings of larger streamers. “I stress it’s going to be cost-effective,” Tomsic said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q5jO90"&gt;Fox expects Tubi to generate $300 million in ad revenue in the current fiscal year, Tomsic predicted. &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fox-expects-tubi-revenues-to-surpass-broadcast-networks-2020-12"&gt;Tubi reported 33 million active users&lt;/a&gt; in December, a 65 percent increase from the year prior. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Judge rules Google has to face lawsuit that claims it tracks users even in Incognito mode</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p5o_us9NdLAuJewvyDvWAx4PaTI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68961348/acastro_191014_1777_google_pixel_0005.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XNNOGb"&gt;A judge in California ruled Friday that Google has to face a class action lawsuit that claims the search giant secretly collects data from  users even when they’re using its private “Incognito” mode, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-13/google-must-face-suit-over-snooping-on-incognito-browsing?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DUaFgd"&gt;Three users &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-google-privacy-lawsuit/google-is-sued-in-u-s-for-tracking-users-private-internet-browsing-idUSKBN23933H"&gt;filed a complaint last June&lt;/a&gt; alleging Google has a “pervasive data tracking business,” and its tracking persists even if users take steps to protect their private information, such as using incognito mode in Chrome, or private browsing in Safari and other browsers. The lawsuit seeks at least $5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X3aH3m"&gt;Google had sought to have the case thrown out, but US District Judge Lucy Koh wrote in her ruling that the company “did not notify users that Google engages in the alleged data collection while the user is in private browsing mode.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lrQ10Q"&gt;The company said in a court filing that it makes clear to users “that ‘Incognito’ does not mean ‘invisible,’ and that the user’s activity during that session may be visible to websites they visit, and any third-party analytics or ads services the visited websites use.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n6XYnT"&gt;Google spokesperson José Castañeda said in an email to The Verge on Saturday that the company disputes the lawsuit’s claims “and we will defend ourselves vigorously against them.”  He added that Chrome’s Incognito mode gives users the choice to browse the internet without activity being saved to their browser or devices. “As we clearly state each time you open a new incognito tab, websites might be able to collect information about your browsing activity during your session.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JMYBaN"&gt;Google said earlier this year it is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21064698/google-third-party-cookies-chrome-two-years-privacy-safari-firefox"&gt;phasing out third-party tracking cookies&lt;/a&gt;, and says it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22310332/google-privacy-replacing-third-party-cookies-privacy-sandbox"&gt;doesn’t plan to replace&lt;/a&gt; the cookies with something that may be as invasive even though it will affect the company’s advertising business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aedbjt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 13th, 4:39PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Adds statement from Google spokesperson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go watch this drone video that will really make you miss movie theaters</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bHTaYzR8zpUHCdbrfkDeFADtHoY=/141x0:1119x652/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68960985/box_office.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mTWZf2"&gt;Last week everyone was fixated on the “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22321576/fpv-drone-footage-short-film-bowling-alley-bryant-lake-bowl"&gt;Right Up Our Alley&lt;/a&gt;” drone video that made us all nostalgic for bowling alleys. On Friday night, a VP at drone company DJI &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dronelaws/status/1370550353922506754"&gt;tweeted this video&lt;/a&gt; of a drone flight through a mostly-empty movie theater in Minnesota, and I don’t know about you but I really miss going to the movies. This video makes that longing about 100 times worse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GJTc9F"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4bVh_XfxQoU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TOLEe0"&gt;According to its YouTube page the video is by SkyCandy, and is a one-take fly-through of Mann theaters’ Plymouth Grand in Plymouth, Minnesota. It was filmed using a DJI Air Unit and Rotor Riot Cinewhoop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2KBzEc"&gt;The video is just over a minute long, but the drone takes us through the lobby — after being welcomed through the front doors by a masked theater employee— where people are deciding what to see, and buying tickets “for the 7:30 show,” according to the audio. There’s some very familiar-sounding background music playing in the lobby portion that I couldn’t quite identify, but it felt exactly right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s92Dwx"&gt;Next we fly by the concession stand where a couple snags a bucket of that overpriced movie popcorn, then we spin past the bar where we can overhear the bartender telling his patron, “you name it, I’ve seen it,” before heading down a long hallway into one of the actual theaters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oqKSGw"&gt;There are so many empty seats in that theater it actually felt a little sad— but then we briefly hear a familiar pre-movie sound: someone forgot to mute their iPhone. Rude! But funny. We end up looking at and then flying “into” the movie screen where guess what’s playing (I thought for one second it might be &lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt;, but no): The beginning of the video we’ve been watching. Wild!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gaXKDE"&gt;For those of us who haven’t been to a movie theater since social distancing started last year, this video is a welcome, wistful reminder of the joys of seeing a film on the big screen. One more thing to put on the “things I’m going to do when everything gets back to normal,” which hopefully will be sooner rather than later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2jihMC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8N1pqw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imiHzX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla reportedly had 450 cases of coronavirus at its California plant after reopening last May</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hHuoMYhs0BUTxVTk1zWpQvRhfnc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68960784/acastro_180430_1777_tesla_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RhCGB7"&gt;After it reopened in defiance of health department orders last May, Tesla’s plant in Fremont, California saw 450 cases of COVID-19 through December 2020, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlainSite/status/1370549174731608064?s=20"&gt;new data&lt;/a&gt; from legal website PlainSite shows (via &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/12/hundreds-covid-cases-reported-tesla-plant-following-musks-defiant-reopening-county-data-shows/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1LISs"&gt;Last March public health officials in Alameda County, where the Fremont plant is located, restricted all but “essential” businesses from remaining open as coronavirus cases surged across the country. Tesla fought the order but eventually shut down the plant on March 23rd. But a few days later, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/11/21254871/tesla-fremont-shutdown-factory-production-model-3-y-elon-musk"&gt;Tesla restarted production&lt;/a&gt; at the Fremont plant, even though it was in violation of the public health order. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Twitter at the time that he planned to be on the factory floor with Fremont workers and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/11/21255149/elon-musk-tesla-fremont-factory-reopen-order-arrest-alameda"&gt;taunted local officials to arrest him&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ruvY9U"&gt;Tesla’s reopening plan was later approved, even though it was already open in defiance of the March orders. Musk, a vocal critic of last year’s coronavirus shelter-in-place orders, threatened to move the Fremont factory out of California. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/9/21253127/elon-musk-lawsuit-alameda-coronavirus-tesla-fremont-lockdown"&gt;Tesla filed a lawsuit &lt;/a&gt;against Alameda County over the shutdown order on May 9th of last year, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/20/21265358/tesla-drops-lawsuit-alameda-county-coroanvirus-lockdown"&gt;dropped the suit&lt;/a&gt; less than two weeks later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="geW1uE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Post&lt;/em&gt; reports that the documents obtained by PlainSite show Tesla had around a dozen reports of COVID-19 cases in May 2020 and the numbers continued to rise through December, a month that saw 125 new cases of the virus at the plant. Tesla employs about 10,000 people at the Fremont facility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xgBugd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p9hm2h"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Judge blocks US restrictions against Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Xiaomi Mi 10S Sold In China" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pu3eYHFuFKn7fSADWl94FqJFiR0=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68960644/1306428552.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0Pl6iD"&gt;A federal judge has blocked the US Department of Defense from placing restrictions on Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi that were set to take effect next week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sqfzOu"&gt;Just before former President Trump left office in January, the DoD &lt;a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2472464/dod-releases-list-of-additional-companies-in-accordance-with-section-1237-of-fy/"&gt;designated Xiaomi&lt;/a&gt; as a “Chinese Communist military company,” (CCMC) making it subject to Trump’s executive order banning the US from investing in such companies. But late Friday, U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22367849/xiaomi_v_us_dept_of_defense.pdf"&gt;issued a preliminary injunction&lt;/a&gt; to prevent what he called “irreparable harm” to Xiaomi, saying the designation was “arbitrary and capricious.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2pNef0"&gt; Xiaomi said in court filings it would suffer “extreme and irreversible damage” to its business and reputation if the restrictions took effect, and has maintained it operates “in compliance with the relevant laws and regulations of jurisdictions where it conducts its businesses.” A company spokesperson&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22231786/trump-administration-blacklists-xiaomi-communist-chinese-military-company"&gt; told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in January&lt;/a&gt; that Xiaomi “is not owned, controlled or affiliated with the Chinese military, and is not a ‘Communist Chinese Military Company.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hS362H"&gt;In his Friday ruling, Contreras called into question the Trump administration’s argument that “civilian Chinese companies” like Xiaomi allow the Chinese government to “directly threaten the United States homeland.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="15WdSY"&gt;“The court is somewhat skeptical that weighty national security interests are actually implicated here,” the judge wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a2Xcj7"&gt;Xiaomi &lt;a href="https://equalocean.com/briefing/20210313230031405"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt; that it will continue to request that the CCMC designation be permanently removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="82hWAm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lycPoK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Some research has gotten a huge boost during the pandemic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DQrgXval60e6gF2J3e-ZzyDRjDU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68960376/acastro_201217_1777_vaccine_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CoxvEf"&gt;Billions of dollars have been spent fighting the pandemic, with a &lt;a href="https://time.com/5921360/operation-warp-speed-vaccine-spending/"&gt;huge proportion&lt;/a&gt; of that money going towards vaccine development. Other areas of research have also gotten a big boost during the pandemic — and the results could make a huge difference to public health in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n054W9"&gt;Here are some of the big winners in the pandemic-inspired funding race.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ca2yNz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;mRNA Vaccines — &lt;/strong&gt;The astounding success of both the Pfizer / BioNtech and Moderna vaccines has set the stage for the development of other highly-customizable vaccines in the future. The beauty of the vaccines is that they are basically blueprints — they use a genetic code to tell the body to build tiny molecular targets. The body’s immune system then goes to town on target practice and builds up immunity so that if a real threat — like the coronavirus — shows up, it can quickly respond. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="PBCVyy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zXws8z"&gt;Researchers have been &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/for-billion-dollar-covid-vaccines-basic-government-funded-science-laid-the-groundwork/"&gt;working on the basic science&lt;/a&gt; around mRNA vaccines &lt;a href="https://cen.acs.org/business/start-ups/mRNA-disrupt-drug-industry/96/i35"&gt;for years&lt;/a&gt;, but haven’t been able to get a truly big break until now. They were getting funding, but remained in the shadow of the “&lt;a href="http://geroscience.com/biotech-valley-of-death/"&gt;biotech valley of death&lt;/a&gt;” — the gap between a research discovery and commercialization. Now that they’ve proven themselves in clinical trials, and been used to vaccinate millions of people — suddenly they are poised for a massive boom. With production ramping up, researchers see hope for diseases including &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/05/1017366/messenger-rna-vaccines-covid-hiv/"&gt;HIV and sickle-cell anemia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LBZ9Db"&gt;Their success is a big win for drug companies (&lt;a href="https://www.labiotech.eu/trends-news/covid-19-vaccine-biontech-pfizer/"&gt;and the stock market&lt;/a&gt;) but also for researchers and smaller suppliers. Specialty biotech companies that produce the nanoparticles which hold the vaccines’ genetic material have been booming, with some &lt;a href="https://cen.acs.org/business/outsourcing/Lipids-unsung-COVID-19-vaccine/99/web/2021/02"&gt;increasing their production 50-fold&lt;/a&gt;. The authorizations, great clinical trial results, and investments in this kind of manufacturing might mean that we see more mRNA vaccines in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9FTVX2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid molecular testing — &lt;/strong&gt;Before COVID-19 a handful of companies were working on diagnostic tests for flu, sexually transmitted diseases, a boatload of other ailments. These quick, easy tests could look for the genetic material of a virus in patient samples without needing a slow trip to the lab. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DbKayo"&gt;When these companies started seeing the reports of this new virus, many of them pivoted. Their tests could detect viruses — why not train them to detect &lt;em&gt;this &lt;/em&gt;virus? Suddenly, they went from being an academic exercise (also languishing in the valley of death) to investors pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into their technology. These rapid tests could make it easier to diagnose diseases in the future. For more on the boom in rapid molecular testing, read my colleague &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323268/covid-rapid-testing-pandemic-home-disease-pcr"&gt;Nicole Wetsman’s excellent story from this week&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0yo8Ri"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long COVID — &lt;/strong&gt;This one’s a little different from the others, but it’s also a notable new area of research that’s emerged during the pandemic. A few weeks ago, the National Institutes of Health announced a new &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/who-we-are/nih-director/statements/nih-launches-new-initiative-study-long-covid"&gt;$1.15 billion commitment&lt;/a&gt; to research “long COVID.” Some people who get infected with the virus end up having symptoms that persist for months — and researchers still don’t know why. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ajz4Zf"&gt;The four-year initiative will help drive research into why this happens, who is affected, and what the long-lasting effects are, among other questions. It’s a big boost for people who suffer from long COVID and other diseases with extended recovery times — whether they’re viral or not. These kinds of symptoms are often overlooked, but, as Julia Belluz &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22298751/long-term-side-effects-covid-19-hauler-symptoms"&gt;points out at &lt;em&gt;Vox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;they definitely aren’t unique to COVID. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9oduZZ"&gt;All of this money allowed scientists to start grappling with a new, emerging threat. The millions, and in some cases, billions of dollars have allowed new technologies to prove themselves. These are investments that have the potential to change how we look at older diseases that have been with us for ages, in addition to newer, emerging threats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MYrtcN"&gt;The question now is how we move that urgency and funding into medicine more broadly, after this particular pandemic has passed us by. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gkcnBi"&gt;Here’s what else happened this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Y8RUUO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

Here’s how it works. (Russell Brandom / &lt;em&gt;The Verge)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9njtoN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-56357760"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oxford-AstraZeneca: EU says ‘no indication’ vaccine linked to clots&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;A number of countries suspended use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines over fears that it might be linked to blood clots. But soon after, the EU regulator said there was no indication that the shots were linked to clots. (&lt;em&gt;BBC&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="fS5ry4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perspectives: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="E78KUD"&gt;On March 10th, I took a selfie with a woman who had fallen asleep on me during my commute home. I joked that “social distancing in NYC is going great!” The next day, I showed up to the office and only a handful of my colleagues were in, but all of the snacks were gone. I had a few bags of chips stowed away at my desk, and I used chopsticks to eat them because I was afraid of touching my mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Ubwp7A"&gt;— &lt;em&gt;Verge Science&lt;/em&gt;’s own Cory Zapatka remembers a year ago this week, when the pandemic was officially declared. He and other &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325333/covid-pandemic-one-year-later-march-pandemic"&gt;shared their memories from the start of the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="qM8Udm"&gt;“They don’t say, ‘Yes, I ended up here because of the coronavirus...But what they tell you about is a chaotic world, of ‘Yes, I’m not doing my activities any more,’ ‘I’m no longer doing my music,’ ‘Going to school is hard in the mornings,’ ‘I am having difficulty waking up,’ ‘I am fed up with the mask.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="llYl9o"&gt;— Dr. Richard Delorme tells the &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt; about the children he treats at a pediatric hospital in France. There has been a&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/global-rise-childhood-mental-health-pandemic-8392ceff77ac8e1e0f90a32214e7def1"&gt; global rise in mental health issues in children during this pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lsFaWW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More than numbers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="AZr4eK"&gt;To the more than 118,910,684 people worldwide who have tested positive, may your road to recovery be smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9BCPyO"&gt;To the families and friends of the 2,641,844 people who have died worldwide — 532,593 of those in the US — your loved ones are not forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hISxaz"&gt;Stay safe, everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CXrpMv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction 3/13/2021 11:00AM: &lt;/strong&gt;A &lt;em&gt;previous version of this article misstated the global death toll. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;More than 2,641,844&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; people have died worldwide, not 118,910,684. We regret the error. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google will now let third party developers create custom Tiles for Wear OS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DoGUz9xcyyxUuI4gyPJm9LR_22w=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68960330/Tiles_alpaha_layout2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Wear OS Tiles give users a quick-glance option | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/03/creating-custom-tiles-on-wear-os-by-google-with-jetpack-tiles.html" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YIs6bu"&gt;Google says in a &lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/03/creating-custom-tiles-on-wear-os-by-google-with-jetpack-tiles.html"&gt;new blog post&lt;/a&gt; that it will now allow third-party developers to create custom Tiles for Wear OS. It first introduced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525335/google-wear-os-tiles-widgets-new-feature-announced"&gt;Tiles in 2019,&lt;/a&gt;  widgets that users could glance at and swipe among to get information about weather, calendar notifications, or stats like heart rate. All of the Tiles used to be directly from Google or the device’s manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/75Ts-byERo_AXi4jTL3r8sGxTQc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16204391/tilesbetter.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gyl0HI"&gt;Its &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/training/articles/wear-tiles"&gt;Jetpack Tiles library&lt;/a&gt; for third-party developers is now in alpha. Google notes in the blog post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="w0l2vs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tiles can be designed for many use cases, like tracking the user’s daily activity progress, quick-starting a workout, starting a recently played song, or sending a message to a favorite contact. While apps can be immersive, Tiles are fast-loading and focus on the user’s immediate needs. If the user would like more information, Tiles can be tapped to open a related app on the watch or phone for a deeper experience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="yJ4Vj3"&gt;Wear OS has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21518580/youtube-music-apple-watch-app-wear-os-wearable-problems"&gt;in limbo for a while&lt;/a&gt;, with small &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366514/google-wear-os-fall-update-smartwatch-faster-apps-weather-pairing"&gt;updates&lt;/a&gt; coming here and there, but without a clear path for its future. In the latest blog post, the company says the new custom Tiles “will become available to users later this spring when we roll out the corresponding Wear OS platform update.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia brings its latency-reducing tech Reflex to Overwatch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Overwatch" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KrOYPd26kfdpNpDr3IknEjYCCFA=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68960298/25458587816_f6f5f221a7_o.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5SeWhC"&gt;An update to &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;’s Public Test Region (PTR) &lt;a href="https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/news/patch-notes/ptr"&gt;is bringing Nvida’s latency-reduction tech&lt;/a&gt;, called Reflex, to the popular esports title (&lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/overwatch-nvidia-reflex-191142647-211647638.html"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;. The tech aims to help reduce the amount of time between when you click your mouse, and when you see the resulting action on screen, making the game feel more responsive. The fact that it’s coming to &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fnvidia-reflex-overwatch-rainbow-six-siege%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F13%2F22328366%2Foverwatch-latency-reduction-nvidia-reflex-beta" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;was announced back in January&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s now available to players who can access the PTR, and who have the latest Nvidia drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a2PdqH"&gt;If you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227040/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-3070-3060-ti-3090-rx-6800-xt"&gt;haven’t been able to get your hands on one of Nvidia’s latest graphics cards&lt;/a&gt;, there’s still hope that you’ll be able to try Reflex out for yourself in &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; — the tech was announced alongside the 30-series graphics cards, but works on cards going back to the GTX 900-series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4TtTOU"&gt;Nvidia has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Freflex-low-latency-platform%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F13%2F22328366%2Foverwatch-latency-reduction-nvidia-reflex-beta" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an incredibly in-depth explainer&lt;/a&gt; on how the tech works, but the very surface-level overview is that the game will work with your GPU to make sure that frames are made “just-in-time” to be shown on your monitor, so you should theoretically always be seeing the latest information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wTGcqD"&gt;It’s worth noting that latency can have a few meanings, especially when it comes to online games. Reflex isn’t designed to help improve your &lt;em&gt;network&lt;/em&gt; latency, so if you’ve got a bad internet connection it probably won’t help improve your gaming experience all that much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ADuUkU"&gt;Whether the difference in latency will be noticeable will depend a lot on the type of equipment you’re using, how much better it is, and how eagle-eyed you are. Still, if you’re one of the testers, it’s probably worth turning it on to try it out, and seeing if you notice the improvement. For everyone else, it’s something to look forward to trying out in a future update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PWs3yV"&gt;AMD also has a feature meant to reduce input latency on its graphics cards, &lt;a href="https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/radeon-software-anti-lag"&gt;called Radeon Anti-Lag&lt;/a&gt;, which can also be turned on for Overwatch. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon ordered to temporarily close facility near Toronto due to increase in COVID-19 cases</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WIogwneTwhlOxTXEKcYNplXRnbc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68960278/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CC6ekW"&gt;A public health authority has ordered Amazon to close one of its fulfillment centers in Canada for two weeks because of an uptick in the rate of COVID-19 infections at the facility. A public health investigation found that while the rate of COVID-19 infections has been decreasing in the area, the rate inside the Brampton facility, near Toronto, “has been increasing significantly.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sn15AD"&gt;Dr. Lawrence C. Loh, the medical officer of health for the Peel region where the facility is located,  said the temporary closure was necessary to help stop the spread of the virus. “This Amazon facility is in a vulnerable community and employs thousands of people. Immediate action must be taken to protect these essential workers and the community where they live,” &lt;a href="https://peelregion.ca/news/archiveitem.asp?year=2021&amp;amp;month=2&amp;amp;day=12&amp;amp;file=2021212.xml"&gt;Loh said in a statement.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IcG1lQ"&gt;In an email to The Verge on Saturday, Amazon spokesperson Dave Bauer said the company doesn’t believe the data supports the closure, and that it plans to appeal the decision. Bauer says Amazon has required regular testing of employees at the Brampton plant, and the most recent round of tests found “little risk of spread” within the facility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WQtZL5"&gt;“Nothing’s more important than the health and safety of our employees and the communities we serve,” Bauer said in the email. “This closure may have some short-term impact on our Canadian customers, but we will work to recover as quickly as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TF9Ym5"&gt;Employees at the Brampton facility are required to self-isolate until March 27th under the order, unless they tested positive for the virus in the past 90 days and have already self-quarantined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v4Zyb0"&gt;Last March, Kentucky’s governor &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-26/amazon-says-kentucky-governor-ordered-idling-of-returns-facility?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;ordered an Amazon warehouse&lt;/a&gt; in that state closed following an outbreak, and Amazon temporarily &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/20/amazon-closes-new-jersey-warehouse-after-covid-19-infections.html"&gt;closed one of its warehouses in New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; back in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mGxXpG"&gt;However, throughout the coronavirus pandemic Amazon has continued to operate most of its warehouses and other facilities even when there were outbreaks of the virus. More than 19,000 of its front line workers had tested positive for the virus as of October, according to &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/update-on-covid-19-testing"&gt;Amazon’s own figures&lt;/a&gt;, and workers have complained they often learned about outbreaks at their workplaces from external sources, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/lack-oversight-transparency-leave-amazon-employees-dark-covid-19-n1241549"&gt;not from the company directly&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QyqCIo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 13th, 12:47PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added statement from Amazon spokesperson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
