    <title>An Amazon server outage caused problems for Alexa, Ring, Disney Plus, and deliveries</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HsxliB"&gt;Problems with some Amazon Web Services cloud servers are causing slow loading or failures for significant chunks of the internet. Amazon’s widespread network of data centers powers many of the things you interact with online, including this website, so as we’ve seen in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/25/21719396/amazon-web-services-aws-outage-down-internet"&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; AWS &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/28/14765042/amazon-s3-outage-causing-trouble"&gt;outage incidents&lt;/a&gt;, any problem has massive rippling effects. People started noticing problems at around 10:45AM ET, and just after 6PM ET the AWS Status showed “Many services have already recovered, however we are working towards full recovery across services.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="lI8pyl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon’s internal apps went down, too, cutting off some delivery drivers and stalling warehouse robots&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yicS6U"&gt;While some affected services that rely on AWS have been restored, the internet is still a bit slower and more unsteady than usual. The most important app impacted by the outage might be the ones that Amazon employees use. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/07/amazon-web-services-outage-causes-issues-at-disney-netflix-coinbase.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt; points out Reddit posts from Amazon Flex, warehouse, and delivery workers who say &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822736/amazon-delivery-van-atoz-app-warehouse-outage-aws"&gt;the apps that keep track of packages, tell them where to go, and generally keep your items on time went down, too&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yLyUbN"&gt;There have been reports of outages for Disney Plus and Netflix streaming, as well as games like &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Valorant.&lt;/em&gt; We also noticed some problems accessing &lt;a href="http://Amazon.com"&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt; and other Amazon products like the Alexa AI assistant, Kindle ebooks, Amazon Music, and security cameras from Ring or Wyze. The &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/"&gt;DownDetector&lt;/a&gt; list of services with simultaneous spikes in their outage reports runs off nearly any recognizable name: Tinder, Roku, Coinbase, both Cash App and Venmo, and the list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hERNiN"&gt;There were &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29473630"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/rb226w/aws_outage/"&gt;network admins&lt;/a&gt; everywhere about errors connecting to Amazon’s instances and the AWS Management Console that controls their access to the servers. After about an hour of problems, Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://status.aws.amazon.com/"&gt;official status page&lt;/a&gt; added an update with messages confirming the outage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="KjgLO8"&gt;[11:26 AM PST] We are seeing impact to multiple AWS APIs in the US-EAST-1 Region. This issue is also affecting some of our monitoring and incident response tooling, which is delaying our ability to provide updates. Services impacted include: EC2, Connect, DynamoDB, Glue, Athena, Timestream, and Chime and other AWS Services in US-EAST-1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYGg42"&gt;The root cause of this issue is an impairment of several network devices in the US-EAST-1 Region. We are pursuing multiple mitigation paths in parallel, and have seen some signs of recovery, but we do not have an ETA for full recovery at this time. Root logins for consoles in all AWS regions are affected by this issue, however customers can login to consoles other than US-EAST-1 by using an IAM role for authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xyKq2j"&gt;With the problems coming from the US-EAST-1 AWS region in Virginia, users elsewhere may not have seen as many issues, and even if you were affected, it could manifest as slightly slower loading while the network rerouted your requests somewhere else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vlT80z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 7th, 3:41PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information about impacts for warehouse and delivery workers, and most recent status message.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A6l0P7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 7th, 7:20PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information about impacts for warehouse and delivery workers, and most recent status message.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft rolls out Notepad with dark mode for Windows 11 Insiders</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3Y9IMJA21J8zOF92R5iRMZ9dNps=/0x0:1419x946/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70242234/NotepadDarkFindReplace.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LDDPta"&gt;Microsoft is testing &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/12/07/redesigned-notepad-for-windows-11-begins-rolling-out-to-windows-insiders/"&gt;a redesign of its venerable Notepad app&lt;/a&gt;, adding some welcomed modern features like a dark mode, a better search / find and replace interface, better undoing, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KO7btm"&gt;While the visual updates like the addition of dark mode, updated right-click menu, and Windows’ &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/style/mica"&gt;new theme-adopting material&lt;/a&gt; are nice, the functional updates will probably be the biggest upgrade to anyone who actually writes in Notepad. In the current version of the app that ships with Windows 11, the text search tool and the find and replace tool are two different pop-up windows, accessed by two different keyboard shortcuts. The redesign combines them into one floating bar instead of something that looks like it’s from the XP era. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BdlH6lCr_XVOR8G-ZezEfL-WBP0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23071497/Find_replace.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Find and Replace still has some quirks in the preview (like not automatically wrapping), but it’s definitely a more modern experience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CzaOyx"&gt;Microsoft also says it’s adding multi-step undo, which replaces the old version’s undo system that only lets you go back one step. It still doesn’t work like you might expect a modern app to, letting you hit Ctrl-Z to delete one word at a time, but it clearly has more memory than the old version of Notepad.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RIK8daT8NqQRC0Oy5gJwH7mqUKM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23071477/Untitled_Project.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notepad’s new undo system is an improvement, but it’d be hard to call it modern.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mglB2w"&gt;Another unfortunate thing about the preview is that Word Wrap is still off by default. It’s got a new home in the View menu, though — and with the Font button going to the Edit dropdown, the old Notepad’s “Format” menu is no more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yV94Sq"&gt;It seems like Microsoft is focused on smaller updates to make Notepad feel less like a relic, rather than stuffing it full of new features and turning it into an entirely different app. That seems like the right move to me, given the existence of Notepads’ perhaps &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPad"&gt;lesser-known sibling WordPad&lt;/a&gt;, which is closer to Microsoft Word than a plaintext editor. (WordPad also lets you view and edit .docx files, unlike even the new version of NotePad.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4EjpyF"&gt;The Notepad redesign should be available for Windows 11 Insiders using the Dev channel. If you’re running the test version of the OS and don’t see it, you may want to check for an update in the Microsoft Store. Everyone else will likely have to wait a little bit to get it, but it’s nice to see Microsoft continue the trend of updating some of its built-in apps like Notepad, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679132/microsoft-windows-11-new-photos-app-design-features"&gt;Photos&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22631442/microsoft-windows-11-paint-redesign-update-app"&gt;Paint&lt;/a&gt; alongside its bigger products like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22814069/microsoft-new-office-ui-rounded-available-now"&gt;Office&lt;/a&gt; and, of course, Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Don’t Look Up is an absurdist mirror of our reality — before it just becomes a regular mirror</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Don’t Look Up" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Co8Akim8LkITKAJXlcw6oL7YtK0=/0x0:7200x4800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70242203/DLU_20201203_02259_R.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Niko Tavernise / Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="w5vFgX"&gt;For a goofy satire about a comet destroying the planet, &lt;em&gt;Don’t Look Up&lt;/em&gt; sure takes you on an emotional journey. The film — helmed by writer and director Adam McKay, best-known for movies like &lt;em&gt;Step Brothers&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Anchorman&lt;/em&gt; — starts out hilarious, with big-name stars trading one-liners amid an impending apocalypse. But over its lengthy runtime, it slowly morphs into something else. Laughs give way to anger, frustration, and ultimately a kind of desperate hope. It’s a trajectory that serves as an eerie mirror to the last two years of pandemic life — just don’t go in expecting lighthearted fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9P5yh8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don’t Look Up&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t waste any time getting going. It starts out with a pair of Michigan State astronomers, Randall (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Kate (Jennifer Lawrence), discovering a massive comet in the sky that’s somewhere between five and 10 kilometers wide. But the excitement of discovery quickly turns to dread, as the pair realize that it’s on a collision course with Earth, and it will cause an extinction-level event in around six months. They rush to the White House to inform the president, played by Meryl Streep, only to be left waiting for hours as she deals with a much more pressing dilemma involving nude models. What follows is a delightfully goofy exchange, where the president and her chief of staff (Jonah Hill) who is also her self-absorbed son, debate the political ramifications of revealing that everyone is about to die ahead of midterms. “The timing, it’s just atrocious,” the president tells them, while noting that she’ll have her own people — from an Ivy League school, of course — assess things.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Don’t Look Up" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9oow7F4M6ug_Qs0v3yxUFVoCq8w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23069868/DLU_20201204_02846_R.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Niko Tavernise / Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yUtJHt"&gt;It would all be absurd if it didn’t feel so close to reality. What should be the only thing that matters to everyone on the planet — finding a way to avoid the destruction of all life — gets drowned out by election season and, later, a celebrity breakup. Early on, this contrast is played up for laughs; the astronomers struggle to get their message across because no one wants to hear bad news. They go on a talk show where they’re told to keep things light. When Kate (Lawrence) explodes in frustration and tells the hosts that everyone is going to die, she becomes a meme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="paUcW6"&gt;The absurdism that mirrors our own reality a little too neatly is helped along by a tremendous cast. This movie is stacked with talent. I could watch Streep and Hill banter all day long, and Ariana Grande and Kid Cudi are perfectly cast as the on again, off again pop star power couple. Meanwhile, Lawrence does an amazing job of channeling the anger I know I’d be feeling in her position. Other actors do great work with smaller-but-vital roles; Timothée Chalamet as a painfully earnest Twitch streamer / skate punk, Ron Perlman as a definitely racist war hero. Everyone brings it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vbFyXM"&gt;But slowly that good humor gives way and &lt;em&gt;Don’t Look Up&lt;/em&gt; gets uncomfortably real. Once the message gets out there, it becomes polarizing. Randall (DiCaprio) turns into a social media star, a hunky scientist who is the face of the government’s constantly shifting plan to try to deflect the comet, while Kate becomes a pariah because of her realist attitude. A chunk of space rock that will eviscerate life on Earth ends up creating political divides. Some are terrified, others don’t believe it’s even real. While working class voters turn hopeful about the jobs the comet will provide, an evil tech mogul salivates at all of the rare Earth metals it contains. At one point Randall is forced to ask: what’s the point of trillions of dollars if we’re all dead? He’s laughed out of the room.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Don’t Look Up" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w2J96RGsV4lAHZp8-I_4FPoJ8jY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23069873/DLU_20210115_10788_R.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Niko Tavernise / Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oeSaDW"&gt;It’s infuriating watching the population argue instead of work together to ensure their literal survival. Sadly, little of the movie seems far-fetched given… well, the past two years on the real planet Earth. We’ve all seen the divides that come from a true existential crisis during the pandemic, and &lt;em&gt;Don’t Look Up&lt;/em&gt; is an uncanny reflection of that reality. You could call aspects of it goofy or unrealistic, but then again many of us spent the early days of the pandemic learning to bake bread while watching &lt;em&gt;Tiger King&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Don’t Look Up&lt;/em&gt; exaggerates a bit, but it’s not too far off the mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="07fXJJ"&gt;It stretches on perhaps a little too long — the movie clocks in at nearly two and a half hours — but the journey &lt;em&gt;Don’t Look Up&lt;/em&gt; takes viewers on is mesmerizing. I went from laughing at the absurdity of a military general scamming some astronomers out of $20 to being genuinely mad at everyone not only ignoring the obvious but, in some cases, rooting for the damn comet. Toward the end, when the collision becomes impossible to ignore, I just felt bad for everyone involved. &lt;em&gt;Don’t Look Up&lt;/em&gt; has a largely dismal outlook on humanity, but it ends on a surprisingly hopeful note. (You should definitely stick around for the credits where it wraps back around to being hilarious.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uI1CPr"&gt;I’m not sure if the film made me realize anything new about myself or life during the pandemic, but it was certainly cathartic to see it all play out in such dramatic fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GgB3xV"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Don’t Look Up &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is coming to select theaters on December 10th, before hitting Netflix on December 24th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Your LG TV can now play Google Stadia if it’s running webOS 5.0 or later</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b02LlLBhdJos-5sYNWNwxFKmJAg=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70242178/webos_stadia_lg.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t1Sphu"&gt;Have a gamepad handy and a recent LG TV? You can likely now try Google’s Stadia cloud gaming platform — as of today, it’s an app you can download for your television running webOS 5.0 or webOS 6.0 (read: likely 2020 models or later) in any of &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/stadia/answer/9566513?hl=en"&gt;the 22 countries&lt;/a&gt; that Google covers. You’ll find it in the LG app store on your TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bapW7o"&gt;LG promised that both Google Stadia and Nvidia’s rival GeForce Now cloud gaming service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224359/google-stadia-nvidia-geforce-now-lg-tv-2021"&gt;would arrive on its TVs in 2021&lt;/a&gt;, and the company’s made it under the wire — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22790223/geforce-now-lg-tv-webos-beta"&gt;GeForce Now arrived in beta in mid-November&lt;/a&gt;. Previously, most Stadia-supported TVs ran some version of Android TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fUVJoR"&gt;Both Stadia and GeForce Now are free to try with a basic account — though they’re not necessarily equal. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750246/nvidia-geforce-now-rtx-3080-google-stadia-cloud-gaming"&gt;We were blown away by GeForce Now’s new $200-a-year RTX 3080 tier&lt;/a&gt;; I wrote that it leapfrogged Google Stadia. But Nvidia only streams in 4K resolution to its own Shield TV set-top box — not these LG TVs — while Google Stadia will be offering its full “Stadia Pro” tier with 4K streaming resolution, HDR, and 5.1 surround sound to LG TVs as of today. Assuming you pay $10 a month for Stadia Pro, that is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="afx2AR"&gt;We haven’t yet compared Stadia’s “4K” vs. Nvidia’s “1080p” on the same screen, but I’m eager to give that a spin some evening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d88roU"&gt;One possible advantage for Stadia: while GeForce Now requires you to bring your own games (it uses your PC library), Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22747836/google-stadia-cloud-gaming-free-trial-30-minutes"&gt;is currently running free timed trials&lt;/a&gt; of games like &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3jyyu1"&gt;Even if you don’t have a gamepad, you can technically play Stadia on some platforms using your phone’s touchscreen — a spokesperson confirms that Stadia’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425678/google-stadia-controller-bridge-mode-chromecast-google-tv"&gt;bridge mode&lt;/a&gt; has made it to LG TVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="znBWxz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 7:20PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Confirmed that Bridge Mode should work with your phone as a touchscreen controller for Stadia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bdjoec"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Pixel mail-in repairs have allegedly twice resulted in leaked pics and a privacy nightmare</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bcBWgEOXjkthOdLprXGr52IZhPk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70229533/acastro_180130_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1il5Xu"&gt;After game designer and author Jane McGonigal sent her Pixel 5a to Google for repair, someone allegedly took and hacked her device. This is at least the second report in as many weeks from someone claiming they sent a Google phone in for repair, only to have it used to leak their private data and photographs. McGonigal posted a detailed account of the situation on Twitter on Saturday and advised other users not to send their phones in for repair with the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="d7nvn6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Yeah, don't send your Google phone in for warranty repair/replacement. As has happened with others, last night someone used it to log into my gmail, Drive, photos backup email account, dropbox, and I can see from activity logs they opened a bunch of selfies hoping to find nudes&lt;/p&gt;— Jane McGonigal (@avantgame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/avantgame/status/1467192779973398531?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4yzw22"&gt;In October, McGonigal sent her broken phone to an official Pixel repair center in Texas. She tweeted later that Google said it never received the phone, and during the ensuing weeks, she was charged for a replacement device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0LDcrt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The photos they opened were of me in bathing suits, sports bras, form-fitting dresses, and of stitches after surgery”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yVbtpF"&gt;But according to McGonigal, FedEx tracking information shows the device arrived at the facility weeks ago. Late Friday night — a few hours after she says she finally received a refund for the device — someone seems to have used the “missing” phone to clear two-factor authentication checks and log in to several of her accounts, including her Dropbox, Gmail, and Google Drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PpG6P9"&gt;The activity triggered several email security alerts to McGonigal’s backup accounts. However, she speculates that whoever has the phone may have used it to access her backup email addresses and then dumped any security alerts into her spam folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fJj3MV"&gt;“The photos they opened were of me in bathing suits, sports bras, form-fitting dresses, and of stitches after surgery,” McGonigal writes. “They deleted Google security notifications in my backup email accounts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lc3msi"&gt;Google spokesperson Alex Moriconi initially told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company is investigating the issue, but now it appears that the investigation has concluded. “After a thorough investigation, we can say with confidence that the issue impacting the user was not related to the device RMA [Return Merchandise Authorization],” Moriconi said. “We have worked closely with the user to better understand what occurred and how best to secure the account going forward.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vPFtDb"&gt;It’s still unclear whether the device might have been intercepted within the repair facility or while it was in transit, or who has it now. Google’s &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/9004345?hl=en"&gt;official repair instructions&lt;/a&gt; recommend backing up and then erasing a device before sending it in. Still, as Jane McGonigal points out, that’s either hard or impossible, depending on the damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Lv86nA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Pixel Support and Google Security have been extremely helpful today I am happy to report. The best thing to come out of this is there will be added security instructions for people who cannot factory reset their phones due to phone damage. This is good and should help a lot.&lt;/p&gt;— Jane McGonigal (@avantgame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/avantgame/status/1467926809052205057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u7tfp8"&gt;Just two days after McGonigal’s complaint, it looks like she received some assistance from Google. “Pixel Support and Google Security have been extremely helpful today I am happy to report,” she tweeted. McGonigal also notes that in response to her case, Google may start providing additional instructions for users with broken devices who are unable to perform a factory reset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S4lC6n"&gt;The whole situation reminds us of the security concerns whenever we hand over our devices for repair, and unfortunately, such activity has precedent. In June, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522560/apple-repair-multimillion-iphone-nude-photos-privacy-settlement-pegatron"&gt;Apple paid millions to a woman&lt;/a&gt; after repair technicians posted her nude photos to Facebook. Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22787245/apple-iphone-mac-self-service-program-repair-diy"&gt;recently said it would start selling DIY repair kits&lt;/a&gt;, giving users the chance to fix their own phones, or at least have the task done by someone that a user trusts, as opposed to sending it in or dropping it off at an Apple Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fmMRii"&gt;For Pixel phones, &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/10227672?hl=en"&gt;your options for official service&lt;/a&gt; are either via mail-in or, in some countries, local service through an authorized provider. In the US, Google partners with &lt;a href="https://www.ubreakifix.com/"&gt;uBreakiFix&lt;/a&gt; franchises. Whatever phone you have, the options for repairs are still somewhat limited, and you end up having to trust that no one with bad intentions will get their hands on your phone while it’s out of your possession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sSM4TM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 7th, 6:20PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to add a statement from a Google spokesperson regarding an update in the company’s investigation. Also added a December 6th tweet from McGonigal, as well as some extra context about that tweet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Meta Portal now lets you view Facebook Stories hands-free</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C9rh5e6yRf7f5PfiQ_YmmeVw9hE=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70242097/portal_calling_features_new.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jinVUN"&gt;The Meta (formerly Facebook) Portal is getting a number of updates, including one that lets you browse through your Facebook friends’ stories hands-free, as detailed in a post on the &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/12/celebrate-the-holidays-with-portal/"&gt;About Facebook blog&lt;/a&gt;. You can access the feature by saying, “Hey Portal, show me Stories.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8XkPWX"&gt;In addition to Stories, you can now ask the Facebook Assistant to display recent Facebook posts, responses, and photos. Previously, there wasn’t any native support for Facebook, as it was only accessible through a web browser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oAnrAq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Portal will let you take screenshots during Messenger calls by saying, “Hey Portal, take a photo”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4Icvzn"&gt;And while the Portal could always take pictures of you during a call, it never had a feature that let you capture images of your friends or family members on the other side of the screen — something that &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/11/08/facebook-portal-review-ai-makes-video-calls-better/"&gt;Facebook reportedly said&lt;/a&gt; was due to privacy reasons back in 2018. But now, the Portal will let you take screenshots during Messenger calls by saying, “Hey Portal, take a photo.” You can then share the photo through Messenger, just like you would with any other photo or video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DIMNoo"&gt;Meta has also added support for AR effects on both sides of a Messenger call, no matter what device you or your caller is using. In other words, if your caller is using a phone or tablet in place of a Portal, they’ll now be able to see the AR effects that you turn on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZkgBq"&gt;Three new games are coming to the Portal as well, including Quizbee, Sequencer, and Port-a-Pet, all of which are accessible through the Photo Booth app. While Quizbee is essentially a trivia game, Sequencer tests your ability to memorize random number sequences, and Port-a-Pet lets you interact with a virtual pet using verbal commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EMgUQP"&gt;Lastly, Meta has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22684447/facebook-releases-portal-go-plus-video-calling-devices"&gt;followed through on its promise to integrate Microsoft Teams&lt;/a&gt; with Portal, as the video conferencing feature will be available on the device starting December 8th. ESPN, along with ESPN Plus, will also be available on the Portal, Portal Plus, and Portal Go in the US “later this month.” ESPN was previously only available on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20871173/facebook-portal-camera-price-release-date-availability"&gt;Portal TV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jiG15d"&gt;Along with these new features, Meta has slashed the price of its Portal devices, offering its &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Facebook-Portal-Go-Portable-Calling/dp/B09FYH2511?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Portal Go for $149&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Facebook-Portal-Smart-Video-Calling/dp/B07XPLJ9TZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Portal TV for $79&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Facebook-Portal-Calling-Screen-Speakers/dp/B09FYJFP5Y/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Portal Plus for $299&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="v1hXR9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Facebook’s new Portal Go is great for video calls, but not much else","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22732472/facebook-portal-go-10-inch-2021-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Blizzard employee will detail studio’s ‘alcohol-soaked culture’ in press conference</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ThshmO"&gt;Lisa Bloom, the celebrity lawyer who represented Bill O’Reilley’s, Donald Trump’s, and Bill Cosby’s sexual assault accusers, as well as once advising Harvey Weinstein in his sexual assault case, has announced that she will be holding a press conference on behalf of one of the survivors involved in the numerous sexual assault, harassment, and discrimination allegations against Activision Blizzard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nJParL"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I represent a Blizzard employee who alleges she's a victim of sexual harassment. Our press release for our press conference tomorrow at the Irvine headquarters where we will demand accountability for the victims who have been subjected to harassment at the video game company: &lt;a href="https://t.co/0PisZ1Zomr"&gt;pic.twitter.com/0PisZ1Zomr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Lisa Bloom (@LisaBloom) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LisaBloom/status/1468299060826177538?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3h7hdE"&gt;The press conference, announced today in a press release from Bloom’s firm, will take place at Blizzard’s Irvine, California, headquarters and feature a statement from the victim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QuzoeH"&gt;According to the press release, the woman is a current employee at Blizzard Entertainment and will “describe the alcohol-soaked culture of sexual harassment [...] and the retaliation she experienced after she reported the sexual harassment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="letN6Q"&gt;Though numerous people have spoken out about their experiences at the company, this press conference will be the first time a current employee has publicly come forward. The press conference will be streamed at 12PM ET Wednesday, December 8th, on &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/lisabloomesq/"&gt;Lisa Bloom’s Instagram account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>5G now means some flights won’t be able to land when pilots can’t see the runway</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-TELECOMMUNICATION-5G" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P2SmjVL7gqjAmGsnakw9rhoCE4s=/0x0:3890x2593/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70241822/1187777089.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by GEORGE FREY/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Je3AF2"&gt;Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T are hoping &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;new swaths of C-band cellular radio spectrum&lt;/a&gt; will help make the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409675/verizon-att-tmobile-5g-mmwave-c-band"&gt;5G hype&lt;/a&gt; closer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"&gt;to reality&lt;/a&gt;, but the big mid-band 5G rollout may have a side effect. Airplanes rely on radio altimeters to tell how high they are above the ground to safely land when pilots can’t see, and the FAA is now instructing 6,834 of them to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;do that &lt;/em&gt;at certain airports because of 5G interference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wk7L8d"&gt;The FAA ruled on Tuesday that those thousands of US planes (and some helicopters) won’t be able to use many of the guided and automatic landing systems that are designed to work in poor visibility conditions if they’re landing at an airport where there’s deemed to be enough interference that their altimeters aren’t reliable. “Landings during periods of low visibility could be limited due to concerns that the 5G signal could interfere with the accuracy of an airplane’s radio altimeter, without other mitigations in place,” an FAA spokesman tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BIp4pP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“These limitations could prevent dispatch of flights ... and could also result in flight diversions”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ry5ywH"&gt;That likely means flight delays: “These limitations could prevent dispatch of flights to certain locations with low visibility, and could also result in flight diversions,” reads a portion &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-statement-5g"&gt;of the FAA’s written explanation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ThSiaf"&gt;“We are engaged with the wireless operators, as well as our interagency partners, to do everything possible to make sure the mitigations are tailored to prevent disruptions,” an FAA spokesman tells us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOc6AS"&gt;The FAA ruling does give airlines and pilots an out — if they can prove their airplanes have altimeters that are protected or are otherwise not going to be affected by interference. No airline would comment to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on expected delays, nor would the Airlines for America industry group that the airlines pointed us to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BrVvSn"&gt;It’s not yet clear which specific airports might restrict low visibility flight, but you can imagine that they’d likely be in the same places where the carriers are deploying mid-band 5G — with a few exceptions, they’re the United States’ most-populated cities. As of December, &lt;a href="https://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgSAIB.nsf/dc7bd4f27e5f107486257221005f069d/27ffcbb45e6157e9862587810044ad19/%24FILE/AIR-21-18.pdf"&gt;the planned rollouts (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; are in 46 markets designated as Partial Economic Areas (PEAs), including 1-4, 6-10, 12- 19, 21-41, and 43-50. (You can see them all &lt;a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-14-759A2.pdf"&gt;here (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;.) The FAA plans to issue notices for specific airports later.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FphoGu"&gt;Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T did agree to push back the launch of C-band by one month (to January 2022), and also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/24/22801008/verizon-att-midband-5g-c-band-lower-power-six-months"&gt;offered to dial back the power of 5G towers for six months&lt;/a&gt; past that to address concerns. Carriers and their lobbying group, the CTIA, have suggested that there isn’t a valid reason to fear interference, but the FAA has so far not been convinced. Nor was an aviation lobbying group, the Aerospace Industries Association, which sent a letter to the FCC on Monday suggesting that AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon’s proposed power limits don’t go far enough for safety. The FCC, not the FAA, is the entity that regulates wireless interference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KUyLUY"&gt;While C-band 5G and these radio altimeters don’t actually operate in the same band, the bands are close enough that the fear exists. One possible solution is a band filter for those altimeters, but organizations like the Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics (RTCA) &lt;a href="https://www.rtca.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Webinar-QA-11.30.20-1.pdf"&gt;have warned (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; that it might take years to certify them and retrofit all the planes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is testing changes to the way it handles reported tweets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4HJ4fPAeNyTAPCiy1GfKTNzW0D0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70241741/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Twitter is testing a new way to report abusive tweets | Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dXkWQi"&gt;Twitter says it is &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/common-thread/en/topics/stories/2021/twitters-new-reporting-process-centers-on-a-human-first-design"&gt;testing an overhaul&lt;/a&gt; to the process for reporting tweets, which it says will ultimately make it easier for users to alert the company to abusive or suspicious behavior. The approach being tested with a small group of users in the US streamlines the current reporting process so that a person reporting a tweet doesn’t have to choose from a list of pre-selected descriptions of what rule a tweet is violating. Instead, the company says, it will ask the user what happened in a “symptoms-first” approach to gather more complete information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1JrtpE"&gt;The blog post used the example of a patient in an emergency; the doctor doesn’t ask them, “Is your leg broken?” but rather, “Where does it hurt?” instead. Brian Waismeyer, a data scientist on the health user experience team overseeing the new process, said asking someone to identify a specific issue or symptom isn’t an effective way to find out what’s wrong. “If they’re walking in to get help, what they’re going to do well is describe what is happening to them in the moment,” he said of the patient in the broken leg example. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WKqp6QF7eqG-BknEB_sPs6kXNtA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23071195/twitter_report_tweets.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Twitter&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Twitter is testing changes to how it handles reported tweets&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HQjy1h"&gt;“What can be frustrating and complex about reporting is that we enforce based on terms of service violations as defined by the Twitter Rules,” senior Twitter UX manager Renna Al-Yassini said in a statement. “The vast majority of what people are reporting on fall within a much larger gray spectrum that don’t meet the specific criteria of Twitter violations, but they’re still reporting what they are experiencing as deeply problematic and highly upsetting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xdXl18"&gt;Twitter says by shifting the focus to the person reporting the tweet, it hopes to improve the quality of reports it receives; the more first-hand details it can gather, the more precise it can be when deciding how to handle a reported tweet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TE992E"&gt;This is the first time in a while that Twitter has made significant changes to its tweet reporting process, other than adding new reasons to report a tweet, such as for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629097/twitter-misinformation-health-covid19-reporting-feature-white-house"&gt;spreading coronavirus misinformation&lt;/a&gt; and tweeting false information about elections such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/30/21115487/twitter-elections-facebook-youtube-warren-iowa-caucuses"&gt;voter suppression&lt;/a&gt;. In 2019, it gave users the ability to add more details about tweets being reported for sharing personal information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QtIHZh"&gt;Twitter said the new reporting process will be rolled out to a wider audience in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8jzZD4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0SHd8D"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The best laptops for you, from ultraportables to high-powered editing machines&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="iKoE9g"&gt;The best laptop of 2021 can come with a variety of brands, prices, and features. Here, we’ve got the rest of the best laptops, Windows 10 business notebooks, gaming rigs, Chromebooks, laptops for school, and 2-in-1 convertibles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lfv5g0"&gt;Our current pick for the best laptop of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a device that does just about everything right. While it’s certainly not a perfect device, there are no major flaws. It’s a great pick for productivity, browsing, and even light gaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNThzL"&gt;We live in a world where smartphones are ubiquitous, tablets are commonplace, and even smartwatches are a thing that people talk about on the regular. But throughout all of these advances, the humble laptop has persevered — and for good reason. When it comes time to work, whether that's editing photos, writing a lot of emails, composing documents, or staying in touch with colleagues and family, we’re here with our top picks to help you find the best laptop for the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="31HnuI"&gt;It's getting harder to buy a bad laptop, but what separates the best laptop of 2021 from good laptops is how they balance power, efficiency, portability, and comfort. The top laptop should have a fantastic keyboard and trackpad — after all, those are the two biggest reasons you'd choose a laptop over a smartphone or tablet. Its display should be easy on the eyes, bright, and sharp enough that you aren't distracted by jagged edges and visible pixels. It should be powerful enough for most anything short of intensive video editing and advanced gaming. It should be easy to carry around from place to place, and it should be able to last all day without needing to be plugged in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hnoYs"&gt;In our view, the best laptop for budget shoppers is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 13&lt;/a&gt;. For a sub-$1,000 price, it delivers performance on par with much more expensive laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ABV8A"&gt;Our other picks for the best laptops, Chromebooks, and 2-in-1s of 2021 include the Asus ROG Zephyrus G15, the MacBook Pro 16, and the HP Spectre x360 14. Check out the full list of best laptop picks below or our roundup of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"&gt;best gaming laptops&lt;/a&gt;, if you’re looking for a powerful machine that doesn’t sacrifice portability.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple MacBook Air is the best laptop of 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oTToOm"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air (late 2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best laptop of 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="qIDMjX"&gt;The late-2020 MacBook Air, powered by Apple’s M1 processor, is the best laptop you can buy. The base model, which includes 8GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage, starts at $999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYCzY0"&gt;Appearance-wise, this laptop has a lot in common with the Intel-powered MacBook Air that Apple released earlier this year, including the same 2560 x 1600 screen, Touch ID, 720p webcam, fingerprint sensor, and scissor-switch keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iDDWFN"&gt;But the new processor is the star of the show here; it’s fast. In our testing, it handled intense photo- and video-editing workloads better than almost any Intel-powered laptop we’ve tried this year. It was also able to run &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at close-to-playable frame rates, which is quite a feat for integrated graphics. At launch, these apps hadn’t yet been optimized for the M1 processor and were running through Apple’s Rosetta 2 translation layer — but they still worked fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ACwNY3"&gt;And the processing power didn’t even weigh down the battery life: we got between eight and 10 hours of sustained work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XZkaRR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10220133"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8eGPnz"&gt;Another benefit of the M1 processor is that it enables the MacBook Air to run iPhone and iPad apps natively on macOS. As of this writing, there still isn’t a huge selection of mobile apps available, and some that have been released aren’t quite optimized for the laptop screen. Still, it’s a benefit we can look forward to as time goes on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NjPO8F"&gt;Overall, there’s no reason that a general-use customer shouldn’t consider the MacBook Air. It’s a reliable device with excellent performance, as well as the excellence in build quality for which Apple is known. Power users who need a MacBook Pro probably know who they are; the Air should be fine for everyone else. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MacBook Pro is an excellent laptop for video editing and intensive work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ip0i0W"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review"&gt;MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2021)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="QRlaQ5"&gt;The best creator laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LyoNCb"&gt;The 16-inch MacBook Pro is the most powerful laptop Apple has ever made. If you’re willing to pay the price (and it’s a steep price), you’ll almost certainly be satisfied with what this machine can do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="svZAry"&gt;In our benchmarks, which test a variety of creative tasks including encoding, playback, and export time, the MacBook Pro 16 did better than any laptop we’ve ever used — the only other machines that have come close to matching this thing in some of our benchmarks are high-end desktop PCs. The battery life is also record-shattering. The 16-inch configuration with the M1 Pro processor lasted 16 hours in my testing — making it the longest-lasting laptop we’ve ever reviewed. (The M1 Max configuration doesn’t last quite as long, but still got us through a work day.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imgWnf"&gt;Elsewhere, we have basically no complaints about the newest MacBook Pro. It has a gorgeous display that can reach 1,000 nits when playing HDR content. It pairs that with the best set of speakers we’ve ever heard from a laptop. If you’re looking for a machine that can accommodate a demanding workload while also serving as an excellent multimedia device when you’re off the clock, the MacBook Pro 16 is the best device for you. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 14-inch MacBook Pro is another great creator laptop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Wh6FfM"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review"&gt;MacBook Pro (14-inch, 2021)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="7399sH"&gt;A great choice for Mac power users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="u8MTQ2"&gt;If you’re a creative professional who doesn’t quite want to pay the price of the MacBook Pro 16, or you’re looking for something more compact, you’re probably better suited to the 14-inch MacBook Pro. This device is thinner, lighter, and less expensive than its 16-inch counterpart, but it comes with the same monstrous processor options and the same stellar screen, albeit at a smaller size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w3aJPr"&gt;We didn’t see much of a difference in benchmark scores between the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBooks with the same processors — the 14-incher actually outperformed the 16-inchers in some of our tests. The primary difference to consider, apart from the sizes of these devices, is battery life. The 16-inch chassis allows for a significantly bigger battery, and the 16-inch M1 Pro model lasted several hours longer than the 14-inch M1 Pro model did in our testing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l8RJE4"&gt;On the outside, Apple has fixed many of the issues that reviewers had with previous MacBook Pro models. There are ports galore on this device, including an HDMI, an SD slot, and multiple Thunderbolt 4 ports. The much-maligned Touchbar is also no more. While you can get plenty of great 14-inch laptops for half the price of this MacBook, it’s the one to buy if money is no object.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Spectre x360 14 is one of the best convertible laptops you can buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O7mXrt"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22264792/hp-spectre-x360-14-laptop-stylus-oled-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Spectre x360 14&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="N7xEV5"&gt;The best Windows laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4nwIVn"&gt;It’s hard to come up with a single complaint about the Spectre x360 14. It’s a drop-dead gorgeous machine with a sturdy build and a premium look and feel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xL3xF1"&gt;But the Spectre x360 14 isn’t just pretty to look at: it’s also a pleasure to use as a daily work driver. Intel’s latest 11th Gen processors and Iris Xe integrated graphics deliver snappy performance with no slowdown or freezes that we observed. And we got an average of 10 hours of battery life out of the device — one of the best results we’ve ever seen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfMa1S"&gt;On the outside, the Spectre includes a roomy 3:2 display, and if FHD resolution doesn’t suit your fancy, there are OLED and 1,000-nit options available. There’s even a packaged stylus, which attaches magnetically to the side of the Spectre — handy if you’re using the device as a tablet. Pretty much every other aspect of this laptop, from its comfortable keyboard and smooth touchpad to its bass-heavy audio and practical port selection, rivals or exceeds the best convertibles on the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xxTNW9"&gt;Such an exceptional package of features doesn’t come cheap, and many customers will find everything they need in a less expensive product. But the Spectre x360 14 is the new gold standard of Windows convertibles. Overall, it’s the best Windows laptop you can buy.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Asus Zephyrus G15 is the best gaming laptop you can buy.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rLlXNY"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nxYz9i"&gt;The best gaming laptop in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="2eqQM4"&gt;At just over four pounds, the Zephyrus G15 is one of the lightest 15-inch gaming laptops you can buy. But you’re not compromising performance for that portability. The G15 is powered by the top mobile chips AMD and Nvidia have to offer, and pairs thim with a fast 165Hz QHD display. In our testing, the system was able to handle even the toughest AAA titles at QHD resolution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SxthwN"&gt;Almost everything else about the G15 is great too: the audio sounds good, the keyboard and touchpad are some of the best on the market, the port selection has just about everything you’d need, and the battery can last over eight and a half hours to a charge. If you’re looking for a high-powered gaming machine that also works great as a daily driver, the Zephyrus G15 should be at the top of your list. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="3W3TFs"&gt;The best 15-inch Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="wVrlpW"&gt;Asus surprised us this year with its Chromebook Flip CX5, a gorgeous $800 laptop that happens to run Chrome OS. It’s as sturdy and well-built as all kinds of Windows laptops at higher price points, and sports a unique smooth texture. It includes fully-fledged laptop specs, including Intel’s 11th-Gen processors and a 57Wh battery, which provide speedy performance, long battery life, and quick charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tt9eBq"&gt;You get all kinds of ports, including an HDMI and a microSD slot. The speakers sound great, and the keyboard is comfortable. Asus hasn’t skimped on CX5’s chassis or its performance — it’s absolutely the product to buy if you’re looking for a Chromebook with a big screen.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aOmcws"&gt;The best laptop in 2021 for big-screen fans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ovDneV"&gt;Even if you’ve used a light laptop before, it’s difficult to explain how light the LG Gram 17 is. It has a massive 17-inch display, but it’s somehow only three pounds. Picking it up messes with your mind; you feel like you’re not holding anything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AbftFc"&gt;But the Gram 17’s weight isn’t the only standout feature. It also has some of the best battery life you can get, lasting over 12 hours in our testing. Add a great keyboard, a solid port selection, quiet fans, and a fast processor, and there’s very little not to like about this device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BvoTCC"&gt;Not everyone needs a 17-inch display, and many folks who do are looking for a heavier-duty workstation that probably doesn’t get moved very often. But if you’d just really like a large screen for your daily office work and Netflixing, you’re the target demographic for this machine. It’s a niche, but truly impressive device without much real competition in today’s market.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Envy x360 is the best laptop you can buy for under $1,000.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7dLyUJ"&gt;8. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 (2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IOuDKK"&gt;The best budget laptop in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6ONzJr"&gt;You don’t need to spend $1,000 to get a laptop that looks and feels premium. The HP Envy x360 2020 is the best budget laptop you can buy, thanks to its sturdy and compact build, chic convertible design, and excellent performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TwdF5"&gt;Part of what makes the Envy so great is that HP has ported over a number of elements from its excellent 2019 flagship, the Spectre x360, including the thin-and-light chassis and nearly bezel-free display with an 88 percent screen-to-body ratio. The touchscreen (which supports HP’s MPP2.0 pen) is bright and looks great. (You can choose a 300-nit, 400-nit, or 1,000-nit panel). And HP has added a row of convenient hotkeys to the keyboard, including kill switches for the microphone and webcam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xRbztF"&gt;But the most exciting feature is inside: the new Envy x360 is powered by AMD’s Ryzen 4000 series. The Ryzen 5-4500U in my model did an outstanding job with a fairly heavy load of multitasking. And AMD’s integrated Radeon graphics delivered good gaming performance comparable to what you’d expect from a lower-powered discrete GPU.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 13-inch MacBook Pro is a compact MacBook Pro for modern customers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3k1xVZ"&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;MacBook Pro 13 (late 2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lYrZ3f"&gt;The best MacBook Pro for everyday users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="yUbRrT"&gt;If you’re looking to buy an M1 MacBook for heavier workloads that’s not as mind-numbingly expensive as the most recent releases, you’ll want to look at the late-2020 MacBook Pro. It starts at $1,299, which is $300 more than the late-2020 MacBook Air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNImzP"&gt;The MacBook Pro has a slightly different design and look than the Air, as well as a few additional features like the Touch Bar. But the two have the same processor. The main difference is that the Pro includes a fan (the Air is fanless), which means it can sustain heavy workloads for a longer period of time without needing to throttle its performance. But you won’t notice much of a performance difference between the two MacBooks unless you’re routinely pushing heavy tasks for long periods of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USngRn"&gt;If that’s you, though, go for the Pro. We were able to run a number of hefty Premiere Pro exports and didn’t see a dip in times. The Pro also achieved a significantly higher score than the Air in a 30-minute loop of Cinebench R23; the scores were closer together after a single run. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 is the best convertible you can buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NKt5f4"&gt;10. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575308/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 13 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Ucqsb1"&gt;A great 2-in-1 laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iLNMXR"&gt;If you’re looking for a convertible laptop that does just about everything right, we recommend Dell’s latest XPS 13 2-in-1. It features a sturdy and well-made chassis, a nearly bezel-free 16:10 touch display, and Intel’s newest 11th Gen processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dghfZI"&gt;The base model, for $1,099, includes a Core i3-1154G4, 8GB of RAM, a 1920 x 1200 display, and a 256GB SSD. You can spec that up to a 3840 x 2400 display, a Core i7-1165G7, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. There are various add-ons as well: you can pay $50 extra for a white model and $60 to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro. Basically, there’s something for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BEAGgI"&gt;Dell has made a few minor tweaks to the 2-in-1 since last year’s model. The webcam now supports Windows Hello, and the RAM and microSD reader have been upgraded. But the exciting news is the new chip and, in particular, Intel’s new integrated graphics. The XPS 13 2-in-1 did a better job than any 10th Gen laptop with an iGPU on our Adobe Premiere Pro export test. And you can even play some games on this thing: it broke 60fps on &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, and even managed 36fps on &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at its lowest settings. That’s an improvement over the results we saw from 10th Gen systems, and it also beats some 11th Gen systems (including the clamshell Dell XPS 13). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izx3w7"&gt;Of course, it’s not perfect. The port selection is limited (as is customary for modern XPS models) and the keyboard is a bit flat for my taste. But overall, the 2-in-1 excels on the fundamentals: build quality, display, performance, and battery life. What more could you want?&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 is one of the best laptops of 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="w7TWDY"&gt;The best laptop for college&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6xPrkB"&gt;The Dell XPS 13 is a compact and reliable laptop. Its beautiful chassis, excellent 16:10 display, and great performance make it an excellent choice for general-purpose users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ik0URk"&gt;This late-2020 model comes with Intel’s new Tiger Lake processors, from a Core i3-1154G4 up to a Core i7-1165G7. It starts at $999, so it’s a bit cheaper than the 2-in-1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZCO5H"&gt;My review unit (an i7 model) blew through the work tasks I needed it to do without any slowdown or heat. It did quite well, and handily beat its 10th Gen predecessor in both gaming and media work. It didn’t do as well as the XPS 13 2-in-1, which is why that model is ranked higher on this list. But if you like the look and feel of the XPS 13 and would prefer a clamshell model (or need a bouncier keyboard), this XPS is still a great option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uN3gSr"&gt;There’s an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22528646/dell-xps-13-oled-2021-review-screen-specs-price"&gt;OLED model&lt;/a&gt; of the XPS 13 as well, which costs $300 more than the FHD model. This model has worse battery life, but does deliver a stunning picture. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="TA1Mem"&gt;The best laptop for business travel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="XTubRZ"&gt;In many ways, the ThinkPad X1 Nano is a run-of-the-mill ThinkPad. It’s got a solid sturdy chassis, discrete clickers, a physical privacy shutter, a red TrackPoint in the middle of the keyboard, and all kinds of business-specific security and management features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WdGWMd"&gt;But the Nano is special because it’s the lightest ThinkPad Lenovo has ever made. It’s also one of the lightest laptops you can buy, at just 1.99 pounds. You’re not sacrificing performance to get that mindblowing weight: The Nano kept up with our heavy testing workloads without any fan noise or noticeable heat. If you’re looking for a reliable business laptop that will feel like nothing in your briefcase, this is the one for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WpIKDR"&gt;The best laptop for students&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="5khaPj"&gt;Lenovo’s Chromebook Duet is a great convertible laptop for kids, or anyone who wants a reliable secondary driver for browsing and games. It’s a nice-looking, well-made 10-inch device that comes with a detachable keyboard and kickstand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FV5DZN"&gt;The Duet is tailor-made to be used around the house and on the go, weighing just 2.03 pounds and delivering over 11 hours of battery life. Its MediaTek processor isn’t designed to shoulder heavy loads, but it’s just fine for browsing in a couple tabs, watching Netflix, or playing Android games — it even handles photo editing pretty well. The Duet also features a new “tablet mode” for Chrome OS, which supports an Android-inspired gesture navigation system and a unique Chrome layout optimized for tablet use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XiBrWO"&gt;The Chromebook Duet is an absolute steal for its low price, and is the Chromebook to buy if you’re on a tight budget. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer Book 13 proves that Razer is cut out for more than just gaming rigs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sky6IZ"&gt;A stylish, powerful productivity laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="1AVfKp"&gt;Razer is best known for its gaming laptops, but the company is making a big splash in the business and productivity space with its new Razer Book 13. At 0.6 inches thick and 3.09 pounds, the Book 13 is a portable workstation with a gorgeous and sturdy aluminum build. It features a good port selection including Thunderbolt 4, USB-A, HDMI 2.0 and a microSD slot, and it’s one of very few non-gaming laptops out there to come with a per-key RGB keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAI01n"&gt;On the inside, this laptop is even more impressive. Its powerful chip did better than any other Windows laptop of its size on our Premiere Pro media export test. And while the Book 13 isn’t a gaming laptop, it delivers some of the best gaming performance I’ve ever seen from integrated graphics — it can even run &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; over 30fps. While the Razer Book 13’s high price means it won’t be ideal for everyone, it’s still an outstanding laptop all around, combining a high-quality chassis with powerful productivity performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DdByBe"&gt;The best multimedia laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3TMlQz"&gt;Most thin and light laptops share one significant weakness — thin, tinny audio. That’s not the case with the Lenovo Yoga 9i. This 14-inch convertible has a rotating soundbar in its hinge, meaning that no matter how it’s positioned, the speakers face outwards. You can expect clear, booming sound whether you’re using the 9i in tablet, tent, or clamshell mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bd1MYR"&gt;There’s a lot more to like as well. You get an excellent 1080p touch display and a built-in stylus for easy artwork and note-taking. The 11th-Gen processors deliver satisfactory performance and all-day battery life. The audio quality, screen, and convertible form factor all add up to an unbeatable machine for multimedia entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;
