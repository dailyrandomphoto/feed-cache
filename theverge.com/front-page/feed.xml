    <title>New AirPods Pro could launch in 2022 with a focus on fitness tracking</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Utbha7"&gt;Apple’s second-generation AirPods Pro will launch next year, following the release of an updated pair of standard AirPods this year, according to a new &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-28/apple-plans-redesigned-airpods-for-2021-new-airpods-pro-in-2022?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The new AirPods Pro will reportedly feature upgraded motion sensors to allow for fitness tracking, while the entry-level AirPods will have an updated design similar to the Pro models along with a shorter stem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v8Kark"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21534123/apple-airpods-3-pro-2-2021-chip-design-battery-life-true-wireless-earbuds-headphones-homepod"&gt;previous report from last year&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; said that the upcoming AirPods Pro could ditch the stem entirely in favor of a more compact design similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147654/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review-wireless-earbuds-sound-quality-battery-life"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Plus&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21400695/google-pixel-buds-2-2020-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review"&gt;Google’s Pixel Buds&lt;/a&gt;. However, at the time &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; noted that design challenges meant these plans could change. Its latest report says Apple has “tested” this design, which sounds like it’s not guaranteed to appear in the final model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4zETRX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Following the launch of the AirPods Max&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZaxHpL"&gt;Alongside the two new AirPods models, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22379470/apple-tv-homepod-speaker-camera-video-call-soundbar-rumor-bloomberg"&gt;Apple is reported to be developing&lt;/a&gt; a HomePod equipped with a screen, as well as a separate Apple TV-like device that could include a speaker and camera for video calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zQ6nt6"&gt;The new AirPods would be the first updates to Apple’s true wireless lineup in over a year. Apple first release its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;AirPods Pro in late 2019&lt;/a&gt;, while its entry-level AirPods haven’t been updated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;since March 2019&lt;/a&gt;. It released its first AirPods-branded over-ear headphones, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt;, in December.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo’s new 13-inch Android tablet also works as a portable Switch display</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X_9rbb_M3Rgya8cYVfhz8CXT3V0=/0x115:1371x1029/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69355124/XEbQB42rd4G9SboycZMTV63zq_0247.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A built in Micro HDMI port lets the tablet work as an external monitor. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Lenovo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a8DMtP"&gt;Lenovo’s &lt;a href="https://item.lenovo.com.cn/product/1014615.html"&gt;Yoga Pad Pro&lt;/a&gt; is a new 13-inch Android tablet that can easily double as an external monitor, &lt;a href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2021/05/25/the-lenovo-yoga-pad-pro-is-a-premium-android-tablet-that-doubles-as-an-external-display/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmochina&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. It will be available to buy in China for 3,299 yuan (around $517) on May 31st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hqPjgn"&gt;It’s not tricky to get most tablets on the market to work as a second monitor, but for the most part you’re limited to using them with specific devices. Apple’s iPads can be used as external monitors thanks to their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18651017/apple-ipad-pro-pencil-sidecar-wwdc-2019"&gt;built-in Sidecar feature&lt;/a&gt;, for example, but this only works if you’re using them with a Mac. But the Yoga Pad Pro has a full-on Micro HDMI port built into its grip, meaning you can plug basically &lt;em&gt;any &lt;/em&gt;HDMI device into it and use the Yoga Pad Pro as a 13-inch monitor. And yes, that &lt;a href="https://p2.lefile.cn/product/adminweb/2021/05/24/XEbQB42rd4G9SboycZMTV63zq-0247.jpg"&gt;absolutely includes a Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/46HStEeiyAQuX-tpeeG-3xmMDes=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22545433/nBd8LhbQy1rkBaPk4uO09V0UR_3489.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lenovo Yoga Pad Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sSAldxeYO8KMjuzxr9QG_q7iARU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22545438/87gJ7enWYO6TAJ4rshZ3EXNBD_5607.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lenovo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Its built-in stand doubles as a hanger for when your wine glasses want to use it to watch TV.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lLpG05"&gt;For use as a tablet, the Yoga Pad Pro is powered by a Snapdragon 870 paired with 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and a 10,200mAh battery. It’s got four Dolby Atmos-compatible speakers arranged around its 2K, 16:10 LCD display, and it also includes a kickstand that can rotate a full 180-degrees out from behind the back of the device. Why would you want a 180-degree kickstand on a tablet? For &lt;a href="https://p1.lefile.cn/product/adminweb/2021/05/24/87gJ7enWYO6TAJ4rshZ3EXNBD-5607.jpg"&gt;hanging it on a wall&lt;/a&gt;, obviously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OpKaF5"&gt;Sure, there are plenty of other portable monitors out there, often available with bigger screen sizes and lower price tags. Take Lenovo’s own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/24/18238314/lenovo-thinkvision-m14-portable-usb-c-monitor-mwc-2019"&gt;14-inch ThinkVision M14&lt;/a&gt; as an example, which is half the price at $249. But the Yoga Pad Pro has the advantage of being a capable standalone device in its own right, complete with stylus compatibility and an 8-megapixel selfie camera (though there’s no rear camera). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LsieOA"&gt;It’s unclear if the Yoga Pad Pro will ever see a release outside of China. But if it does, we’ll be ready.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony launches motion-sensing music effects controller on Indiegogo</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s4Q4RQf3dfzr5kkkey1REqJNp3Y=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69354968/houa3hlugbgte6bjgidn.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LpMtXQ"&gt;Here’s something you don’t see every day: a brand-new Sony product launching first on Indiegogo. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiegogo.com%2Fprojects%2Fmotion-sonic%23%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F28%2F22458023%2Fsony-motion-sonic-launches-music-indiegogo-price-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Motion Sonic&lt;/a&gt; is, in the words of Sony’s campaign, “effects gear to control sound in sync with your motion for playing music.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c57KEz"&gt;The Motion Sonic device itself is a small capsule that can slot into differently shaped rubber wristbands, sort of like a Fitbit. There’s a band that attaches to your wrist for use cases like playing guitar, and another wraps around the back of your hand and is better suited to playing keys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LOtdYd"&gt;What it actually does is allow you to link hand motions to specific musical effects. For example, you could set it to add a delay effect when you move fingers from left to right, or to bend pitch as you roll your wrist. These effects are all created and saved on an iOS app, then you need to connect your iPhone to your instrument with an audio interface. (It’s not compatible with Android.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BxP8hf"&gt;Here are some demonstrations: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Tu4QYI"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fTazUqnJhzM?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="MsULYW"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w9fUo41DWiU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mWGINH"&gt;Sony has actually had this project kicking around for quite a while — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/3/13/14914172/sony-motion-sonic-wristband-wearable-dance-music-sxsw-2017"&gt;we tried out an early version&lt;/a&gt; at SXSW in 2017. Shortly after, Sony posted &lt;a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/design/stories/motionsonic/"&gt;this interview&lt;/a&gt; with a designer and art director on the project, who attributed the initial idea to an engineer called Heesoon Kim. The Motion Sonic Indiegogo campaign now lists Kim as project lead, quoting him as saying “I believe we can create new entertainment never seen before with Motion Sonic and I’m so excited to create a new culture with you!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zRcqtC"&gt;Sony isn’t new to crowdfunding, but most of its projects to date — like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21333837/sony-reon-pocket-hands-on-wearable-air-conditioner-japan"&gt;the Reon Pocket wearable air conditioner&lt;/a&gt; — have been limited to its own First Flight site in Japan. Now that Motion Sonic is on Indiegogo, Sony will ship it to the US as well as its home market. The first 400 units will sell for 23,900 yen or $218, and the retail price is 27,200 yen or $248. The product is scheduled to ship in March next year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO’s The Last of Us is the rare show letting a video game actor reprise her role</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="61st Annual GRAMMY Awards - Arrivals" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mwkdQtcKbDdC1jdBngFwH2Gq2RQ=/0x0:3350x2233/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69354620/1097256280.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amy Sussman/FilmMagic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="anlmcp"&gt;Merle Dandridge, an actor who’s had a long career in television and theater, will be reprising her role of Marlene in HBO’s &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt; adaptation, according to &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/the-last-of-us-merle-dandridge-marlene-hbo-1234983605/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/05/the-last-of-us-merle-dandridge-repris-original-game-hbo-series-1234765808/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Dandridge’s casting is particularly notable because actors in video games are rarely presented with the opportunity to play their characters in live action outside of the motion capture stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hIhhyd"&gt;Marlene is integral to how lead characters Joel and Ellie join together and head off on their zombie road trip in the first place. It’s unknown how much of the game’s story will carry over to the television adaptation, but Dandridge’s situation is unique. Both Troy Baker’s Joel and Ashley Johnson’s Ellie were recast for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/20/21583442/hbo-the-last-of-us-tv-show-playstation-neil-druckmann-craig-mazin-series-order"&gt;executive producer and writer Craig Mazin’s take&lt;/a&gt; on the critically acclaimed video game. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22277687/mandalorian-star-pedro-pascal-joel-hbo-the-last-of-us-tv-show"&gt;Pedro Pascal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22277372/the-last-of-us-ellie-game-of-thrones-bella-ramsey-hbo-lyanna-mormont"&gt;Bella Ramsey&lt;/a&gt; were announced to be filling both roles, respectively, in February.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jcwyAlUvR-w2w8yti5mKBqmvHHw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22544868/Marlene_shoulder_infobox.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Marlene from &lt;/em&gt;The Last of Us.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yPbruB"&gt;Just look at the recent history of adapting video games for film and TV and you can see the trend. Any time a game is brought to the big screen, a Hollywood actor seems to be slotted into the lead role. It happened with casting Jake Gyllenhal in &lt;em&gt;Prince of Persia,&lt;/em&gt; Tom Holland in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/22/15676770/uncharted-movie-tom-holland-nathan-drake-spider-man"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and Alicia Vikander in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/28/11531858/alicia-vikander-tomb-raider-reboot"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;But for the reverse, the only recent example I could find was Jen Taylor joining the cast of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/28/17514578/halo-tv-series-showtime-microsoft-xbox"&gt;ViacomCBS’ &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; series&lt;/a&gt;. Taylor’s played Cortana since 2001 in the games, but Natascha McElhone was originally cast as the character in the show. Due to the pandemic interrupting production, McElhone had to step down, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21561137/halo-tv-show-cortana-recast-jen-taylor"&gt;Taylor was brought back in&lt;/a&gt; to play the character she helped create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bJDYNB"&gt;Besides her talent, Dandridge’s success in securing the part could be credited to the increasingly common use of motion capture in games. If there’s an actor who’s physically played a video game character in cut scenes and voiced them in every other scenario, they might as well be considered for a live-action take on the material — they’ve clearly done the work. For now Dandridge and Taylor are outliers, but with more video game adaptions on the way, it could be the start of a positive trend for actors who might normally be overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spyra has a new digital water blaster that looks like it’ll blow the original away</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JMayGkdjSnD9iKsb0al3ElB3UY0=/0x0:1658x1105/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69353890/spira_two.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3n38OY"&gt;In 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/8/10/17674496/spyra-one-water-gun-digital-ammo-counter-usb-c-kickstarter"&gt;we marveled over the Spyra One&lt;/a&gt;, an attempt to crowdfund a modern Super Soaker that could blast veritable &lt;em&gt;bolts&lt;/em&gt; of water; refill&lt;em&gt; itself&lt;/em&gt; from a pool; and maintain a digital ammo gauge of your shots, thanks to a heap of electronics, a self-pressurizing tank, and a battery you recharge via a standard USB-C port. The big catch: you had to be willing to risk north of $133 on an unproven Kickstarter that wound up shipping a year behind schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VcsflI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Spyra Two&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EEl76C"&gt;But not only did Spyra eventually manage to ship those blasters (11,000 of them, according to the company) it’s now got a new version coming next month that sounds like a huge improvement in practically every way. &lt;a href="https://spyra.com/products/spyratwo"&gt;The new Spyra Two&lt;/a&gt; fires faster, further, has twice the battery life, the company claims the pump is less noisy now — and this time, the company says it’s already manufactured and ready to ship in early June with no crowdfunding whatsoever. The initial units seem to be sold out, but Spyra’s website says it’ll have more in July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PlU4uK"&gt;The only downside, on paper anyhow, is a lower capacity of 20 shots compared to the 25 of the original... and a $159 pricetag. You can still charge up three distinct shots at a time, each ready to dispense a shot-glass worth of water at your friends, or charge up for a bigger blast that can travel up to 46 feet if you’re aiming at a 45-degree angle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vel4t9"&gt;Here’s a quick spec comparison I whipped up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jwg1oF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10522643"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="ReyldP"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Crns5rmGv6w?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=22&amp;amp;start=22" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t5cumb"&gt;While the company doesn’t seem to have an official video of the new Spyra Two in action yet, just the brief intro above, you can check out &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXiYfApXd1o"&gt;this video from YouTuber LordDraconical&lt;/a&gt; for an idea of what the blaster’s capable of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zdPWM8"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CXiYfApXd1o?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w21nmB"&gt;Drac points out that it’s also got a rubber flap over the USB-C port now, letting you more fully submerge it in a swimming pool. The company’s documentation isn’t &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; clear on whether that’s a good idea, though: while &lt;a href="https://spyraeu.reamaze.com/kb/english-faq-9603031bed8ce828/is-the-spyratwo-waterproof"&gt;one FAQ page&lt;/a&gt; states that “All components of the SpyraTwo are individually protected agains[t] water damage” and that the primary risk is simply that it won’t float, &lt;a href="https://spyraeu.reamaze.com/kb/english-faq-9603031bed8ce828/can-i-fully-submerge-the-spyratwo-under-water"&gt;another FAQ&lt;/a&gt; reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="IU5aSb"&gt;The SpyraTwo is like a yoghurt cup, which means your SpyraTwo will fill up with water and join the Titanic. This can also increase the dripping on the barrel. Among other things, this can affect the lifespan of the SpyraTwo!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="5D3SjE"&gt;Cool. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla starts using in-car camera for Autopilot driver monitoring</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3AP6vhO8otzX9VpYDVatUiaKtGQ=/0x0:1400x933/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69353677/d3d70c40_031e_480a_85d6_4bff05670ea3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RBw4zB"&gt;Tesla is starting to use the camera above the rear-view mirror in the Model 3 and Model Y to help make sure people pay attention to the road while using Autopilot, the company’s advanced driver assistance system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m7Kayb"&gt;Until now, the main way Tesla’s cars measure driver attention is through torque sensors in the steering wheel that look for resistance — a crude way of ensuring drivers keep their hands on the wheel. If it doesn’t register enough feedback, the car performs a series of escalating visual and audible warnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="owJ7hd"&gt;The change comes after regulators and safety experts spent years &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21153320/tesla-autopilot-walter-huang-death-ntsb-probable-cause"&gt;begging&lt;/a&gt; Tesla to add &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21152984/tesla-autopilot-safety-recommendations-ignored-ntsb-crash-hearing"&gt;better driver monitoring to its cars&lt;/a&gt;. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has even admitted that crashes involving Autopilot &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/2/17313324/tesla-autopilot-safety-statistics-elon-musk-q1-earnings"&gt;stem from complacency&lt;/a&gt;. But he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/14/17352814/elon-musk-tesla-autopilot-face-tracking-gm"&gt;previously rejected his own engineers’ calls&lt;/a&gt; to add more robust driver monitoring to the company’s cars. Musk said at the time that the tech was “ineffective.” Companies like General Motors and Ford currently sell cars with camera-based eye-tracking systems that are meant to make sure drivers pay attention while using hands-free driving features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="QCWazs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Tesla ignored safety board’s Autopilot recommendations, chairman says","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21152984/tesla-autopilot-safety-recommendations-ignored-ntsb-crash-hearing"},{"title":"Tesla Autopilot, distracted driving to blame in deadly 2018 crash","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21153320/tesla-autopilot-walter-huang-death-ntsb-probable-cause"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="fsF3qS"&gt;A Twitter user who says they just took delivery of a new Model Y &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/spleck/status/1398015162255298560"&gt;posted an image Thursday that shows software release notes&lt;/a&gt; describing the new safety feature: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="0udB3j"&gt;The cabin camera above your rearview mirror can now detect and alert driver inattentiveness while Autopilot is engaged. Camera data does not leave the car itself, which means the system cannot save or transmit information unless data sharing is enabled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="65s2we"&gt;In subsequent tweets, the Model Y owner said the steering wheel sensor alerts were still active. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NaNfI7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt; has also &lt;a href="https://t.co/82d3tZACu3"&gt;seen the release notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uWkClX"&gt;Model S and Model X vehicles made before 2021 do not have a cabin camera, though the redesigned versions announced in January (which have still not shipped) are supposed to have them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="h1DSKQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It will watch for “driver inattentiveness”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PKCpKF"&gt;Tesla doesn’t define the term “driver inattentiveness” that it uses in the release notes, or what happens if it decides someone isn’t paying sufficient attention. Earlier this year, hacker @greentheonly and an accomplice were able to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZWR4MQBI4M"&gt;tease out &lt;/a&gt;what a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTCbBsMJ3ts"&gt;work-in-progress version&lt;/a&gt; of the camera-based driver monitoring system could see. It was particularly good at noticing when the driver looked down at a phone, though it struggled in low light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NB0Ydo"&gt;The in-car camera was pretty much benign in the early going with the Model 3 and Model Y, though Tesla started using it to make sure that drivers in the beta test of its “Full Self-Driving” version of Autopilot were paying attention to the road. Musk said in March that Tesla removed some beta testers from the program because they “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1370522745709158407"&gt;did not pay sufficient attention&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bZS71o"&gt;The addition of camera-based driver monitoring feature also follows a fresh wave of scrutiny on Autopilot, which rose up after a pair of fatal crashes where it initially appeared the driver assistance system may have been involved — though, in one case, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/california-business-technology-204e5600ec902d0bfda10feca74a9ed0"&gt;officials walked back the claim that Autopilot was active&lt;/a&gt;, and in the other, an early report from the National Transportation Safety Board &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22429198/tesla-ntsb-texas-crash-driverless-preliminary-report"&gt;made it seem unlikely that the system was in use&lt;/a&gt;. There have also been a number of recently documented cases of social media users posting videos that show them fooling Autopilot into thinking someone is still in the driver’s seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7cQjx2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oscar Isaac will star in Disney Plus’ Moon Knight series</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xRg4pa"&gt;Marvel &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelStudios/status/1397987590075129861?s=20"&gt;has confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that Oscar Isaac will star in the Disney Plus &lt;em&gt;Moon Knight&lt;/em&gt; series, bringing the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; star to another highly lucrative side of the Disney empire. Moon Knight is one of several Marvel characters who seem to be inspired by DC Comics’ Batman, and is certainly more of an obscure character to adapt, but as the company pivots into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167976/disney-investor-day-2020-biggest-announcements-plus-marvel-star-wars-pixar-animation"&gt;the next phase of movies and now shows&lt;/a&gt;, weirdness is on the menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MfPPuP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.marvel.com/characters/moon-knight-marc-spector/in-comics"&gt;Moon Knight&lt;/a&gt;, or Marc Spector, is a mercenary possessed by an ancient Egyptian moon god named Khonshu. That possession is what gives him his superpowers but also multiple conflicting personalities, including a taxi driver, wealthy playboy, and masked vigilante. Marvel and Isaac’s announcement — “WE ARE MOONKNIGHT” — seems to directly reference the character’s complex psychology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="blik1u"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;

The show’s head writer is Jeremy Slater, who co-created the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/7/18214426/netflix-umbrella-academy-review-tv-series-gerard-way-my-chemical-romance-x-men-ellen-page"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Umbrella Academy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Netflix show and also created and executive produced the extremely underrated &lt;em&gt;The Exorcist&lt;/em&gt; TV adaptation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ilk9zl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moon Knight&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t have an announced release date, but there are several other Marvel shows on their way soon to Disney Plus. &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; is set to premiere &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421140/loki-disney-plus-show-new-date-wednesday"&gt;on June 9th&lt;/a&gt; and both &lt;em&gt;Ms. Marvel&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye &lt;/em&gt;are still planned for the back half of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is now embroiled in a full class-action lawsuit over whether it underpaid women</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/voSFbGnH10BPJWznDWyPFTmex2w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69353511/acastro_210104_1777_google_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u2bdxV"&gt;Four women who used to work for Google have won class-action status for their gender equity lawsuit against the search engine company, allowing them to represent some 10,800 women, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-27/google-women-suing-over-gender-bias-win-class-action-status?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gMo7tp"&gt;The lawsuit alleges that Google pays men more than women for the same work, in violation of California’s Equal Pay Act, and that Google paid its female employees nearly $17,000 less per year than male counterparts in the same roles. The women&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/14/16308740/google-class-action-sexism-gender-pay-lawsuit"&gt; filed the suit in 2017,&lt;/a&gt; claiming they were put into lower career tracks than their male colleagues— so-called “job ladders” that resulted in them receiving lower bonuses and salaries. The women have since left Google. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fHmJMc"&gt;“This is a significant day for women at Google and in the technology sector, and we are so proud of our brave clients for leading the way,” Kelly Dermody, an attorney representing the women, wrote in an email to&lt;em&gt; Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. “This order shows that it is critical that companies prioritize paying women equitably over spending money fighting them in litigation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qzp1r"&gt;The plaintiffs weren’t the only ones accusing Google of systematically underpaying female employees in 2017; the US Department of Labor &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/4/14170226/google-anti-discrimination-audit-lawsuit-department-of-labor"&gt;also sued Google that year&lt;/a&gt; for withholding compensation data, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/8/15229688/department-of-labor-google-gender-pay-gap"&gt;concluded three months later&lt;/a&gt; that Google was responsible for “systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22261263/google-pays-3-million-us-department-labor-settlemt-allegations-pay-discrimination"&gt;Google agreed to pay $2.5 million to employees and job applicants earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; over alleged pay and hiring discrimination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RzL65y"&gt;A Google spokesperson said in an email to The Verge that the company “strongly believes in the equity” of its policies and practices.  The spokesperson did not directly address the lawsuit’s class action status, but said the company has performed a “rigorous pay equity analysis” annually for the past eight years. “If we find any differences in proposed pay, including between men and women, we make upward adjustments to remove them before new compensation goes into effect,” the spokesperson added, saying that last year alone Google made “upward adjustments” for 2,352 employees across the company, for a total of $4.4 million. Google had over 135,000 employees as of December, and pulled in $17 billion in profit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22404046/google-alphabet-q1-2021-earnings"&gt;last quarter alone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HwdhKj"&gt;Dermody, the attorney, told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; she expected a trial to start sometime next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tUnfFj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Check if your Verizon or AT&amp;T phone will keep working after the networks’ 3G shutdowns</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cell tower (STOCK)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TDf8X3YimwrbxzTcsIyKJga5Z18=/3x0:1017x676/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69353302/cell-tower-stock_1020.1419980290.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;US wireless carriers plan to shutter their old 3G networks next year.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="93mvKT"&gt;Major US wireless carriers are gearing up to shut down their old 3G networks — a process that has been fraught with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215453/verizon-3g-shutdown-paused-delay-network-old-phones"&gt;delays&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21334221/att-customer-upgrade-email-3g-shutdown-2022"&gt;miscommunication&lt;/a&gt; as companies alert customers with older phones that it’s time to upgrade. To that end, Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T have published guides to which devices will stop working after their 3G networks go offline next year. Here’s what you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qP1RJt"&gt;Verizon has delayed its CDMA 3G network shutdown several times but is now firmly committed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358628/verizon-3g-cdma-shutdown-date-2022"&gt;shutting the network down by December 31st, 2022&lt;/a&gt;. All 3G basic phones and smartphones will lose service, but some 4G devices will be impacted as well — namely, those that don’t support VoLTE (Voice over LTE). A few connected devices are affected, too; take a look at &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/support/knowledge-base-218813/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon’s full guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D7DbZk"&gt;Taking the opposite approach, AT&amp;amp;T has published a &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.att.com/idpassets/images/support/wireless/Devices-Working-on-ATT-Network.pdf?source=ECAuAT10600aff12A&amp;amp;wtExtndSource=100122946&amp;amp;CI=CJ_AFFILIATE&amp;amp;RI=CJ1&amp;amp;RD=37922269&amp;amp;tfn=aff&amp;amp;cjevent=38f3c68bbf2911eb81ee1d8c0a1c0e0c" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;complete list&lt;/a&gt; (spotted by &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/will-my-phone-work-on-att-after-3g-shutdown/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) of exactly which phones, tablets, and smartwatches &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; keep working after its 3G shutdown on February 22nd, 2022. (Separately, there’s &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/security/atandts-3g-shutdown-plans-are-harmful-even-deadly-warns-alarm-industry/d/d-id/769737"&gt;concern in the alarm industry&lt;/a&gt;: many home security devices use AT&amp;amp;T’s 3G and it’s possible that users won’t be able to replace them in time.) In any case, AT&amp;amp;T makes it easy to understand which mobile devices will keep functioning after the network shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qnH2r5"&gt;T-Mobile’s 3G shutdown is a bit more complicated. It operates a UMTS 3G network, which the company will &lt;a href="https://tmo.report/2021/02/t-mobile-shutting-down-3g-network-on-october-1st/"&gt;reportedly shut down in April 2022&lt;/a&gt;, and Sprint’s former CDMA 3G network, which the company says it will sunset on January 1st, 2022. T-Mobile hasn’t published a list of affected devices, but customers can &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fresources%2Fbring-your-own-phone%23find-IMEI&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F27%2F22457255%2Fverizon-att-3g-shutdown-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;check their device’s IMEI&lt;/a&gt; to see if it’s LTE and VoLTE compatible, which should indicate whether the device will keep working after the 3G networks are taken offline. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DMHSEz"&gt;The DualSense controller for PS5 has great haptic feedback for games like &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt;. But today I found out that it’s also good at humming along to tunes on Spotify when plugged into a PC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hKj31x"&gt;While browsing Reddit, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/jlmlm4/dualsense_haptic_feedback_works_with_spotify_on_pc/"&gt;I stumbled across an ancient thread&lt;/a&gt; from six months ago where a user explained that, by plugging in a DualSense and tweaking a few settings, the device’s built-in haptics motors will do their best to play your music from the Spotify app on Windows 10. If you press your ear to the controller, it’s like listening into the world’s smallest rave ever, perhaps with a few Astro Bots in attendance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a8oweH"&gt;I assume you just ran to go get your controller to try this out — because that’s the same reaction that I had. Okay, but first lower your expectations before you get started. The haptics likely won’t blow you away, as they aren’t tuned for this particular use case — this is just for fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="TCgo4B"&gt;Plug your controller into your PC via a USB-C cable and wait for Windows to automatically install the driver.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XYlJmp"&gt;Once it’s installed, tap the speaker icon near the bottom-right corner of your display where the time is shown. Set “Speakers (Wireless Controller)” as your audio output. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tRHE3r"&gt;Open the Control Panel and click “Sound.” From there, click on your current audio output and select the “Properties” button just below that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BgENbD"&gt;Click “Enhancements,” the third tab from the left on the pop-up window. Check the box next to “Speaker Fill,” then hit “Apply.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="A6sJeM"&gt;You’ll need to restart the Spotify app for the haptic playback to begin. Once you start the app up again, you should be able to feel your music. You might even be able to hear the haptics motors doing their best at playing the music if you press the DualSense to your ear. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YAmG41"&gt;If you actually want to listen to your music, in addition to feeling it in haptics form, just plug a set of headphones into the DualSense’s 3.5mm jack and the audio will be passed through. Your audio setup will look a little silly this way, but who cares?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="sMEEVu"&gt;Here’s a track that I feel shows off the effect well. Click the Spotify logo in the top right of the embed to have the track open within the PC app:&lt;/p&gt;
