    <title>Apple fires senior engineering program manager Ashley Gjøvik for allegedly leaking information</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xfqpAL"&gt;Apple has fired senior engineering program manager Ashley Gjøvik for allegedly violating the company’s rules against leaking confidential information. For months, Gjøvik has been tweeting openly about allegations of harassment, surveillance, and workplace safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7fO2x3"&gt;“When I began raising workplace safety concerns in March, and nearly immediately faced retaliation and intimidation, I started preparing myself for something exactly like this to happen,” she says. “I’m disappointed that a company I have loved since I was a little girl would treat their employees this way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O0K58X"&gt;Gjøvik has raised concerns that her office is in an Apple building located on a superfund site, meaning it requires special oversight due to historical waste contamination. She also says that she faced harassment and bullying from her manager and members of her team. More recently, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22648265/apple-employee-privacy-icloud-id"&gt;she’s begun raising privacy concerns&lt;/a&gt; related to Apple’s policies on how it can search and surveil employees’ work phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0nYUnz"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Sooo, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Apple&lt;/a&gt; has pics of my boobs. During a discovery thing 3yr ago, legal forced me to hand-over all my texts. They refused to let me delete anything, even "fully personal," even when I said "by fully personal I mean nudes." They said they're in their "permanent evidence locker"&lt;/p&gt;— Ashley M. Gjøvik (@ashleygjovik) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashleygjovik/status/1428495420917837826?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4dviGK"&gt;She was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22610112/apple-female-engineering-manager-leave-sexism-work-environment"&gt;placed on administrative leave in early August&lt;/a&gt; while Apple investigated some of these concerns — a placement she says she requested as a last resort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ayee9"&gt;A member of Apple’s employee relations team reached out to Gjøvik earlier today saying the company was looking into a sensitive intellectual property matter and wanted to speak to her within the hour. Gjøvik said she wanted to keep all communications in writing, and noted she was forwarding the correspondence along to the NLRB, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-national-labor-relations-board-investigating-two-complaints-apple-workers-2021-09-02/"&gt;where she recently filed a charge&lt;/a&gt;. The employee relations representative responded to say that because she had chosen not to participate in the discussion, they would move forward with the information they had and — “given the seriousness of these allegations” — suspend her access to Apple systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TWdgdI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Any bets if I get a literal knock on my physical door from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Apple&lt;/a&gt; today? &lt;a href="https://t.co/oFqw4VFaGi"&gt;pic.twitter.com/oFqw4VFaGi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ashley M. Gjøvik (@ashleygjovik) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashleygjovik/status/1436078307859066890?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PXSOMR"&gt;Hours later, Gjøvik received an email that her employment at Apple was being terminated, effective tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDhGAH"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vape receipts help DOJ nab man who allegedly botnetted thousands of passwords</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q-qMR2bo13723-o2ojmc44Q_GMQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69837773/acastro_170621_1777_0001_fin.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YEfHY3"&gt;28-year-old Ukrainian national Glib Oleksandr Ivanov-Tolpintsev has been &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-mdfl/pr/ukrainian-cyber-criminal-extradited-decrypting-credentials-thousands-computers-across"&gt;indicted by the Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt; for allegedly using a botnet to brute force people’s passwords, and then selling the credentials on a dark web store ominously called The Marketplace. According to the DOJ, Ivanov-Tolpintsev bragged that he was able to get at least 2,000 logins a week, and he allegedly told one of The Marketplace’s admins that he had cracked over 20,000 passwords. The DOJ’s description of the alleged methods and victims serve as a reminder of how much stolen information is out there, and the importance of implementing basic security principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Uk6zG"&gt;The indictment, which can be read in full below, alleges that Ivanov-Tolpintsev talked about controlling a botnet, which is essentially a group of computers whose users don’t know they are infected with malware. He’s accused of using those computers’ power to guess people’s passwords over and over, far faster than he could with his own hardware. Then, according to the DOJ, he would sell those passwords to cybercriminals who used them to carry out fraudulent activity, such as ransomware attacks, or even accessing someone’s home security cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="koEZMo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Botnets can let you guess passwords faster than you could with a single machine&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0FmXpe"&gt;Some of the alleged victims are perhaps a bit surprising. The &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21059498-tolpinstev-complaint"&gt;criminal complaint&lt;/a&gt; lists two victims who were interviewed; one ran an IT business, the other was a security systems consultant who did work for the Department of Corrections. While the two victim’s systems are only a small portion of the over 6,000 compromised logins Ivanov-Tolpintsev is accused of putting up for sale, his alleged contributions are in turn just a drop in the bucket for The Marketplace. According to the complaint, vendors on the site are selling access to over 700,000 machines, and past buyers have used info purchased on The Marketplace to carry out over $100 million of fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vjB4u6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Investigators were able to track Ivanov-Tolpintsev using an email address&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ecplj0"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/irs-ukraine-scammer-vape-store-receipts/"&gt;a report by &lt;em&gt;CyberScoop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, simple mistakes made it easier for investigators to accuse Ivanov-Tolpintsev. The IRS was granted access to email addresses with a warrant, and was able to link the alleged hacker to them using receipts from local vape and smoke shops, scans of his passport, and pictures on Google Photos. The emails also allegedly linked him to other accounts and identities that were related to The Marketplace, where the passwords were sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vy2Qx0"&gt;The DOJ says that if Ivanov-Tolpintsev is found guilty he could face up to 17 years in prison, and would have to hand over more than $80,000 that he allegedly made from selling information. He was originally caught by Polish authorities in late 2020, and was extradited to the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PbxXeG"&gt;The story serves as a reminder of why good security practices are important. Things like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311182/best-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password"&gt;using strong passwords&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22215571/factor-authentication-2fa-apple-microsoft-google-how-to"&gt;two-factor authentication&lt;/a&gt; can help better protect you against brute-force attacks, and occasionally scanning your computer for malware can keep your computer from inadvertently working to crack other people’s passwords. While authorities may be able to catch some cybercriminals, the vastness of The Marketplace (itself just a single site), shows that there’s plenty of people out there trying to get their hands on unprotected data.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Stadia’s director of games has left for Google Cloud</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZhbZyRUZHUV7dQFjBlnrTs5yptI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69837752/akrales_191113_3779_0317.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oFeu31"&gt;Google’s Stadia cloud gaming service appears to have lost &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22334101/jade-raymond-haven-game-studio-playstation"&gt;another&lt;/a&gt; top video game industry veteran — kind of. Jack Buser, Stadia’s Director for Games and a former PlayStation exec, is moving to the company’s Google Cloud division to head up “Gaming Solutions,” according to &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-cloud-zeroes-in-on-gaming-taps-stadia-exec-jack-buser-to-lead-the-way/"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;ZDNet&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w79TN2"&gt;Google confirms Buser is leaving the Stadia group for Google Cloud, providing this statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="rqS3dp"&gt;Gaming is an incredibly important vertical at Google and we’re seeing huge momentum across all products and services. Jack’s new role will allow us to better bring customers the best of Google across our Cloud services, Stadia, YouTube, and more. Stadia continues to be led by its GM Phil Harrison, and Stadia’s business development and partner management teams will continue to be led by Michael Abbattista, who took over the role in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="5qKSzp"&gt;While it’s easy to think Google’s just trying to spin a loss for Stadia as synergy for Google’s bigger gaming goals, it might make a lot of sense for Stadia’s future. As I wrote in February when the company axed its own game studios, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22260994/google-stadia-platform-white-label-option"&gt;the writing’s on the wall&lt;/a&gt; — Stadia boss Phil Harrison sent a clear message that the future of Stadia is to run it as “a technology platform for industry partners,” not a Netflix-of-games or a place to build groundbreaking games of its own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EHkvIm"&gt;And now, it sure sounds like Buser’s going to work on that overall technology platform for Google’s partners, which it already sells as Google Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="SIp3dH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The writing’s on the wall for Google Stadia","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22260994/google-stadia-platform-white-label-option"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="TxZ2N1"&gt;If Google does eventually decide to add Stadia to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20977968/google-graveyard-products-shut-down-dead-not-supported-discontinues-spring-cleaning"&gt;its Google graveyard&lt;/a&gt;, it might be easier to swallow if the company manages to turn it into a different kind of business first. But it could also be that Google has decided to invest more, not less in gaming, by taking it a different route. &lt;em&gt;ZDNet&lt;/em&gt; quotes a Google Cloud spokesperson that gaming “is one of the key verticals we are investing in,” and writes that the idea behind Buser’s move “is to connect with players through a holistic suite of products and services.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="apUOBi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“end-to-end collaboration solutions”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="05Obt4"&gt;“The tech giant could offer, for instance, end-to-end collaboration solutions that include YouTube as a streaming partner for live broadcasts or e-sporting events,” &lt;em&gt;ZDNet &lt;/em&gt;adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="743PRg"&gt;Some of that brings to mind &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22631907/google-gaming-vision-android-windows-mac-cross-screen-controller"&gt;the 70-page confidential Google document&lt;/a&gt; we unearthed from the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial last month, which describes a plan to make Google “the world’s largest game platform” by 2025, starting by bringing roughly 100 Android games to Windows PC, and later expanding to Mac, smart displays, and TVs, all bolstered by Google’s cloud services. The document suggested cloud gaming might be part of that vision too, and that the platform would “super-premium” games as well, with &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; as a representative example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ybb0Ub"&gt;Buser has plenty of experience trying to attract premium games at both Google and at Sony, where he headed up Sony’s own cloud gaming service PlayStation Now, and soon he might have a more attractive pitch to bring those games in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VN2IVc"&gt;While Stadia &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22303496/google-stadia-struggle-wired-bloomberg-reports-studios"&gt;has had some serious struggles&lt;/a&gt;, it’s also been steadily trying to make the service more attractive, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575619/google-stadia-revenue-share-developers-games-summit"&gt;recently slashing its revenue share to hook more developers&lt;/a&gt;, adding &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22624023/stadia-direct-touch-control-scheme-humankind-stadia"&gt;a direct touchscreen control option&lt;/a&gt;, and finally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/31/22603498/google-stadia-controller-chromecast-play-watch-bundle"&gt;bringing Stadia to the Chromecast with Google TV.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic tests Apple with new request: let us relaunch Fortnite in Korea</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7TZ6sK9iqu192z0_337ftVRFx2I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69837530/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zAkiU5"&gt;Epic Games has asked Apple to reinstate its &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; developer account so it can release the game in South Korea, following the passage of a bill that will force Apple and Google to let apps &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22643800/apple-google-south-korea-app-store-payment-legislation-passes"&gt;use alternative payment systems&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IR6usc"&gt;“Epic has asked Apple to restore our &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; developer account,” Epic said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1436105346184056832?s=20"&gt;in a tweet on the official &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; account&lt;/a&gt;. “Epic intends to re-release &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on iOS in Korea offering both Epic payment and Apple payment side-by-side in compliance with the new Korean law.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4mLcOx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Epic has asked Apple to restore our Fortnite developer account. Epic intends to re-release Fortnite on iOS in Korea offering both Epic payment and Apple payment side-by-side in compliance with the new Korean law.&lt;/p&gt;— Fortnite (@FortniteGame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1436105346184056832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rGDyc8"&gt;It’s unclear if Apple will agree to the request, or if Epic’s intentions are genuine: after all, Epic used Apple’s responses to its prior demands &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21368651/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-ban-lawsuit-epic-games-payments"&gt;to help spring its original #FreeFortnite legal trap&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ZdOAo"&gt;In August 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;Apple kicked &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; off the App Store&lt;/a&gt; hours after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366259/epic-fortnite-vbucks-mega-drop-discount-iphone-android"&gt;Epic introduced a direct payment system&lt;/a&gt; to the game that bypassed Apple’s own. Epic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367963/epic-fortnite-legal-complaint-apple-ios-app-store-removal-injunctive-relief"&gt;then sued Apple&lt;/a&gt;, starting off a contentious legal battle between the two companies. The case went to trial &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22454959/epic-apple-trial-recap-video-tim-cook-xbox-playstation-business"&gt;in May&lt;/a&gt;, and we are still awaiting a verdict. The entire time, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; hasn’t been on the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfsEsi"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately reply to our request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is beginning to test labels for bot accounts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zdrA0ZldqBQjcj9HcUNseUl_r88=/0x342:2048x1707/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69837371/pasted_image_0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of what an automated account label looks like on Twitter.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Cb2VMR"&gt;Twitter is beginning to roll out labels for automated accounts (or bot accounts), the company announced Thursday. “Examples of automated accounts you might see on Twitter include bots that help you find vaccine appointments and disaster early warning systems,” &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/automated-account-labels"&gt;Twitter said in an FAQ&lt;/a&gt;. “When these accounts let you know they’re automated, you get a better understanding of their purpose when you’re interacting with them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uLqckn"&gt;Initially, in what Twitter is calling a test, a small number of developers will be invited to be able to apply the labels to their accounts. For accounts in the test that have activated the labels, an “Automated” label will appear on profile pages and on tweets themselves for accounts. Twitter says all developers will be able to use the labels by the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qW6OlE"&gt;

    <title>Refusing to wear a mask on an airplane could now cost you up to $3,000 in fines</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pRMsvv"&gt;Refusing to wear a mask on an airplane is about to get really expensive. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) announced that it was doubling civil penalties for those who refuse to comply with federal mask mandates on commercial airlines, at airports, or on certain forms of public transportation like passenger rail or intercity buses. Repeat offenders could now face fines of up to $3,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8c1Mn8"&gt;First time offenders will be fined $500-$1,000, up from the previous amount of $250. Second offenders will be fined $1,000-$3,000. The new TSA penalties, which are separate from the fines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration for unsafe behavior, will take effect September 10th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="G9oPOE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Wearing a mask protects the traveling public”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lUNMU9"&gt;“Wearing a mask protects the traveling public and all of the personnel who make the travel experience safe, secure, and comfortable,” said Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas in a statement. “We will continue to enforce the mask mandate as long as necessary to protect public health and safety.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DI0Vd5"&gt;The day after he took office, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242249/biden-mask-required-public-transportation-airplane-covid"&gt;President Joe Biden issued an executive order&lt;/a&gt; requiring masks to be worn while traveling by airplanes, buses, or trains. It was an abrupt change from his predecessor Donald Trump, who actively blocked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from issuing a similar order in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2QIZ5F"&gt;That mandate had been set to expire in September 2021, but the TSA today extended it through January 18, 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="et1NOj"&gt;Enforcement of the mask mandate generally falls on airline crews, who have had to deal with a sharp increase in unruly passengers since flights resumed after lockdown. So far this year, the FAA logged 4,184 unruly passenger reports, the vast majority of which — 3,057 — involved mask wearing. Flight attendant union leader Sara Nelson recently said that the situation with poorly behaved passengers on planes was “completely nuts.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FDA has rejected nearly one million flavored e-cigarettes </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O1_ikkqlbqf2l3I19ZYt2FXuQMo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69836982/acastro_190916_1777_juul_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OLiRTC"&gt;After a year-long review of millions of e-cigarette&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;related products, the Food and Drug Administration says it has rejected 946,000 flavored products, prohibiting them from being marketed or sold. It also said that the applications for 4.5 million products were missing materials that the agency required to make a decision. All of those products must also be removed from the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8bX9ui"&gt;The FDA &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-makes-significant-progress-science-based-public-health-application-review-taking-action-over-90?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt; Thursday that it has reviewed 93 percent of the applications submitted, which included 6.5 million products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iWkVjs"&gt;It will continue to review the remaining 7 percent of products. Notably, that group includes e-cigarettes made by Juul, a market leader and the company that drew &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/2/17928616/juul-ecig-vaping-fda-raid-inspection-smoking-nicotine"&gt;federal attention&lt;/a&gt; for its product’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17850376/juul-ecigs-vaping-fda-smoking-nicotine-health-science"&gt;popularity&lt;/a&gt; among kids and teenagers, the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fda-to-seek-more-time-to-decide-fate-of-juul-11631196029?mod=pls_whats_news_us_business_f"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. Juul only submitted applications for its tobacco- and menthol-flavored products — it stopped selling its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/17/20919415/juul-suspends-sale-fruity-flavor-pods-ecigarette"&gt;fruit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/7/20953865/juul-mint-flavor-discontinue-ban-fda-vaping-illness"&gt;mint&lt;/a&gt; flavors in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oBMKAu"&gt;The announcement marks the end of a year-long period where companies were allowed to sell vaping and e-cigarette products while the FDA reviewed applications from manufacturers. It’s also a turning point for the industry, which spent years operating outside the typical regulations around tobacco products. The FDA’s rules state that any new tobacco products have to submit an application and get authorization before they’re marketed and sold. As of 2016, vaping products and e-cigarettes were subject to those rules. But for years, the FDA deferred any enforcement, allowing those products to continue to be sold.  In 2019 a federal judge said companies had until September 2020 to submit their applications to stay on the market and ordered the FDA to review those applications within a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wtVwOd"&gt;Now, any vaping and e-cigarette products that stay on the market without authorization are “marketed unlawfully,” the FDA warned in its statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dox2sc"&gt;The FDA’s review focused on whether a vaping or e-cigarette product had enough benefit to adult smokers — like helping adults smokers quit cigarettes — to outweigh the risk of attracting kids and teenagers. The rejected flavored products didn’t meet that bar because flavors are popular with kids and teenagers, the agency said. Teen vaping spiked in 2018 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21429132/vaping-ecig-teens-decrease-school-juul-cdc"&gt;before dropping off&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, and the products were blamed for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/15/18096316/electronic-cigarette-flavor-ban-vaping-fda-pods-juul-myblu"&gt;hooking kids&lt;/a&gt; on nicotine who may have never started smoking otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dVvJAx"&gt;“Continuing to take appropriate regulatory actions to protect the public, especially youth, from the harms of tobacco products remains one of the agency’s highest priorities,” Janet Woodcock, acting FDA commissioner, and Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The biggest announcements and best trailers from Sony’s PlayStation Showcase 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oiY6xFSXnsVKjMl2-A1ezYOlIHM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69836944/vpavic_4278_20201030_0206.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UWo6Pz"&gt;Sony is the latest video game company to put on a big virtual event, and its PlayStation Showcase 2021 didn’t disappoint. It was a chance to show off some of the biggest games coming to the PS5, and while there were some notable absences — Sony still isn’t talking much about the next generation of PlayStation VR — we were able to catch a glimpse of highly-anticipated titles like &lt;em&gt;God of War: Ragnarok&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man 2&lt;/em&gt;, and a remake of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic&lt;/em&gt;. There were even a few surprises, like a new &lt;em&gt;Wolverine&lt;/em&gt; game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rRlOoq"&gt;Here’s everything you need to catch up on the showcase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Xu790i"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lL-RfE-ioJ8?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="QJaWaJ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665460/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-ps5-darth-revan"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knights of the old Republic&lt;/em&gt; is getting a next-gen remake&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="OaJjQS"&gt;Sony opened the show with a reveal that’s been rumored for some time: the classic Star Wars role-playing game &lt;em&gt;Knights of the Old Republic&lt;/em&gt; is getting a next-gen remake. However, aside from the fact that it’s coming to the PS5, that’s all we know right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nZ5DK7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qIQ3xNqkVC4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="p8HidK"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665533/spider-man-2-insomniac-games-peter-parker-miles-morales-venom-ps5-2023"&gt;Insomniac is making &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665529/insomniac-wolverine-ps5"&gt;and a &lt;em&gt;Wolverine&lt;/em&gt; game&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7EjJqd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; developer Insomniac had plenty of news to share. Not only is the studio working on a sequel that’s due out in 2023 and features Venom, but it’s also working on another superhero title with a mysterious Wolverine game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wldD4i"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EE-4GvjKcfs?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="e59Hmt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665085/sony-god-of-war-ragnarok-playstation-ps5-showcase"&gt;We finally have a &lt;em&gt;God of War: Ragnarok&lt;/em&gt; trailer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="SDvaXH"&gt;It’s been a long-time coming, but the sequel to the acclaimed God of War reboot now has a trailer, so you can see what Kratos and Atreus have been up to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HGJJhK"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OfcDN-Yewh8?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ExdAy1"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands&lt;/em&gt; has a release date&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="aA39Hr"&gt;Gearbox’s fantasy spin on &lt;em&gt;Borderlands&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22528190/tiny-tinas-wonderlands-2k-gearbox-andy-samberg-wanda-sykes-summer-game-fest"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tiny Tina’s Wonderland&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, now has a release date: the game will be out on March 25th. You can get another glimpse at it in the new trailer above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IdjmxZ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AdZUrXCqUck?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mvQTUy"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Forspoken &lt;/em&gt;has a new trailer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="zsFfED"&gt;Curious name aside, Forspoken is one of the more interesting action games on the horizon, and the latest trailer shows off the fast-paced movement and combat, along with plenty of spells. It’s expected to launch next spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="d1gYbd"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mRVBZC-RJF0?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="wAMHGk"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665443/sony-playstation-showcase-alan-wake-remastered-trailer"&gt;Here’s what the Alan Wake remaster looks like&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="5Kqkay"&gt;We already knew Remedy was remastering &lt;em&gt;Alan Wake&lt;/em&gt;, but now the developer has finally shown off what the spooky new version looks like with a brief trailer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="msRNLd"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xQT-O1nMSBU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="z3Hg9A"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/em&gt; is coming to PS5 next March&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="wFvz2n"&gt;The next-gen version of &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/em&gt; — which, it should be noted, originally launched in 2013 — is coming to the PlayStation 5 next year, with an expected March debut. The wildly popular GTA Online will also be available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kAEPuF"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XWpsAKYa7NQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="AnY6tw"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Ghostwire Tokyo&lt;/em&gt; still looks hot&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Mlmro8"&gt;I don’t have a lot to say here other than &lt;em&gt;Ghostwire: Tokyo&lt;/em&gt;, from Tango Gameworks, looks amazing. Check out the new trailer above — the game is slated for a spring launch on PS5 and PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zJI3l9"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QNUzGew1EN4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="A3q9LT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665509/radiohead-epic-games-kid-a-mnesia-exhibition-ps5"&gt;Radiohead is making... something with Epic Games&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Pfandi"&gt;Radiohead has partnered with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; developer Epic on a project described as “an upside-down digital / analogue universe created from Thom Yorke and Stanley Donwood’s original artwork and audio design by Nigel Godrich. It commemorates the coming of age of Radiohead’s records, Kid A and Amnesiac.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xvTu52"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IfrfJn_-24g?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IScaxS"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22661816/sony-playstation-showcase-uncharted-legacy-of-thieves-collection-ps5-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uncharted &lt;/em&gt;is also getting some remasters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="CSLULi"&gt;The two most recent &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; games, &lt;em&gt;A Thief’s End&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Lost Legacy&lt;/em&gt;, are being remastered. The surprise is that they’re not just coming to the PS5 but also the PC. The collection is expected early next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="K2VIyF"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1tBUsXIkG1A?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="pjl8o1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22664477/gran-turismo-7-ps5-racing-march-2022-trailer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo 7&lt;/em&gt; is coming next March&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="yngTU9"&gt;It wouldn’t be a Sony event without PlayStation’s premier racing series, so it was nice to see a slick new &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo 7&lt;/em&gt; trailer appear. Even better: the game has a release date of March 4th, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zL67cj"&gt;Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed a bill regulating how social media companies moderate content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rTkh5R"&gt;&lt;a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=872&amp;amp;Bill=HB20"&gt;The new law&lt;/a&gt;, passed as HB 20 in early September, controversially prohibits banning (or demonetizing or otherwise restricting) content based on “the viewpoint of the user or another person,” whether or not that viewpoint is expressed on the social media platform itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u7AeNL"&gt;HB 20 also requires social media services to disclose how they promote and moderate content and mandates transparency reports similar to those produced by Facebook, Google, and other major web companies. If platforms are notified of illegal content, the law requires them to evaluate it within 48 hours, a policy that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21302170/facebook-google-brian-schatz-john-thune-section-230-content-moderation"&gt;mirrors at least one proposal&lt;/a&gt; in US Congress. (Unlike Congress, however, a state legislative body can’t override Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act — which governs much moderation of illegal content online.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BhVNkt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Email providers can’t filter messages based on content... unless they’re spam&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L6rRpp"&gt;Companies that break the rules could face a civil lawsuit or action from the attorney general. The law applies to web services with more than 50 million active users that let people “communicate with other users for the primary purpose of posting information, comments, messages, or images,” not including internet service providers and news or entertainment sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qe8TCp"&gt;The law also includes a section specifically aimed at email platforms — making it unlawful to “intentionally impede the transmission of another person ’s electronic mail message based on the content of the message” unless the company believes it contains malicious code, obscenity, illegal content, or violations of an existing Texas &lt;a href="https://codes.findlaw.com/tx/business-and-commerce-code/bus-com-sect-321-114.html"&gt;anti-spam law&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7F8fFP"&gt;The Texas law is one of several Republican efforts to scare web companies away from removing objectionable but lawful content, a fight &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/09/02/texas-social-media-censorship-legislature/"&gt;conservative politicians have framed&lt;/a&gt; as an anti-censorship battle against companies that are akin to phone companies or other communications utilities. It follows a similar Florida law covering social media, although it doesn’t include some of that rule’s more distinctive provisions, like protections for political candidates and an exemption for companies that own a theme park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6C6u9v"&gt;The rule’s future, however, is uncertain. It’s likely to face legal challenges from critics, and unlike the recent Texas abortion ban, it’s not tailored to &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/8/31/22650303/supreme-court-abortion-texas-sb8-jackson-roe-wade-greg-abbott"&gt;evade judicial scrutiny&lt;/a&gt;. A judge &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22558086/florida-social-media-theme-park-law-preliminary-injunction-lawsuit"&gt;blocked Florida’s social media law&lt;/a&gt; in June, saying it “compels providers to host speech that violates their standards.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wTOagb"&gt;NetChoice, one of the plaintiffs in that Florida lawsuit, released a statement condemning the bill. “HB 20 has the same First Amendment flaws as the Florida law that a federal court blocked this summer. The same outcome will almost certainly occur in Texas,” said NetChoice president Steve DelBianco in a statement. So far, however, it hasn’t committed to a similar lawsuit there.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Radiohead teams up with Epic Games for Kid A Mnesia: Exhibition</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rO3yeYx3aW5Q4ZC5ltLEHgeQuas=/201x0:2181x1320/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69836847/Screen_Shot_2021_09_09_at_4.36.56_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jifBzt"&gt;Radiohead is teaming up with Epic Games for &lt;em&gt;Kid A Mnesia: Exhibition&lt;/em&gt; — an interactive experience coming to PlayStation 5, PC, and Mac in November as part of the band’s upcoming Kid A Mnesia release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nnaPV2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kid A Mnesia&lt;/em&gt; is a commemorative rerelease of Radiohead’s iconic albums &lt;em&gt;Kid A&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Amnesiac, &lt;/em&gt;along with a third, new album — &lt;em&gt;Kid Amnesiae&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; —&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; of unreleased material from the two original albums’ recording sessions. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vlL0U1B7JNijFcNMSXXdxWcdV8A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22838137/Screen_Shot_2021_09_09_at_4.37.04_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GzkJmt"&gt;According to the announcement, the &lt;em&gt;Kid A Mnesia: Exhibition &lt;/em&gt;for PlayStation will be an  “upside-down digital / analogue universe created from original artwork and recordings” to accompany the rerelease. Given Epic’s recent taste for interactive musical experiences, it’s likely that &lt;em&gt;Kid A Mnesia: Exhibition &lt;/em&gt;will offer some sort of experiential new lens into Radiohead’s music, but we’ll find out for sure in November. &lt;/p&gt;
