    <title>Casio announces first Wear OS smartwatch in iconic G-Shock lineup</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zWvMaQFaBxOGXMqSWEL1udBtu5w=/0x0:1349x899/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69060838/HIz0xsGodYbCgfDTr0wQnBUPKg9xx4TJHrFkK9c9.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Casio&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n3nGLi"&gt;Casio has announced the first Wear OS smartwatch in its long-running G-Shock lineup: the &lt;a href="https://world.g-shock.com/asia-mea/en/products/g-squad/gsw-h1000/"&gt;GSW-H1000&lt;/a&gt;. The watch will retail for $699 in the US or £599 in the UK, and it will be available in red, blue, or black. With shock resistance and water resistance up to a depth of 200 meters, Casio says the GSW-H1000 is a fitness-focused wearable designed for everything from surfing to snowboarding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oJWpVl"&gt;The watchmaker has been releasing devices using Google’s smartwatch OS since 2016, when it released the Android Wear-powered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/29/11525360/casio-smart-outdoor-watch-fs10-android-wear-review"&gt;Casio Smart Outdoor Watch&lt;/a&gt;. But this is the first time Google’s software has appeared on a G-Shock watch. The G-Shock lineup dates back to the 1980s, and the watches have a reputation for being some of the hardest-wearing around. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1E4uO4snjIFs7Hnzn5FA2_pe-e4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22413325/qwpwTYcRiQLJMBe09VsOrPSSxeVnnuUPnpPOoyVA.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Casio&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Its dual-layer display includes one monochrome and one color panel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="o4WFNn"&gt;The GSW-H1000 comes with many of the features expected on a fitness-focused smartwatch. There’s an optical heart rate sensor, and Casio’s built-in software supports 15 activities and 24 indoor workout options. The watch supports GPS and has a built-in compass, altitude sensor, accelerometer, and gyrometer. Wear OS means there’s Google Assistant and Google Fit support, and you can download apps from Google Play. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yOKBOe"&gt;In terms of hardware, the watch has a 1.2-inch 360 x 360 dual-layer display that combines a monochrome always-on LCD display with a color LCD panel. Battery life is rated at around one and a half days if you’re using the color display, extending to up to a month if you only use the watch for timekeeping and sensors. A full charge takes around three hours, according to Casio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DgKXW0"&gt;With rumors of an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22351979/apple-watch-rugged-extreme-sports-rumor-bloomberg"&gt;extreme sport-focused Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt; on the horizon, Casio and other rugged smartwatch manufacturers could soon be facing a lot more competition. But on paper at least, the GSW-H1000 looks like it could be up to the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dl8QOG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n6SaA3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MSCHF will not ship its 666th pair of Satan Shoes after Nike lawsuit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="MSCHF / Lil Nas X “Satan Shoes”" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DSo7qWDud-cy0T0HpvOOTyVS1qM=/64x0:1984x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69060672/Exbfpl2WgAAQkl8_resized.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: MSCHF&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zW2fyM"&gt;Internet collective MSCHF says it’s not infringing on Nike’s trademark with a pair of exclusive, blood-infused “Satan Shoes,” setting the stage for a bigger legal battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5sZFex"&gt;After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357225/nike-sues-lil-nas-x-unauthorized-satan-shoes-mschf"&gt;filing a lawsuit earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, Nike sought a &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nyed.461880/gov.uscourts.nyed.461880.7.0.pdf"&gt;temporary restraining order&lt;/a&gt; to bar MSCHF from fulfilling any orders of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/28/style/nike-satan-shoes-lil-Nas-x.html"&gt;its Satan Shoes&lt;/a&gt; — a $1,018 Nike sneaker embellished with a pentagram and allegedly injected with ink and a single drop of blood. But &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nyed.461880/gov.uscourts.nyed.461880.14.0.pdf"&gt;in a response&lt;/a&gt; filed yesterday, MSCHF says all but one pair of the shoes, a 666 pair collaboration with rapper Lil Nas X, have already shipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cU0BRT"&gt;“Contrary to Nike’s speculation in its papers, all but one pair of the shoes already have been sold and shipped. MSCHF has no intention of issuing additional Satan Shoes,” MSCHF’s attorneys wrote in a response to the Nike suit. The collective says it planned to give away the last pair on April 2nd, but it’s suspended that plan due to the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Nike’s legal exhibit distinguishing standard Nike shoe from “unauthorized Satan Shoe”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WCD9l551DV_WlLU8LxbUNSjFM0E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22406803/Screen_Shot_2021_03_29_at_7.20.44_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nike&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fNeqry"&gt;Nike claimed that MSCHF sold its shoes using Nike branding but modified them in ways that tarnish Nike’s brand. It cited internet commenters who believed the shoes were official products. But MSCHF argues that buyers knew Nike hadn’t designed the Satan Shoes. It also accuses Nike of singling out the Satan Shoe while ignoring a similar 2019 “Jesus Shoe.” In a footnote to a court filing, Nike says it may amend the suit to include Jesus Shoes, but it’s not targeting them because they aren’t being sold at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hOjBwQ"&gt;MSCHF argues that since “there will be no further distribution of Satan Shoes” for now, Nike won’t suffer harm that would require a restraining order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LdeMzy"&gt;More generally, MSCHF says the shoes are works of artistic social commentary — comparable to signed Banksy prints. “These shoes are works of art that are intended to criticize the ever popular ‘collab culture,’ where brands like Nike collaborate with anyone willing to make a splash,” its response says. They were sold in partnership with Lil Nas X, but they were also “portrayed as a collaboration with Satan himself (a comment on the extreme collab culture).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fvaBgO"&gt;In the filing, MSCHF basically admits that the Satan Shoes were more of a one-off stunt than a full-fledged commercial product. But if the two parties go to court, they could set a legal precedent for the entire fashion world, particularly online sellers who “upcycle” or heavily modify designer clothes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Let this be the year April Fools’ Day for brands dies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cCXeQmnOnaSSmjqHWCZoYJUx3jE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69060563/jbareham_170330_1577_0005_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XbfsVr"&gt;Today is April 1st, one of the worst days on the internet every year. For the rest of the day, the internet will be filled with an unending parade of dumb PR stunts, fake products, lie-filled press releases, and just plain unfunny jokes that have been filtered through layers and layers of corporate branding teams as to be unrecognizable as humor by normal humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zaZl1A"&gt;Last year, the holiday fell at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic; faced with the unspeakable human tragedy that was unfolding on a daily basis, most companies elected to opt out of the holiday. Some, like Google, have wisely chosen to once again &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360619/google-april-fools-2021-prank-cancel"&gt;pull their April Fools’ gags&lt;/a&gt; in light of the current state of the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvWgzZ"&gt;And yet, April 1st has rolled around once again, and like villainous treasure hunters in an Indiana Jones movie&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; it seems brands just can’t stop opening the box of forbidden knowledge and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcR9k8o4I0w"&gt;getting their faces melted off&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="l9kCz9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"April Fools’ Day is canceled, you monsters","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201179/april-fools-day-2020-is-canceled"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="8JDTQE"&gt;The latest example of this cautionary tale is Volkswagen, which, earlier this week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22357166/volkswagen-name-change-voltswagen-us-division"&gt;messed up so spectacularly&lt;/a&gt; with a fake rebranding that created a backlash so severe that I truly hope that it ends the practice forever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wjHCVk"&gt;As it stands, there are only four options for a brand in 2021 pulling this nonsense:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="5nB7Qf"&gt;Don’t do an April Fools’ joke. Put the time and energy into doing something productive that will materially benefit the world (or, less idealistically, your business) instead. Or just don’t do anything. Abstaining entirely would still be a net positive over the drain of resources and mental energy. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tFm8xo"&gt;Do an April Fools’ “joke” but actually follow through on your stunt. This is arguably not a prank, since you’ve actually created a video game skin or a real product that people can buy — but it doesn’t really hurt anyone. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KbCzsB"&gt;Do an April Fools’ joke but be extremely clear from the start that this is a dumb joke and you have no intention of doing the thing that you are “humorously” pretending to do. Does this defeat the purpose of doing an April Fools’ joke because you’re not “fooling” anyone anymore? Absolutely. (Please see my first two points.) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jlDza6"&gt;Lie to your customers, successfully tricking them into believing you are making some product, rebranding, or service you are not. By doing so, you will almost certainly annoy everyone once your deceit is made plain for the extremely small gain of pointless PR. The aphorism goes that there is no such thing as bad publicity; the seemingly endless line of companies willing to make fools out of themselves has proven this false time and time again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="Qwqt7p"&gt;In a more logical world, brand managers and social media strategists the world over would simply take the day off, realizing there’s simply no benefit in risking your customers’ ire (or, in some cases, your entire good name) to celebrate a toxic internet holiday that was never much fun to begin with. Unfortunately, today — as happens every year — the brands will almost certainly refuse to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The stonks guy is now in Fortnite</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PDYBACveX-OFk315bvGI-8T0UnY=/600x0:3840x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69060557/Fortnite_20210401092640.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5c42NB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; has added a new skin to its collection that may look a touch familiar to internet dweebs. Diamond Hanz, introduced in Chapter 2, season 6, is a play on the beloved stonks man, but now on your squad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d1yzZ0"&gt;By “stonks,” I am of course talking about this:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0C68cr7C6V-7_G_-T0OQC9Gnfgg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22413053/Screen_Shot_2021_04_01_at_9.33.25_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Fv7vG1"&gt;For 1,200 V-Bucks, this rugged and weirdly kind of hot version of Mr. Stonks (a Megan Farokhmanesh™ official, do not steal) can be yours. He’s here to dance and ruin my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gzBiyN"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The   has been rung and Diamond Hanz is ready to answer the call. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Buy! Hold! Win! &lt;a href="https://t.co/bmP1czr326"&gt;pic.twitter.com/bmP1czr326&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Fortnite (@FortniteGame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1377607605250588673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TBDvro"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; has an already admirable collection of skins celebrating &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22276283/fortnite-tron-crossover-skins-light-cycles"&gt;pop culture&lt;/a&gt;, fruit, and more, but this one is especially... special. Why anyone would suddenly be interested in stocks, I &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;can’t&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22254656/robinhood-gamestop-stonks-trade-freeze-class-action-lawsuits"&gt;possibly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323839/gamestop-stock-price-dramatic-rise-fall-stonks-return"&gt;imagine&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Sony RA5000 speaker review: extravagant sound at an unreasonable price</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;It’s a very Sony product, in ways both good and bad&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Q70ANO"&gt;Sony’s new SRS-RA5000 is a $700 single-unit speaker that is filled to the brim with drivers, has convenient features like Spotify Connect and Chromecast built in, and is capable of producing immersive 360-degree audio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l9cGvb"&gt;Though it’s only coming to market now, the RA5000 dates back to CES 2019, where Sony exhibited it as a prototype speaker for its new-for-the-time 360 Reality Audio format. So it’s been in the hopper for a while. Same goes for the smaller, less expensive RA3000, which Sony demonstrated a year later at CES 2020. Now they’ve both evolved into consumer products and look practically unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yxeEOe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10423047"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fva7Ym"&gt;At 13 inches tall, the RA5000 is much bigger than any smart speaker. And yes, from the top, it absolutely looks like an oversized electric razor, thanks to the three round speaker grilles. If this thing was all white, you might confuse it for some kind of futuristic humidifier or air purifier. But Sony has stuck with the mix of black and rose gold that has been the signature look for many of its recent headphones and earbuds. I continue to dig the contrast this creates, and the speaker’s sides are covered in a knitted fabric that hides the innards. There are touch-sensitive buttons on the left and right sides. You get volume and play / pause on the right, with the left side handling power, mode selection (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or aux input), and a calibration feature that tweaks the sound for whatever room the RA5000 is in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7_Qzi9eQ2AWkiouUob_l_qQgsDE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22410858/cwelch_20210330_4498_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s no denying the electric razor resemblance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QVdWeA"&gt;The internal layout breaks down like this: there are three up-firing speakers, three outward-facing speakers positioned at the middle of the speaker’s sides, and a single subwoofer at the bottom. Around back is a 3.5-millimeter input and a little NFC icon, which you can hold an Android phone to for quick pairing. Underneath the speaker is where the power cord plugs in, and the RA5000 comes with a big honking external power supply. That’s something I didn’t expect to see considering how large the product already is. It needs to be plugged into power at all times, so Sony’s fancy speaker is wireless but by no means portable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MKE89O"&gt;The setup process is… a lot. Sony’s mobile app guides you through numerous steps like adding the RA5000 to the Google Home app, bringing it aboard your Wi-Fi network, linking it to Amazon’s Alexa platform, and more. The speaker initially had a lot of trouble connecting to my home Wi-Fi, but with some persistence, eventually it worked. As is standard for Sony, the app isn’t very polished or pretty, but it gets the job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e9-CflP3Z6IXRfpKtg1ptMR89Wg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22410863/cwelch_20210330_4498_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The RA5000 has touch-sensitive capacitive controls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lP0dV6"&gt;The RA5000 offers a ton of flexibility for how you play music on it. You can pair a device to the speaker via Bluetooth — AAC and SBC codecs are there, but not LDAC — but you’ll get far better quality when the music is coming over Wi-Fi. There’s built-in Chromecast support for audio casting, and the RA5000 can also be added to a speaker group with either Google Home or Amazon Alexa. I’d have loved for Sony to round out the streaming options with AirPlay 2, but no such luck. The speaker hardware includes a microphone, but this is only used for the calibration feature. You’ll have to rely on another device to get music playing on the RA5000 with your voice, but since it’s compatible with both Alexa and Assistant, this can be done wirelessly with a cheap smart speaker or your phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HIeCEp"&gt;When in traditional stereo mode, this speaker is a powerhouse, though you might expect more bass for the size. (There are EQ options in the Sony app if you want to boost the low end.) It easily blanketed both my living room and bedroom with sound; the up-firing drivers help give it a very full presence. In my average listening, I never pushed volume beyond the 60 percent range. Going much higher would probably result in some very annoyed neighbors if you’re in an apartment. But despite its big, boisterous sound, there’s no mistaking the RA5000 for a proper set of stereo speakers. It sounds every bit like the single enclosure it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EhrK46evmxQMbmYs1PhSxyC0Ros=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22410923/cwelch_20210330_4498_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It dwarfs most other smart speakers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3fSalD"&gt;And that leads us to the standout trick: 360-degree audio. Sony’s &lt;a href="https://www.sony.com/electronics/360-reality-audio#speakers"&gt;360 Reality Audio&lt;/a&gt; uses object-based spatial audio to try to build a captivating soundscape. The pitch is that it can feel “as real as if you are there at a live concert or with the artist recording in a studio.” When you close your eyes and listen to 360 Reality Audio, the RA5000 definitely sounds bigger and wider than its physical footprint. It’s a noticeable change from plain stereo. But does it put me in some mind-blowing sphere of music coming from all directions? No, not really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xWfD5c"&gt;When you hop between 360 tracks, you’ll notice that not all content really takes advantage of its scope. It remains unclear how involved and invested most artists really are when it comes to these 360 mixes, so I’m skeptical of any claims that this is how songs were meant to be heard. Jazz sounds fantastic; the instrumentation really benefits from bouncing off walls and your ceiling. Concert recordings, like Liam Gallagher performing Oasis hit “Champagne Supernova” with an enthusiastic sing-along crowd, also have an impressive breadth to them that feels distinct from regular stereo sound. The LED at the bottom of the speaker illuminates green when you’re playing true 360 Reality Audio music. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KHGqkbF2B_iWXPzjO7C9cy40nXI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22410857/cwelch_20210330_4498_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The speaker supports music over Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or aux input.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QRDbly"&gt;Only a few music streaming services, including Tidal, Deezer, and Nugs.net, support Sony’s 360 Reality Audio at present. Amazon Music HD will also let you play 360 audio on the RA5000 as of April 6th. You can cast 3D audio directly from these apps to the speaker. But even among services that offer 360 Reality Audio, adoption from musicians and labels has a long way to go. Not a single song in Tidal’s “Top Tracks” section had 360 Reality Audio, nor did any of the Top Albums. That really speaks volumes. There’s a dedicated section in the explore tab where you can easily browse through playlists and albums that &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; support 360-degree audio. A vast majority of it is older stuff, but recent records like Haim’s &lt;em&gt;Women in Music Pt. III&lt;/em&gt; are there, too, as are hit singles like Harry Styles’ “Watermelon Sugar.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fO8mAW6L13cyB4aYFpoaOdR5ges=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22410862/cwelch_20210330_4498_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The unconventional looks fit the novel 360-degree sound.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MtxMvW"&gt;To make up for the lack of content that’s truly mixed for 360, Sony includes an “immersive audio enhancement” setting that attempts to re-create the same effect for two-channel music tracks. This algorithm-powered approach doesn’t work nearly as well. Toggling it on adds an obvious layer of artificial reverb and ambience to everything that you play, and you lose the soundstage precision that’s there with genuine 360 Reality Audio content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="TyIVuO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10423057"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FJLVWH"&gt;At its eye-popping price of $700, finding direct “competitors” for the RA5000 is complicated. There’s a HomePod-looking device in Sony’s promotional video, but that Apple speaker was less than half the price and is now history. The $500 Sonos Five is my favorite single-unit speaker, but it sticks to stereo audio. Then you’ve got high-end, luxury audio alternatives like &lt;a href="https://www.bowerswilkins.com/formation/wedge"&gt;the $900 Formation Wedge speaker&lt;/a&gt; from Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins, but again, that’s aiming for an audiophile-grade stereo experience. Sony’s speaker outperforms the $200 Amazon Echo Studio and can crank much louder — but that’s exactly what I’d expect considering the huge price gulf. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="cET0tt"&gt;So the question I’m left with is this: who is this speaker &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt;? It sounds excellent, can satisfyingly fill any normal-sized room, and 360 Reality Audio is a fun party trick. But the asking price is hard to get over. A lot of people who are serious about audio gear would sooner pay for a nice pair of stereo bookshelf speakers than drop $700 on this single unit. I think Sony’s trying to make the RA5000 a jack of all trades — led by immersive sound and an array of convenient streaming options. But I come away feeling like this speaker just tries to do too much, especially when the worth of its headline feature remains unproven and often inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>COVID-19 vaccine ‘passports’ aren’t exactly like yellow fever certifications</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1G04acgkwLVu6QyuL6MfCVO9XAo=/241x0:2098x1238/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69060509/Screen_Shot_2021_03_31_at_3.47.45_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York state already launched a COVID-19 vaccine certification program.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iXDNpY"&gt;Businesses and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356333/covid-vaccine-certification-passport-biden"&gt;governments&lt;/a&gt; are developing COVID-19 vaccine certifications that let people prove they’ve been immunized so they could enter spaces or travel without as much worry that they’d get sick or pass the virus to others. Conservative politicians &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-vaccine-passports-desantis/2021/03/30/eeb41124-9171-11eb-9668-89be11273c09_story.html"&gt;recently seized&lt;/a&gt; on these efforts as evidence of government overreach, while other people argued the certifications a more benign public health tool — one that’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AstroKatie/status/1377231031644868611"&gt;analogous&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JamesFallows/status/1376640473222279176"&gt;strategies&lt;/a&gt; we’ve uses to manage disease for decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QcZXGm"&gt;“Usually, the reality is somewhere in the middle, and that’s the case for this as well,” says Lisa Lee, director of the division of Scholarly Integrity and Research Compliance at Virginia Tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Pliave"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Usually, the reality is somewhere in the middle, and that’s the case for this as well.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l7Q8S1"&gt;There’s a reason these types of tools feel familiar. Using proof of vaccination to enter a country or participate in certain activities is nothing new: many African and South American countries require visitors to get yellow fever vaccines before they arrive. In the US, many people have to get a flu shot for work, and certain vaccinations are required for people to attend schools and colleges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZhLzyX"&gt;But there are a few things that make the proposed COVID-19 certifications different from these familiar guidelines. They may not be the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-vaccine-passports-desantis/2021/03/30/eeb41124-9171-11eb-9668-89be11273c09_story.html"&gt;government overreach boogeyman&lt;/a&gt; raised by many conservative politicians, but there are lingering ethical questions around them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ALAX7o"&gt;For one, the shots aren’t easily available to most people in the world. Many high-income countries have vaccinated tens of millions of people, while lower-income countries have secured &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/03/31/world/global-vaccine-supply-inequity.html"&gt;far fewer doses&lt;/a&gt;. In countries like the United States, which has enough vaccine doses for all adults, lower-income and non-white people are &lt;a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/health-equity/how-inequities-are-surfacing-covid-19-vaccine-distribution"&gt;less likely&lt;/a&gt; to be able to access those shots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tynS0z"&gt;“What we’re going to have at least for the next year or probably two is a very inequitable distribution of vaccines,” says Chris Beyrer, a professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Requiring a COVID-19 vaccine certification to enter a country could be discriminatory if most people aren’t able to get vaccinated, Beyrer says. “People in wealthy countries with access to vaccines will be able to move around the world again, and the world’s poor or people in low- and middle-income countries are going to be trapped.” The past year has shown that pandemics are more of a burden on some groups than others, and this could risk adding to that existing inequity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mt9akh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“What we’re going to have at least for the next year or probably two is a very inequitable distribution of vaccines.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1U6Kva"&gt;Even where vaccines are more plentiful, there are still quandaries around using vaccine status as a permission slip for work or other activities. In the United States, COVID-19 vaccines are also not fully approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). They’re available under an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22189236/fda-approval-authorization-difference-clearance-vaccines"&gt;emergency use authorization&lt;/a&gt;, a slightly lower standard that lets the agency sign off on a product when there are no other options available and the benefits outweigh the risks. Companies are still studying these vaccines. While there aren’t major concerns about the vaccines available in the US, there’s still a lot we don’t know about them. The quasi-experimental nature of these vaccines makes mandating vaccinations ethically complicated, Beyrer says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfXqve"&gt;Unlike other vaccine certification programs, these new vaccine passports are not just on the table for things like travel or school admissions — which officials use to stop a disease from spreading to a new place and to make sure students are protected. Instead, many businesses say they’re going to ask people to show their vaccination status to do things like attend a sporting event. That’s something different from any other vaccination credential strategy used normally in the US, Lee says. “This is not a brand new concept, but the issue that makes it so unusual is that it’s something you’d have to do for admittance into a daily event. That’s not something we’re used to doing,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CpnCt3"&gt;It’s not surprising for people to be concerned about those plans, Lee says, even if they could help make sure in-person events don’t become superspreaders. She thinks the fears of government officials stopping people on a whim to demand they show proof of their shots is probably overblown. The Biden administration has &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-vaccine-passports-desantis/2021/03/30/eeb41124-9171-11eb-9668-89be11273c09_story.html"&gt;stressed&lt;/a&gt; that there won’t be a federally mandated or centralized COVID-19 vaccine credential. But this is a new way to use vaccine information, and it’s not out of line for people to express discomfort with it, Lee says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UTHK1N"&gt;Some of the concerns around COVID-19 vaccine certifications are temporary. Eventually, the shots will be more widely available, and the equity issues won’t apply in the same way. The FDA will also officially license COVID-19 vaccines at some point. After we cross those two checkpoints, a COVID-19 vaccine certificate requirement to enter a country &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; actually be analogous to a yellow fever certificate, Beyrer says. When the FDA licenses the vaccines, asking people who work in a hospital to show that they’ve been immunized would more closely resemble flu shot requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2C50RZ"&gt;By the time that happens, though, the pandemic may no longer be in the emergency phase. When the spread of the virus subsides around the world, vaccine certifications may seem less necessary and be less justifiable in some cases. If there’s very little coronavirus circulating in a community, it’s less of a risk that someone at, for example, a sporting event might catch or carry it. The next few months are probably when they’d offer the most protection. But unfortunately, that’s also the time frame when the shots will be the hardest to get, Lee says. “It is a little bit of a paradox that when we would want it the most, it’s the least ethical to do.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KK7jtd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to type special characters on a Windows PC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KyFfDbSg1BrFhmUnbhFSkzciu-Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69029603/mchin_190527_4449_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nBtPSS"&gt;Here’s the situation: you’re typing a report for work, and you suddenly have to write the phrase “Jones née Berkowitz.” Or you are adding a phrase in Spanish and need to use the word “años.” How do you add the special characters to the letters?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2JFT5W"&gt;Special characters (also known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic"&gt;diacritical marks&lt;/a&gt;) may be more common in certain languages, but there are plenty of circumstances in which English speakers may need to use them. But because they are so rare in English, native English speakers may not have learned how to add those marks to documents, emails, or other writings. It’s not difficult to add them to your Windows document, although it’s not quite as smooth an operation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22347140/apple-mac-special-characters-how-to"&gt;as on a Mac&lt;/a&gt;, where all you have to do is hold the appropriate key down. (In fact, once upon a time, you would have had to look up the symbol character codes...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="F2UXCI"&gt;Use the touch keyboard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cK212s"&gt;The easiest way to add diacritical marks to a document is to enable the Windows touch keyboard. (Thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-tip-get-easy-access-to-symbols-emojis-and-other-special-characters/"&gt;Ed Bott from &lt;em&gt;ZDNet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for first leading me to this method.) The touch keyboard automatically appears if you’re using a Windows tablet or if you’re using a PC in tablet mode. If you don’t have a touchscreen, you can use the keyboard icon that appears in the taskbar, on the right side near the date. Don’t see it? This is how you get it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="3mKSNx"&gt;Right-click on the taskbar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="guGqAk"&gt;Click on “Show touch keyboard button”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Click on “Show touch keyboard button.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zX5tGpTALETlEtcWIgb7syaRgx4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22397964/special1.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click on “Show touch keyboard button.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="isigzU"&gt;Now, when you want to use a special character:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="MiArSp"&gt;Click on the touch keyboard icon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vkiOjM"&gt;The touch keyboard will appear. Long press (with your mouse button or, if you have a touchscreen, your finger) on the letter you want to use &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mxWCG7"&gt;You’ll now see several extra keys showing the ways you can type that letter with different symbols. Select the one you want, and it will appear on your document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YsM2S5"&gt;If you want to enter an emoji, click on the emoji key (on the left of the “space bar”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select the special character you want, and it will appear on your document." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ianQf8kqWF7MLYr-Jkzt0fc99TM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22397970/special3.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select the special character you want, and it will appear on your document.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3KuFuR"&gt;Use the emoji keyboard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Ias5hY"&gt;Another keyboard that you can access and can let you easily add special characters to your text is Windows’ emoji keyboard. Yes, it is mainly for adding emojis to your text, but it’s got other uses as well. And it’s simple to use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="YHAmrI"&gt;Hold down the Windows key (the one with the Windows symbol on it) and hit the period key&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yERfP0"&gt;The emoji keyboard will pop up, showing a variety of emojis. Click on the symbols tab on top (the third from the left).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The emoji keyboard also lets you access special characters." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0rwi7njzEZ8YaPRWp_OnJwmWVBg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22399994/emoji4.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The emoji keyboard also lets you access special characters.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="RBvuoy"&gt;Use the menu on the bottom line to select the type of symbol you’re looking for (if you’re looking for characters to use within text, you’ll probably want to select this one: Ç). Then scroll down until you find the character you want.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="blWVk1"&gt;Use the character map&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MX8CIZ"&gt;If you’d like to try a more old-fashioned method of adding special characters to Windows, you can use the character map, which is a less polished and more complicated version of the touch keyboard but offers a similar service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rCcyqh"&gt;To access it on your Windows 10 system:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="QyOOxs"&gt;Type “character” in your search field and then select the Character Map app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2thjaB"&gt;You’ll get a pop-up map showing a bunch of special characters for a specific font. You can change the font by clicking on the drop-down font menu at the top.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The character map lets you access a wide variety of special characters." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t7GknZWGbXmLDWNLFDoIqxsW84U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22397981/special4.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The character map lets you access a wide variety of special characters.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="4Xgqtz"&gt;Click on the letter(s) or special characters that you want to use in your document and then click on the “Select” button. They’ll appear in the “Characters to copy” field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XN5Maf"&gt;Once you’ve selected all the characters you want, click on the “Copy” button and then paste the character(s) into your document&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TyzBrw"&gt;Use the US International Keyboard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xFd69h"&gt;If you’re an English speaker who is multilingual and uses special characters a lot, you may want to try the US International Keyboard, which maps your keyboard to more easily allow you to add special characters. (Thanks to “shiroledat” for the tip.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7zIVkO"&gt;First, you need to add the US International Keyboard to Windows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="L4pshC"&gt;Go to Settings &amp;gt; Time &amp;amp; Language &amp;gt; Language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xnVyk8"&gt;Look for “Preferred languages” and (assuming you’re an English speaker in the US) click on “English (United States).” Then click on “Options.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rGKWxs"&gt;Look for the “Keyboards” section, which (if you’ve never been there before) will probably only contain a single keyboard icon labeled “US / QWERTY.” That’s the keyboard map you’re now using. Click on “Add a keyboard” just above it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="p6aTp5"&gt;In the pop-up menu that appears, scroll to “United States-International / QWERTY” and click on it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Under “Preferred languages,” click on “English (United States)” and then on “Options”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cP7g6d5Lqg42r94GE6Gz1vKeDsw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22411514/send2.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Under “Preferred languages,” click on “English (United States)” and then on “Options.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Click on “Add a keyboard” and look for “United States-International”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LbxpVGvetBKsNgrO23ly0T16cN0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22411522/send3.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click on “Add a keyboard” and look for “United States-International.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DLJYiS"&gt;Now you always have the choice of using either the standard US keyboard or the US International Keyboard. You can see which one is active in the lower-right side of your taskbar, near the date. It will either read “ENG / US” or “ENG / INTL.”  You can click on that to switch from one to the other, or just hit Windows key+space bar.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Click on the icon to switch keyboards." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T3E5OjLpnUiIStTqkvN1nNO6byg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22411664/send4__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click on the icon to switch keyboards.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EZgsPc"&gt;The US International Keyboard gives you two ways to add a special character:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="gyKMWW"&gt;Use the right-hand Alt key in combination with the appropriate letter to get one of the more common combinations. For example, Alt+e will result in: é &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CRWm4n"&gt;Press the symbol you want to use and then the letter you want to use it with. For example, if you first press the ~ symbol and then the “n” key, you’ll get: ñ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="0URckU"&gt;Washington State University &lt;a href="https://slcr.wsu.edu/help-pages/microsoft-keyboards-us-international/"&gt;has published a useful chart&lt;/a&gt; showing all of the symbols you can get using the US International Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="F8Ftnt"&gt;Use the Unicode value&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cLBy3k"&gt;If you look at the lower right-hand corner of the character map after you’ve chosen a letter or special character, you’ll see the word “Keystroke” followed by “Alt” and a four-digit number. This number represents the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode"&gt;Unicode value&lt;/a&gt; of the symbol, and it’s the time-honored standard for adding characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SKmqL4"&gt;If you use a few special characters consistently, it can be faster to simply add the character you want using your keyboard. There are several ways to do this; here are two of the easiest (each of which has its limitations):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="dMoLKy"&gt;Press the Alt key and then type the four-digit Unicode value. For this to work, you need to have a separate number pad on your keyboard, and the NumLock key should be enabled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PrXVUY"&gt;If you’re working with Microsoft Word, WordPad, Outlook, or another Microsoft app, you can type in the Unicode value and then type Alt-X&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Hnw0dE"&gt;You can also press the Control key plus a symbol, and then the letter you want to accent. For example, Ctrl+’ and “e” will result in “é” — assuming you’re in a Microsoft app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="fcd8Jh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 26th, 10:50AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article has been updated to add a section on using the Unicode values and the emoji keyboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aOGU5g"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 30th, 11:15AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to add another way to add special characters within Microsoft apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n0fya3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 1st, 9:45AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to add information on the US International Keyboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Doom 3 for PSVR is a solid showcase for Sony’s Aim Controller</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gzcDAPPCuT8HnjBm5d9WPb92ZDM=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69060306/D3VR_41.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b2xVnB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doom 3&lt;/em&gt; has a long history with VR, so it’s a little surprising that this week’s PlayStation VR release is the first version ever to go on sale. Almost nine years ago, we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/5/30/3052191/doom-3-bfg-edition-announced-for-the-fall-we-try-it-with-john"&gt;visited Id Software luminary John Carmack&lt;/a&gt; to see his duct-taped prototype “Oculus Rift” headset for the first time, and &lt;em&gt;Doom 3&lt;/em&gt; was the game he used to show it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E24vvG"&gt;Carmack later moved to Oculus, of course, and Id never put out an official &lt;em&gt;Doom 3&lt;/em&gt; VR release until now. That said, it’s not like you haven’t been able to play &lt;em&gt;Doom 3&lt;/em&gt; in VR before — the game is open source, and there are various third-party mods available, including a &lt;a href="https://www.doom3quest.com"&gt;recent port to the Oculus Quest&lt;/a&gt;. So why is &lt;em&gt;Doom 3: VR Edition&lt;/em&gt; only landing now as a PS4 exclusive?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bkSJdU"&gt;After playing it for a while, I think I have the answer: the PSVR Aim Controller makes for a pretty good shotgun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Zo82aG"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y7eO3eATsxs?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UQ96PR"&gt;For better or worse, &lt;em&gt;Doom 3: VR Edition&lt;/em&gt; is a straightforward port of &lt;em&gt;Doom 3&lt;/em&gt;, including its expansions. That means there’s a lot more content here than most VR shooters, but it also means you spend a fair bit of time watching 2D cutscenes rendered in the kind of quality you’d expect from a game that came out in 2004. PSVR games aren’t known for their visual pyrotechnics, though, and &lt;em&gt;Doom 3&lt;/em&gt;’s limited technology at least means it can run at a reasonable frame rate and resolution on a PS4 Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GhIeDq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doom 3&lt;/em&gt; itself is a somewhat divisive game that Id struggled to follow up for a long time before reviving the series with an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/27/11795652/doom-review"&gt;excellent reboot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/19/21186572/doom-eternal-review-xbox-ps4-pc-stadia-date-battlegrounds"&gt;last year’s sequel &lt;em&gt;Doom Eternal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Id decided to focus on atmosphere and horror with &lt;em&gt;Doom 3&lt;/em&gt;, leaning into the series’s moodier moments rather than rampant monster blasting. You spend much of your time traipsing through corridors, anticipating the next jump-scare where a demon bursts out from nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0wArH3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;VR is often all about atmosphere, and ‘Doom 3’ has plenty&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rxv4Wt"&gt;In theory, this makes &lt;em&gt;Doom 3&lt;/em&gt; a much better fit for VR than the more recent &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt; games, which are based around frenetic combat that’s difficult enough to keep track of on a regular monitor. (Id did adapt the reboot into a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/15/16771826/fallout-doom-skyrim-virtual-reality-reviews"&gt;separate game called &lt;em&gt;Doom VFR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in 2017, but it suffered from awkward controls and didn’t play anything like the original.) VR is often all about atmosphere, and &lt;em&gt;Doom 3&lt;/em&gt; has plenty, even 17 years on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qGGAuo"&gt;That said, this is still an old-school PC first-person shooter at its heart. The sprawling levels are designed to be navigated quickly, and they wouldn’t really work with typical solutions for VR locomotion like teleportation. &lt;em&gt;Doom 3: VR Edition&lt;/em&gt; forces you to be comfortable with analog stick movement and its affordances designed to ward off nausea, like a vignette that limits field of view and the use of snap turning instead of free motion on the right stick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0N8prn"&gt;I didn’t have issues with nausea myself, though &lt;em&gt;Doom 3: VR Edition&lt;/em&gt; is definitely on the intense side of VR games. It does help that the PSVR is generally geared around seated experiences, given that it’s likely to be used in living rooms. You can play with a regular DualShock controller, which works reasonably well, but there’s no option for the Move motion controllers — probably for the better.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PlayStation VR Aim Controller.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BHGKvL"&gt;Really, though, the only way to play &lt;em&gt;Doom 3: VR Edition&lt;/em&gt; is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/16/15643304/playstation-vr-aim-controller-farpoint-interview"&gt;PlayStation VR Aim Controller&lt;/a&gt;. Sony’s abstract gun-styled peripheral doesn’t have a lot of support, but it might as well have been made for this version of &lt;em&gt;Doom 3&lt;/em&gt;. It gives you all of the controls you need, including independent movement and aiming ability, and — crucially — it makes you feel like you’re holding a Super Shotgun. The game immediately becomes more immersive and easier to play. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QB4og2"&gt;Not all of the weapons work perfectly with the controller. The starting pistol feels a little off with the Aim Controller’s two-handed setup, for example, and the machine gun’s sights don’t quite track with the controller itself. Overall, though, the Aim Controller is great to use, and it’s the only time PSVR ever beats competing VR systems on the control front. If you have one, that’s reason alone to check out this version of &lt;em&gt;Doom 3&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RgxlFJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The combat in ‘Doom 3’ wasn’t designed for VR&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bky4T1"&gt;Still, the original &lt;em&gt;Doom 3&lt;/em&gt;’s combat wasn’t designed for VR, and it does show. You’ll find yourself needing to use the 180-degree-turn button constantly as enemies move behind you, which really detracts from the otherwise smooth controls. There’s just no escaping the fact that the game was always intended to be played with a mouse and keyboard, for all that this version makes the most of its best control option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WGlGwf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doom 3: VR Edition&lt;/em&gt; is a good port, but it’s also a 2004 PC shooter that’s been adapted to VR, and there’s really only so much you can do with that. If you’re okay with an experience that ignores most of what we’ve learned about modern VR game design, and you have an Aim Controller, it’s a reasonable way to spend a few demon-destroying hours. But there are better VR shooters — and there are better ways to play &lt;em&gt;Doom 3&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g5PE4r"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Doom 3: VR Edition &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is out now on the PlayStation 4. A PlayStation VR headset is required.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This Nvidia RTX 4090 video wins 2021’s best April Fools’ joke</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RgeI0ZGTvLkz83PGGQWSPfXgONQ=/4x0:1813x1206/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69059979/rtx4090joke.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The joke RTX 4090 card.&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="http://captains-workspace.com/?page_id=268" target="_blank"&gt;Captain’s Workspace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jXi55P"&gt;April Fools’ Day jokes are usually lame and lack any real effort, but 20-year-old Kasper Andersen has risen to the occasion for 2021 to deliver &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0frNP0qzxQc"&gt;Nvidia’s RTX 4090&lt;/a&gt;. The Danish hardware enthusiast loves to create homemade replicas of retro graphics cards, but his latest RTX 4090 project imagines a future where Nvidia’s card uses 1,000 watts of power, has a 12-fan design, and includes 48GB of VRAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PSQ8f1"&gt;The video is a work of art, with subtle details like two power cords, RGB lighting, or the ridiculous GPU benchmarking tool that records more than 23,000 frames per second. My personal favorite is when the whole PC powers on and the desk starts wobbling, a Pepsi Max can tumbles by, and then the test rig swings around by itself and crashes into the monitor. It’s pure chef’s kiss.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QkxxHwj8FWgzqOgCxDfzfR_4mrE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22412972/fC6ccck.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="http://captains-workspace.com/?page_id=237" target="_blank"&gt;Captain’s Workspace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Andersen’s joke Intel Xe GPU.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xVtyd6"&gt;If that’s not enough, wait until Andersen unveils the RTX 4090 Ti flagship with eight GPUs in SLI that “only takes up four PCIe slots.” Andersen has also created a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/s13iFPSyKdQ"&gt;similar video for Intel’s Xe gaming GPU&lt;/a&gt;. It includes a GPU to CPU switch on the top, “which allows you to use the card as a motherboard.” There are plenty more fun videos and projects over at Andersen’s &lt;a href="http://captains-workspace.com/"&gt;Captain’s Workspace site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qym9l"&gt;Andersen’s shenanigans won’t make the RTX 4090 any more real than the constantly out-of-stock RTX 3080. But if you’re still trying to snag a new GPU, hopefully this video puts a smile on your face while you battle scalpers, stock notifications, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;GPU prices that are utterly out of control&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
