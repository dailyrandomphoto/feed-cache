    <title>Mercedes recalling more than 1 million vehicles over emergency-call tech issue</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S6SAEC"&gt;Mercedes-Benz USA is recalling 1.29 million vehicles because of a failure in its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/29/8512845/ecall-europe-emergency-call-2018"&gt;eCall software&lt;/a&gt; which may not provide a vehicle’s correct location to emergency responders after a crash, &lt;a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a35498170/mercedes-benz-emergency-call-system-recall"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Car and Driver&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n8Plzp"&gt;The recall covers vehicles sold from model years 2016 to 2021 and includes CLA-Class, GLA-Class, GLE-Class, GLS-Class, SLC-Class, A-Class, GT-Class, C-Class, E-Class, S-Class, CLS-Class, SL-Class, B-Class, GLB-Class, GLC-Class, and G-Class vehicles, &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PySQ57"&gt;The automaker &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mercedes-benz-recall-idUSKBN2AD0KK"&gt;said it was unaware&lt;/a&gt; of any instances of material damages or personal injuries that have resulted from the issue, and plans to provide a free software update to be installed over the air or at dealerships. The recall will begin April 6th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JdIaIZ"&gt;Mercedes-Benz said “a temporary collapse of the communication module’s power supply caused by a crash might lead to the vehicle’s position during a potential emergency call being incorrect.” However, “other functions of the automatic and manual emergency call function remain fully operational,” the company added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b0qTey"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mercedes-benz-recall-idUSKBN2AD0KK"&gt;Reuters reported&lt;/a&gt; that in 2019, Mercedes-Benz in Europe investigated an incident where the automatic eCall system provided an incorrect position for its vehicle. The company found other situations where an incorrect vehicle position was relayed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google updates its iOS YouTube app, the first update to one of its major iOS apps since December</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rNQsyXB_i4OMb65ZuviVR2UJ5nM=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68815471/acastro_180202_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ChPkQ2"&gt;Google has provided a bug fix to its iOS YouTube app, the first update to a major Google iOS app since December, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/12/google-youtube-iphone-update/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. Although there’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250648/google-apple-app-store-privacy-label"&gt;speculation that the reason&lt;/a&gt; for the lack of updates to iOS versions of Gmail, Docs, Search, and Photos is an attempt to avoid Apple’s new privacy labels, Google has &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/google-to-add-app-store-privacy-labels-to-its-ios-apps-as-soon-as-this-week/"&gt;explicitly denied&lt;/a&gt; that was the case. The company said in a &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/our-work-keep-you-safe-and-control-your-privacy"&gt;January 12th blog post&lt;/a&gt; it would add the labels to its apps when updates were available:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ORywLQ"&gt;As Google’s iOS apps are updated with new features or to fix bugs, you’ll see updates to our app page listings that include the new App Privacy Details. These labels represent the maximum categories of data that could be collected—meaning if you use every available feature and service in the app. The data you provide to Google products delivers helpful services to you, and you can always control your privacy settings by visiting your Google Account or going directly to the Google products you use on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="UFg45x"&gt;Apple requires companies to apply the privacy labels, which it launched on December 14th, before they can update existing iOS apps. Some of Google’s other apps— Stadia, Authenticator, Translate, and Classroom, for example— have received iOS updates already. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WnLY97"&gt;We’ve reached out to Google to ask if updates for the iOS versions of Gmail, Search, Docs and Photos are forthcoming, and will report back if we learn more. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this New York Times report on SlateStarCodex and Silicon Valley tech leaders</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/puV083LBw4P4mlLISXk3_EyUi5s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68815287/acastro_170629_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aUXqFu"&gt;Last year, the pseudonymous writer behind the SlateStarCodex blog abruptly shut it down, claiming a forthcoming story from &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; was going to reveal his real name and potentially put him in danger. Reporter Cade Metz says he was able to easily find the blogger’s real name —Scott Siskind— online. After a farewell post on the blog, Metz says he and his editor were harassed online by its angry fans. Now, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/13/technology/slate-star-codex-rationalists.html"&gt;Metz’s reporting on SlateStarCodex&lt;/a&gt; and the philosophical views that made it so popular is finally here. It’s a compelling look at the mindset among many in Silicon Valley’s tech industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Xz0CkZ"&gt;It was nominally a blog, written by a Bay Area psychiatrist who called himself Scott Alexander (a near anagram of Slate Star Codex). It was also the epicenter of a community called the Rationalists, a group that aimed to re-examine the world through cold and careful thought&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="vZa6Vv"&gt;Rationalists, Metz writes, believe AI could eventually destroy the world. Many were very into the musings on SlateStarCodex. The blog was read by top venture capitalists and startup leaders, he writes, who felt it was up to them to build AI in a safe way. Most held a deep-seated distrust of mainstream media (and some even contemplated ways to target a “single vulnerable hostile reporter” for doxxing). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="YtWmSQ"&gt;Part of the appeal of Slate Star Codex, faithful readers said, was Mr. Siskind’s willingness to step outside acceptable topics. But he wrote in a wordy, often roundabout way that left many wondering what he really believed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="aldIIv"&gt;Metz goes deep into the blend of topics SlateStarCodex touched on and how the blog resonated with contrarians in Silicon Valley and others with more extreme views. Siskind has since reinstated old SlateStarCodex posts, and has launched a &lt;a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/still-alive"&gt;Substack newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for his continued musings where he revealed his real name.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvwAuo"&gt;Anyone who covers or plays close attention to Silicon Valley and its tech culture has been witnessing this undercurrent of tension for some time. Tech company leaders have a very specific view of what constitutes “free speech,” and many prefer not to have their views challenged by journalists. But Metz’s article suggests that there’s actually a guiding philosophy, beyond libertarianism, one which most tech industry leaders would prefer be kept quiet. Go read his fascinating article &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/13/technology/slate-star-codex-rationalists.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Silicon Valley’s Safe Space&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CEOs of Reddit and Robinhood and ‘Roaring Kitty’ slated to testify in GameStop hearing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration a GameStop logo is seen on a mobile phone screen in front of Reddit logo." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8bvmTIPsSUHOXkxoyiQlNd1vBdA=/0x0:4896x3264/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68814755/1230992809.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lXLsZX"&gt;Reddit CEO Steve Huffman, Robinhood co-CEO Vlad Tenev, and Keith Gill (aka Roaring Kitty) are all on the witness list for an upcoming hearing before the House Financial Services Committee, according to a &lt;a href="https://financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=407152"&gt;release from Chairwoman Maxine Waters&lt;/a&gt; (D-CA). The hearing, to be conducted virtually, will probe the recent volatility in shares of GameStop following a rally fueled by a group of day traders active on the r/WallStreetBets Reddit board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WDFFrQ"&gt;Over a two-week period that began last month, GameStop’s stock (GME) skyrocketed by 500 percent, hitting a high of $483 on January 28th. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278799/gamestop-surge-federal-investigation-manipulation-robinhood-reddit"&gt;Several government entities are now looking into&lt;/a&gt; whether there was market manipulation involved, and whether Robinhood and other brokerages that temporarily restricted trading of GME were in compliance with federal regulations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="yXKE3m"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Reddit vs. Wall Street: the latest in the GameStop saga","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22253363/wall-street-bets-verge-stories-gamestock-reddit-discord"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="oWL1qn"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/technology/roaring-kitty-reddit-gamestop-markets.html"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, after Gill invested $53,000 in GME in 2019, he began tweeting and posting videos about the stock; following the Reddit rollercoaster last month his original investment is now worth around $48 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uFSccw"&gt;The Senate Committee on Banking also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254909/senate-banking-stocks-sherrod-brown-aoc-gamestop-reddit-hearing"&gt;plans to hold a hearing&lt;/a&gt; into the “current state of the stock market.” The House hearing, which has the catchy title “Game Stopped? Who Wins and Loses When Short Sellers, Social Media, and Retail Investors Collide,” will &lt;a href="https://financialservices.house.gov/live/"&gt;stream live on its website&lt;/a&gt; beginning at 12PM ET on February 18th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Donald Glover to star in Amazon’s Mr. and Mrs. Smith series</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="2019 British Academy Britannia Awards presented by American Airlines and Jaguar Land Rover - Inside" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QKeXZ5p0alGG-F3ZtH2hE00IbUw=/0x667:4000x3334/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68814575/1183526858.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C82vWw"&gt;Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Donald Glover will star in a new Amazon Prime Video series based on the 2005 film &lt;em&gt;Mr. and Mrs. Smith&lt;/em&gt;. The movie starred Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt as a pair of married killers-for-hire who are assigned to assassinate each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m4EeeE"&gt;I am trying to envision what Waller-Bridge’s &lt;em&gt;Fleabag&lt;/em&gt; character would make of this news and whether her Mrs. Smith will make the &lt;a href="https://www.theringer.com/2016/9/22/16043266/breaking-the-fourth-wall-on-fleabag-b85eb4ac198f"&gt;asides to the camera that &lt;em&gt;Fleabag&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was known for (please do). And! This not the first time the two stars have been in the same production; both were in the 2018 Disney movie &lt;em&gt;Solo: A Star Wars Story, &lt;/em&gt; he as a young becaped Lando Calrissian and she as snarky droid L3-37. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E4GBlL"&gt;Glover made the announcement via a story on his &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/childishgambino/2507788700969440046/"&gt;Childish Gambino Instagram&lt;/a&gt; page, which was shared by Amazon Studios head Jennifer Salke. She called the pair a “dream team” for the studio in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="bUJu0s"&gt;Waller-Bridge created and wrote for the hit series &lt;em&gt;Killing Eve &lt;/em&gt;based on the novels by Luke Jennings, and is also a &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/phoebe-waller-bridge-james-bond-no-time-to-die-daniel-craig-1203398180/"&gt;writer on the delayed James Bond film&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;No Time to Die&lt;/em&gt;. Glover has won raves for his FX series &lt;em&gt;Atlanta&lt;/em&gt;, which he created and co-starred in (its latest season has also been &lt;a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2020/09/atlanta-season-3-delay-1234585412/"&gt;delayed by the coronavirus pandemic&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBGDh0"&gt;Both stars have done other projects with Amazon Studios; it distributed &lt;em&gt;Fleabag&lt;/em&gt; in the US, and Glover’s musical &lt;em&gt;Guava Island&lt;/em&gt; was an Amazon Original production. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s Edge extensions store hosted illicit copies of Sonic and Mario Kart 64</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JhNmDBq_Dq26uty49fszJODkG_0=/0x4:527x355/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68812989/Screen_Shot_2021_02_12_at_4.54.10_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An image from the Mario Kart 64 listing on the Edge extensions store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3vc7tZ"&gt;Microsoft’s Edge extensions store was hosting likely illegal copies of a number of iconic games, including &lt;a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/mario-kart-64-n64-simul/abfdnoiheolhpbdcehdnhecgclaaekie"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mario Kart 64&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/super-mario-bros-game/nmkdnipcejjcbliglpibnffkgpjjpjld"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/sonic-the-hedgehog-game/dibhlaandmahmcgndlebpobpcchcjilp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/original-pacman-game/mahclhjcbhohmmkcobhoglipcajcnfcp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pac-Man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/tetris-game/iefpnmfngbceeldlcfmkancbginibhno"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tetris&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/cut-the-rope/bcnmodafbghancmdkbbbijkkdoejjfno"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cut The Rope&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and even Microsoft’s own smash hit &lt;a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/minecraft-game-online/cdeankbhhhghfpmlhbebphangglimeog"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The developers listed on the titles weren’t Microsoft, Nintendo, or any other recognizable game developer, meaning that they almost certainly aren’t official copies of the games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WdYSYR"&gt;In the hours since we published this story, all but one game we found has been removed. We had also seen another &lt;a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/sonic/nflchbbjkneglfanbofhlbdekbhndoko"&gt;Sonic game&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/super-mario-bros-game/akoiiggjcphhkjaogelehljleeofpnjp"&gt;another Mario game&lt;/a&gt;, a couple of Pac-Man games, and a variety of copies of &lt;em&gt;2048, Flappy Bird, Fruit Ninja, Temple Run,&lt;/em&gt; but they aren’t available anymore. All that remains is what appears to be &lt;a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/running-dinosaur-game/gmngklkembmipfjndbacppgiimpagecp"&gt;a copy of Google Chrome’s dinosaur game&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v13RhF"&gt;Initially, we saw 35 listings across 10 different “developers” with names like “GamePro Inc,” “Gamelands,” “StayReal” and “Kday,” including a number of duplicate games. Many listings, even from different developers, had very similar descriptions, indicating that they could be coming from the same source. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eYBf7G"&gt;Here are screenshots of just a few of the games we found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qn5xfB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10340835"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AcuZn8"&gt;Oddly, Microsoft&lt;em&gt; itself&lt;/em&gt; appeared to promote the browser extensions in what looks to be a now-deleted tweet from the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/msedgedev"&gt;@MSEdgeDev account&lt;/a&gt;, which we saw &lt;a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-promotes-that-you-can-pirate-games-through-their-browser-for-some-reason.377748/"&gt;via ResetEra&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S-LZ4a2KfrNhJS1fp6k1VwAm8uc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22301271/nm5i6DK.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-promotes-that-you-can-pirate-games-through-their-browser-for-some-reason.377748/#post-58490358" target="_blank"&gt;KoolAid on ResetEra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="07oFte"&gt;We didn’t see this purported tweet ourselves, and it isn’t currently on the @MSEdgeDev account right now. But one brave soul on Twitter, Jordan Chase, said he &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/olynative/status/1360343707845726208"&gt;installed the &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart 64&lt;/em&gt; extension&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter — and he said that in a reply to a now-deleted tweet from @MSEdgeDev. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VJxmK8"&gt;In his tweet, Chase said the Mario Kart 64 extension downloaded a ROM of the game. While emulators are generally legal, and some sites (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/19/17138752/internet-archive-handheld-history-collection-game-emulator-mame"&gt;like Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;) host abandonware you can play in a browser, it’s extremely unlikely that Nintendo, which is well-known for cracking down on sites hosting ROMs and pirated content, would let people download copies of its most-loved games over free browser extensions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uZEr8T"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The Mario Kart 64 extension downloads a ROM of the N64 game.   &lt;a href="https://t.co/BY9VDMqp3B"&gt;pic.twitter.com/BY9VDMqp3B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jordan Chase (@olynative) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/olynative/status/1360343707845726208?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7KxQOx"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Tetris&lt;/em&gt; extension also appeared to be a clone of the famous puzzle game, though it didn’t download a ROM, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/olynative/status/1360343707845726208"&gt;according to Chase&lt;/a&gt;. He &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/olynative/status/1360345226733182976"&gt;also said&lt;/a&gt; he installed a &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man&lt;/em&gt; extension, and it “seems like it’s using direct assets from the original game.” I didn’t install the games myself in case they were doing something nefarious, and I’d recommend against putting them on your machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q0OpWS"&gt;Some of the games we found had reviews dating back to October, indicating they had been sitting unnoticed in Microsoft’s catalog for quite some time. It’s unclear why they were available for so long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d6sKOW"&gt;Many listings attempted to skirt trouble with dubious disclaimers acknowledging the listings aren’t affiliated with the original games. Here’s one we found on the listing for &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart 64, &lt;/em&gt;for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="hi6Qwz"&gt;IMPORTANT: This emulator is not affiliated with nor endorsed by Nintendo. All graphics, games, and other multimedia are copyrighted to their respective owners and authors. This game is for ALL Mario fans!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="tuyAcP"&gt;Microsoft and Nintendo tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; they are looking into the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ZSN5C"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 13th, 11:23AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that all but one of the games have been removed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="KWC6NP"&gt;Earlier this week, Netflix &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276221/redwall-tv-show-netflix-announcement-film"&gt;dropped a surprise announcement&lt;/a&gt; that it’s adapting author Brian Jacques’ iconic &lt;em&gt;Redwall&lt;/em&gt; books into a new animated movie and TV franchise. Based on the 22-book children’s series that was published from 1986 through 2011, the books span generations of sword-fighting anthropomorphic mice, rabbits, badgers, and other woodland creatures living at the titular Redwall Abbey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dsns1l"&gt;While the show was previously made into a TV series back in the late ‘90s, it’s never been adapted with the scale (or presumably, the budget) of a Netflix feature film. Many of us here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; are longtime fans of the series. Here’s how we’re taking the news. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="FxYCni"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Netflix is turning iconic series Redwall into a TV show, film","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276221/redwall-tv-show-netflix-announcement-film"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="oaUxYH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What were your initial thoughts on a &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Redwall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; adaptation? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nm9KDF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim Gartenberg&lt;/strong&gt;: I think my initial reaction was “OMG” followed by a lot of screaming from my internal seven-year-old. I grew up reading the &lt;em&gt;Redwall&lt;/em&gt; books. I remember the original being one of the first “real” books I ever read. And the entire series just has this shining, golden spot in my memory. They’re wholesome, lovely books full of daring adventures, clever puzzles, and where good always triumphs over evil. What’s not to like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tvcWfa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jay Peters&lt;/strong&gt;: I was elated when I first saw the news of the &lt;em&gt;Redwall&lt;/em&gt; remaster. I was a devoted fan of the books for years as a kid, devouring each new entry in the series as soon as I could. But if I’m being honest, I couldn’t tell you a single plot point from any of the books right now. Hopefully, that doesn’t matter for the new series; as long as it features adorable forest creatures in epic battles and enjoying decadent feasts, I’ll be happy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3FPU3I"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adi Robertson&lt;/strong&gt;: I’m partly in the same boat: I read the books religiously, but I remember very little about their actual plots. They really hit the part of my brain that loved dollhouses and other miniature things. Unlike Jay and Chaim, though, I remember enjoying that they could be kind of bloody and creepy — we’re not talking &lt;em&gt;Watership Down&lt;/em&gt; or anything, but I remember a lot of eerie fortresses and mad kings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cY7fnA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitchell Clark&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah, I have to agree. While I remember books like &lt;em&gt;Triss&lt;/em&gt; being light-hearted adventures, I know there were some pretty dark ones like &lt;em&gt;Marlfox &lt;/em&gt;and parts of &lt;em&gt;Salamandastron — &lt;/em&gt;assassins, bloodlust, the whole nine yards. As an adult, and given Netflix’s reputation, I’ve wondered if they’ll get into the darker parts, but I’m honestly kind of hoping they keep it aimed more at kids, and that it’ll inspire some of those kids to pick up the book series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dgGR92"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Redwall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; a good choice for a TV show?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="palvmX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jay&lt;/strong&gt;: There’s lots of swashbuckling action and heroic tales, which consistently makes for pretty good TV. I’m sure many of the characters will be fuzzy and adorable, making the show even more watchable. And Netflix has a lot of source material to pull from, given there are approximately 1,000 books in the series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jmSnn1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim&lt;/strong&gt;: So many books. But part of the brilliance is that they’re all (for the most part) fairly standalone, so adapting each one could be its own project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tptBA5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitchell&lt;/strong&gt;: Fantasy has been very &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; lately, but it’s usually not aimed at kids. It’s a good series that has a lot of elements that really let your imagination run wild, and I think that’ll be very fun. It could also lend itself to a really neat art style. There’s always a lot of talk of tapestries and paintings in the books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KdM8Rs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What parts or books in the series are you most looking forward to seeing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mFWYRD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russell Brandom&lt;/strong&gt;: It’s been a good 20 years since I read these books, but two scenes stand out. First, the outright terror of Matthias standing off against Asmodeus in the first &lt;em&gt;Redwall&lt;/em&gt; hooked me like nothing else. The snake hypnotism is a great use of the central animal-fantasy conceit, and the fact that Asmodeus isn’t the primary villain makes the encounter that much more unsettling. The second — spoilers for &lt;em&gt;Mossflower&lt;/em&gt;, I guess? — is Tsarmina in the sinking castle at the end of the second book, a legitimately haunting image if you have any fear of drowning, which I definitely did at the time. (Cats hate water! So true.) I’ll have to wait for the Martin the Warrior prequel series to see that one on-screen, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SCFoG2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim: &lt;/strong&gt;I’m kind of hoping for some good, fuzzy, &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;-style battles. Show us some Badger Lords, please. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z87eAH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any concerns about making a &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Redwall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; show?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5k6FSe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitchell&lt;/strong&gt;: There’s just so much lore, backstory, and regular stories told over the series that I hope Netflix and the show’s creators have come up with a specific story they want to tell within the universe. I’m not sure I want to see them try to tackle the whole thing. I’d rather be left wanting more than overstuffed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LefjFy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim&lt;/strong&gt;: It’s a good point, but it seems like they’re starting (relatively) small: a movie based on the first book, and a TV series focused on Martin the Warrior, which makes sense to me. Martin’s story is a broader one, spread across a number of books, while the first book is relatively self-contained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gm0PVK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adi&lt;/strong&gt;: I remember the books relying a lot on Tolkien-style species-based morality, and that’s objectively weird, and I’m not sure how the show will deal with it! I was going to soften this by saying that I remember some good foxes or something, but the &lt;a href="https://redwall.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Foxes"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Redwall&lt;/em&gt; Wiki informs me&lt;/a&gt; that foxes are “without exception villainous vermin,” so I guess that settles that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lD5y8C"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russell:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m going to throw in a practical concern here. Part of the fun of the books is imagining this wide range of animals interacting both as friends and enemies, with rabbits, badgers, mice, crows, and various obscure mustelids interacting more or less as equals. But if you have to draw canonical versions of these characters, the size differential becomes a problem. Mice are just much, much smaller than crows, cats, weasels, rats, and most of the other common &lt;em&gt;Redwall&lt;/em&gt; antagonists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zmdmrw"&gt;Sword or no, even the bravest mouse cannot realistically take down an animal more than 10 times its size, so choreographing the fight scenes is going to be a serious problem if we stay even slightly close to natural proportions. But at the same time, an undeniable draw of the series is picturing mice holding swords in their little mouse hands, which becomes less fun if you stray too far from the sort-of photorealistic animals depicted on &lt;a href="https://redwall.fandom.com/wiki/Book_Cover_Gallery?file=Redwall10.jpg"&gt;the classic book covers&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a real bind!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="13SCsq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CGI? Hand-drawn animation? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lion King&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-esque faux live action? How would you want to see a &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Redwall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; show realized? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5XZcT9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitchell&lt;/strong&gt;: I hate to be boring, but it’s gotta be hand-drawn. I think that’ll work best for the fantasy setting, and while I don’t need it to have the same art style as &lt;em&gt;Over The Garden Wall&lt;/em&gt;, I’d like the vibe to be similar, if that makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fFSigh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim&lt;/strong&gt;: Anything but “realistic” CGI, please. These books are... pretty violent, which I’m worried would translate &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; badly to a realistic style. No one needs to see a mouse murder a bunch of rats with a sword in faux-live-action, especially not the family-friendly target audience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pYdUuB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jay&lt;/strong&gt;: I want hand-drawn, but I expect CGI. Netflix, if it’s not too late: please, make the show hand-drawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nPzNxw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russell&lt;/strong&gt;: Given the surreal nature of the setup, I think they could also get away with computer-assisted 2D animation, along the lines of &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/2020/9/15/21438560/wolfwalkers-review-apple-tv-plus"&gt;what Cartoon Saloon does&lt;/a&gt;. But definitely not 3D and definitely not photo-realistic. Nobody wants to see another &lt;em&gt;Lion King&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6AHb6x"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some Deeper’n’Ever Turnip’n’Tater’n’Beetroot Pie or some strawberry cordial? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3XVd3Z"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitchell&lt;/strong&gt;: While I don’t love beetroots, strawberries are extremely out of season right now, so rustle up what roots you can from the cellar, aye chap? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eYhAaS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adi&lt;/strong&gt;: Anything except clotted cream, because A) the large amount of dairy-based food in &lt;em&gt;Redwall&lt;/em&gt; has always raised questions to me about where exactly the milk is coming from in a series about humanoid animals (I vaguely remember “aphid milk” being an answer at one point?), and B) I still don’t really know what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kEqLkt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jay&lt;/strong&gt;: Honestly, I’d try any of it. If the show is successful, maybe Netflix can make a &lt;em&gt;Redwall-&lt;/em&gt;themed cooking show spinoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GnPVoZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adi&lt;/strong&gt;: Either way, &lt;em&gt;Redwall&lt;/em&gt; Feast TikTok is gonna be great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XJxBUs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vaccine rollout won’t be equitable unless health care reckons with racism</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="New York’s Northwell Health Hospital Administers Covid Vaccines" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q69SeKk9ph-Wb36Gefz5dLnT3bw=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68814338/1230124989.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ki8dEm"&gt;The pandemic has been anything but “the great equalizer” that some people called it when it started more than a year ago. Here in the US, COVID-19 has sickened and killed a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-race-ethnicity.html"&gt;disproportionate&lt;/a&gt; number of Black, Native American, and Latinx people. Vaccine rollout is &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/02/health/white-people-covid-vaccines-minorities.html"&gt;proving to be inequitable&lt;/a&gt;, too. Black and Latinx elders in Los Angeles, for example, have been &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-02-08/l-a-latinos-black-seniors-fall-behind-in-covid-19-vaccine-access-compared-to-whites"&gt;vaccinated at a lower rate&lt;/a&gt; than their white and Asian American counterparts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBz4bn"&gt;Distrust in vaccines has been a challenge across the board. But Black Americans were less inclined than other racial and ethnic groups to want to get vaccinated, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/12/03/intent-to-get-a-covid-19-vaccine-rises-to-60-as-confidence-in-research-and-development-process-increases/"&gt;Pew Research Center&lt;/a&gt; survey from December. To fix a system that isn’t fully serving Black Americans and other people of color, “There really needs to be some healing,” says &lt;a href="https://www.unlv.edu/people/melva-thompson-robinson"&gt;Melva Thompson-Robinson&lt;/a&gt;, executive director of the Center for Health Disparities Research at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iGPGdj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke with Thompson-Robinson about the roots of that distrust and how to heal.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eqMr9l"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IoC5e6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does distrust for vaccines in communities of color differ from white celebrities or conspiracy theorists who are anti-vaxxers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FKtm9e"&gt;It’s not just a simple matter of, “Oh, I don’t believe that something works because this is what I heard.” This is about that deep-rooted, historical trauma that has been carried down through generations. That distrust comes out of the racism that they experience. When you’re talking about African Americans, in particular, you’re talking about a group of people who are descendants of slaves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="F7EuPE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XPw1uH"&gt;And so it’s a different kind of thing. It’s not “I believe that these vaccines aren’t effective because I heard that’s what somebody said.” This is “I’m not trusting because of the experience that my family has had under slavery.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TeZ3Bb"&gt;A big thing now is people are looking at who’s in charge. Who’s running the vaccine trials? Who’s participating in the trials? They say, “Well, I don’t see people who look like me.” Or “I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; see people who look like me.” And all of that is huge. We need to see people who look like us who are involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TcOU8G"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some of those historical traumas that have led to distrust of vaccines among some people of color?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ORkLlS"&gt;When you start to talk particularly about slaves, one of the men who is credited as being the founder of gynecology actually did &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/02/07/513764158/remembering-anarcha-lucy-and-betsey-the-mothers-of-modern-gynecology"&gt;surgery on Black women&lt;/a&gt; because they were considered property. He was doing gynecological surgery with no anesthesia because part of the thought was “Well, they don’t experience pain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NyA1iy"&gt;That’s not true. All people experience pain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HEK7oI"&gt;You can jump the &lt;a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/history/40-years-human-experimentation-america-tuskegee-study"&gt;Tuskegee syphilis study&lt;/a&gt;. You could also even look at the story of &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/nih-family-of-henrietta-lacks-reach-deal-on-access-to-dna-code/2013/08/07/68f3da04-ff8b-11e2-96a8-d3b921c0924a_story.html"&gt;Henrietta Lacks&lt;/a&gt;, who had cervical cancer. And they harvested her cells at Johns Hopkins and still to this day still use her cells for research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dvVTH4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That’s not true. All people experience pain.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CoYyp3"&gt;So people are saying, “Well, you need to trust the health care system.” But health care systems, health care facilities, and health care providers need to act in a trustful manner. You can’t just expect people to say, “Oh yeah, I’ll now trust you” after centuries of mistrust. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QPBCB4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do we see inequities playing out today when it comes to vaccine rollout in the US? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RizTg"&gt;The challenge has been with some of the vaccines that you have to have very specialized storage capabilities, which then has limited where some of these can be distributed. Communities of color don’t always have access to those storage facilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ux9e95"&gt;For people working in grocery stores or other retail and food outlets, it’s not as simple for them to take time off to go to an appointment. If they don’t have sick leave or they have a limited amount of leave, they can’t go and stand in line for hours at a time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2zqOeQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You can’t just expect people to say, ‘Oh yeah, I’ll now trust you’ after centuries of mistrust.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IYckqS"&gt;Another challenge is the messaging that’s going out to people. You already know that you have populations that are concerned about getting the vaccine. So the messaging for that population needs to be different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gMpzF9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s no “one size fits all” prescription for how to reach out to different communities of color. But what should solutions or outreach strategies look like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gSxusx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/sisolak-establishes-new-equity-initiative-as-working-class-communities-hit-hard-by-covid-19-slow-to-receive-vaccine"&gt;Here in Clark County&lt;/a&gt; where Las Vegas is located, the governor just came out last week with an equity initiative. Because if you look at the data, where the cases are versus where people are who are getting the vaccine — it’s two different places within the same city. It’s not the same group of people. We’re seeing this inequitable distribution of resources. We’re in this perfect storm, and in order to survive it, I think there has to be some relinquishing of power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jQYB9b"&gt;There really needs to be some healing and some stepping back. Not rushing, but stepping back and saying: “You know what, we hear what you’re saying. We understand where we’ve done wrong, and we want to do better.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Minneapolis prohibits use of facial recognition software by its police department</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sC42K8mphTgM4URpVh5EdfjtNJU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68814291/acastro_180730_1777_facial_recognition_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="njnJsy"&gt;The Minneapolis City Council voted unanimously on Friday to approve an ordinance banning the use of facial recognition software by its police department and other city agencies, the &lt;a href="https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-passes-restrictive-ban-on-facial-recognition-use-by-police-others/600022551/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Tribune&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. The ban adds Minneapolis to the list of US cities moving to limit or end the use of such technology by its law enforcement officers and city employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qw7dC6"&gt;But Minneapolis police chief Medaria Arradondo said in a statement that the ban was created without feedback from him, and that he believes it’s possible for facial recognition technology to be “utilized in accordance with data privacy and other citizen legal protections,” according to the &lt;em&gt;Star Tribune&lt;/em&gt;. Facial recognition software &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21031255/facial-recognition-algorithm-bias-gender-race-age-federal-nest-investigation-analysis-amazon"&gt;has been found&lt;/a&gt; to have age, race, and ethnic biases, and privacy advocates have raised concerns about its use by law enforcement. Minneapolis’ ordinance created an appeals process allowing city agencies to request exemptions under some circumstances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K5XVQH"&gt;Minneapolis was the site of huge public protests last summer after one of its &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/officers-involved-deadly-arrest-black-man-minneapolis-have-been-fired-n1215046"&gt;police officers killed George Floyd&lt;/a&gt; during an arrest in May. The city council &lt;a href="https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2020/06/26/minneapolis-city-council-takes-another-step-toward-dismantling-police-department/"&gt;voted to disband its police department&lt;/a&gt; last June, but ended up &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/10/us/minneapolis-police-funding.html"&gt;reducing the department’s 2021 budget&lt;/a&gt; by less than 5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7WQF8a"&gt;Software made by Clearview AI —the controversial firm that has a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition.html?searchResultPosition=1"&gt;database of some 3 billion images&lt;/a&gt; scraped from social media and other websites— would be included under Minneapolis’ facial recognition ban. &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolinehaskins1/george-floyd-protests-surveillance-technology"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; last year that Minneapolis was one of the police departments that had access to Clearview’s software. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21368930/clearview-ai-ice-contract-privacy-immigration"&gt;Clearview also has contracts&lt;/a&gt; with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0w4qUu"&gt;Other cities have also implemented bans on facial recognition software, with Portland blocking both public and private use of the technology. &lt;a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2020/06/23/boston-facial-recognition-ban"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/14/18623013/san-francisco-facial-recognition-ban-vote-city-agencies"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Oakland-bans-use-of-facial-recognition-14101253.php"&gt;and Oakland&lt;/a&gt; have also passed laws prohibiting public institutions from using facial recognition, but Portland was the first to prohibit private use. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A few of the best deals for the holiday weekend</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DgHOMvPC4l4HqCezWv46RgbNwc0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68814046/akrales_190716_3546_0060.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;That’s The Verge’s Chris Welch wearing Bose’s Noise Canceling Headphones 700&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Uz30AX"&gt;You wouldn’t know it from looking at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s deals coverage this week, but we’ve been getting &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; many pitches for deals that are on because of Valentine’s Day on Sunday, February 14th, and Presidents’ Day, which is happening the following day in the US. We haven’t featured any of them because, truthfully, better deals have popped up. But below, you’ll find a mix of the holiday-themed deals you actually need to know about, along with some favorite discounts of the week that are still happening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="8ng4jF"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6oiPeLI9h3CU5VY0iEucQh5AOKE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18314842/akrales_190716_3546_0185.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="J2V0HV"&gt;Bose’s refurbished headphones are $150 off until today at 10:55AM ET&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZsO9y5"&gt;At eBay, you can save 20 percent on refurbished tech by using the code &lt;strong&gt;PREZDAY20 &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout. I invite you to try it out on anything that strikes your fancy, but I think one of the best ways to utilize the one-time-use coupon is on Bose’s refurbished Noise Cancelling Headphones 700, its latest (and greatest) set of over-ear noise-canceling cans. These usually cost $379 new, but they’re $224 before tax with the offer code applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tBXgHL"&gt;Seeing “refurbished” might spook some people, and I get it. But you shouldn’t worry as much with these. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FBose-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-700-Certified-Refurbished%2F153863412679&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F2%2F13%2F22278064%2Fpresidents-day-headphones-tech-sale-bose-beats-flex-earbuds-oneplus-8#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;On the page&lt;/a&gt;, it says that each set of headphones is in “pristine, like-new condition” and that it’ll be “in new packaging with original and new accessories.” Also, if you live in the US, eBay automatically tacks on a two-year warranty through Allstate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Nv5yaU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9586877"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="xsg9Vm"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple’s new Beats Flex earbuds, pictured in yellow." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xTmRbKZGtzUUNb7kIN3CIlmRsnM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21971885/BF904AC7_A371_4D8E_B0A9_0CA38299CBD9.jpeg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KOuw1O"&gt;Beats Flex neckbuds with USB-C charging start at just $40&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="p7JCmx"&gt;If those Bose headphones are a little too pricey, the Beats Flex wireless neckbuds are $40 at Amazon in either the black or neon green colorway. They’re normally $50, so it’s not a huge price cut, though it amounts to a 20-percent discount. These are the first Beats that are just as easy to recommend for people using Android phones as they are for iPhone users. That’s because they charge via USB-C, and they also have a companion app on Android. On iPhone, they can easily and quickly pair with their Apple W1 wireless chip, letting them also switch between compatible Apple devices that have previously been paired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oxTM4t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9591203"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="b0udGT"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/czJXSyl16KZGyyLDmJE-iunqvSc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19895598/vpavic_042008_3967_0089.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="F9WegQ"&gt;Get the OnePlus 8, then save 50 percent on a second phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="D0MT1l"&gt;OnePlus is hosting a Presidents’ Day deal that lets you save when you buy two OnePlus 8 phones, which is helpful if you’re buying for a family. The glacial green-colored phone costs $599, and if you add a second one to your cart, you’ll automatically get 50 percent off it, totaling $898 for both. This deal will go on until Wednesday, February 17th, or until supplies last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yYfMhi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9572420"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
