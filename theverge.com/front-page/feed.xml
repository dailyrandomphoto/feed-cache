    <title>WhatsApp on the web gets a built-in sticker maker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5Eilv8mNBXbXq9I_cx2v15v8BZI=/0x0:1619x1079/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70186670/WhatsApp_Sticker_Tool_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The sticker maker lets you crop out a background, and add extra flourishes like emoji.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: WhatsApp&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n7epty"&gt;&lt;a href="https://web.whatsapp.com/"&gt;WhatsApp’s web version&lt;/a&gt; has been updated with a built-in custom Sticker Maker, which lets you turn ordinary images from your computer into stickers that can be sent via the messaging service. To access it, click the paperclip (attachments) icon, select Sticker, and then pick an image to upload. As well as WhatsApp’s web version, the feature is also coming to its &lt;a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/download"&gt;Desktop apps&lt;/a&gt; in the next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QI5jGo"&gt;Once uploaded, images can be edited to turn them into the perfect sticker. An outline can be drawn around a picture’s subject to cut out the background, and images can also be cropped (though always in a square aspect ratio). Emoji, text, and additional WhatsApp stickers can also be layered on top of your sticker creations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJzn3Q"&gt;Being able to make your own stickers on WhatsApp is nothing new, and there are a &lt;a href="https://www.techcommuters.com/best-sticker-maker-apps-for-android-and-ios/"&gt;whole range of third-party apps available on iOS and Android&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to the task. But it’s a convenient feature to have built directly into the service’s desktop and web versions, especially since they let you edit images with the precision of a mouse pointer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1KxZYQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QpL89u"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is offering Xbox Series X bundles direct to ‘valued customers’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h0yOjEmjhUYux2W2bCKiEw-IyKs=/8x0:2632x1749/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70186650/twarren_xboxseriesxhandson.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SzT75O"&gt;If you’re hunting for an Xbox Series X, you might want to check your email inbox. Microsoft has been emailing out special links over the past week to the Microsoft Store, that let you directly order an Xbox Series X bundle. Microsoft says it has a “limited supply of Xbox Series X bundles” that are available to “valued Microsoft customers” in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zFHJB"&gt;The emails are addressed to Microsoft Store customers, and bundles are available on a first-come and first-serve basis. Microsoft is limiting orders to one bundle per order, or two bundles per 30-day period. The links to order a bundle are unique and tied to a Microsoft Account, and don’t always guarantee that stock is available for a purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="n4IiKS"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Microsoft has been offering Xbox Series X bundles (with a game and extra controller) to “valued Microsoft customers” this week. Emails include a unique link to purchase a bundle &lt;a href="https://t.co/dEHlR0rsZ7"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dEHlR0rsZ7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1463250768681742344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hv90iU"&gt;A wide range of “valued Microsoft customers” seem to be receiving the emails, and it could be a way for Microsoft to ensure some of its stock isn’t heading into scalpers hands. The main requirement seems to be that you’ve shopped online at the US Microsoft Store before, and perhaps even purchased Xbox-related software or hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jxo0eI"&gt;If you’re lucky enough to receive an invite to purchase a bundle, you won’t be able to buy just the console itself. Microsoft is bundling a game and an additional controller with this offer, and you can pick between &lt;em&gt;Madden 22&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;GTA V&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Rust&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Far Cry 6&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Hasbro Family Fun Pack&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Insurgency Sandstorm&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Diablo 2 Resurrected&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e6n58a"&gt;Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22701878/xbox-phil-spencer-supply-constraints-2022"&gt;warned earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that Xbox Series X supply will be constrained into 2022. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22368552/global-chip-shortage-end-tsmc-samsung-ps5-supply-demand-intel"&gt;global chip shortage&lt;/a&gt; has impacted various companies for more than 18 months now. Car manufacturers have had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/10/22222166/semiconductor-shortage-ford-idle-kentucky-toyota-nissan-volkswagen"&gt;scale back production&lt;/a&gt; of vehicles, and it’s been near impossible to find stock of new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227040/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-3070-3060-ti-3090-rx-6800-xt"&gt;graphics cards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297039/playstation-ceo-ps5-supply-2021-stock-consoles-jim-ryan"&gt;PS5s&lt;/a&gt;, and Xbox consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NJp8YC"&gt;Scalpers have also been making a bad situation worse by driving up prices. PS5, Xbox Series X, and GPU street prices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22797788/price-ps5-xbox-nvidia-amd-rtx-gpu-scalpers-ebay-update"&gt;are still through the roof&lt;/a&gt;, with an Xbox Series X selling for an average of $856 on eBay right now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The newest game on Netflix is actually an old game  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2TGK7OUp7tRDi6m7SvXjX8Znbeo=/0x1:2153x1436/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70186514/Y4vlfOfnJ5.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ylZugz"&gt;The latest game to come to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759628/netflix-games-global-rollout-mobile-android-devices"&gt;Netflix’s fledgling gaming service&lt;/a&gt; is the racing title &lt;em&gt;Asphalt Xtreme&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/netflixs-gaming-service-adds-two-more-titles-including-the-return-of-gamelofts-asphalt-xtreme/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. If that name sounds familiar, that’s because the mobile game was originally released in October 2016 but was subsequently pulled from app stores at the end of September 2021. A trailer for the game released on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmPVO0j03TU"&gt;Netflix’s YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; notes that it will be available “exclusively” for the service’s subscribers, with no ads or in-app purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bDyuvw"&gt;It’s an interesting launch that sees Netflix’s gaming service borrowing from its video streaming playbook. Rather than exclusively releasing all-new, original titles, Netflix seems to be bulking out its catalog by licensing previously released games. Same as how Netflix’s video catalog contains all-new shows like &lt;em&gt;Lupin &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252580/bridgerton-netflix-82-million-households-biggest-show-ever-caveats"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;alongside classics like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/16/20868736/seinfeld-netflix-2021-hulu-friends-streaming-wars"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="n4KVdd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple Arcade has used a similar approach&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NexX0C"&gt;Other game subscription services have struck a similar balance. This year, Apple Arcade &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623498/apple-arcade-castlevania-grimoire-of-souls"&gt;added the game &lt;em&gt;Castlevania: Grimoire of Souls&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which had previously seen a &lt;a href="https://toucharcade.com/2019/01/31/castlevania-grimoire-of-souls-global-release/"&gt;limited release in Canada in 2019&lt;/a&gt; but which was &lt;a href="https://toucharcade.com/2020/07/09/castlevania-grimoire-of-souls-release-date-closing-canada-ios-android-free/"&gt;discontinued the following year&lt;/a&gt;. Alongside it, Apple’s game service also offers brand new titles like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22362624/fantasian-release-date-apple-arcade-hironobu-sakaguchi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; So too does Xbox Game Pass include a mix of new and old games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AKwSmF"&gt;If you’re a Netflix subscriber and want to check out the mobile games available on its service, you can find them listed in its regular iOS and Android apps. Be aware, though, that in order to actually play them you’ll be linked out to each platforms’ app store to download each game. On iOS, this approach is due to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/20912689/apple-cloud-gaming-streaming-xcloud-stadia-app-store-guidelines-rules"&gt;Apple’s strict App Store rules&lt;/a&gt;, which prevent developers from letting users download or stream a catalog of games within their existing apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pGqhpi"&gt;Thankfully, the process is about as seamless as it can be given the circumstances — I just tried downloading a Netflix game on an iPhone where I’m already signed in, and I didn’t have to go through a separate login process. Available games include &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/pl/app/stranger-things-1984/id1574739824"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stranger Things: 1984&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/stranger-things-3-the-game/id1574824199"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stranger Things 3: The Game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/shooting-hoops/id1585735348"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shooting Hoops&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/teeter-up/id1585735663"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Teeter (Up)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/card-blast/id1586360462"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Card Blast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hellofrostypop/status/1461009547447783429"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bowling Ballers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a new title that was released earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X5bJX0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/netflixs-gaming-service-adds-two-more-titles-including-the-return-of-gamelofts-asphalt-xtreme/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Asphalt Xtreme&lt;/em&gt; is gradually rolling out to users globally, and will come to Netflix subscribers in the US in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tWSOus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt; is currently producing a series with Netflix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter updates iOS app to stop tweets disappearing mid-read</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Twitter bird logo in white against a dark background with outlined logos around it and red circles rippling out from it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RSWyIm9tp16n4sbh7n3M4x7UId0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70186397/acastro_180827_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KQ6EGz"&gt;Twitter has updated its iOS app to prevent those annoying situations where tweets disappear as you’re trying to read them, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1463270547706585100"&gt;company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. “Now when you pause your timeline scrolling to look at a Tweet, it should stay put!” the company tweeted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8UjaGU"&gt;The updates made on iOS follow similar improvements made on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785094/twitter-auto-refresh-timeline-stop-tweets-disappear"&gt;web version of Twitter last week&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter explained that tweets can disappear when replies are being added to an ongoing conversation, because this would push existing tweets up the timeline. “We know it’s a frustrating experience, so we’re working on changing it,” the company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1440766157884039170"&gt;said in September&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hoFeZc"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’ve made some updates on iOS to prevent Tweets from disappearing mid-read. Now when you pause your timeline scrolling to look at a Tweet, it should stay put!&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1463270547706585100?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M7Bwiz"&gt;The changes have come during an unusually busy year for Twitter, where it’s been adding major new features on an almost monthly basis. Earlier this month it added a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22783594/twitter-blue-nuzzel-top-articles-ios-arrivial-top-articles"&gt;new summary of popular articles&lt;/a&gt; for subscribers of Twitter Blue, a paid service that itself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22464291/twitter-blue-subscription-service-canada-australia-undo-reader-mode"&gt;only launched in June this year&lt;/a&gt;. Other major new features to have been widely released this year include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22753072/twitter-super-follows-subscription-ios"&gt;Super Follows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22739249/twitter-finally-letting-everyone-create-spaces"&gt;Spaces&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/22/22740451/twitter-revue-subscribe-newsletter-tweet"&gt;new button&lt;/a&gt; to simplify the process of subscribing to newsletters.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This ultra-short throw projector can almost replace a TV</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;But you need to really hate the look of televisions&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="8fbvIT"&gt;Televisions are ugly. A 55-incher creates about 1,300 square-inches of eyesore when not in use. Many don’t care, but my spouse does, which meant living with a tiny TV for longer than I care to admit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="owGqMb"&gt;Ultra-short throw projectors are often marketed as TV replacements. They’re small by comparison, yet capable of projecting a large image when placed just inches from the wall. But UST projectors capable of a big bright 4K HDR image have always been prohibitively expensive. So, long story short, we bought a 55-inch OLED TV while in Covid lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XpnzGa"&gt;But now there’s a newcomer: the all-in-one Xgimi Aura is a 4K HDR ultra-short throw laser projector with integrated sound system that runs Android TV and is capable of tossing 2400 lumens onto my white walls for $2,499. That’s not cheap, but it undercuts other 4K short-throw projectors that start at &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fvava-4k-uhd-smart-ultra-short-throw-laser-tv-home-theater-projector-black%2F6440309.p%3FskuId%3D6440309&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$2,800 for a VAVA&lt;/a&gt;, jump to $3,300 from established brands &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Foptoma-cinemax-p2-smart-true-4k-uhd-ultra-short-throw-laser-home-theater-projector-white%2F6426680.p%3FskuId%3D6426680&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;like Optoma&lt;/a&gt;, and reach prices as high as &lt;a href="https://electronics.sony.com/tv-video/projectors/all-projectors/p/vplvz1000es"&gt;$15,000&lt;/a&gt; for a top-end Sony. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d3ERAh"&gt;“Your next TV is not a TV,” is how Xgimi markets the Aura. But can a UST projector really replace a modern TV?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Ethvz"&gt;Well, &lt;em&gt;maybe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Cor5wK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10882819"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gceXXz"&gt;Let’s first take a step back for those of you not familiar with Xgimi. The Chinese company got its start in 2014 before debuting in Western markets in 2016. It’s built a loyal fanbase around nice looking all-in-one portable projectors that are reasonably specced yet still inexpensive. These include the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/30/11329640/XGIMI-Z4-Aurora-hands-on-review"&gt;Z4 Aurora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22548487/xgimi-horizon-pro-4k-hdr-review-projector-portable-specs-price"&gt;Horizon Pro 4K&lt;/a&gt; which &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reviewed previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ilrriq"&gt;The Xgimi Aura is not portable. It measures 606 x 401 x 139.5mm and weighs 14.9kg (about 32 pounds) which is big compared to traditional long-throw projectors. But most of that volume sits low on a cabinet in place of a free-standing television. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="COMygo"&gt;To replace a TV, the Aura needs to turn on as quickly, be just as enjoyable to view in all lighting scenarios, offer a similar selection of streaming apps, and deliver comparable sound with the option to enhance it for home theater setups. It also needs to do all these things while justifying a price that’s at least twice that of a 55-inch OLED. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g6nFUI"&gt;So let’s address each item one-by-one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QLJEyY"&gt;Time to TV&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q6FewC"&gt;My 55-inch LG TV boots into webOS in about 25 seconds with Quick Start+ turned off. It turns on in just 5-6 seconds with standby enabled, which is my usual setup. By comparison, the Xgimi Aura boots cold into Android TV OS 10.0 in about 55 seconds, twice as long as the LG TV. Turning on from standby takes about 11 seconds, again twice the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rjZCwa"&gt;There is an option to turn the Aura’s laser projection unit off (to stream music, for example) which allows it to spring back to life instantaneously. But fan noise (more on that later) and excessive power draw makes this an option I use sparingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQDwrj"&gt;More importantly, apps launch faster on the Aura than my TV. Plex launches about three times faster, YouTube opens instantly while the TV takes a few seconds, Apple TV launches about 50 percent faster, and Prime Video about 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FkzOdV"&gt;I can deal with a few extra seconds of startup time as long as my apps are responsive when I’m looking for something to watch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TSHCtl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Winner: Aura.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All the inputs and outputs are on the back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4w1LDi"&gt;Viewing Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="i5r1bZ"&gt;Comparing the viewing experience of a projector to a TV is really comparing apples to oranges. Some will certainly prioritize a 100-plus inch immersive display that, for most people, is only financially viable with a projector. Others want high-contrast, color-accurate displays enabled by the brightest TVs. Unless you’re in the market for a super yacht, you can’t afford both size and image-popping HDR from a single display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="6oVuG8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10882519"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fM2m1y"&gt;Size junkies will be drawn to the Aura’s claimed 150-inch max display. But that comes with a few catches. First, spreading all those lumens across such a large space dims the displayed image considerably. Second, the Xgimi Aura needs to be 17.3 inches (44.1cm) from the wall to achieve such a large image, which can easily defeat typical TV stands that tend to be quite narrow (the projector is almost 16-inches wide). Nevertheless, buying a wider table is cheaper than knocking down a wall to gain the distance required by some long-throw projectors to achieve that same display size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xOJR7h"&gt;In my setup, where the Aura sits on a narrow Ikea sideboard, the furthest I can move the projector from the wall before the beamer tumbles over the edge is about 15.5cm (6.1 inches). That’s far enough to create a 90-inch projected rectangle. It’s big compared to my 55-inch LG OLED but nowhere near as bright. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wKKz2u"&gt;As you might have already guessed then, viewing the Aura during the day is bad. It’s fine for watching the news, I guess, and catching up on some of my YouTube subscriptions as long as the blinds are closed, but the image is washed out severely, even on dreary rainy afternoons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="G6T47T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10882606"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xxycte"&gt;It’s at night when the Aura’s giant 4K projected image really springs to life. True, blacks suffer from having to be projected over distance using light unlike my OLED TV, but the Xgimi Aura still serves up some beautiful dark scenery from films like Dune, thanks to the more spacious screen that evokes the type of cinematic experience I’ve longed for since the pandemic closed theaters. Sports also look great on the Aura when viewed in a darkened room. It should go without saying, but the bigger image makes it easier to keep track of the ball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDVDev"&gt;Watching in darkness isn’t a problem currently as the sun sets at 5pm where I live. However, I’d need blackout blinds in the summers when daylight stretches past 10pm. That’s something to consider if you live in a northern climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zkwOhgkoM5jm5u2fdAfuOOCCB7c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23039709/verge_IMG_20211124_103816_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Colors pop, but Aura lacks the brightness and contrast to rival HDR on TVs (4K HDR content).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p42GTk"&gt;Overall, the Aura’s colors are rich, even if they tend to skew green; images are sharp; and focus is uniform throughout. And while the Aura supports HDR10, it’s simply not bright enough to produce the image-popping contrast produced by modern TVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a0NES5"&gt;Casual gameplay is also wonderful on that giant display, especially in multiplayer split-screen modes that can be cramped on even large televisions. But input latency and lack of HDMI 2.1 mean you won’t be taking home any professional esports titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kSu0ik"&gt;I had to tilt my Aura review unit upward to keep a power outlet from obscuring part of the projection. This was easy to do thanks to Aura’s integrated legs that unscrew from beneath, and 8-point keystone correction to square the image again. But like all projectors, the image brightness suffers as a result at those angles while also resulting in trapezoidal light shadows that become visible in dark scenes. The ideal setup is for the Aura to be sitting flat and pointing directly at the wall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WBXWMD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Projecting light from below makes wall deformities more prominent &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BLrV7Y"&gt;Having the light projected from below also makes deformities in my wall more noticeable due to their respective shadows. Front-projection devices do a much better job of obscuring the holes, nicks, and undulating plaster on my 170-year-old walls. My setup would benefit from a projection screen, which would smooth out the images while improving image brightness and contrast. But that would really defeat this as a TV replacement unless I wanted to pay even more for a screen that automatically unfurls from a ceiling nook. No thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qXkouj"&gt;Like Xgimi’s other projectors, the Aura features an integrated Harman Kardon sound system. This time it’s a beefy 4 x 15W setup (equally divided into two tweeters and two woofers) with DTS and Dolby Audio support. It’s plenty loud and yields decent audio separation that blows my LG TV out of the water. The Aura’s audio can’t compete with my usual 5.1 Sonos setup, but it does have an S/PDIF optical output for expansion, as well as a headphone jack and support for Bluetooth audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8QMci4"&gt;Fan noise from the Aura produces a light hum that’s easily noticeable. I can hear it buzz from ten-feet away as Android TV cycles through what should be silent slideshows. It bothers me when my attention is drawn to the noise, but mostly I’m unaware of it. With the display off, Aura slows the fan down to cut the noise by half. This can be useful if you want to use it as a music player, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W7F4Po"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Winner: It’s a tossup, because sometimes a giant display that’s good is better than a smaller one that’s great.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="I3aYs6"&gt;Smart Apps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VUQ6Ra"&gt;The Aura runs Android TV like many smart televisions. That means plenty of streaming apps to choose from like Apple TV Plus, Disney Plus, YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, Plex, and HBO Max. Netflix, however, has still not certified Xgimi under the steamer’s proprietary &lt;a href="https://openconnect.netflix.com/en/"&gt;Open Connect program&lt;/a&gt; to make Netflix streams more efficient. The app can be installed via workarounds, but even this stopped working half-way through my testing (other workarounds routinely pop-up). Fortunately, Aura has Chromecast support built-in but the experience pales in comparison to a local app, and performance is inconsistent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G2hcBq"&gt;For example, Chromecasting video was usually fine, but the NFL GamePass app crapped out on both iOS and Android devices. The only fix was to attach an old Chromecast dongle off an HDMI port that worked flawlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tPKFYl"&gt;The Apple TV app also errored out a few times during my testing which was only solved by rebooting the Aura.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z7Sqv5"&gt;But it really comes back to Netflix. Netflix is used by over 200 million people around the world. Spending $2,500 on a projector marketed as a TV replacement only to find out the app is missing is troubling, especially for families with small kids who don’t have phones for casting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l6X2bd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Winner: TV.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KEpqUf"&gt;Other Observations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="1kX7oY"&gt;The Aura has built-in eye protection that quickly cuts the laser light source if it detects interference. It’s fast and will hopefully protect the curious eyes of kids and pets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PqCaMn"&gt;Upscaled 1080p content looked fine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0BozwG"&gt;The Aura features the same remote control with dedicated Google Assistant button I tested, and liked, on the Horizon Pro. Don’t lose it because other than a power button, there aren’t any on-device controls. (Even then there’s always the Google Home software remote.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DiPC0eRtJPVC0GSUzpq5uehua4Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23037391/verge_IMG20211122144809_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aura does big well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ttIYeS"&gt;Over the years I proposed a variety of less ugly TV solutions to my wife only to be rebuffed. A ceiling mounted projector (don’t want to open the walls for cable runs). TV mounted to an electric lift (have to build a giant cabinet to hide it). Rollable TV (too prototype-y and way too expensive). One of those always-on TVs that pretends it’s a picture frame (do you think I’m a fool?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWXDqQ"&gt;The Xgimi Aura all-in-one 4K ultra-short throw projector can indeed replace a TV but only if you’re installing it in a very dark room. Even then you’ll have to put up with fan noise, no Netflix app, and an inferior (but very good) picture for the price of two 55-inch OLED TVs &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a game console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="peMXZz"&gt;But if you really hate the idea of a giant TV ruining the aesthetic of your minimalistic living room, or you want the biggest image possible in a narrow room where a traditional long-throw projector just won’t fit, then the $2,500 Xgimi Aura is as good as it gets for the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="qF3jFN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10882748"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly switching to its own iPhone modem design in 2023</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rM51ne"&gt;Apple is planning to partner with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. for the production of its own 5G modems for future iPhones, according to a &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/Apple-taps-TSMC-to-build-custom-iPhone-5G-modem-in-2023"&gt;new report in &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Apple is said to be planning to use TSMC’s 4nm process node, which hasn’t yet been deployed for any commercial product; the modem is apparently being designed and tested at 5nm before moving to mass production in 2023 at 4nm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sYPkpa"&gt;Apple’s switch to modems of its own design is widely expected to happen in 2023, and TSMC is the natural manufacturing partner. Qualcomm, which is the dominant player in the industry and produces modem components for the entire iPhone 13 lineup, recently said that it expects to account for just 20 percent of iPhone modem orders in two years’ time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="HhiBJg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iPhone 13 review: yep, bigger batteries are better","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="IAG1ZF"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/8909671/apple-intel-5g-smartphone-modems-acquisition"&gt;Apple bought Intel’s 5G modem division in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, foreshadowing the eventual switch. Earlier that year Qualcomm and Apple agreed to end a costly modem technology patent dispute, with Qualcomm receiving &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525962/qualcomm-apple-settlement-4-5-billion-dollars-patent"&gt;more than $4 billion&lt;/a&gt; as part of the settlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="60SHji"&gt;TSMC is the manufacturer of all iPhone A-series processors and M1 systems-on-chip for Mac computers. According to &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;, there are hundreds of TSMC engineers based in Cupertino to work with Apple’s chip development team. 2022 iPhone SoCs will reportedly use TSMC’s 4nm process, and some iPad models are said to be adopting 3nm processors in 2023. &lt;em&gt;Nikkei &lt;/em&gt;says the iPhone will make the 3nm jump “as soon as” next year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Tolkien estate has smote JRR Token — but the NFTs persist</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f4ygPZGga1I-mWnkfBQTvE0MroM=/272x0:2609x1558/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70185837/Screen_Shot_2021_08_03_at_6.26.43_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: JRR Token&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H8EPtx"&gt;It seems &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22608361/jrr-token-cryptocurrency-one-ring-lord-of-the-rings"&gt;our prediction&lt;/a&gt; that a &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;-themed “JRR Token” cryptocurrency was destined for the fires of Mount Doom was accurate — the World Intellectual Property Organization (or WIPO) has declared that it violated a trademark belonging to the estate of author J.R.R. Tolkien, and ordered that one of the project’s web domains be transferred to that estate (via the &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/11/tolkien-estate-vanquishes-lord-of-the-rings-themed-cryptocurrency/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UPrPWJ"&gt;If you’re unfamiliar with JRR Token (not Tolkien), here’s the lore — it was a cryptocurrency project that drew &lt;em&gt;heavy&lt;/em&gt; inspiration from &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;. Its tagline was “The One Token That Rules Them All,” its website featured Tolkien-esque imagery of rolling hills and wizards, and there was &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/did-pippin-from-the-lord-of-rings-just-promote-a-new-cr-1847434477"&gt;even a promotional video&lt;/a&gt; featuring an actor from the movies making Hobbit puns and claiming that the token was going “to the moon.” It promised a bunch of financial features called “Tokenomics,” the actual details of which were left annoyingly unclear by its (&lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;-themed) white paper and website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rkARd0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Tolkien Estate issued its complaint almost as soon as the project went live&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xhOc7k"&gt;As many, many people predicted, all this didn’t sit well with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolkien_Estate#Legal_issues"&gt;the famously litigious&lt;/a&gt; Tolkien Estate — it &lt;a href="https://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/search/text.jsp?case=D2021-2571"&gt;filed a complaint with WIPO&lt;/a&gt; on August 7th, the day after the tokens went on sale.  The estate claimed that the project’s site, jrrtoken.com, violated its trademarks, and provided paragraphs of detailed explanations about how the website was infringing on &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings.&lt;/em&gt; Honestly, though, you can probably get the gist by &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210809190917/http://www.jrrtoken.com/"&gt;just looking at a web archive&lt;/a&gt; or screenshot of it. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UPz-PTsicSbxx6qVi309FQrnAGI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23039076/Screen_Shot_2021_11_23_at_17.16.11.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Via: The Wayback Machine&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;If you look closely, you can see subtle references to&lt;/em&gt; Lord of the Rings.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cfWAQQ"&gt;(Note: the project also had another site, thetokenofpower.com — based on Wayback Machine archives, the two sites appear to have had the same content, but only the former is mentioned in WIPO’s writeup. Neither site contains information about the token anymore.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R2HQva"&gt;In its defense, lawyers for the token attempted to argue that people wouldn’t confuse JRR Token with JRR Tolkien because the “L” and “I” in Tolkien are “conspicuously absent” in Token, and the two phrases are pronounced differently. The response also reads, in part:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="h4TkJX"&gt;J R R TOLKIEN is not confusingly similar to JRR TOKEN. The former is a surname used as a trademark and the latter is an English word meaning a form of digital currency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qlySUY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If you look closely, your honor, these two words are different&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PzXr32"&gt;Strangely, the WIPO panel (not to be confused with the Council of Elrond), wasn’t convinced by these arguments, or by the ones saying it was meant to be a parody — it said &lt;a href="https://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/search/text.jsp?case=D2021-2571"&gt;in its decision&lt;/a&gt; that the domain name was registered “in bad faith,” and that it “was selected for the sole purpose of creating a false association with” author J.R.R. Tolkien. All the &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; references and imagery on the token’s website didn’t help the project’s case either, according to WIPO, nor did the fact that it was a commercial enterprise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8DCsjv"&gt;The panel also said that the developer’s alternate explanation that the “JRR” in “JRR Token” actually stood for “Journey through Risk to Reward” was probably bogus, given that the phrase didn’t seem to be used on the site. In its own words: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="dVOW8o"&gt;It is not clear to the Panel what “Journey through Risk to Reward” actually means, and why the term “journey” is relevant to the purchase of tokens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjN1nN"&gt;“There is no doubt that the Respondent was aware of Tolkien’s works and created a website to trade off the fame of these works,” reads part of the WIPO’s decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lj9i0a"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/nov/23/tolkien-estate-blocks-jrr-token-cryptocurrency"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Tolkien estate is now working to “delete any infringing online content” — and indeed the token’s Twitter account, YouTube channel, and websites appear to be gone. To misquote &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/N4xV2RIlMi4?t=100"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fellowship of the Ring&lt;/em&gt;’s opening scene&lt;/a&gt;: one by one, JRR Token’s sites and social media accounts fell to the power of international copyright law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ktXaLw"&gt;But, as they say, there were some that resisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s2kTGe"&gt;Like The One Ring in Tolkien’s story, the token has survived after a fashion — in the form of &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/collection/jrrtoken9nfts"&gt;an OpenSea collection&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Of course&lt;/em&gt; there are JRR Token NFTs, and if you thought the main project was blatantly biting &lt;em&gt;LotR&lt;/em&gt; just wait until you feast your eyes on these (akin to how Gollum disgustingly feasts on a live fish in that one scene I still hate watching).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gyOUhyyngl3pzpu0bXG2FyQWI9w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23038886/Screen_Shot_2021_11_23_at_15.56.34.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This may be the last haven for JRR Token’s online presence.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cZRLAWkFW_MYpNTsrwyRnyLbcy4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23038878/Screen_Shot_2021_11_23_at_15.51.54.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I too love to claim that the bad guys of LotR were pro-centralization, and then make all my NFTs depict the villains of the story.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="EL2But"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rNG974"&gt;Interestingly, the NFTs weren’t mentioned in the WIPO’s case write-up, though the timeline may offer some insight into that. As previously noted, the Tolkien estate filed its complaint in early August, and the NFTs weren’t advertised on JRR Token’s website until sometime between August 31st and September 11th, according to &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210911051129/https://www.thetokenofpower.com/"&gt;captures by the Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ECoDmt"&gt;Looking at the blockchain gives us even more precise timing — &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/Accounthasbeendisabled?tab=activity"&gt;OpenSea shows&lt;/a&gt; that the NFTs were minted on August 31st, and were either listed for sale or transferred to other accounts on September 1st. That is, by the way, is the exact same day the WIPO’s report says that JRR Token filed its response to the complaint. I pray that someday I’m granted the confidence (but not the audacity) of the person who creates NFTs with characters from &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings &lt;/em&gt;while fighting an infringement complaint from the Tolkien estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QFb8Qx"&gt;I’m not sure what will end up happening to the JRR Token NFTs, though I don’t imagine the Tolkien estate will be happy if it finds out about them. As for the rest of the project — if I’m honest, this is pretty much exactly what I expected to happen. The Eye of Sauron may be ever watchful, but the eye of The Tolkien Estate is even more so — and no mere token can be expected to resist the powers of the WIPO.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elizabeth Holmes admitted to a key part of the case against her</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Theranos Founder Elizabeth Holmes Testifies In Her Own Defense At Trial" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oQ6QUTYBgNx_5wamgAakeZAv23c=/0x0:2971x1981/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70185606/1236751419.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Ethan Swope/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Holmes confesses to a passion for graphic design&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="XZYCQB"&gt;Who added the Schering-Plough and Pfizer logos to the&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22760601/theranos-pfizer-schering-plough-logo-memo"&gt; Theranos-produced lab reports&lt;/a&gt; that investors received? Why, none other than Elizabeth Holmes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YxhSlj"&gt;“This work was done in partnership with those companies and I was trying to convey that,” she said on the stand today. She added the logos before sending the memos to Walgreens, which Theranos would later partner with. Holmes wasn’t trying to fool anyone, she said. “I wish I’d done it differently.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="6ZFtzg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I wish I’d done it differently.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4r7KDq"&gt;Holmes spoke slowly as she confessed. The testimony, given on her third day of questioning by her defense team, sounded polished. Rehearsed. It was the most confident she’d sound all day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pn58oS"&gt;Those documents have been a major part of the case against Holmes in her trial for wire fraud. Investors testified that they thought the documents had been generated by the pharma companies themselves. And Holmes’ &lt;em&gt;mea culpa&lt;/em&gt; didn’t explain why the language in the Schering-Plough memo had changed from “give accurate and precise results” in the version the drug company saw to “give more accurate and precise results… than current ‘gold standard’ reference methods” in the Walgreens version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LDQgG"&gt;But maybe the confession was meant to make it sound more serious when Holmes spent other parts of her testimony passing the buck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ckc6r9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The clinical lab&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="tkp8h1"&gt;Holmes said that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22692600/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-bad-tests-complaints"&gt;lab director Adam Rosendorff&lt;/a&gt;, VP Daniel Young, and Balwani, her CFO, were responsible for the clinical lab — implying that whatever problems happened there weren’t her fault. And, maybe, that she wasn’t completely aware of those problems. As she discussed conditions in the lab, her speech sped up and she appeared nervous. She said she hadn’t pressured Rosendorff to approve tests. Hadn’t pressured Young, either. Hadn’t pressured &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; to sign off on a lab report they didn’t want to sign. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J2dCkk"&gt;Whatever had gone on in the lab, well, that wasn’t her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DVVDYo"&gt;When Rosendorff raised concerns about the schedule for tests, “I recall telling Dr. Rosendorff that we’ll do whatever it takes to give him the time he needs to bring up the tests properly,” Holmes said. Those tests were delayed by months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="b4YJgl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This was the wrong way to treat people.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7wp2ca"&gt;What about scientist Surekha Gangakhedkar, another&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22680372/elizabeth-holmes-wire-fraud-emails-gangakhedkar"&gt; employee who feared getting blamed&lt;/a&gt; for Theranos’ problems? Well, gee, Holmes had no idea Gangakhedkar had reservations about Theranos’s tests. (Holmes did not directly address Gangakhedkar’s testimony that Holmes had pressured her to approve tests.) When the scientist resigned, she cited stress and health issues. Stress, incidentally, can &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt; health issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tEJH75"&gt;Holmes tried to convince Gangakhedkar to take a leave of absence, but the scientist quit. And we saw one reason why Gangakhedkar was so stressed: an email from Balwani (on which Holmes was copied!) scolding her for not working hard enough. “Please note the software team was here til 3:07AM — and is already here now at 10AM,” he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gepWT9"&gt;Holmes said she wished she’d handled this differently. “This was the wrong way to treat people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oyjFdl"&gt;The rotten working environment at Theranos was a consistent theme among employees who testified in the trial. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676789/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-wire-fraud-erika-cheung-whistleblower"&gt;Entry-level employee Erika Cheung&lt;/a&gt; testified that people &lt;a href="https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/theranos-employees-were-sleeping-in-their-cars-in-effort-to-address-quality-control-issues/2659820/"&gt;slept in their cars&lt;/a&gt; as they tried to address problems with quality control on Theranos tests. On the day Gangakhedkar quit, &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; member of her team also quit, also citing stress. A human resources employee emailed Holmes about it: “Surekha just came by and said she believes Tina is resigning because of health reasons, family life and stress,” that email said. “She said it is similar to the reasons she is resigning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZEq5ic"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questionable marketing materials&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZbbJ8P"&gt;As for Theranos’ marketing, which the prosecution argued deceived people about Theranos’s technology, that was the doing of Chiat Day, the firm that famously did the Apple “1984” ad, Holmes said. The images that conveyed Theranos’ message — like the image of the cute kid captioned with “Goodbye Big Bad Needle” — were symbols that Chiat Day told them to adopt for their brand identity. Images were &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; important for conveying identity, the firm told Holmes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="Fr566K"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Holmes said she reviewed the article before publication&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lkMenB"&gt;But Holmes admits that she wasn’t hands-off with shaping Theranos’ image. Theranos hired a PR group, Grow Marketing, and managed to place a story in &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s opinion section, written by Joseph Rago, about how amazing Theranos was, titled: “&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324123004579055003869574012"&gt;Elizabeth Holmes: The Breakthrough of Instant Diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kZeR8R"&gt;In the article, which Holmes said she reviewed before publication, Rago wrote that “Theranos’s processes are faster, cheaper and more accurate than the conventional methods and require only microscopic blood volumes, not vial after vial of the stuff.” This article was part of the marketing materials that investors received, convincing them to invest in Theranos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tbfizV"&gt;That was part of the press strategy — to introduce Theranos before announcing its partnership with Walgreens. You know, the one that had gotten Holmes to send the be-logoed reports. We saw emails Holmes wrote about the roll-out strategy. At the end of 2013, Theranos agreed to open its testing locations in 3,000 stores over the next two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3t7xBA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slow roll-out at Walgreens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3jqi9B"&gt;Former &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/elizabeth-holmes-trial-theranos/card/CIYwcVsttP84lQkksJJW"&gt;Walgreens senior executive Nimesh Jhaveri testified earlier &lt;/a&gt;in the trial that the roll-out had been slowed because so many tests had been done on venous draws, instead of the fingersticks Theranos had promised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lPboqS"&gt;According to Holmes, the roll-out was going well in early 2014. By the end of the year, only 40 service centers had opened. But see, that wasn’t Holmes’ fault, because Walgreens had made an acquisition (of Boots, another pharmacy) and all the Walgreens execs had been replaced by Boots execs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OzYFN3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weird financial projections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6v9XJK"&gt;As for the wonky financial projections that had convinced investors that Theranos was more profitable than it actually was, well, those models were Balwani’s and he prepared the projections she used. Looking at the projected revenue in 2014 ($140 million) and 2015 ($990 million), Balwani “built a model with a number of assumptions about how many stores Theranos would roll out to and other work with physicians and hospital systems sending us samples” and that was how he made projections, Holmes said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YZ2WYD"&gt;Balwani was the primary contact for investor Daniel Grossman of PFM Management, Holmes said. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22786461/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-trial-brian-grossman-pfm-investor-testimony"&gt;Grossman previously testified&lt;/a&gt; that Holmes lied to him about Theranos’ capabilities, and that in meetings where both Holmes and Balwani attended, Holmes did most of the talking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="iqaQmg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problems with Safeway&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PwIG46"&gt;As for Theranos’ failed attempt to open stores in Safeway, part of that was executive changeover. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/06/former-safeway-ceo-says-theranos-delays-raised-red-flags.html"&gt;Former Safeway CEO Steven Burd had testified&lt;/a&gt; that Theranos’ frequent delays troubled him, but &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/12/safeway-ex-ceo-we-did-at-least-100-hours-of-diligence-on-theranos.html"&gt;Holmes never told him there was a problem&lt;/a&gt; with Theranos’ tech. He retired; when new management came in, Balwani dealt with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="bOFDm2"&gt;The defense &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22663723/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-trial-opening-arguments-day-one"&gt;announced its strategy on the very first day&lt;/a&gt;: pass the buck. The gamble appeared to be that having Holmes admit her culpability in the doctored memos would give her more credibility when she blamed other people for almost everything else. But the difference between Holmes’ demeanor when she admitted her role in the memos and when she spent time blaming others was striking. As she deflected responsibility, for the first time in the trial, she looked nervous.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter verified a fake account in the Norwegian government, but it’s not Twitter’s fault</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K4OkgI35ED6S8vmNZsu7ZPK9oJw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70185172/acastro_170726_1777_0012_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dilxhA"&gt;Twitter verified a fake account for Norway’s new Minister of Finance, but apparently, it’s not Twitter’s fault. As first reported by Norwegian tech site &lt;a href="https://nrkbeta.no/2021/11/23/smk-tabbe-verifiserte-falsk-finansminister-pa-twitter/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NRKbeta&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Prime Minister’s Office and Norway’s Security Authority (NSM) mistakenly passed along a fake account for verification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="d3K4fu"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Twitter has verified a fake account portraying the Norwegian Minister of Finance, Trygve Slagsvold Vedum.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Norwegian Ministry of Finance confirms the story to news agency NTB: &lt;a href="https://t.co/dcpINS9ZhS"&gt;https://t.co/dcpINS9ZhS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/U6MvNk93d0"&gt;pic.twitter.com/U6MvNk93d0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ståle Grut (@stalebg) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stalebg/status/1462751042081370118?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iNwKcI"&gt;Norway’s Minister of Finance, Trygve Slagsvold Vedum, has never had a Twitter account. The report states that several fake accounts impersonating Vedum cropped up since he was elected into office this September, so much so that the Ministry of Finance &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Finansdep/status/1450045492520493056"&gt;sent out a tweet&lt;/a&gt; last month warning that the Minister of Finance doesn’t actually have an account. The translated tweet reads, “We want to inform that Minister of Finance Trygve Slagsvold Vedum does not have private Twitter. Accounts that appear in his name are therefore fake and will be reported.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2dGQKu"&gt;What was different about this most recent fake account, though, was that it was granted a blue checkmark by Twitter. According to &lt;em&gt;NRKbeta&lt;/em&gt;, Vedum’s fake account sent out tweets that oppose his political party’s policies, potentially ruffling some feathers in the political sphere. However, Twitter doesn’t appear to be responsible for the mistake — &lt;em&gt;NRKbeta&lt;/em&gt; found that the Prime Minister’s Office and the NSM were at fault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CaH9CA"&gt;“Unfortunately, there was an error in the reporting that caused a fake account to be verified,” Anne Kristin Hjuske, the head of communications at the Prime Minister’s Office told &lt;em&gt;NRKbeta&lt;/em&gt;. “The account has now been removed and we have made sure that no more fake accounts have been verified. Furthermore, we are currently reviewing our reporting routines to ensure that this does not happen again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6vsGja"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It seems somebody at the Prime Minister’s Office was fooled by the account”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pLrdgC"&gt;The Prime Minister’s Office and NSM were responsible for verifying politicians’ social media accounts following the recent election. The fake account apparently tricked both organizations, got sent along to Twitter, and passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="baq32m"&gt;“Out of nowhere one of these fake accounts shows up verified,” Ståle Grut, the journalist behind the &lt;em&gt;NRKbeta&lt;/em&gt; article told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It seems somebody at the Prime Minister's Office coordinating the verification was fooled by the account, and it ended up being sent to Twitter along with the other newly appointed ministers who are also now all verified.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IW0kID"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22673213/twitter-verification-application-requests-open-how-to"&gt;Twitter recently revamped its verification process&lt;/a&gt; to specifically prevent the creation of fake accounts. It reopened its verification process this past May after nearly four years of overhauling the system, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623714/twitter-verification-program-pause-fake-accounts-review"&gt;later briefly put it on pause&lt;/a&gt; after mistakenly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575025/twitter-verified-fake-accounts-botnet-researcher"&gt;verifying several phony accounts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8f5eRh"&gt;But it seems that no matter how fancy Twitter makes its verification process, it still can’t protect against plain old human error. It remains unclear whether Twitter typically delegates its verification process to outside authorities. If it does, that’s especially concerning for accounts that belong to high-profile government officials, and this mishap is a case in point. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to Twitter with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Studios is reportedly trying to make a Mass Effect TV show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eGJ6woIxJhzU3VFyDnlyCHUJvHE=/60x0:708x432/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70185126/MassEffect_LE_Key_Art_16x9_RGB_768x432.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: BioWare&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NIQoaH"&gt;According to a report by &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/11/the-wheel-of-time-premiere-ratings-amazon-prime-video-mass-effect-lort-of-the-rings-jennifer-salke-qa-1234879517/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon isn’t relying on the just-launched&lt;em&gt; Wheel of Time&lt;/em&gt; series and its upcoming Lord of the Rings show to pull in sci-fi/fantasy viewers. The entertainment news outlet reports that Amazon is “nearing a deal to develop a series” based on the &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt; games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="AefmO3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon’s Wheel of Time tries a little too hard to be Game of Thrones","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785109/amazon-wheel-of-time-tv-show-review-rosamund-pike-game-of-thrones"},{"title":"Amazon’s Lord of the Rings series will premiere in September 2022 ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22606267/lord-of-the-rings-amazon-series-release-date"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="WXCTFT"&gt;While Electronic Arts and BioWare have not announced a series, there have been more than a few hints. Earlier this year, the project director for EA’s remastered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22256806/mass-effect-legendary-edition-pc-ps4-xbox-one-mac-walters-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mass Effect: Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; trilogy set &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mass-effect-director-on-rise-of-video-game-tv-shows-2021-6"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it’s “not a matter of if, but when” a movie or TV show project appears relating to the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PILS5D"&gt;There was also that &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CLrAjEuhtTe/"&gt;interesting Instagram post&lt;/a&gt; in February from Henry Cavill, who may want to add male Commander Shepard to his geeky resume along with Superman and Geralt from &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;. The actor posted an easily-deblurred image hinting at a “secret project?,” and internet sleuths &lt;a href="https://www.thegamer.com/mass-effect-henry-cavill-tv-series-game/"&gt;figured out&lt;/a&gt; it was actually a printout of the Wikipedia entry for&lt;em&gt; Mass Effect 3&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DpGYdn"&gt;Any other details like how this could tie in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/7/21554092/bioware-new-mass-effect-game-announced-n7-day"&gt;with a new game in the series&lt;/a&gt;, are unclear, even if some people — &lt;a href="https://massfanon.fandom.com/wiki/Mass_Effect_(TV_series)#:~:text=Mass%20Effect%20is%20an%20American,Mass%20Effect%20video%20game%20series"&gt;like this very imaginative wiki editor&lt;/a&gt; — already have fan casting done in their head. W Well, there’s one safe guess I can make — it’s probably not going to be based on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/20/14961928/mass-effect-andromeda-review-xbox-ps4-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mass Effect: Andromeda&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
