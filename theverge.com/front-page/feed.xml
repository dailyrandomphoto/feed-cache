    <title>Visible confirms account breaches, blames ‘outside sources’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WCZPrRgPQ1Sq7t_GHPUEAtQEi8c=/0x25:1336x916/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69989709/Screen_Shot_2021_10_13_at_9.41.35_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Visible&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CCertt"&gt;Cell service provider Visible has confirmed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723587/verizon-visible-cell-network-potential-hack-data-breach-phone-sales"&gt;customer reports&lt;/a&gt; of attackers accessing and changing user accounts, and it has said that the breaches were carried out using usernames and passwords from “outside sources.” In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; (which you can read in full below), the Verizon-owned carrier said that it’s worked to “mitigate the issue” since it became aware of it, though it doesn’t mention exactly what measures it’s put in place to protect customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lp7Iz8"&gt;Starting earlier this week, customers of Verizon’s lower-cost service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723587/verizon-visible-cell-network-potential-hack-data-breach-phone-sales"&gt;were reporting unauthorized charges&lt;/a&gt; from Visible on their PayPals or credit card statements, as well as emails telling them that their accounts’ passwords or addresses had been changed. Some customers have been frustrated with a lack of response from the company, as it hasn’t sent out emails or texts about the situation and was largely silent on social media until Wednesday, when it &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Visible/status/1448322446646554633?s=20"&gt;posted a Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5oHfGB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt; If you use your Visible username &amp;amp; password across multiple accounts, including your bank/financial accounts, we recommend updating your username/password with those services. Reminder: Visible will never call &amp;amp; ask for your password, secret questions or account PINs. &lt;/p&gt;— Visible (@Visible) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Visible/status/1448322446646554633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jXgEea"&gt;In both its statement and on Twitter, the company recommends resetting your password if it’s one you’ve used for other services. It’s good advice, but the company has turned off its password reset system — it wasn’t available yesterday, and as of Wednesday morning you’ll still get an error if you try to change your password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bVp1tn"&gt;Hackers getting into accounts using passwords found elsewhere is very common, that’s why everybody (including Visible) says to use unique passwords for each service and to change your passwords in the case of a breach. Security experts also recommend using two-factor authentication, which can help protect you even if your password fails (like in a situation where you’re not able to change it). Visible, however, doesn’t support two-factor authentication, which means that its customers are still potentially open to these kinds of attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M2KJYg"&gt;Here’s Visible’s full statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="zaaqzD"&gt;Visible is aware of an issue in which some member accounts were accessed and/or charged without their authorization. As soon as we were made aware of the issue, we immediately initiated a review and started deploying tools to mitigate the issue and enable additional controls to further protect our customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1lE5BM"&gt;Our investigation indicates that threat actors were able to access username/passwords from outside sources, and exploit that information to login to Visible accounts. If you use your Visible username and password across multiple accounts, including your bank or other financial accounts, we recommend updating your username/password with those services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mI9x16"&gt;Protecting customer information — including securing customer accounts — is critically important to our company and our customers. As a reminder, our company will never call and ask for your password, secret questions or account PINs.

    <title>Call of Duty’s new anti-cheat system includes a kernel-level driver to catch PC cheaters</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H4htLgw_WMVWwET2fnS53M_AXII=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69989634/acastro_300505_4008_pcGameHacks_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hRYFef"&gt;Activision and Raven Software are finally cracking down on cheating in &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt;. A new Ricochet anti-cheat system is arriving in both &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Vanguard&lt;/em&gt;. The system will use a combination of a PC kernel-level driver, machine learning algorithms to examine player behavior, and a “team of dedicated professionals” working to investigate cheaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTmwp8"&gt;The PC kernel-level driver has been developed internally for the &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; franchise and will launch first for &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt; with the upcoming Pacific update. PC games are increasingly using kernel-level drivers to detect sophisticated cheating, but since they run at such a high level in Windows, there are always privacy concerns surrounding such an approach.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-G604PlBtYqYcUUweU6ov7HHX1A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22923329/The_Pacific.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The kernel-level driver will be part of the Pacific map update for Warzone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WYr7Xq"&gt;The Ricochet anti-cheat system in &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; will not always be on, according to Raven Software. That means the kernel-level driver only operates when you open up &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt;, and the driver will shut down when you exit. The driver itself will monitor processes interacting with &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt; to see if they’re trying to inject code or manipulate the game, and report the results back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RRIGoV"&gt;Raven Software says it has tested the driver across a large range of PCs, and it will be required to play &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt; when the Pacific map update launches later this year. The kernel-level driver will eventually arrive in &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Vanguard&lt;/em&gt; “at a later date.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qJvJLA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; players will welcome this new anti-cheat effort, even if there will be inevitable questions and concerns over a kernel-level driver. It comes just a day after the main &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty &lt;/em&gt;Twitter account issued a stern warning to cheaters: “Cheaters aren’t welcome. There’s no tolerance for cheaters, and soon you’ll know what we mean.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ByzsyG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;See you tomorrow. &lt;a href="https://t.co/BAvAGPkTzx"&gt;pic.twitter.com/BAvAGPkTzx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Call of Duty (@CallofDuty) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1448000521743314951?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k5JIrp"&gt;While Activision has been banning thousands of accounts, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22261947/call-of-duty-warzone-cheaters-hackers-aimbots-wallhacks-problem"&gt;cheaters have still been ruining &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt; for months&lt;/a&gt;. Prominent &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt; players have become highly vocal about the problem, forcing Raven Software to communicate more frequently about the cheating issues and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632554/call-of-duty-warzone-vanguard-raven-new-map-destiny-2-anti-cheat"&gt;promise a full anti-cheat system in August&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0EPe4I"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt; isn’t the only PC game affected by cheaters, though. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21246229/pc-gaming-cheating-aimbots-wallhacks-hacking-tools-developer-response-problem"&gt;Cheating in some of the world’s top PC games has been getting worse&lt;/a&gt; over the past year, and aimbots and wallhacks are now common in the industry’s most competitive shooters. Aimbots automatically lock onto opponents, making it easy to hit head shots. Wallhacks expose everyone on a map, so cheaters get a huge advantage by knowing where their opponents are at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r3r438"&gt;The industry has been struggling to combat cheaters even with tools like Easy Anti-Cheat and BattlEye that also use kernel-level drivers. &lt;em&gt;Valorant &lt;/em&gt;has had some success with its own custom kernel-level driver, but it’s still a big investment to have teams dedicated to fighting what are effectively hackers and malware authors. It’s a continuous cat and mouse game, as hackers regularly work around protections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wauODA"&gt;A more coordinated industry effort might be required to really tackle the issue. Microsoft is the Windows platform holder, but the company’s “TruePlay” anti-cheat system for Windows 10 never really materialized. It was limited to the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) for apps, which most game developers have ignored, and it’s not clear if Microsoft will ever provide a full anti-cheat solution at the Windows kernel level to assist game developers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Aurora’s autonomous trucks and taxis will be available to customers via subscription</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iWvVfN76zco32Ey-scY_DVbk7ok=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69989632/xkvSmEKlZQ_PgpAS1Z5WsY09UyfIyFr7H2bDFv9oFWoK6lyxv1_qcnFuygvECR7ZSzNZpkJw02Xvk_yzxEgnkk0xcjk6QIHxFh___kWxsYUa0QYDpaWonojC17Cz0Cvm6wDJrqJc_s0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eeqEUs"&gt;Aurora, the autonomous vehicle company founded by the former lead engineer for Google’s self-driving car project, announced that its autonomous trucks and taxis will be available to customers via subscriptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sCNyzu"&gt;Aurora doesn’t expect to roll out its self-driving trucks and ride-hailing vehicles until 2023 and 2024, respectively, but the company is providing more detail about how it plans on putting them into commercial operation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HtkUEq"&gt;Aurora’s trucking service will be called “Aurora Horizon,” in which the company says it will provide trucking carriers and private fleets “with a reliable and scalable driver supply powered by the Aurora Driver.” The Aurora Driver is the name the company uses to describe the hardware and software it uses to enable a vehicle to drive itself under certain conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ut5jEa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Aurora’s trucking service will be called “Aurora Horizon”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dLELBb"&gt;The ride-hailing service, called “Aurora Connect,” will allow vehicles equipped with the company’s Driver technology to integrate ride-hailing network software so it can be used as a taxi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="pFKvsJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How long will it take to phase in driverless cars?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18512618/how-long-will-it-take-to-phase-in-driverless-cars"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5mIkra"&gt;Aurora’s customers won’t be individual truckers or ride-hailing passengers, but rather the logistics firms and companies that operate for-hire vehicle fleets. In that respect, Aurora is seeking to distinguish itself from other companies in the autonomous vehicle world, which are seeking to be both technology providers and fleet operators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZW4QV6"&gt;Aurora’s decision to make its self-driving vehicles available by subscription is unique, but not completely unheard of. The company says that subscribers to either Aurora Horizon or Aurora Connect will have access to the Aurora Driver, a mission control system called Aurora Beacon, and a roadside assistance program and extended support called Aurora Shield. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hiaqlc"&gt;The company isn’t revealing the price of its subscription products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0Ajwu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Safety regulator wants info on Tesla’s FSD beta, ‘safety score’ evaluation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tesla will ship a “full self-driving” car in a beta version." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MEuAfEtyU_TQArJt3snqz3mx7z0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69989202/jbareham_180213_2301_0149.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mNeqFr"&gt;The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration wants to know why Tesla didn’t issue a recall for Autopilot after it became obvious the driver assistance system had a problem “seeing” parked emergency vehicles. NHTSA is also asking Tesla for more information about the growing public beta test of its incomplete Full Self-Driving software, the recently launched “Safety Score” evaluation process for entering the program, and the non-disclosure agreements Tesla was making participants sign up until this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AW4iEP"&gt;The safety regulator’s concerns were outlined in &lt;a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2021/INIM-PE21020-85573P.pdf"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2021/INOT-PE21020-85593P.pdf"&gt;letters&lt;/a&gt; published Wednesday — the latest in a series of recent moves by NHTSA that show it’s paying far more serious attention to Tesla now than it ever did during the Trump administration. In March, it disclosed that it had 23 active investigations into crashes that &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-crash/u-s-safety-agency-reviewing-23-tesla-crashes-three-from-recent-weeks-idUSKBN2BA2ML"&gt;may have involved Autopilot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1OWcDR"&gt;The concern with Autopilot’s inability to “see” emergency vehicles stretches back &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/05/29/tesla-autopilot-implicated-in-another-emergency-vehicle-crash/"&gt;years&lt;/a&gt;. NHTSA opened a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22626819/tesla-autopilot-crash-emergency-vehicle-probe-nhtsa"&gt;formal probe into the problem in August&lt;/a&gt; and said it had logged at least 11 incidents since 2018 where drivers crashed into parked emergency vehicles — including 17 injuries and one fatality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bfvoU0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The agency wants a lot of info about Tesla’s decision to ship a software fix without a recall&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AGd38c"&gt;Tesla shipped a software update to its &lt;a href="https://insideevs.com/news/534868/tesla-autopilot-update-emergency-vehicles/"&gt;cars meant to fix the issue&lt;/a&gt; with its driver assistance system in September. But NHTSA wants to know why Tesla didn’t go through the formal recall process with this update, potentially setting up a protracted fight over whether over-the-air updates that can materially change how cars operate should be subjected to the government’s stringent automotive safety rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KF0jIW"&gt;“As Tesla is aware, the [Vehicle] Safety Act imposes an obligation on manufacturers of motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment to initiate a recall by notifying NHTSA when they determine vehicles or equipment they produced contain defects related to motor vehicle safety or do not comply with an applicable motor vehicle safety standard,” the agency writes in one of the letters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U4CUK7"&gt;NHTSA’s Office of Defects Division is specifically asking Tesla for an internal timeline of the decision to deploy the September software update, any internal investigations or studies the company performed into the matter, and specific dates when the software went out to customer vehicles. The division also wants Tesla to provide a list of any “field incidents or other events that motivated the release” of the software, presumably to see if there are related crashes it’s not aware of. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Du0g0X"&gt;Lastly, the agency wants Tesla to provide any “technical and/or legal basis” for not filing for a recall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mnYBez"&gt;This is one of the first times the government safety agency has directly questioned Tesla about what critics of the company say is a pattern of actively dodging recalls. In particular, the company has performed a number of mechanical fixes on cars over the years that were labeled as “goodwill” repairs instead of doing them under warranty — which some &lt;a href="https://insideevs.com/news/394769/attorney-tesla-not-evading-lemon-law-goodwill/"&gt;argue is an effort to evade issuing recalls&lt;/a&gt;. Earlier this year, Tesla only issued a recall for failing touchscreen displays on more than 100,000 of its cars &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262072/tesla-display-failure-flash-mcu-recall-model-s-x-nhtsa"&gt;after much public pressure from NHTSA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="mveOY9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Regulators want to know more about the “Full Self-Driving” beta test, which Tesla is expanding&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m4enE0"&gt;Tesla recently started expanding access to the beta version of its so-called Full Self-Driving software, which does not yet make the company’s cars anywhere near fully autonomous. In late September, it shipped another software update that allowed owners to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/26/22693610/tesla-opens-full-self-driving-beta-software-more-customers"&gt;request participation in the beta test&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, Tesla said it would start using a new “Safety Score” feature to evaluate owners’ driving habits and that it only allows the best-performing ones into the Full Self-Driving beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ghVh9d"&gt;NHTSA wants to know a lot more about all of this. In the same letter, it asks Tesla to provide “criteria and timeline for allowing access to customers who have requested consideration in Tesla’s FSD Beta Request process” and tells the company to include “detailed descriptions of all selection criteria and copies of supporting documents.” It also wants a list of people who have opted to participate in the beta, as well as the vehicle identification number of any car with the software, the date when the software was installed on said car, and whether the owner is an employee of Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T5b32k"&gt;Tesla’s response to all of those requests for information is due November 1st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mdepuz"&gt;The second letter is also focused on an aspect of the Full Self-Driving beta, though it was sent by NHTSA’s chief counsel, Ann Carlson. She wants to know more about the non-disclosure agreements Tesla was making owners sign in exchange for access to the beta software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CTRTTd"&gt;When parts of that NDA were first published by &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22696463/tesla-fsd-beta-nda-video-clips-controversy-full-self-driving"&gt;in late September&lt;/a&gt;, it was revealed that Tesla was asking owners to “consider sharing fewer videos” of the software performing poorly out of fear that those clips would be taken out of context. “[T]here are a lot of people that want Tesla to fail; Don’t let them mischaracterize your feedback and media posts,” the document read. (Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said, on a number of occasions, that he believes “negative news” about his company’s driver assistance systems makes roads less safe &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2018/05/03/tesla-autopilot-usage-dips-bad-media-coverage/"&gt;because it discourages people from using Autopilot&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84zWsv"&gt;Just one day after that story published, Tesla CEO Elon Musk was asked about the NDAs at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22699361/elon-musk-tesla-full-self-driving-beta-nda-footage"&gt;the 2021 Code Conference&lt;/a&gt;. He said that owners were sharing “a lot of videos” in spite of the agreement because “people don’t seem to listen to me.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JGLfO4"&gt;“I don’t know why there’s an NDA,” he added, saying “we probably don’t need it.” Tesla seems to have dropped the NDA in the most &lt;a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-fsd-beta-nda-removed-confirmed/"&gt;recent version of the Full Self-Driving beta software&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XNmQR2"&gt;In Carlson’s letter, which is dated October 12th, she writes that the agency is concerned that Tesla is hampering one of the agency’s best resources for keeping tabs on automakers: their customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="a0IswS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;NHTSA is probing Tesla’s use of NDAs, though Musk said they “don’t need them”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6MwQfQ"&gt;“Given that NHTSA relies on reports from consumers as an important source of information in evaluating potential safety defects, any agreement that may prevent or dissuade participants in the early access beta release program from reporting safety concerns to NHTSA is unacceptable,” she writes. “Moreover, even limitations on sharing certain information publicly adversely impacts NHTSA’s ability to obtain information relevant to safety.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SGh9Nz"&gt;While NHTSA has turned up the heat on Tesla since Joe Biden took office, it’s also increased its scrutiny of driver assistance systems across the board. In June, the agency &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557135/nhtsa-autonomous-adas-crash-rule-response-tesla"&gt;announced a new rule&lt;/a&gt; requiring automakers and transportation companies to quickly report crashes involving partially or fully autonomous systems. In September, it requested &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22673497/tesla-nhtsa-autopilot-investigation-data-ford-gm-vw-toyota"&gt;information from 12 other automakers&lt;/a&gt; about their driver assistance systems as part of the probe into Tesla’s problem with emergency vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer Blade 15 Advanced review: the new hotness</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A technical achievement that struggles to hide its seams&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Zl4w6R"&gt;When I last reviewed Razer’s Blade 15 Advanced in late 2020, I accused the company of resting on its laurels when it came to laptop design. Some of its competitors, namely the MSI GS66 Stealth, did a lot of catching up. And until recently, Razer hadn’t responded with much beyond minor (but welcome) design tweaks and spec refreshes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nyFBtk"&gt;But Razer has actually answered back in two major ways so far in 2021. One is with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22548663/razer-blade-14-review-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-9-5900hx-nvidia-rtx-3070"&gt;Blade 14&lt;/a&gt;, which packs a very capable AMD processor and Nvidia RTX graphics card into a compact 14-inch laptop. The other is the newer Blade 15 Advanced. It’s very similar to previous versions, but if you look a little closer, it addresses some repeated criticisms from prior models while retaining its signature excellent build quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="W4EiH7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10804924"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g1ikgZ"&gt;The Blade 15 Advanced, starting with the mid-2021 lineup, has a more fingerprint-resistant design, and its webcam has been bumped up from 720p resolution to 1080p. The most interesting model of the bunch is technically the least capable one, the base model I’m reviewing here. It’s about 15.8mm thick, trimming away a little more than one millimeter compared to the other Blade 15 Advanced options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3GkaGM"&gt;Thinner is good and all, but Razer also deserves credit for making sure that many of the fundamentals didn’t get axed during the size reduction. This model has a good port selection that includes Thunderbolt 4, HDMI 2.1, and an SD card reader. So, not only does it look good, but it’s still practical as well. Its fast refresh rate QHD display is also fantastic, as are its keyboard and trackpad. To my surprise, its 65Wh battery boasts decent performance for a gaming laptop, pulling in about six hours of use under the load of normal workday tasks, like using Chrome, Spotify, Slack, and some Affinity Photo (the thicker Blade 15 Advanced variants have 80Wh batteries). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tN0ftd"&gt;The thinner Blade 15 Advanced is fully featured in many other ways I expect a gaming laptop to be. It has an RTX 3060 graphics chip, a capable processor, and user-upgradeable RAM and storage (it has just one M.2 slot compared to the two in thicker models). Impressively, it’s just a hair thinner than the thickest spot on Apple’s latest MacBook Air. Let that sink in for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Blade 15 Advanced" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ev4WUK534RcudNXW8oCBkXhoSps=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22822466/akrales_210831_4735_0099.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Blade 15 is still among the best-looking laptops (gaming or not) available.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="mIPLvi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10804932"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ho0W1F"&gt;Okay, now let’s get real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PuPcjU"&gt;The price of this model is steep. It costs $2,299, which is easily a $600-$700 premium (if not more) over most other models with similar specs (sans QHD display). That’s hardly an issue if you can afford it. But a bigger pain point that money won’t solve is its cooling. While it’s not uncommon for gaming laptops to be in a persistent state of warmness, this laptop felt very hot near the screen’s hinge during gameplay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DRM4pR"&gt;After boosting the system’s CPU and GPU performance to the maximum in Razer Synapse, its built-in tool for adjusting power settings and for customizing the backlit keyboard, a few rounds of &lt;em&gt;Deathloop &lt;/em&gt;caused its CPU temperature to climb up to 100 degrees Celsius. It felt, at that point, well beyond what I consider to be a comfortable temperature for a device that’s meant to be placed on my lap. I shared these results with Razer, which asked for the unit back for testing. The company sent another, and it fared about the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S1JLPo"&gt;I didn’t notice any signs of performance-related throttling due to the high temperature. It’s just a laptop that runs hot during intensive tasks. This is less of an issue if you plan to plug in accessories you already own, like a mouse and keyboard, and push the Blade 15 Advanced back on your desk. According to Razer, this is all expected behavior, and the company says it isn’t indicative of a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Blade 15 Advanced" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pk3WvNPkvxwGj6ux8fRYnJvLBHg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22822459/akrales_210831_4735_0021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Behold, no fingerprints in sight. The new coating is more resistant to smudges, but you’ll still need to clean it sometimes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CuPFpB"&gt;Here’s a statement that Razer provided to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on this Blade 15 Advanced model’s heating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="hSD1Nk"&gt;“We’ve found that when running at maximum performance settings, the Blade can reach high internal temperatures, though after a short amount of time level out to and typically do not exceed 90C. These internal temperatures are safe to run and with our improved vapor chamber cooling solution, still lead to a comfortable external temperature for regular use well below the internal thermals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="tEtC6M"&gt;If you ask me, I think you should reconsider purchasing this model if you imagined gaming primarily on your lap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IcBdse"&gt;There is some good news to come out of this that I think Razer and I can agree on: gaming performance with this Blade 15 Advanced is good. It’s one of the few laptops out there that pairs an RTX 3060 (a somewhat low-powered one, at that, with 85W maximum graphics power and 1,282MHz boost clock) and a QHD screen. I’ve written in several laptop reviews now that making the leap to QHD over FHD is definitely worth your money if you can swing it — and if the laptop itself is powerful enough to run most applications and games without crumbling under the load. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wHIBlv"&gt;After playing a few demanding games on this thinner Blade 15 Advanced model, it’s safe to say that it tackles that challenge of playing AAA games with high graphical settings at QHD resolution with more ease than I expected it to — you know, aside from being toasty throughout. The aforementioned &lt;em&gt;Deathloop &lt;/em&gt;maintained a fairly steady 50 frames per second at native resolution with almost all settings set to their highest. I encountered a minor isolated issue for this game; it repeatedly warned me that I had surpassed VRAM usage, claiming that this RTX 3060 had less memory than it actually did. Though, it didn’t crash or prevent me from playing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Blade 15 Advanced" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UI__AIwmwxStBtaqmY7zfSHGhgI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22822461/akrales_210831_4735_0047.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Razer gets kudos for including a robust set of ports in this thin build, including several USB-A ports and an SD card reader.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Blade 15 Advanced" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jYKlNXUh25HHjof7GHRsecxfru0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22822460/akrales_210831_4735_0041.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A glimpse at the left edge of the Blade 15 Advanced. I totally own up to forgetting to remove the film around the charging port before the photo shoot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LkijAT"&gt;Other games didn’t present such issues, and ran decently, too. At QHD resolution, ultra settings, and with DLSS and ray tracing on, &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;’s built-in benchmark ran at an average of 48 frames per second. With that result, you’re just a few setting adjustments away from a steady 60 frames per second at native resolution. With DLSS (auto mode) and ultra settings on in QHD resolution, &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2&lt;/em&gt; got up to 53 frames per second. &lt;em&gt;Hunt: Showdown&lt;/em&gt; ran the most effortlessly of any game that I tested, easily achieving 60 frames per second in native 1440p resolution with graphical settings set to their highest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tBdOwU"&gt;Games look great and are full of sharp detail and color on this QHD screen, though its 240Hz refresh rate is a far higher ceiling that many games won’t reach with this laptop. You’ll be lucky to push this screen even half of its peak refresh rate with modern games, which is an achievement unto itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J18BcT"&gt;The more money you’re willing to spend on a gaming laptop, the fewer (if any) settings you’ll need to adjust in order to more reliably surpass that coveted 60 frames per second bar. It’s not a huge issue that this Blade 15 Advanced can’t exactly get there in some games, so long as you know about it before you buy. It is, however, more of an issue when you look toward the future. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Blade 15 Advanced" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h9K2LAfCwv0EH9O6RKFoUcTDUOc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22822467/akrales_210831_4735_0119.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Razer, your QHD displays are simply superb.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QDoldg"&gt;The evolution of graphical tech means some games will only require more power to run, not less. For a laptop like this that only has fairly limited headroom, both in terms of power and cooling, that’s a problem that I had a hard time not thinking about during this review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HjSKu0"&gt;Though, the future is made a little less scary because of Nvidia’s deep-learning super sampling (DLSS). Turning it on means you run games at a lower resolution, yet the RTX GPU’s AI cores utilize Nvidia’s neural network to improve the image quality to make it appear as if you haven’t lowered the resolution at all. In some of those tests above, the Blade 15 Advanced was able to squeeze out an average of 10 frames per second more than when the DLSS tech was turned off. It’s impressive stuff.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dn8dNw"&gt;This particular Blade 15 Advanced won’t win in a spec shootout against Blade 14 that has an AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX and an RTX 3070, particularly for gaming. But it has the advantage with some creative tasks, thanks to its Intel processor’s Quick Sync Video feature. In our export test, which puts out a five-minute, 33-second 4K video, it took this review unit just over three minutes, thirty seconds to run through the paces. In PugetBench for Premiere Pro, a benchmark that runs a bevy of demanding tasks and outputs an aggregate score, &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=59045"&gt;the Blade 15 Advanced scored almost 200 points higher&lt;/a&gt; than the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=44616"&gt;Blade 14 that my colleague Monica Chin reviewed&lt;/a&gt;, and several hundred points higher than &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=32198"&gt;the Razer Blade 15 Base from early 2021&lt;/a&gt;. If you plan to copy footage to the Blade 15 Advanced with its SD card slot, you can rest easy knowing that your time to export should be pretty speedy with this laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LtmFHc"&gt;Using the new Blade 15 Advanced on a day-to-day basis is a similar experience to that of previous versions, and in most ways that’s a good thing. Razer’s keyboard is easy to type on, and the layout is easy to transition to from using a full-sized keyboard. Though, after using several other gaming laptop keyboards, it’d be great if Razer would try to make its own compact mechanical key switches, like Alienware does with its premium Cherry ultra-low profile switches. There’s nothing wrong with what’s here, but sometimes the keys can feel a little mushy. I have no complaints about the trackpad, though, as it remains one of the biggest you can find on a gaming laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Blade 15 Advanced" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w7gIEugjpLZR4nVlyeBgNffD-7k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22822462/akrales_210831_4735_0052.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The improved webcam is one of the key highlights in the latest Blade 15 Advanced refresh.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="O3Cq1z"&gt;Focusing on two new improvements for this newer wave of Blade laptops — the fingerprint-resistant coating and the improved 1080p webcam — the webcam is the more meaningful update of the two. I didn’t have a previous iteration with a 720p webcam to compare it to directly, but even in my apartment that gets a low amount of natural light, the picture looked a little sharper than I remember it being before, with slightly improved low-light performance. Video footage still looks a bit grainy, particularly in online video chats, but it’s certainly a positive step forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="q3lJeD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10804929"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v1SkQI"&gt;For the fingerprint-resistant coating — look, this laptop still collects your fingerprints. Though, I realized it was an improvement when I didn’t yell the same “wow, I barely touched this thing and it’s &lt;em&gt;filthy&lt;/em&gt;” that I usually do shortly after I unbox a black Razer laptop. But if you’re a clean freak, you’ll probably still find enough smudging to warrant giving it a wipe every couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EDz5lg"&gt;This particular Blade 15 Advanced stands out from Razer’s other models, including some competing gaming laptops, because of how thin it is. Its thickness is an asset, but also a major downside when it comes to keeping cool. Gaming on it isn’t a problem, unless you actually want to comfortably use it on your lap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iJlbJw"&gt;I don’t have a solution for Razer, or really any company, on this one. At a certain point, the quest to push the power envelope in thinner gaming-focused devices is going to be hindered by how much airflow they can allow, and it seems like Razer’s is approaching the ceiling here. Still, I’m impressed with many aspects of the Blade 15 Advanced, particularly that it’s so similar to thicker, more powerful variants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Blade 15 Advanced" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gw1emV82Z8sIPiQB3iROf70G6TQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22822458/akrales_210831_4735_0019.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even though it’s thinner than ever before, it still has the familiar Blade 15 design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="WDw0TB"&gt;If you want a recommendation that’s in Razer’s realm, &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-14-%2FRZ09-0370BEA3-R3U1&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;check out the Blade 14 variant that costs $2,199&lt;/a&gt; ($100 less than this reviewed model) that has an AMD processor, an RTX 3070, and a QHD screen. It’s a little thicker, so heating shouldn’t be as much of a concern. You’ll lose the Thunderbolt 4 ports, the SD card reader, along with a 1080p webcam (it’s 720p instead) and the ability to operate on its RAM and storage. Otherwise, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"&gt;check out our buying guide for the best gaming laptop&lt;/a&gt; where you’ll find several cheaper and faster options, even if they’re a bit thicker than this razor-thin Blade 15 Advanced.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>We might get a System Shock live-action series before System Shock 3</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="System Shock TV series key art: a poster of SHODAN." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3ToMKh7jWbk5Co6SF7jlyjbvxpY=/222x0:1572x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69989013/Binge_SystemShock_LiveAction_Wide.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FoN0G6"&gt;A live-action &lt;em&gt;System Shock &lt;/em&gt;series is apparently on the table for games-focused streaming platform Binge, marking a third attempt at reviving the classic space horror series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BOl4Ip"&gt;&lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/10/system-shock-live-action-series-based-on-video-game-franchise-in-the-works-from-binge-nightdive-studios-1234854806/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; has offered&lt;/a&gt; a few details about the project, including that it will be executive produced by executives from NightDive — a studio and retro games publisher that &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/many-questions-system-shock-2-comes-to-gog"&gt;acquired the remarkably tangled rights to &lt;em&gt;System Shock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in 2013. It’s being produced by Binge chief content officer Allan Ungar, and it’s supposed to be part of Binge’s original content lineup as the platform &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/06/09/binge-will-debut-in-2022-as-a-game-and-entertainment-streaming-video-platform/"&gt;prepares for a 2022 launch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ycP1C"&gt;There’s a heavy emphasis on “supposed to” here because &lt;em&gt;System Shock&lt;/em&gt; adaptations have a troubled history. NightDive successfully released the long-unavailable 1994 shooter &lt;em&gt;System Shock&lt;/em&gt; and its 1999 sequel &lt;em&gt;System Shock 2, &lt;/em&gt;more than a decade after the demise of original developer Looking Glass. But it’s faced more challenges with a crowdfunded remaster of the original game — which was &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1598858095/system-shock"&gt;funded in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, slated for release in 2017, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/2/16/17016744/system-shock-reboot-hiatus-nightdive-interview"&gt;placed on hiatus in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, and is currently listed as “coming soon” after missing its &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/25/22301179/system-shock-remake-trailer-demo-release-date"&gt;latest release date&lt;/a&gt; of summer 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="upFHZS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The System Shock game reboot is supposed to come out this year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xwGcL0"&gt;Another studio, OtherSide Entertainment, has had even more difficulty with a sequel. &lt;em&gt;System Shock 3&lt;/em&gt; was announced in 2015, appeared as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/18/18272003/system-shock-3-teaser-trailer-gdc-2019-unity"&gt;a teaser trailer in 2019&lt;/a&gt; shortly after the &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-01-28-the-fall-of-swedish-game-wonder-starbreeze"&gt;near-collapse of its publisher&lt;/a&gt; Starbreeze and was &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/tencent-appears-to-be-the-new-owner-of-system-shock-3-and-4-websites/"&gt;acquired by the Chinese megapublisher Tencent&lt;/a&gt; in 2020. It’s currently listed as “in development” on OtherSide’s website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oCso4V"&gt;There’s not much information on Binge’s live-action show. “I’ve always believed that a live-action adaptation of System Shock would be the perfect medium to retell the harrowing story of Citadel station and its rogue AI that subjects the crew to unimaginable horror,” &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; quotes NightDive CEO Stephen Kick as saying. (In case you’re not familiar with &lt;em&gt;System Shock&lt;/em&gt;: it’s set in 2072 on a corporate space station called Citadel where a hacker must defeat a rogue artificial intelligence named SHODAN, seen in the art above.) “We’re very excited to see the talented team at Binge bring System Shock to life in horrifyingly real and new ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RfC1m4"&gt;If you’re curious what a non-interactive version of &lt;em&gt;System Shock&lt;/em&gt; might look like, author Shamus Young published &lt;a href="https://www.shamusyoung.com/shocked/"&gt;a fanfiction story&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;em&gt;Free Radical&lt;/em&gt; that’s effectively an unofficial novelization of the game. If a live-action TV version pans out, too, you’ll see the resulting series stream exclusively on Binge.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verge Deals is our biweekly newsletter filled with tech sales and exclusive deals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FSTFWaj7MjAzcpSSa-SyJmk7POE=/8x0:2162x1436/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69988975/Screen_Shot_2021_10_12_at_2.24.26_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge Deals, our weekly newsletter, highlights the best deals of the week, exclusive discounts, and more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="REzNJI"&gt;Every day, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; scours the web looking for and writing about the best tech deals — but did you know many of these highlights can also be found in our newsletter? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="syq4Vn"&gt;Each week, we deliver the top tech deals and sales straight to your inbox. We look for the kind of discounts we rarely see on items that are truly good investments — not small price drops on mediocre goods. These are deals on products we’ve tested, used, or feel confident in recommending, from laptops and 4K TVs to the latest smart speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vp3hAf"&gt;Occasionally, we even treat our readers to exclusive deals. Recent newsletter subscribers, for instance, were amongst the first to find out about the $150 discount we’re currently offering on a standard ticket to &lt;a href="https://www.voxmediaevents.com/ontheverge"&gt;On The Verge&lt;/a&gt;, our 10th-anniversary birthday bash in New York City. You, too, can also take advantage of the deal when you enter promo code &lt;strong&gt;VERGEDEALS &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout, which brings down the price of a single ticket from $250 to $99. The event — which takes place on October 22nd and 23rd — will feature live performances, guest speakers, interactive experiences, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eaqaL96kykhKMgza4evkZ3D53Dg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22890722/Stage_2__1_.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TYaM2I"&gt;At the moment, we’re sending the biweekly newsletter on Wednesday and Friday, but we’ll let you know if we start doing so more frequently. Deals change all the time, however, which is why we’ll also continue to post the contents of the Friday newsletter on the site on Saturday mornings, with the necessary updates. That’s because we want to make sure you’re always up to date and getting the best bang for your buck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JwNjKk"&gt;So if you want to take advantage of a &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt;-approved deal before it sells out, consider subscribing via the box below or by visiting our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/newsletters"&gt;newsletter landing page&lt;/a&gt;, where you can subscribe to HotPod and other &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;newsletters. And if you ever feel like you don’t want these emails, you can easily unsubscribe as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat is back up, after users couldn’t post or send messages for hours</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Snapchat white ghost logo on a bright yellow background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h0qetljI3w5--QOjcQSbaeWN3PY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69988409/snapChatPattern_BW.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MUmaBr"&gt;For a couple of hours on Wednesday morning, Snap Streaks were at risk as many users reported they couldn’t successfully post story updates or send messages on the service. In a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snapchatsupport/status/1448254521914937349"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;, the Snapchat Support Twitter account confirmed the issues, telling people to “hang tight, we’re looking into it!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eZXmVN"&gt;The source of the issue was unclear, but this doesn’t seem to be a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710963/facebook-dns-bgp-outage-backbone-maintenance"&gt;Facebook-level event&lt;/a&gt;. The app itself was still mostly functional for some of us, and if you weren’t trying to post, you may not have noticed anything wrong right away. It also wasn’t crashing constantly, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22600902/snapchat-crashing-down-outage-issue-app-login"&gt;which has been a problem for Snapchat&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PhIUFK"&gt;At about 10:31AM ET the Snapchat Support Twitter account &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snapchatsupport/status/1448295237978365954"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; the issue is fixed, and everything is working again on our end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KE8xvF"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’re aware that some Snapchatters are having issues using the app right now - hang tight, we’re looking into it!&lt;/p&gt;— Snapchat Support (@snapchatsupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snapchatsupport/status/1448254521914937349?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p id="pCAlHy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 13th, 11:17AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to reflect that Snapchat is back up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blue Origin successfully sends William Shatner and crew to edge of space and back</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r8mvnQDN2cZ3gGonQ6QTl41SBtw=/8x0:2180x1448/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69988895/Screen_Shot_2021_10_13_at_10.54.14_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Blue Origin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AGRWvk"&gt;Famed Star Trek actor William Shatner and a crew of three fellow passengers successfully flew to the edge of space and back this morning on Blue Origin’s New Shepard tourist rocket. The foursome took off from Blue Origin’s launch facility in Van Horn, Texas at 9:50AM ET, climbed to an altitude of roughly 66 miles up, and then safely landed back on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KVUxrv"&gt;Flying alongside Shatner today were two paying customers and a Blue Origin employee. They included Chris Boshuizen, co-founder of small satellite company Planet Labs, and Glen de Vries, co-founder of Medidata, a software company. Audrey Powers, vice president of mission and flight operations at Blue Origin, represented the company on the flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kBeecI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“What you have given me is the most profound experience.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BvP35f"&gt;After Shatner landed, he shed tears, emotional about what just happened. “What you have given me is the most profound experience,” Shatner told Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos after the actor landed. “I’m so filled with emotion about what just happened. I just, it’s extraordinary, extraordinary. I hope I never recover from this.” Shatner argued afterward that everybody needs to see what he saw, even comparing the experience of transitioning from blue sky to the blackness of space to what dying might feel like. “Is that what death is?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_eFix7klDoaO4NRbeoh96QrnUHY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22923798/Screen_Shot_2021_10_13_at_10.43.41_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Blue Origin&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jeff Bezos pins Blue Origin astronaut wings on William Shatner after the flight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4IxzLP"&gt;This morning’s flight, lasting just a little over 10 minutes in length, marks the second successful crewed launch for Blue Origin on the New Shepard rocket. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22582735/blue-origin-jeff-bezos-space-launch-landing"&gt;The company’s first crewed launch on July 20th carried Bezos&lt;/a&gt;, who is the former CEO of Amazon. He flew along with his brother, Mark, a Dutch teenager, and legendary aviator Wally Funk. When Funk flew, she became the oldest person in space at 82 years old, but this morning, 90-year-old Shatner surpassed her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jmr8LT"&gt;New Shepard is the company’s primary rocket at the moment. The vehicle is suborbital, so it cannot achieve enough speed to get into orbit around the Earth. Instead, it’s capable of launching crews to the edge of space and back so that riders can experience weightlessness for a few minutes. To get to space, crews launch strapped inside a crew capsule, perched on top of the rocket. Once high above the Earth, the capsule and rocket separate, and passengers briefly float throughout the cabin. Then, both pieces of the vehicle fall back to Earth; the capsule lands under parachutes while the rocket reignites its engine and lands upright.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pqLi6pJB47dgl98Mo12MGKHEdWE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22923418/blue_origin_ns18_training_astronauts_cm7_training_october_12_2021.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The crew of today’s flight: Audrey Powers, William Shatner, Chris Boshuizen, and Glen de Vries, with Crew Member 7 Sarah Knights&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7WGa54"&gt;Though Shatner’s flight was ultimately a success, it comes amid a tumultuous time for Blue Origin. Just before the mission, 21 current and former employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702335/jeff-bezos-employees-essay-blue-origin-toxic-workplace"&gt;published a damning essay&lt;/a&gt;, criticizing Blue Origin’s culture as both sexist and unsafe. &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/11/blue-origin-jeff-bezos-delays-toxic-workplace/"&gt;A recent &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; investigation&lt;/a&gt; also revealed employees think Blue Origin has “an authoritarian bro culture.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GB6ZiL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reddit’s latest feature turns predictions into a tournament</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0YcCR1OERsx3MYwuIwbBopiDudk=/0x0:1158x772/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69988846/ApplicationFrameHost_sgcOT2vcbX.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Users pick a prediction and bet tokens on the outcome.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Reddit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IB77Sp"&gt;Reddit has officially launched its new Predictions feature after piloting it for almost a year. It lets users compete by guessing the outcome of upcoming events like sports matches or awards ceremonies. Predictions build upon, and gamify, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21191119/reddit-poll-post-type-nfl-super-bowl-survey"&gt;site’s existing Polls feature&lt;/a&gt; from last year, allowing users to bet and earn tokens based on successful predictions as part of miniature tournaments. There’s no real money involved, just bragging rights, though Reddit says Premium members “&lt;a href="https://reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407383251860#:~:text=nope%2C%20no%20purchase%20necessary.%20however%2C%20reddit%20premium%20members%20may%20get%20special%20advantages%20or%20benefits%20in%20the%20future%2C%20so%20stay%20tuned!%20"&gt;may get special advantages or benefits in the future.&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6SW8IQ"&gt;Predictions tournaments can only be posted by moderators and consist of a series of questions for users to bet on the answers to. This list can be expanded by moderators as the tournament progresses. Each user who participates is given 1,000 free tokens to answer the questions posed, like which film could win Best Picture at the next Oscars. If they’re right, then they get a share of the winnings; but if they make too many wrong predictions and lose all their tokens, then they’re out of the tournament. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mp-teOXHFX-IctVSCST4NUs8bEk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22923340/pasted_image_0__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Reddit&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example Prediction question.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9P1m22"&gt;It’s important to note that although Reddit allows users to pay for features like Reddit Premium, the Predictions feature currently doesn’t involve any real money. Tokens are distributed for free to anyone who wants to take part, and at the end of the tournament they’re used to calculate a leaderboard of its winners. Tokens are nontransferable and cannot be carried over between tournaments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mhK39q"&gt;Reddit has been testing its Predictions feature in select subreddits for almost a year now and says over a million people have already taken part in tournaments. Past tournaments have involved guessing the outcomes of the Oscars, the 2021 Formula 1 Grand Prix, and this year’s Euros soccer tournament. Now, however, the feature is rolling out to any subreddit with more than 10,000 members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5mJKyO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lDDfpK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
