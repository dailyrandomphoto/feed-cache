  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Ugly Truth&lt;/em&gt; tracks the last five years of Facebook scandals &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="6QaS3u"&gt;As the second season of the great 2000s crime drama &lt;em&gt;The Wire&lt;/em&gt; begins, Baltimore police detective Jimmy McNulty finds himself on a boat. After spending the previous season sounding the alarm about local drug kingpin Avon Barksdale, to the indifference and annoyance of his various superiors, McNulty is exiled to the city’s marine unit. (His bosses have learned he gets seasick, and punish him accordingly.) The special investigation team he was part of is forcibly disbanded; drug dealing in Baltimore continues unchecked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lylWxC"&gt;Something similar happens to Alex Stamos, the non-fictional former chief security officer of Facebook, in the wake of his 2016-17 investigation into Russian interference on the platform. In&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ugly-Truth-Inside-Facebooks-Domination-ebook/dp/B09461YYFV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8"&gt; &lt;em&gt;An Ugly Truth: Inside Facebook’s Battle for Domination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, authors Sheera Frenkel and Cecilia Kang detail the company’s dawning awareness of the foreign adversaries in their midst. By the time it’s all over, Donald Trump will be president, and Facebook’s halting response triggers an international reckoning over the size and power of technology platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="FisaHS"&gt;&lt;q&gt; the company’s dawning awareness of the foreign adversaries in their midst&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QiPrF0"&gt;The broad outlines of this story are well known, and have been told on a regular basis ever since, including in this column. (The aftermath of the 2016 election, and Facebook’s role in it, were the original inspiration for this newsletter.) The value in &lt;em&gt;An Ugly Truth&lt;/em&gt; comes from the detail it brings to the Russia investigation as it was experienced by some of its participants at the time. And while I ultimately come to some different conclusions than the authors do, the book is worth reading for everyone interested in social networks, trust and safety, and cybersecurity. (And, of course, for anyone else like me who is fascinated by Facebook history.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xl4J8S"&gt;First, some disclosures: Frenkel and Kang have been colleagues of mine on the Facebook beat for years, and I’ve long been a fan of their work. I’m also friendly with Stamos — no reporter can resist a loudmouth who always gets in trouble with his bosses for telling them things they don’t want to hear, since this is secretly how we all think of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBfB6S"&gt;Stamos arrived at Facebook in September 2015 following a high-profile stint at Yahoo, where he discovered a vulnerability in Yahoo mail that allowed the US government to monitor the messages of Yahoo Mail users. The vulnerability had been approved by then-CEO Marissa Mayer; Stamos quit a few weeks later on principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qw9TFQ"&gt;There were actually two separate Russian campaigns on Facebook during the 2016 election. The first came from Russia’s military intelligence agency, the GRU. Facebook first discovered GRU activity in March 2016, according to a postmortem circulated internally the following year. GRU agents made fake Facebook accounts and pages, and used them to spread disinformation and false news. Stamos’ team shared reports on what it found with the FBI — it heard nothing back from the agency — and also with his direct supervisors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g2KVrr"&gt;Facebook was slow to remove some of what it found, in part because at the time it had no rule against foreign groups setting up groups and pages to manipulate American opinion. After Facebook became aware that a Russian-operated page known as DCLeaks was distributing stolen emails from the Clinton campaign to journalists on the platform, the company initially took no action. Only after a security analyst found that the documents contained personal information — a clear violation of Facebook rules — was DCLeaks banned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bRcbFe"&gt;But even as the company investigated, it said nothing publicly. The authors write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="3GgET2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They didn’t have a protocol in place, and so they didn’t want us to take action. It made no sense.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QKIvyL"&gt;Within the threat intel group, there was debate over what should be done. Facebook was a private company, some argued, not an intelligence agency; the platform was not duty-bound to report its findings. For all Facebook knew, the National Security Agency was tracking the same Russian accounts the company was seeing, and possibly planning arrests. It might be irresponsible for Facebook to say anything. Others argued that Facebook’s silence was facilitating Russian efforts to spread the stolen information. They said the company needed to make public that Russia-linked accounts were spreading hacked documents through Facebook. To them, the situation felt like a potential national emergency. “It was crazy. They didn’t have a protocol in place, and so they didn’t want us to take action. It made no sense,” one security team member said. “It felt like this was maybe a time to break precedent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RoFHIH"&gt;While Facebook considered what to do about the Russians’ hack-and-leak campaign, a separate influence operation was unfolding under its nose. The Internet Research Agency, a “troll farm” that&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/magazine/the-agency.html"&gt; the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; had first profiled in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, was running its own attack. It was discovered only after the election, in 2017, when a senator alerted Facebook officials to its existence. A subsequent Facebook investigation found that the IRA had published 80,000 posts, spent $100,000 on 3,300 advertisements, and reached as many as 126 million Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G2I1t9"&gt;That investigation had been undertaken by Stamos’ team without the knowledge of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg or COO Sheryl Sandberg — this is the moment in the book that I began to see him as Jimmy McNulty — and Frenkel and Kang report that this put him in a tenuous position. Tensions spilled out during a presentation of the team’s findings to Zuckerberg and his leadership team in December 2016, a month after the election:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WkgvDK"&gt;His investigation could expose the company to legal liability or congressional oversight, and Sandberg, as the liaison be- tween Facebook and Washington, would eventually be called to DC to explain Facebook’s findings to Congress. “No one said the words, but there was this feeling that you can’t disclose what you don’t know,” according to one executive who attended the meeting. Stamos’s team had uncovered information that no one, including the U.S. government, had previously known. But at Facebook, being proactive was not always appreciated. “By investigating what Russia was doing, Alex had forced us to make decisions about what we were going to publicly say. People weren’t happy about that,” recalled the executive. “He had taken it upon himself to uncover a problem. That’s never a good look,” observed another meeting participant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sglHbA"&gt;Stamos would spend the next year managing the fallout of the revelations, and putting together various plans to restructure Facebook’s security operations. One of his ideas was to embed security people throughout the organization, rather than silo it from the rest of Facebook. The company accepted this idea, but it wound up leaving him like McNulty on the boat — a man without a country:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8489FY"&gt;When he returned to work in January, the security team of over 120 people that he had built was largely disbanded. As he had suggested, they were moved across to various parts of the company, but he had no role, or visibility, into their work. Instead, he was left in charge of a whittled-down team of roughly five people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wQxRTa"&gt;Stamos left Facebook in the summer of 2018 to create the Stanford Internet Observatory, where he built a team that analyzes influence operations on social platforms around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="rWayaP"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="bVYKRb"&gt;What lessons have platforms learned, if any, since 2016? Facebook massively expanded its team devoted to “platform integrity,” which monitors for Russia-style campaigns, and publishes monthly reports on the networks of adversaries that it disrupts around the world. (This has become so routine that they now typically get little coverage beyond Facebook’s own blog posts on the subject.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h2Cnce"&gt;“Since 2017, we have removed over 150 covert influence operations originating in more than 50 counties,” Facebook told me today, “and a dedicated investigative team continues to vigilantly protect democracy on our platform both here and abroad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IdCE3o"&gt;Meanwhile, disinformation in US elections has become a primarily domestic concern, driven by politicians like former President Donald Trump, who spread lies with impunity and was often rewarded for it by his voters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oIX6ia"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wire&lt;/em&gt; is a show about how people are shaped by the systems that they work within, and &lt;em&gt;An Ugly Truth&lt;/em&gt; offers a story like that, too. Facebook’s police found plenty of suspicious activity while out on patrol, but they struggled to make an airtight case — to say, definitively, what they were looking at. Amid that uncertainty, the almighty inertia of bureaucracy took over: &lt;em&gt;who do we tell? What do they do with what they tell them? Who is ultimately responsible? &lt;/em&gt;And in the confusion, Russia’s campaign succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="i6s4qm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;in the confusion, Russia’s campaign succeeded&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZO8QI4"&gt;At the same time, the story of the 2016 election is much bigger than Russia and Facebook. It’s a story about the accelerating polarization of our country; white anxiety over demographic changes; the decline of local journalism; and the fracturing of our broader information ecosystem. Even the Russia story was not simply about Facebook:&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/08/world/europe/russian-hackers-find-ready-bullhorns-in-the-media.html"&gt; the country pioneered the strategy of “hack and leak”&lt;/a&gt; — stealing documents and sharing them with mainstream news outlets while concealing their origin, giving those documents greater legitimacy when they were published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F6kl4n"&gt;Facebook had many failures during 2016, but the greatest one was of imagination: an inability to see that a platform that had gathered together billions of people would create a powerful point of leverage for foreign adversaries seeking to reshape public opinion — and to benefit from the platform’s own viral sharing mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xV5eak"&gt;Facebook has since learned that lesson; it has never been harder to set up a network of fake accounts on the network and keep it operational. And yet just because Facebook is less vulnerable to attack from state actors doesn’t mean its current information environment is good or healthy. High-quality news is too often relegated to a secondary tab, while depending on your friend and follow graph, your News Feed could be as dumb, partisan, and polarizing as ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yOATUv"&gt;What will be the result of people consuming years of feed posts that misinform them, or lead them to outrage? Who is the McNulty inside Facebook empowered to run &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; investigation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uZcBLC"&gt;It feels like there are some failures of imagination there, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="uFttUp"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Y0oXP2"&gt;While the Russia story is at the heart of &lt;em&gt;An Ugly Truth&lt;/em&gt;, the book also serves as a kind of compendium of Facebook’s highest-profile scandals over the years. Searching for a connecting thread, the authors attribute the company’s history of public relations crises to its capitalist origins: “the platform is built upon a fundamental, possibly irreconcilable dichotomy: its purported mission to advance society by connecting people while also profiting off them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0H7txX"&gt;Certainly, Facebook triggered several crises as a direct result of pursuing growth and profits above all else: the initial launch of the News Feed; the&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_Beacon"&gt; Beacon&lt;/a&gt; advertising disaster; setting posts to public by default in 2009; and most damningly, the tragic, heedless expansion into a genocidal&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/technology/myanmar-facebook-genocide.html"&gt; Myanmar&lt;/a&gt;, where Facebook initially had only a single moderator who spoke Burmese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1UlDt4"&gt;Other topics covered here, though, don’t fit quite as squarely into that narrative. The company’s use of human moderators to select “trending topics” for the feed, which is given much space in the book, actually &lt;em&gt;improved&lt;/em&gt; Facebook by keeping misinformation out of sight. To the extent it was a scandal, it was only because selecting for high-quality news disadvantaged Republican outrage bloggers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3B1OyZ"&gt;In other cases, the company faces blowback because it exercises its right to moderate content as it sees fit: leaving up a manipulated video of Nancy Pelosi, say, or defending a decade-old policy permitting Holocaust deniers on the platform. (That policy was reversed last year.) Whatever you think of those decisions, they don’t strike me as capitalist growth hacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="naT1qr"&gt;To me, the most alarming Facebook scandals have always been the ones that reflect the company’s ability to affect human psychology, typically without our knowledge. Like the time in 2012 that the company&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/everything-we-know-about-facebooks-secret-mood-manipulation-experiment/373648/"&gt; experimented with altering users’ moods&lt;/a&gt; by showing them happy or sad posts in the News Feed. Or the revelation that Cambridge Analytica used Facebook data to create “psychographic profiles” of users in hope of better targeting them with ads to benefit the Trump campaign. (This effort seems to have been a total failure, but the fact that this even seemed possible fueled much of the outrage toward that company and Facebook.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dFLnBX"&gt;You can look at the story of Russian interference on Facebook as a growth-and-profits scandal, I &lt;em&gt;guess&lt;/em&gt; — if you want to suggest it happened only because the company under-invested in security and moderation, which everyone at Facebook now acknowledges it did. But to me this one falls in that last camp — the human psychology one. I’m ultimately less worried that it took Facebook so long to find the Russians as I am about what it was possible for them to do&lt;em&gt; using &lt;/em&gt;Facebook. After all, the same viral machinery they used so successfully in 2016 is still being used every day — by Americans against other Americans, and by&lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/June-2021-CIB-Report-Final.pdf"&gt; various foreign governments against their own citizens.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ta5pe3"&gt;To me, that’s not a story about the business model being “broken,” as is so often said about the company. If Facebook had switched off ads in 2015 and become a nonprofit organization, the vast majority of the 2016 Russian influence operation still would have been possible. To me, this is a story about a social network that is massive, powerful, mostly unregulated, and by virtue of its data being privately owned, still poorly understood. In 2021, Facebook now has the tools for dealing with foreign adversaries. But Americans still don’t have many tools for dealing with Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4kxXFx"&gt;So by all means, let’s keep debating those bills now before Congress. Let’s pass a national privacy law. Let’s scrutinize future mergers and keep an eye&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22537795/is-facebook-cornering-the-vr-market"&gt; on Facebook’s VR ambitions&lt;/a&gt;. And let’s invest in&lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/what-social-networks-could-learn"&gt; public social media&lt;/a&gt; — and public media in general — to see what kinds of good we can do online when we remove the profit motive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="NGNONp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;for more than five years, various parts of our critical internet infrastructure have been under attack&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2MMBoj"&gt;But let’s also not allow ourselves the comforting delusion that the problems in our information environment begin and end in Menlo Park. All year now, cyberattacks have been ravaging our country — many of them appearing to originate in Russia. That’s a different story from the one told in &lt;em&gt;An Ugly Truth&lt;/em&gt;, but it is also part of a single story, which is that for more than five years now, various parts of our critical internet infrastructure have been under attack. Until very recently, thanks to the president they helped elect, Russia has suffered very few consequences for its actions. And among all the ugly truths on parade here, that might be the one that baffles me most of all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="zvSulC"&gt;
&lt;p id="pEjYP3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This column was co-published with &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Platformer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a daily newsletter about Big Tech and democracy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Candace Parker becomes first woman to feature on NBA 2K cover</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Chicago Sky v New York Liberty" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pEYvhagREqqb-zHZpdvx_5lnEZE=/0x0:5184x3456/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69584706/1233602900.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Ned Dishman/NBAE via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m5AJPc"&gt;Candace Parker has become the first WNBA player to appear on the cover of an &lt;em&gt;NBA 2K&lt;/em&gt; game. The Chicago Sky forward, a six-time WNBA All-Star, two-time WNBA MVP, and 2016 WNBA Finals MVP, is featured on the cover of the WNBA 25th Anniversary Special Edition of &lt;em&gt;NBA 2K22&lt;/em&gt;, which will be released on September 10th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gHlsTc"&gt;“I grew up a video game fanatic, that’s what I did, to the point where my brothers would give me the fake controller when I was younger where I think I was playing and I wasn’t,” &lt;a href="https://www.espn.com/wnba/story/_/id/31816516/chicago-sky-candace-parker-first-woman-cover-nba-2k-game"&gt;Parker tells ESPN&lt;/a&gt;. “All I wanted to do was just be like them. As a kid growing up, you dream of having your own shoe and dream of being in a video game. Those are an athlete as a kid’s dreams. To be able to experience that, I don’t take it lightly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="S9HiTX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Extremely proud and humbled to be the first female cover athlete in the history of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NBA2K?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@NBA2K&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m honored to work with a company that’s investing in women and betting on us to succeed. I’m hopeful there will be many more badass females to follow      &lt;a href="https://t.co/WJan4YE7Qt"&gt;pic.twitter.com/WJan4YE7Qt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Candace Parker (@Candace_Parker) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Candace_Parker/status/1415311818071756806?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ALnUpH"&gt;The WNBA was added to &lt;em&gt;2K&lt;/em&gt; three years ago with &lt;em&gt;NBA 2K20&lt;/em&gt;, so it’s a little surprising it’s taken this long for a female player to be featured on the cover — particularly since 2K Sports often releases multiple versions of the game starring different athletes. Last year’s &lt;em&gt;2K21&lt;/em&gt;, for example, had Damian Lillard on the last-generation console versions, Zion Williamson on the PS5 and Series X versions, and a special “Mamba Forever” edition honoring the late Kobe Bryant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OjUya5"&gt;This time around, the Dallas Mavericks’ star guard Luka Doncic will be featured on the standard cover, while an NBA 75th Anniversary Edition cover depicts NBA legends Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Dirk Nowitzki, and Kevin Durant. There’s yet another special edition starring the Washington Wizards’ Rui Hachimura, which will only be available in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fyX4dX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NBA 2K22&lt;/em&gt; will be released on the PS5, PS4, Nintendo Switch, PC, and Xbox consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;

    <title>Amazon adds AirPlay 2 and HomeKit to two Fire TV Edition TVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GRIl6CVdBf_cSWN_jAr9Ezf2gMA=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69584030/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0001.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zXQ8jp"&gt;Amazon is adding support for AirPlay 2 and HomeKit to two of its Fire TV Edition TVs in a free update, the company &lt;a href="https://amazonfiretv.blog/apple-airplay-2-and-homekit-now-available-on-toshiba-and-insignia-4k-uhd-smart-fire-tv-2020-models-89188a0b0fb3"&gt;announced on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. Both the 2020 Toshiba 4K UHD Smart Fire TV with Dolby Vision and the 2020 Insignia 4K UHD Smart TV will receive the features, before they arrive on Amazon’s less expensive Fire TV sticks and set-top boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7OgeT"&gt;On these specific TV sets, AirPlay 2 should function the same on Apple’s own Apple TV, allowing you to send audio and video from your phone, tablet, or computer to the big screen and control playback from your device. Integrating with HomeKit, Apple’s smart home ecosystem, requires a little extra legwork: you’ll have to enable HomeKit in your TV’s settings under Display &amp;amp; Sounds &amp;gt; AirPlay &amp;amp; HomeKit &amp;gt; Set Up, and then add it as a device in the Home app. Once it’s added, you can use Siri to turn your Fire TV on and off, change the volume, or switch inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jSRKpf"&gt;Both AirPlay 2 and HomeKit coming to Fire TVs (and hopefully, one day soon, Fire TV sticks) should make using the TVs with Apple’s devices that much easier. Apple already has an in with Amazon’s devices — the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/24/20930244/apple-tv-app-amazon-fire-tv-stick-models-now-available"&gt;Apple TV Plus app came to Fire TVs&lt;/a&gt; in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BX6Z41"&gt;It’s a stark contrast to how these two companies were interacting a little over five years ago, Back then, Amazon had banned sales of competing hardware like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/2/9439281/amazon-ban-apple-tv-chromecast-why"&gt;Apple TV (and Chromecast, and Nexus Player)&lt;/a&gt; in its marketplace because it claimed it was important to only sell media players that “interact well” with Prime Video. The companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/12/14/16777508/amazon-brings-back-apple-tv-google-chromecast"&gt;have since reconciled&lt;/a&gt;, and reached a very favorable deal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348108/apple-amazon-prime-video-app-store-special-treatment-fee-subscriptions"&gt;for Amazon that allows it to avoid Apple’s 30 percent App Store commission&lt;/a&gt; and use its own in-app purchase system. Now things are better. At least if you own an iPhone and Fire TV. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix snags former EA, Oculus exec to lead its video game efforts</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kHyYKD-0XwbmYb2lJJOvB5rZm3U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69583622/acastro_181101_1777_netflix_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gqqEE6"&gt;A report this spring from &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/netflix-seeks-executive-to-expand-game-efforts"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said that Netflix was seeking an executive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22452173/netflix-gaming-subscription-service-executive-2022"&gt;to lead its push into gaming&lt;/a&gt;, with an eye toward offering an Apple Arcade or Xbox Game Pass-like subscription bundle. Now, as first reported &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-14/netflix-nflx-to-offer-video-games-on-its-streaming-platform?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the streaming company has hired Mike Verdu as its vice president of game development reporting to COO Greg Peters. A Netflix spokesperson confirmed the hire to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UxBAtP"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, Netflix could offer games right next to its other streaming content “within the next year” listed as a new genre just like documentaries or anything else, without charging extra for the experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvXwjj"&gt;Verdu is a former exec who has experience with mobile gaming companies like Zynga, ran EA Mobile for a year, and most recently has been working at Facebook acquiring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22530144/facebook-oculus-studios-acquires-bigbox-vr-population-one"&gt;a series of Oculus game developers like BigBox VR&lt;/a&gt;, maker of &lt;em&gt;Population: One&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

And so really we’re trying to figure out what are all these different ways that we can increase those points of connection, we can deepen that fandom.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Asy3pk"&gt;“And certainly, games is (sic) a really interesting component of that... And there’s no doubt that games are going to be an important form of entertainment and an important sort of modality to deepen that fan experience. So we’re going to keep going, and we’ll continue to learn and figure it out as we go.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BBI14h"&gt;Netflix gaming forays have included interactive features like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/2/18165182/black-mirror-bandersnatch-netflix-interactive-strategy-marketing"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Mirror: Bandersnatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21152973/netflix-carmen-sandiego-interactive-special-black-mirror-gaming"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carmen Sandiego&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as well as licensed games including a &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; title for mobile devices. It also currently has a few job listings &lt;a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/jobs/93060254"&gt;for positions producing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/jobs/64788193"&gt;leading interactive products&lt;/a&gt;, postings that don’t mention the word gaming, but show it’s staffing up with people who have the experience necessary to help that division get off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rfKire"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 14th, 7:25PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added additional details and confirmation from a Netflix spokesperson.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft attributes new SolarWinds attack to a Chinese hacker group</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K3s1Ll1lDGUWV1c5_6N6SBoTcmI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69583436/acastro_170621_1777_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cGaGmP"&gt;Microsoft’s Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fsecurity%2Fblog%2F2021%2F07%2F13%2Fmicrosoft-discovers-threat-actor-targeting-solarwinds-serv-u-software-with-0-day-exploit%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reported on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; that SolarWinds software was attacked with a zero-day exploit by a group of hackers it calls “DEV-0322.” The hackers were focused on SolarWinds’ Serv-U FTP software, with the presumed goal of accessing the company’s clients in the US defense industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DAaCsU"&gt;The zero-day attack was first spotted in a routine Microsoft 365 Defender scan. The software noticed an “anomalous malicious process” that Microsoft explains in more detail in &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fsecurity%2Fblog%2F2021%2F07%2F13%2Fmicrosoft-discovers-threat-actor-targeting-solarwinds-serv-u-software-with-0-day-exploit%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;its blog&lt;/a&gt;, but it seems the hackers were attempting to make themselves Serv-U administrators, among other suspicious activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="klIEzb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Update Serv-U as soon as possible&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U05ytu"&gt;SolarWinds reported the zero-day exploit &lt;a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/trust-center/security-advisories/cve-2021-35211"&gt;on Friday, July 9th&lt;/a&gt;, explaining that all of the Serv-U releases from May 5th and earlier contained the vulnerability. The company released a hotfix to address the issue and the exploit has since been patched, but Microsoft writes that if Serv-U’s Secure Shell (SSH) protocol connected to the internet, the hackers could “remotely run arbitrary code with privileges, allowing them to perform actions like install and run malicious payloads, or view and change data.” Anyone running older Serv-U software is encouraged to update it as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1u5Adr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/13/22173035/hackers-russia-breached-us-government-agencies-email-cozy-bear"&gt;The first hack&lt;/a&gt; that shoved SolarWinds into the limelight in December 2020 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/2/22210667/solarwinds-hack-worse-government-microsoft-cybersecurity"&gt;exposed hundreds&lt;/a&gt; of government agencies and businesses. Unlike the previous hack, which is now widely connected to a Russian state-affiliated group of hackers called Cozy Bear, Microsoft says this zero-day attack originated in China. DEV-0322 has made a habit of attacking “entities in the US Defense Industrial Base Sector,” Microsoft writes, and is known for “using commercial VPN solutions and compromised consumer routers in their attacker infrastructure.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus says the base OnePlus 9 Pro actually won’t be sold in North America</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The whole camera system on the OnePlus 9 Pro is solid, but has room to improve" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/abwW_Zeb-zdZl3IGCvW1HnAMCMU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69583432/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0053_Edit_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5Gg8nu"&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro went on sale on April 2nd, but to date, the $969 base model, which comes with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, hasn’t been available to actually buy in North America. The company had told &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/04/03/oneplus-delays-sales-of-the-9-pros-969-base-model/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; on April 3rd&lt;/a&gt; that the base version was still on the way, but now, according to &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/07/14/the-969-base-model-oneplus-9-pro-is-never-coming-to-the-us/"&gt;a new statement given to &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it actually won’t make its way to the US or Canada due to “unforeseen supply constraints.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V23oP9"&gt;Here’s the full statement, from &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="6KWun5"&gt;“The OnePlus 9 Pro 8x128 GB variant was originally set to be sold in North America for $969. Unfortunately, due to unforeseen supply constraints specific to North American devices, we recently concluded it is no longer possible to bring this configuration to the United States and Canada. In North America we are prioritizing the 12x256 GB version to ensure our users have access to the highest spec device.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wKPcL9"&gt;This decision means that that the only OnePlus 9 Pro model available for US and Canadian consumers is the more expensive $1,069 version with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. But if you’re looking for a more affordable OnePlus phone, the OnePlus 9 is still a good option, according to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;my colleague Allison Johnson’s review&lt;/a&gt;. While it doesn’t have all the bells and whistles of the 9 Pro, it starts at $729, making it $340 cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM says two Chevy Bolts caught fire after getting recall fix</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c4rw7LhjEHsWBqPIFApN4fTUAHU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69583389/akrales_170405_1582_0571.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eYotk4"&gt;General Motors &lt;a href="https://my.chevrolet.com/how-to-support/safety/boltevrecall"&gt;said Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; that two recent Bolt EV fires happened in vehicles that had already received the fix meant to prevent the battery pack from igniting, raising new questions &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21564217/gm-chevy-bolt-recall-battery-fire-lg-chem"&gt;about the recall announced last year&lt;/a&gt;. In the meantime, the automaker is warning owners of 2017-2019 model year Bolts not to charge the electric cars overnight, and to park them outside in case they catch fire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kV4g9P"&gt;The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued the same warning to owners late Wednesday, too. The safety agency said is still investigating the problem, that it’s looking into the two new fires, and said owners can enter their VIN number &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to check to see if their Bolt is included in the recall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CHonMt"&gt;GM recalled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21564217/gm-chevy-bolt-recall-battery-fire-lg-chem"&gt;nearly 69,000 Bolt EVs in November 2020&lt;/a&gt; after a handful of reports of fires that apparently started in the electric vehicles’ battery packs. The company warned owners at the time to park their Bolts outside until it could figure out the cause of the fires and settle on a fix, but it didn’t say anything at the time about not charging overnight. GM also issued an interim software update that limited the maximum capacity of the affected Bolts’ battery packs to 90 percent to reduce the chance of a fire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ub6Yhx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Dealers started implementing the fix in May&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qdRMOP"&gt;It wasn’t until May of this year, though, that GM &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417634/chevy-bolt-recall-fire-fix-software-update"&gt;finally shared its plan to fix the problem causing the fires&lt;/a&gt;. It ultimately involved having Chevy dealers inspect the battery packs, swap out any suspect battery modules, and install new software meant to “detect potential issues related to changes in battery module performance before problems can develop.”  This software is also being installed on the revamped Chevy Bolt and the Bolt EUV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JxPDJO"&gt;The problem now is that this fix may not be working. Two recent fires happened in vehicles that had received the new software and been checked by a dealer — including &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/14/gm-warns-some-bolt-ev-owners-dont-park-them-inside-or-charge-them-unattended-overnight.html?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;amp;utm_content=Main&amp;amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1626290713"&gt;one in a vehicle owned by a Vermont state lawmaker&lt;/a&gt;. The other fire happened this week in New Jersey, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/14/gm-warns-some-bolt-ev-owners-dont-park-them-inside-or-charge-them-unattended-overnight.html?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;amp;utm_content=Main&amp;amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1626290713"&gt;the company told CNBC&lt;/a&gt;. GM says it’s still investigating the fires, and is asking owners who haven’t gotten the fix to take their Bolts in to a dealer regardless. At least nine fires have been documented, and the company has started &lt;a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/40825/gm-is-buying-back-dozens-of-chevy-bolt-evs-that-pose-fire-risk-due-to-rare-manufacturing-defect"&gt;buying back some Bolts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1nmbe0"&gt;GM has remained tight-lipped about what is causing the fires throughout this whole process, but these earlier-model Bolts use the same cells from LG Chem that power Hyundai’s Kona EV, which has also been recalled following multiple reports of fires and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396480/hyundai-discontinue-kona-ev-korea-battery-fire-recall"&gt;canceled outright in South Korea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c8ajim"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 14th, 6:30PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added second paragraph with information from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Plex’s free TV service gets 15 new channels</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="plex logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DT2-ps1Y7qyd3M35mMrb5NzvlUo=/66x0:774x472/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69583350/plex-hero-970-80-840x472.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Plex&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5G30XJ"&gt;Plex, the popular build-your-own streaming service, has added 15 new channels to its ad-supported streaming offering for free TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="snhS8O"&gt;All of the new channels available on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.plex.tv%2Fwatch-free-tv%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F14%2F22577727%2Fplex-15-new-tv-channels" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Plex’s free Live TV&lt;/a&gt; feed arrive on the service today, and most will be available globally (though a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that some are available in Latin America or the US only). Plex &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/do-it-all-streaming-service-plex-is-launching-a-new-tv-1844474303"&gt;originally launched&lt;/a&gt; the free TV feature last year as a collection of pre-programmed, continuous channels rather than traditional over-the-air streams. So it’s not &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; live TV, but it does offer a similar linear experience if you’re just looking to throw something on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qls4f3"&gt;Of these new channels, some notable additions include MMA TV, USA Today, USA Today Sportswire, and the Tribeca Channel. The full list of channels added today are, with summaries from Plex:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="lLF9GQ"&gt;AfroLandTV (Global)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KKbLoQ"&gt;WildEarth (Global)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9o2X6S"&gt;Johnny Carson TV (Global)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TCIbe5"&gt;The Carol Burnett Show (Global)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1Uom3p"&gt;MMA TV (Global)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aCI9vu"&gt;USA TODAY (Global)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="BwjyZd"&gt;Plex’s user-friendly Live TV offering currently supports 182 free channels, with 24 news-specific channels. IFC Films Picks, IGN, Reuters, Yahoo! Finance, Cheddar News, Newsy, and FuboTV Sports Network are among the more notable channels already offered. The service also supports filtering for HD-only channels. If on-demand is more your speed, the service also offers a bunch of free movies to stream as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O29khe"&gt;Plex is widely known as a customizable content server, which by nature makes it a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/23/20697751/piracy-plex-netflix-hulu-streaming-wars"&gt;bit of a piracy haven&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="LtH90v"&gt;“With [every] new addition, we’re focused on continuing to expand our catalogue to provide entertainment options that speak to everyone,” Shawn Eldridge, VP of strategic alliances and content, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Kindle deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VfQnBwLbLIeiZEVOPMuNUumuNok=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67715739/akrales_190723_3560_0016.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AZCNr8"&gt;When it comes to finding a device to use to read your ebooks, you have a few options to choose from. You can always buy a tablet or use your smartphone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doom-scrolling on Twitter. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while niche, are designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with limited functionality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDKHVT"&gt;Amazon, having helped pioneer the e-reader, has dominated the space for years with its Kindle lineup, which consists of three unique models with their own pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRHBaM"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each model currently available for purchase. Sometimes, there isn’t a deal for one, or any, of the products. In those instances, we’ve mentioned the most recent sale price so you know what a good Kindle deal looks like when you see one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jqPttv"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/4/10/18302177/amazon-kindle-base-model-low-resolution-screen-backlight-review"&gt;Kindle (10th Generation)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="mXAcFi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10363966"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hfprjz"&gt;This is Amazon’s most affordable e-reader, and as such, it usually retails for $90. Released in 2019, the base Kindle includes a front light, 8GB of storage, and comes with or without ad support. Despite including the same 167ppi resolution as its predecessors, this model has slightly higher contrast than earlier models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIAlEv"&gt;Right now, you can buy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07978J597?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a 10th-gen Kindle with lockscreen ads&lt;/a&gt; for $90, which is the usual price. If you want &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VZV5VB?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=1ccac7c6dd4bb605e9b24952e83a00de&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one without ads&lt;/a&gt;, you can grab it for $110. If you buy either Kindle model, you’ll also receive three months of Kindle Unlimited at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTnhuW"&gt;If you want to save some money on additional accessories for the e-reader, Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Essentials-including-Amazon-Printed-Adapter/dp/B08C6NDPFM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Essentials Bundle&lt;/a&gt; is $120 ($15 off its usual price); it includes one of three printed covers and a power adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RkX3DN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ze80m8"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/7/20902588/kindle-kids-edition-amazon-bundle-young-e-reader-case-replacement-program-freetime"&gt;Kindle Kids Edition (2019)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JypT34"&gt;The entry-level Kindle and Oasis models were not the only ones that received a refresh in 2019. Amazon also announced and released a Kindle Kids Edition Bundle, which provides age-appropriate content for younger readers who prefer digital books for $110 ($20 more than the base Kindle). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LlYfl"&gt;The Kindle Kids Edition consists of five items: the device, a case, a two-year extended replacement guarantee (in the event the device breaks), and one year of Amazon’s FreeTime Unlimited service. The latter is the biggest selling point of the device aside from the kid-friendly patterns, as it allows parents to grant their kids access to a digital library of kid-friendly books like &lt;em&gt;Percy Jackson&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit &lt;/em&gt;at no additional cost. Right now, you can grab one for $70 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NMY72SC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1746224890339507137" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, the lowest price we’ve seen on the e-reader outside of Prime Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3DEvBp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552664"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="iYO8oT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"},{"title":"Here are the best Amazon Echo deals right now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21546591/best-amazon-echo-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="t6m9om"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/7/18065960/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2018-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Paperwhite (fourth-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="P1C5xu"&gt;The fourth-gen Kindle Paperwhite, released in 2018, starts at $130 and comes in four different configurations: an 8GB Wi-Fi model, a 32GB Wi-Fi model, and a configuration of each that drops the ads from the lock screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qneu65"&gt;The Paperwhite features a 6-inch, pin-sharp backlit display, which is the main reason to get the Paperwhite over the base Kindle. The 2018 model also added a few useful features normally found on Amazon’s flagship reader, the Oasis, such as water resistance and Audible audiobook support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UaH6Zy"&gt;No deals are currently available for the Paperwhite, but you can pick up the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PQ96B6B?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB model with ad support&lt;/a&gt; for $130 or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PTCW9G7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ad-free edition for $150&lt;/a&gt;. If you need more space, Amazon is selling the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PP49ZDW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB Paperwhite with ads for $160&lt;/a&gt;; if you want the ad-free model, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PT96B3T?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for $180&lt;/a&gt;. Just like the base Kindle, Amazon currently running a promotion where you can grab the e-reader plus three months of Kindle Unlimited at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Emeowb"&gt;Amazon has discounted its Kindle Paperwhite Essentials Bundle, which includes either an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HL49FCK/ref=mako_bundletwister_mt1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB e-reader bundle for $170&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HKT4M5K/ref=mako_bundletwister_mt1?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$200 if you buy the 32GB&lt;/a&gt; (with ads). If you’re a fan of Suzanne Collins’ Hunger Games trilogy, Amazon also offers a bundle that includes a Kindle Paperwhite, a power adapter, and a Mockingjay-emblazoned cover. It’s currently available in two ad-supported configurations and colors: an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Bundle-including-Ad-Supported/dp/B087NMH2F7?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB version for $160&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Bundle-including-Ad-Supported/dp/B087NM77FC?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB variant for $190&lt;/a&gt;, both of which save you $20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vOUHwk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552401"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="X5jbTU"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707619/amazon-kindle-oasis-2019-e-reader-review-price-specs-features-display" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Oasis (Third Generation)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IByP4u"&gt;The Kindle Oasis is the most expensive of the lineup, starting at $250. The device comes in two storage configurations, 8GB or 32GB, and like the other models, you can get it with or without ads on the lock screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1AvXZM"&gt;The 2019 Kindle Oasis looks very similar to the previous model. It retains its waterproof, seven-inch, 300ppi E Ink display and supports Audible audiobooks via Bluetooth. Unlike previous models, however, it can adjust the color temperature to a yellow-toned display, making it easier to read at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxP7sb"&gt;In the past, we have seen the 32GB Kindle Oasis drop to as low as $200, which is the lowest it has ever been for that configuration to date. While there are currently no deals on just the Oasis itself, configurations start at $250 and include three free months of Kindle Unlimited. The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHV8D7P?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB, ad-supported Oasis&lt;/a&gt; is $250 and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VDMJJLG?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one without ads is $270&lt;/a&gt;. If you need more storage, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VCMJSLB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB version is $280 with ads&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VGTRMFS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$300 without&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XuGlPY"&gt;Amazon is currently offering an Essentials Bundle for $30 off its normal list price. You can get either the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RNPKRKW/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB, ad-supported configuration for as low as $280&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RW2K1MD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB variant for $310&lt;/a&gt;, both of which come with a leather cover, a power adapter, and three months of Kindle Unlimited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hPPu8s"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552599"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp multi-device beta allows four devices at once even without a phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/emln98KvTUW9KTx1LRB-7Tp6G5Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69583322/acastro_210119_1777_whatsapp_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RBk3IR"&gt;Until now, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/21/7867529/whatsapp-is-coming-to-the-web"&gt;using WhatsApp web on your desktop&lt;/a&gt; or any other device has required having a phone that’s powered on and connected, but a new beta test is trying out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/10/21361542/whatsapp-multiple-devices-support-ipad-app-chat-sync-rumors"&gt;support for multiple devices&lt;/a&gt; without needing a phone in the mix. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466425/whatsapp-multi-device-support-disappearing-mode-view-once-features-confirmed"&gt;a June interview&lt;/a&gt;, WhatsApp head Will Cathcart and his boss, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, commented on the technical challenge of maintaining end-to-end encryption. With &lt;a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/07/14/security/whatsapp-multi-device/"&gt;a blog post today&lt;/a&gt;, Cathcart explains more about what has been done behind the scenes to maintain security.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mQESK80QqqQ5XJGGBl3Qt-c1My4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22718057/whatsapp_e2e.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;WhatsApp’s message architecture.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="glO7XX"&gt;As the image comparing the legacy and new systems (above) tries to explain, previously, a user’s phone managed the key determining their identity and ability to encrypt/decrypt messages. The encrypted synchronization also applies to message history, contact names, and other data, with keys maintained on the individual devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RHg4jd"&gt;To start, the beta is going out to a limited group of testers who are already in WhatsApp’s beta program, while the team says it’s working on improving performance and adding more features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VOuDBw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We've been working on this for a long time. Until now, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WhatsApp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@WhatsApp&lt;/a&gt; has only been available on one device at a time. And desktop and web support only worked by mirroring off your phone - which meant your phone had to be on and have an active internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;— Will Cathcart (@wcathcart) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wcathcart/status/1415386856783417344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
