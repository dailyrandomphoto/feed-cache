    <title>Nobody is flying to join Google’s FLoC</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H7Fo0Z"&gt;Google is going it alone with its proposed advertising technology to replace third-party cookies. Every major browser that uses the open source Chromium project has declined to use it, and it’s unclear what that will mean for the future of advertising on the web. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WR1nAW"&gt;A couple of weeks ago, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358287/privacy-ads-google-chrome-floc-cookies-cookiepocalypse-finger-printing"&gt;Google announced it was beginning to test a new ad technology inside Google Chrome called the Federated Learning of Cohorts&lt;/a&gt;, or FLoC. It uses an algorithm to look at your browser history and place you in a group of people with similar browsing histories so that advertisers can target you. It’s more private than cookies, but it’s also complicated and has some potential privacy implications of its own if it’s not implemented right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HANyqh"&gt;Google Chrome is built on an open source project, and so FLoC was implemented as part of that project that other browsers could include. I am not aware of any Chromium-based browser outside of Google’s own that will implement it and very aware of many that will refuse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tKmX0h"&gt;One note I’ll drop here is that I am relieved that nobody else is implementing FLoC right away, because the way FLoC is constructed puts a very big responsibility on a browser maker. If implemented badly, FLoC could leak out sensitive information. It’s a complicated technology that does appear to keep you semi-anonymous, but there are enough details to hide dozens of devils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="T4Ez4r"&gt;&lt;q&gt;No browser vendor except Chrome is joining the FLoC&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o6OutW"&gt;Anyway, here’s &lt;a href="https://brave.com/why-brave-disables-floc/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brave&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: “The worst aspect of FLoC is that it materially harms user privacy, under the guise of being privacy-friendly.” And here’s &lt;a href="https://vivaldi.com/blog/no-google-vivaldi-users-will-not-get-floced/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vivaldi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: “We will not support the FLoC API and plan to disable it, no matter how it is implemented. It does not protect privacy and it certainly is not beneficial to users, to unwittingly give away their privacy for the financial gain of Google.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O6lUvI"&gt;We’ve reached out to &lt;strong&gt;Opera&lt;/strong&gt; for comment as well. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22376110/duckduckgo-privacy-floc-block-chrome-extension-advertising-tech"&gt;DuckDuckGo isn’t a browser&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s already made a browser extension to block it. And the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which is very much against FLoC, has even &lt;a href="https://amifloced.org/"&gt;made a website to let you know if you’re one of the few Chrome users who have been included&lt;/a&gt; in Google’s early tests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ndbovl"&gt;But maybe the most important Chromium-based browser not made by Google is &lt;strong&gt;Microsoft Edge&lt;/strong&gt;. It is a big test for Google’s proposed FLoC technology: if Microsoft isn’t going to support it, that would pretty much mean Chrome really will be going it alone with this technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1e21CA"&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22351192/tech-ceo-hearing-mark-zuckerberg-jack-dorsey-sundar-pichai-facebook-google-twitter"&gt;grand tradition of Congressional tech hearings&lt;/a&gt;, I asked Microsoft a yes or no question: does it intend to implement FLoC in Edge? And in the same grand tradition, Microsoft answered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="5PE2bT"&gt;We believe in a future where the web can provide people with privacy, transparency and control while also supporting responsible business models to create a vibrant, open and diverse ecosystem. Like Google, we support solutions that give users clear consent, and do not bypass consumer choice. That’s also why we do not support solutions that leverage non-consented user identity signals, such as fingerprinting. The industry is on a journey and there will be browser-based proposals that do not need individual user ids and ID-based proposals that are based on consent and first party relationships. We will continue to explore these approaches with the community. Recently, for example, we were pleased to introduce one possible approach, as described in our PARAKEET proposal. This proposal is not the final iteration but is an evolving document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="2fMS42"&gt;That is a LOT to unpack, but it sounds very much like a “no” to me. However, it’s a “no” with some important context. But before I get too deep into it, let’s talk about a couple of non-Chromium browsers — because one important piece of all of this is that Google’s FLoC technology is still a &lt;em&gt;proposal. &lt;/em&gt;Google is saying it would like to make it a fundamental part of the web, not simply a new feature in its browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JftGAC"&gt;Here’s a statement that a Mozilla spokesperson provided to us on the plans for &lt;strong&gt;Firefox&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="m_-550364295539317878gmail-docs-internal-guid-7f59cbb4-7fff-ed02-d8c4-bc9f826b3e13"&gt;We are currently evaluating many of the privacy preserving advertising proposals, including those put forward by Google, but have no current plans to implement any of them at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aacnfh"&gt;We don’t buy into the assumption that the industry needs billions of data points about people, that are collected and shared without their understanding, to serve relevant advertising. That is why we’ve implemented Enhanced Tracking Protection by default to block more than ten billion trackers a day, and continue to innovate on &lt;a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2021/02/23/latest-firefox-release-includes-multiple-picture-in-picture-and-total-cookie-protection/"&gt;new ways&lt;/a&gt; to protect people who use Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jtav2Q"&gt;Advertising and privacy can co-exist. And the advertising industry can operate differently than it has in past years. We look forward to playing a role in finding solutions that build a better web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="BsXnUm"&gt;As for Apple’s &lt;strong&gt;Safari&lt;/strong&gt;, I will admit I didn’t reach out for comment because at this point it’s not difficult to guess what the answer will be. Apple, after all, deserves some credit for changing everybody’s default views on privacy. However, the story here is actually much more interesting that you might guess at first. John Wilander is a WebKit engineer at Apple who works on Safari’s privacy-enhancing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192830/apple-safari-intelligent-tracking-privacy-full-third-party-cookie-blocking"&gt;Intelligent Tracking Prevention&lt;/a&gt; features. He was asked on Twitter whether or not Safari would implement FLoC and here’s his reply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BzD49q"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We have not said we will implement and we have our tracking prevention policy. That’s it for the time being. Serious standards proposals deserve thinking and I appreciate Brave sharing theirs.&lt;/p&gt;— John Wilander (@johnwilander) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/johnwilander/status/1381699191609561088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="b488OU"&gt;Wilander’s reply jibes with Microsoft’s statement that “the industry is on a journey” when it comes to balancing new advertising technologies and privacy. More importantly, it speaks to something really important: web standards people take their jobs seriously and are seriously committed to the web standards process that creates the open web. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iqRgAK"&gt;I often make light of that process as being slow, contentious, and frustrating. It is all those things. But it’s also the last line of defense against the complete and total fracturing of the web into pages that are only compatible with specific web browsers. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/24/15681958/what-is-web-definition"&gt;That isn’t the web at all&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="S3ubRG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"And now, a brief definition of the web ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/24/15681958/what-is-web-definition"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ZZEWzu"&gt;And so what you’d expect to be a hard “no” from Apple (and what will almost surely be a hard “no” in the end) instead becomes a commitment to the web standards process and taking Google’s proposals seriously. Ditto from Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="epybuy"&gt;All of this is happening because every major browser already has or will soon block third-party cookies, the default way of identifying you and tracking you across the web. And every major browser has committed to ensuring that you can’t be personally identifiable to third-party advertisers. Even Google’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22310332/google-privacy-replacing-third-party-cookies-privacy-sandbox"&gt;own ad team has said as much&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JMYZkT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The future of the web is at stake&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EqbreL"&gt;The end of those cookies is called the Cookiepocalypse, and it’s apocalyptic because nobody really knows what advertisers will do once those tracking methods are raptured. And so right now, major browser vendors are proposing different, new solutions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sfsTHW"&gt;Apple, Google, and Microsoft all have ideas for how advertising on the web should work. We’ve discussed Google’s FLoC at length, but you might be surprised to hear that Apple isn’t just trying to stop all ads; it has &lt;a href="https://webkit.org/blog/8943/privacy-preserving-ad-click-attribution-for-the-web/"&gt;privacy-enhancing ad proposals of its own&lt;/a&gt;. And that random reference to PARAKEET in Microsoft’s statement? &lt;a href="https://github.com/WICG/privacy-preserving-ads/blob/main/Parakeet.md"&gt;Another ad proposal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WfgRiE"&gt;The problem here is that the Cookiepocalypse is already nigh. Many browsers are already blocking third-party cookies. Google Chrome is the big holdout on blocking third-party cookies, but it’s also the browser with the biggest market share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xp4baO"&gt;Google has committed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21064698/google-third-party-cookies-chrome-two-years-privacy-safari-firefox"&gt;cutting off third-party cookies in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, but it seems very unlikely that the web standards process will get to an answer by then. In fact, one of &lt;a href="https://www.adweek.com/programmatic/google-shelves-fledge-trials-until-late-2021/"&gt;Google’s other proposals isn’t going to begin testing until late this year&lt;/a&gt; — far too late to be implemented by the ad industry if Google sticks to its original promise. Who knows what advertisers will do then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0PotSl"&gt;The technology here is complicated, the process is slow, and the outcome is unclear. That’s par for the course for the web. Normally I’d tell you not to worry about it and just let the W3C run its course. But the stakes are very high: your privacy, vast pools of money, and the interoperable nature of the web itself could all go up in a puff of smoke if these browser makers don’t figure out a way to thread all these needles. Cookiepocalypse, indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Unicode Emoji Subcommittee is back, baby</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GzN9UTgRfhfOLQDldBp7dIke2lE=/300x0:2100x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69137593/final_Android_11_emoji.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nONfdU"&gt;After pausing its review of emoji submissions, the Unicode Emoji Subcommittee is back with tips for successful submissions, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jenniferdaniel/status/1382758288316502017"&gt;chair Jennifer Daniel announced.&lt;/a&gt; Anything you submit now could come to phones as soon as 2023 — but if you want to fine-tune your emoji, she’s got some suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CPFPX1"&gt;A good emoji has multiple uses, can be used with other emoji to create an emoji phrase, represents something new, and is distinct from existing emoji, Daniel writes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="erDjSd"&gt;We won’t get new emoji this year; the Unicode Consortium — that’s the panel in charge of emoji releases — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/9/21214865/unicode-emoji-delay-2022-android-ios-mobile-release"&gt;delayed the version release&lt;/a&gt;. The delay was because Unicode relies on volunteers, and last year, the pandemic overwhelmed them. The next planned release is in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T87NFN"&gt;Our own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21327599/how-to-make-emoji-yawning-face-waffle-proposal-unicode"&gt;Jay Peters has contributed to your emoji vocabulary&lt;/a&gt; with a yawn and a waffle. He submitted his proposal in 2017, and the new emoji hit phones everywhere in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KNxDfR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dogecoin is on a run, has escaped the yard, and is headed to the moon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Dogecoin logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/px4qoPMrTMFeETFXi7ZGqxDyLZg=/21x0:539x345/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69137451/Dogecoin_logo.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JRJotZ"&gt;Oh, super, Dogecoin is spiking. The joke currency, which as recently as January 27th was worth less than a cent, hit 47 cents this morning, according to Robinhood’s tracker. As I type this, &lt;a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dogecoin/"&gt;the market cap is more than $51 billion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TGmGWI"&gt;The currency is based on an &lt;em&gt;au-courant-&lt;/em&gt;as-of-2013 meme of a Shiba Inu, and was intended to satirize bitcoin. Well, kids, the joke’s over. It’s now a top-10 cryptocurrency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fe6jgE"&gt;Weird year for finance, honestly. There was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;the Gamestonk&lt;/a&gt; thing which made GameStop stock so valuable, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gamestop-board-hestia-exclusive-idUSKBN2BV2VW"&gt;a member of the board of directors had to step down&lt;/a&gt; so that he could sell shares without restrictions. (Noted investor David Einhorn accused Elon Musk &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/investor-einhorn-says-palihapitiya-musk-poured-jet-fuel-gamestop-2021-04-15/"&gt;of pouring “jet fuel”&lt;/a&gt; on the January rally;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-04/elon-musk-s-gamestop-tweets-are-now-a-hedge-fund-signal?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt; a hedge fund called the top&lt;/a&gt; of the January rally based on the Musk tweet and raked in the dough.) Keith “Roaring Kitty” Gill &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/16/roaring-kitty-stands-to-rake-in-millions-on-his-gamestop-options-bet-friday.html"&gt;stands to make millions&lt;/a&gt;, which he will presumably use to buy fancier headbands. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;NFT mania seized the world&lt;/a&gt;, after artist Beeple — aka Mike Winkelmann —  sold an NFT of &lt;em&gt;Everydays: The First 5,000 Days&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;for $69 million&lt;/a&gt;. Coinbase went public earlier this week, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2021/4/14/22383748/coinbase-nasdaq-ipo-direct-listing"&gt;closed its first day of trading worth more than the company behind the Nasdaq&lt;/a&gt;, the exchange it trades on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XBfbGF"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Doge Barking at the Moon &lt;a href="https://t.co/QFB81D7zOL"&gt;pic.twitter.com/QFB81D7zOL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1382552587099062272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zxZ04u"&gt;Last night, Musk — a shitposter with a hobby of being CEO of Tesla and SpaceX — tweeted “Doge Barking at the Moon.” For those of you fortunate enough to have avoided internet-related brainworms: a bunch of people probably thought this was a reference to a phrase used by internet traders, “to the moon.” Musk, who is known for coming to memes late, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1113009339743100929"&gt;has called dogecoin his favorite cryptocurrency.&lt;/a&gt; In February, he called it “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1357241340313141249"&gt;The People’s Crypto&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kKF1W0"&gt;Look, it’s not my fault that the interest rate is zero percent — that was always gonna make shit weird, because there’s almost nowhere safe to park your money without losing some of it to inflation. That means a lot more money is sloshing around than usual, which is fueling everything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;SPACs&lt;/a&gt; to Gamestonk. What worries me is that we could be locked into zero interest rate policy world &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/31/the-fed-could-be-locked-into-zero-rates-for-five-years-or-even-longer.html"&gt;for as long as five years&lt;/a&gt;, which is an awfully long time for memes to mess with actual money. As long as there’s this much money sloshing around, anything goes. Anyway, if you are a hedge fund that called the top on Dogecoin based on an Elon Musk tweet, let me know — I’d love to interview you and find out how that call went.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fitbit’s next fitness tracker looks fancy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eYHqDszeoZCnaVy-iru3K17jaxA=/0x1:2134x1424/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69137362/47268.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image of the upcoming Fitbit Luxe showing three colors: gold, black, and silver.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: WinFuture&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RToLen"&gt;Fitbit may be ready to launch a new fitness tracker soon, if images &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,122391.html"&gt;published by &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are to be believed. The new tracker is apparently named Luxe and features a more fashion-centric design than Fitbit’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344359/fitbit-adds-tile-tracking-feature-bluetooth-inspire-2-wearable"&gt;existing Inspire 2&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not clear when the Luxe will be released or how much it will cost, but I would not be surprised if it has a higher price tag than the $100 Inspire 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KAoVtv"&gt;The big upgrade for the Luxe is a new stainless steel body, which will be available in silver, gold, or black finishes. It also has a color OLED touchscreen, though &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; didn’t provide specs or detailed information about it. Both the stainless steel body and the color screen are upgrades over the plastic and monochrome options on the Inspire 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxY7Er"&gt;The Luxe is expected to have a heart rate monitor, sleep tracking, and all of the activity tracking features that Fitbit’s other wearables support. It’s not likely to have a GPS radio of its own, however — you’ll probably need to have your phone with you for accurate mapping of your runs. In addition to the body colors, &lt;em&gt;WinFuture’s&lt;/em&gt; images show various strap color options, so it’s likely Fitbit will position this as much of a fashion accessory as a fitness device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zmIidm"&gt;Fitbit, which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22188428/google-fitbit-acquisition-completed-approved"&gt;now owned by Google&lt;/a&gt;, built its brand on wrist-worn fitness trackers, and it looks like the Luxe is very much in that vein. The company has had less success &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21450123/fitbit-sense-review"&gt;producing a competent smartwatch&lt;/a&gt;, but perhaps it can inject some life into Google’s flailing smartwatch platform once the companies fully merge their resources.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla settles with ex-engineer accused of stealing Autopilot source code </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wkf-CLVKpEVqKhrS5i5Rup4HFKk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69137354/acastro_180430_1777_tesla_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nKbhhm"&gt;Tesla and former Tesla engineer Cao Guangzhi have come to a settlement after the electric car company accused Cao of stealing the Autopilot source code. Cao, an engineer focused on autonomous driving, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/tesla-ex-engineer-settle-lawsuit-over-autopilot-source-code-2021-04-16/"&gt;told Reuters&lt;/a&gt; that the source code has never been used since he parted ways with Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PvH1WJ"&gt;In 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18275617/tesla-former-employee-lawsuit-trade-secret-theft-zoox-xpeng-feature"&gt;Tesla sued Cao&lt;/a&gt; after the engineer left Tesla to work at its rival, the Chinese carmaker XMotors. Tesla accused Cao of stealing trade secrets — specifically the source code for its Autopilot driver-assistance software. In the initial filing, &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-settles-with-former-employee-over-autopilot-source-code-accusations-131023096.html"&gt;Tesla referred to it&lt;/a&gt; as the “crown jewel of Tesla’s intellectual property portfolio.” While Tesla and its fans often liken it to autonomous driving, it's really more a sophisticated form of cruise control and Tesla has previously &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JenniferHomendy/status/1344064202164621315"&gt;come under fire&lt;/a&gt; for misrepresenting its capabilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yG7TmB"&gt;Cao left Tesla to work on automated driving technology at Xmotors. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/10/20689468/tesla-autopilot-trade-secret-theft-guangzhi-cao-xpeng-xiaopeng-motors-lawsuit-filing"&gt;He later admitted&lt;/a&gt; that he uploaded multiple zip files containing the source code to his iCloud account in 2018 while he still worked for Tesla. Yet he insisted he never used the source code in his work at Xmotors, and continues to insist the same today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CubOA8"&gt;XMotors confirmed to Reuters that Cao is no longer with the company, and says it respects intellectual property rights. Cao is on the hook with Tesla and per the terms of the settlement must pay the company. The details of the settlement have not been disclosed, so it’s unclear how much he owes Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VF47Ds"&gt;As a reminder, never upload sensitive company materials to your personal cloud. You might have the best of intentions, but your employers probably won’t assume the same. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Music pays a penny per stream</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A woman wearing headphones and a mask" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jEMkE3lC6O1SgypxlhXCPIbr9h4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69137161/IMG_0626-1.0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FkhXC5"&gt;Apple Music’s payment rate for artists and labels is fundamentally a penny per stream, according to a letter from the company posted on its artist dashboard and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-music-reveals-how-much-it-pays-when-you-stream-a-song-11618579800?mod=pls_whats_news_us_business_f"&gt;first reported by the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That payment rate is higher than Spotify, which has a confusing variable rate scheme that basically tops out at a half-penny per stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j3MQls"&gt;Announcing a penny-per-stream rate is a nice PR win for Apple Music, since it is 1. very simple and 2. Spotify hates talking about its per-stream payments, which the company insists are a misleading figure. Seriously, it just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22336087/spotify-loud-clear-website-launch-pay-artists-streaming-royalities"&gt;launched an entire website&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href="https://loudandclear.byspotify.com/?question=spotify-pay-per-stream"&gt;Loud&amp;amp;Clear&lt;/a&gt; last month designed to help artists and fans understand how payments work, and a good chunk of it is devoted to explaining why per-stream rates are not the right thing to focus on. It’s a lot of copy like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="L4ZrlX"&gt;In the streaming era, fans do not pay per song and services do not pay per stream, so we don’t believe a “per stream rate” is a meaningful number to analyze. Still, we understand that artists find it useful to calculate an effective “per stream” rate or, in other words, a revenue-to-streams ratio — dividing the total size of the royalty pool on Spotify (&lt;strong&gt;the numerator&lt;/strong&gt;) by the total number of music streams on Spotify (&lt;strong&gt;the denominator&lt;/strong&gt;). Both of these numbers are growing incredibly quickly every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BFeifM"&gt;There are a number of factors that contribute to that ratio looking small, which we understand can &lt;em&gt;seem&lt;/em&gt; problematic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OoYiht"&gt;Right. It is important to note that Spotify runs a massive ad-supported music service with very different economics to the paid Spotify Premium tier, while Apple Music only offers a paid service. And Spotify is way bigger, with 345 million total users, of which 155 million are paying Spotify Premium customers. (It’s hard to put good numbers on how big Apple Music is currently; the company’s last public number is “more than 60 million subscribers” from June 2019, and &lt;a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/apple-music-statistics/"&gt;more recent estimates&lt;/a&gt; have it at 72 million.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRATzf"&gt;In any event, Spotify’s argument is that it pays lower variable rates on far more streams, while Apple’s happy to say that it pays a higher, simpler rate on fewer streams. Neither argument really solves the essential economic problem of streaming, which is that most artists can’t make a living on streaming royalties alone, which is why everyone is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/10/22375289/the-week-in-nfts-ranked"&gt;out there selling NFTs&lt;/a&gt; and hoping the concert business comes back in force soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQAVSU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lX9wT4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton clarifies the Apple Watch GymKit mess</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pelton Bike Plus in an apartment" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zjAdzAkjfcIwKZeco-myaiedaDE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69136950/akrales210108_4344_0020.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5LoneU"&gt;Okay. Peloton sells a very famous stationary bicycle with streaming workouts, an app, and a whole fitness lifestyle situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g44yeN"&gt;Apple sells a very famous smartwatch with heart rate tracking, apps, and the ability to sync with fitness equipment over a proprietary Apple system called GymKit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="znuAWI"&gt;The basic Peloton bike costs $1,895 and does not work with GymKit; the fancier Bike Plus, which works with GymKit, costs $2,495. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yqXoLI"&gt;A lot of people bought the more expensive bike to use it with their Apple Watches over GymKit! And yesterday all those people were dismayed to learn that Peloton had disabled Apple Watch integration for “bike bootcamp” classes, which combine cycling with strength training. (The integration still works just fine with regular old cycling, but you understand, again, that Peloton is an entire fitness lifestyle situation.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="SLF7Dz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Peloton Bike Plus’ GymKit support no longer works with Bike Bootcamp classes ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385515/peloton-bike-plus-gymkit-apple-watch-bootcamp-support"},{"title":"Apple Fitness Plus adds new workouts designed specifically for pregnant, beginner, and older users ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2021/4/15/22385653/apple-fitness-plus-new-workouts-pregnant-beginner-older-users-jane-fonda"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="4010wh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385515/peloton-bike-plus-gymkit-apple-watch-bootcamp-support"&gt;Peloton’s statement yesterday&lt;/a&gt; firmly pinned the blame for this on Apple, with a spokesperson telling &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that “Peloton is committed to bringing the GymKit integration to all workouts and disciplines &lt;strong&gt;within Apple’s terms of service&lt;/strong&gt;.” (emphasis ours).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iM9b43"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple’s GymKit terms have a clause limiting them to specific use cases&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7uqkKp"&gt;This predictably led to a lot of confusion. Since Apple’s terms of service for GymKit are not public, it was not clear what terms Peloton had violated, and, in general, “using your expensive smartwatch to sync your heart rate to your expensive stationary bike” is not the sort of thing that should require contract negotiations between huge companies. And obviously Apple runs Apple Fitness Plus, which is a direct competitor to Peloton, and does not suffer from any corporate politics-based heart rate tracking issues. (And, of course, Peloton just &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-22/peloton-buys-wearables-ai-hardware-companies-in-deal-flurry"&gt;bought Atlas&lt;/a&gt;, which is... a smartwatch company.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EPtTzw"&gt;Anyhow, irritating the huge group of wealthy people who own both an Apple Watch and a Peloton Bike Plus is &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pelotoncycle/comments/mrhhan/the_peloton_bike_plus_gymkit_support_no_longer/"&gt;a bad idea&lt;/a&gt;, so Peloton has a new statement today clarifying what’s going on. Here it is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="mxD9SM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple GymKit is designed to work with equipment-based cardio workouts. However, Peloton recently implemented GymKit with Bike Bootcamp, a multi-disciplinary class type that combines strength and cardio, which the feature does not support. Members can still use GymKit to sync their cycling-only workouts to their Apple Watch from the Bike+.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="C3ZZUB"&gt;So basically, the Apple Watch does not support switching from biking to lifting weights all in one workout. Fair enough. That said, if people want to use their Apple Watch in goofy off-label ways, it’s weird that Apple is stopping them in this way, no? And certainly adding a “bike bootcamp” workout mode to the Apple Watch fitness app would be relatively easy for Apple, the company that makes the Apple Watch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XFB44x"&gt;In conclusion, Apple retains iron-fisted control over its devices and the things that connect to them through its secret accessory contracts, and if anyone would like to send me those contracts, our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/a/tip-us-secure-contact-email"&gt;Securedrop is working again&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Project Veritas founder wants to sue Twitter for defamation over recent suspension</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="American Conservative Union Holds Annual Conference In Florida" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8j29m1O4oGT13neoHkFYljYODpU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69136837/1304268713.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="v9mvIN"&gt;James O’Keefe, a conservative activist and founder of Project Veritas, should be able to take a break from Twitter after the company suspended his account for allegedly making fake Twitter accounts. O’Keefe has denied the claim and says he plans to sue Twitter over the suspension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="31ce9U"&gt;Twitter &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/james-okeefe-professional-person-impersonator-firmly-1846695009"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that O’Keefe was suspended for “misleading others” by “operating fake accounts.” &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/15/business/twitter-james-okeefe.html"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Twitter claims O’Keefe was operating multiple sockpuppet accounts to “artificially amplify or disrupt conversations.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QBKdLn"&gt;O’Keefe and his staff at Project Veritas have a long history of pretending to be someone else and failing to identify themselves as the journalists they claim to be. O’Keefe first came to notoriety &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/02/nyregion/02acorn.html"&gt;after dressing up like a pimp&lt;/a&gt; to secretly record ACORN staff in a series of videos. Then there was the time he and three others dressed as telephone workers and attempted to sneak into a federal building in Louisiana. &lt;a href="https://www.nola.com/news/crime_police/article_99fb784b-b4b1-5571-935b-c325c57d3f6a.html"&gt;They were arrested and pled guilty&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfDcew"&gt;O’Keefe’s latest attempt at journalism was to have a Project Veritas staff member create a fake account on Tinder. &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/04/14/cnn-staffer-tells-project-veritas-network-played-up-covid-19-death-toll-for-ratings/"&gt;As reported&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt;, the staff member pretended to be a nurse on Tinder and went on five dates with Charlie Chester, a technical director at CNN. The Project Veritas staff secretly recorded Chester as he claimed CNN produces “propaganda”. With rare exception, it's considered unethical to fail to identify yourself as a journalist when speaking with others and intending to report on what they say and do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NHKhER"&gt;Twitter isn’t a fan of people using its platform to impersonate others, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LGW10R"&gt;On Telegram, O’Keefe vehemently denied Twitter’s claim and announced his intention to file suit against Twitter for defamation on Monday, April 19. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pnjaban/status/1382903225007837184?s=20"&gt;He reiterated his intention&lt;/a&gt; when he appeared on Sean Hannity’s show alongside attorney Harmeet Dhillon, a former vice chairwoman for the California Republican Party. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FWWlUA"&gt;O’Keefe claims to be battling an oligarchy working to subvert the truth, but he’s also failed to address the profound ethical violations that he and his staff repeatedly perform. While O’Keefe says Twitter defamed him when it alleged he made sockpuppet accounts, he appears to have zero concern over his own staff making fake Tinder accounts to woo the soundboard guy at CNN. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Five little Google Sheets tricks I taught my dad</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/42XNv0crPO2ARaGX0IQxwJTAESw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69136629/vpavic_181102_3068_0053.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MIbUPS"&gt;I was recently working remotely next to my dad, and realized just how many time-saving little Google Sheets shortcuts I take for granted. These aren’t advanced formulas or pivot tables; just simple tricks to save you time if you work with basic organizational spreadsheets. Some of these are old Excel tricks; but some even my &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; colleagues only discovered recently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="srxFAx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easily rearrange rows and columns by dragging from the row number&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XuZ45G"&gt;If you want to reorder a row, you can do it in one step by first clicking on the row number to highlight the row, then clicking and dragging &lt;em&gt;from the row number&lt;/em&gt; to easily slot it wherever you want it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Reorder rows in Google Sheets by dragging from the row number" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JQrbOZ1OlS_R3TgObjvtJuJsTbA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22448443/Easily_reorder_rows_in_Google_Sheets.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Reorder rows in Google Sheets by dragging from the row number&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XPRwKs"&gt;Before learning this trick from my partner, who (full disclosure) was a one-time Google Docs product manager, I am embarrassed to admit that I wasted a lot of time reordering things by first inserting a blank row, then dragging the content to that new space, and finally deleting its old row. Don’t do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YCvOEc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start a new Google Sheet by typing “&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://sheets.new"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sheets.new&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;” into your browser&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBiRqB"&gt;Google owns the top-level domain “.new,” so this also works for &lt;a href="https://docs.new"&gt;docs.new&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://sheets.new"&gt;slides.new&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cal.new"&gt;cal.new&lt;/a&gt;, etc. They &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20932848/google-new-shortcuts-domain-register-websites-spotify"&gt;started letting other websites use the domain&lt;/a&gt; in 2019; so Spotify has &lt;a href="https://playlist.new"&gt;playlist.new&lt;/a&gt;, Medium has &lt;a href="https://story.new"&gt;story.new&lt;/a&gt;, etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7zrIj9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quickly resize columns to fit the content by double clicking between the column headers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xr25Dy"&gt;This is as easy as it sounds — if you want your column width to automatically resize to the shortest or longest entry, just double click in between the column headers. This also works in Excel.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Resize columns in Google Sheets by double clicking between the column headers" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MnzwUExB2x1fCoekB-P3MowcBgU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22448453/Automatically_resize_columns_in_Google_Sheets.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Resize columns in Google Sheets by double clicking between the column headers&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AeKbn6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paste something with clear formatting with Command + Shift + v on Mac or Ctrl + Shift + v on PC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNFFfQ"&gt;I pull data about &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; from a lot of different sources, which all have their own fonts and styling, so this trick comes in handy. By using &lt;strong&gt;Command + Shift + v &lt;/strong&gt;instead of&lt;strong&gt; Command + v &lt;/strong&gt;on Mac or&lt;strong&gt; Ctrl + Shift + v &lt;/strong&gt;instead of&lt;strong&gt; Ctrl + v&lt;/strong&gt; on PC, you can strip the old font and font sizes as you paste and insert clear text. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j_2LFwYqCkCn4e9LNh_-pdjsbgg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22448455/Paste_with_clear_formatting_in_Google_Sheets.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Paste with clear formatting in Google Sheets using Command + Shift + v&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pJgq4q"&gt;You can also paste plain values by double clicking into a cell before you paste, but that’s a little more cumbersome. To clear formatting from multiple cells at once, first highlight them and then use &lt;strong&gt;Command + \ &lt;/strong&gt;on Mac&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;or&lt;strong&gt; Ctrl + \ &lt;/strong&gt;on PC. There are a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; more keyboard shortcuts like this, which Google catalogs &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/181110?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="awo4Ln"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add multiple hyperlinks to one cell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V68djw"&gt;This one’s more of a PSA — for a long time, you could only hyperlink entire cells. My colleague Jay Peters &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21431536/google-sheets-hyperlink-individual-many-multiple-words-cell"&gt;recently discovered&lt;/a&gt; that this is no longer the case; you can now add as many links as your heart desires. Just click into the cell and highlight the word or phrase you want to hyperlink before adding your links.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0NI61y"&gt;Some weeks aren’t so great on the tech deals front. Thankfully, this hasn’t been one of those weeks. Each day, our deals roundups have been full of fresh discounts, like the best-ever price on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08M1N8522?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon’s new Echo Show 10&lt;/a&gt; smart display that can rotate to follow your movements around the room or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1621994-REG%2Flg_27gn800_b_27_qhd_ips_hdr10.html%23donotlink&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F4%2F16%2F22385758%2Famazon-echo-show-10-lg-27-inch-qhd-gaming-monitor-airpods-pro-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$100 off a 27-inch 1440p gaming monitor&lt;/a&gt; from LG. There are a few other deals to look through below, and they’re all good, so I won’t waste much more of your time. But in case you’re looking for a Mother’s Day gift, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22358371/mothers-day-gifts-ideas-best-mom-tech-gadgets"&gt;our gift guide&lt;/a&gt; (which is gorgeous, might I say) is full of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Dn5i0D"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3RCyyd"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; are $197&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="QAn0mg"&gt;Apple’s top-shelf wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, are down to $197 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22149799%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-AirPods-Pro/520468661?irgwc=1&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_XyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVs713WQ-N3A0&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;wmlspartner=imp_482924&amp;amp;clickid=XyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVs713WQ-N3A0&amp;amp;sharedid=verge&amp;amp;affiliates_ad_id=565706&amp;amp;campaign_id=9383&amp;amp;irgwc=1&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_wq02e5wo0xyOWPQwUx0Mo38XUkEXYrwPlxjyx00&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;wmlspartner=imp_482924&amp;amp;clickid=wq02e5wo0xyOWPQwUx0Mo38XUkEXYrwPlxjyx00&amp;amp;sharedid=verge&amp;amp;affiliates_ad_id=565706&amp;amp;campaign_id=9383&amp;amp;sharedid=verge&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22149799%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, over $50 less than the MSRP and about $20 less than typical pricing. Apple is expected to refresh its non-Pro AirPods very soon, but if you’re looking for noise canceling, you’ll want to go with the Pro model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gvr4jS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="MaHW9K"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="18zrrK"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21400695/google-pixel-buds-2-2020-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review"&gt;Google Pixel Buds&lt;/a&gt; are $50 off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qXS8kG"&gt;If Google’s Pixel Buds are more your speed, they are available for $129 from several retailers, down from the usual price of $179. Any discount on the Pixel Buds is rare — this is one of the biggest we’ve ever seen. The Pixel Buds don’t have active noise cancelation, but they do offer hands-free Google Assistant access and easy pairing with an Android phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YGCM8B"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502839"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="yDZsb1"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AC3jNK"&gt;LG’s 27-inch 1440p gaming monitor is a great value for $297&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LNyXqe"&gt;Normally around $400, LG’s UltraGear 27-inch gaming monitor that has 1440p resolution, G-Sync compatibility, and a 144Hz refresh rate is just over $100 off its usual price at Amazon and B&amp;amp;H Photo. If you have a gaming PC or console and want to step up to QHD, this monitor should be a good fit for you — and it costs far less than usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kkT74u"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10429642"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="7tU1nD"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jes7o0"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review"&gt;Amazon’s latest Echo Show 10&lt;/a&gt; smart display is $50 off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="DJVgFW"&gt;You can get the best-ever price on Amazon’s new Echo Show 10. What’s special about this one compared to previous generations is its motorized base, which allows its screen to rotate and follow your movements to stay in view. If you buy it through Amazon, you can get a free Ring smart bulb with the purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9QLwoh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10362085"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="CYGdaE"&gt;
