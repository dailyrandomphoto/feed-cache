    <title>SecretLab’s Titan Evo chair claims to offer more comfort, features, and magnets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SecretLab says it has improved both its polyurethane and SoftWeave materials.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: SecretLab&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LvL4d2"&gt;SecretLab’s new line of 2022 gaming chairs have a renewed focus on packing in more features without significantly boosting the price. It’s also making it easier to decide which one to buy. Instead of offering both the Titan and Omega chairs, it’s cramming the best aspects of each into a single model called the Titan Evo. SecretLab told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it’ll  launch the Titan Evo in mid-July starting at about $20 or $30 more than the small-sized Omega chair, which is currently selling for $359.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldoC1b"&gt;The company is offering the Titan Evo in small, regular, and extra-large sizes. And no matter the size you choose, it’ll come with the same new comfort and cosmetic features. It revamped the seat base to offer thigh support, and there’s a new knob on the left side of the chair that tweaks its new and improved “L-ADAPT” lumbar support system. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll be able to detach and magnetically attach different arm rests that you purchase.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tq6lqK"&gt;Following SecretLab’s recent obsession with magnets in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405816/secretlab-first-pc-desk-magnus-metal-magnets-cable-management"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt; desk, the Titan Evo has replaceable magnetic arm rests. You’ll be able to upgrade with more materials in the future, including Technogel. There are more magnets! The pillow that comes with each Titan Evo chair attaches to the chair magnetically. SecretLab emphasized that it was challenging to develop strong magnets in a pillow that didn’t impact its softness, or put wear on the chair over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wc9VEF"&gt;The company is offering the Titan Evo in two new colors available with its hybrid polyurethane (PU) leatherette material: royal and ash, which are a blue and gray color, respectively. SecretLab says it has improved that material, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21401434/secretlab-omega-titan-softweave-black-fabric-gaming-chair"&gt;its SoftWeave weaving technique&lt;/a&gt;, to be more durable. It claims that its PU leatherette is 12 times more durable than standard PU leatherette. Also, it uses a new weaving technique to bring color gradients to what SecretLab is calling SoftWeave Plus fabric, which it claims has a 3.5x improvement in strength.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cryptocurrency traders struggle to sue Binance</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cryptocurrencies Illustrations" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zsQD_nO_jJuKV7xiSxxXHOze-Wc=/157x0:2875x1812/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69571220/1233884318.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by STR/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dSvb6b"&gt;One fun (?) thing about cryptocurrency is that it’s newer than regular money — or as the cryptocurrency enthusiasts call it, fiat — and for this reason it is less regulated. I am going to leave the case against regulation to the libertarians who are interested in making it; instead, let’s direct our attention to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/binance-froze-when-bitcoin-crashed-now-users-want-their-money-back-11626001202?mod=e2tw"&gt;this &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; story about Binance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n1fMRZ"&gt;Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, had a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22388447/robinhood-app-dogecoin-rally-failed-trades"&gt;Robinhood-style&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/9/21171584/robinhood-outage-week-us-stocks-third-market"&gt; oopsie woopsie&lt;/a&gt; during a plunge in Bitcoin value on May 19. Users were locked out of the system, and couldn’t make trades to stop the bleeding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="28k4Ut"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It seems like people are having a bad time!&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="95RTPe"&gt;Now, Robinhood users are suing Robinhood for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/9/21171584/robinhood-outage-week-us-stocks-third-market"&gt;March 2020&lt;/a&gt; outages, but Binance doesn’t have a headquarters — so it seems Binance users are having some difficulty figuring out how to sue. I’m not kidding, here’s how the WSJ phrases it: “But unlike a more traditional investment platform, Binance is largely unregulated and has no headquarters, making it difficult, the traders say, to figure out whom to petition.” There are apparently two groups trying to figure out how to sue this company, one in France working with 700 people and one in Italy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="InIBvs"&gt;This is horrible for the guy who lost more than &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/binance-froze-when-bitcoin-crashed-now-users-want-their-money-back-11626001202"&gt;$70,000 on Binance&lt;/a&gt; but it’s also amazing? [Taps forehead] &lt;em&gt;You can’t sue me if you can’t figure out how to serve me. &lt;/em&gt;Anyway, Binance claims it “took immediate steps to engage with users affected by the outage” and to provide compensation. The compensation, one user told &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal,&lt;/em&gt; turned out to be three free months’ worth of Binance’s VIP platform in exchange for, basically, letting the whole thing go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tW9q1M"&gt;It is maybe here that I should mention that&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-13/binance-probed-by-u-s-as-money-laundering-tax-sleuths-bore-in"&gt; the US Justice Department is investigating Binance&lt;/a&gt; for its role in money laundering and possible tax evasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zKwMoT"&gt;There are a lot of things to get excited about with respect to Binance but for me, personally, it seems like a real-world test case of libertarian values. The company is relatively unregulated — at least, compared to most banks, which is what the exchanges are primarily recapitulating in the cryptocurrency system — and it turns out that means Binance basically can screw its users with total impunity. It seems like people are having a bad time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9a9pn5"&gt;Anyway, I feel sorry for the guy — different guy — who told the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; that he lost $3 million because Binance’s app wouldn’t let him sell his position. Perhaps he will reconsider fiat as an investment vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft did door-to-door router replacements to stop Trickbot malware</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mMlGpjCiIhWNYZKAY9X1o03AGIw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69571210/acastro_180507_1777_microsoft_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qo3mOH"&gt;Microsoft says it’s gone door-to-door replacing routers compromised with the Trickbot malware in Brazil and Latin America, hoping to squash an international hacking group. &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-pentagon-tried-to-take-down-these-hackers-theyre-back?source=articles&amp;amp;via=rss"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Daily Beast&lt;/em&gt; reported the detail&lt;/a&gt; in an article about the group, which is an ongoing target for US Cyber Command as well as information security companies like Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pbG5Ee"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Daily Beast&lt;/em&gt; reports that the hacking ring — also known as Trickbot and based in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, and Suriname — is a persistent presence online. The group uses compromised computers as a massive botnet and runs ransomware attacks and other illegal operations. Trickbot is known to &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/10/trickbot-the-for-hire-botnet-microsoft-attacked-is-scrambling-to-stay-alive/"&gt;hijack routers and internet of things devices&lt;/a&gt; that are often easy to infect without owners realizing it. Eradicating malware from routers can be &lt;a href="https://www.cbtnuggets.com/blog/certifications/security/your-router-is-probably-a-zombie-in-a-botnet"&gt;particularly difficult for users&lt;/a&gt;, making in-person replacement a surprisingly effective tactic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fxPSKW"&gt;Law enforcement agencies and companies have made some recent inroads into tackling Trickbot. The Justice Department &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/5/22520499/justice-department-charges-latvian-helping-to-develop-trickbot-malware-ransomware"&gt;charged a woman&lt;/a&gt; who allegedly helped develop it last month, and Microsoft boasted in 2020 that it had &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/10/20/trickbot-ransomware-disruption-update/"&gt;cut off 94 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the group’s server infrastructure, aiming to prevent any attacks on the US election. But Amy Hogan-Burney, general manager of Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit, told &lt;em&gt;The Daily Beast&lt;/em&gt; that Trickbot remained a “continuing challenge.” That’s where the router replacement comes in — apparently as a partnership with local internet service providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TTlJwM"&gt;Trickbot has been allegedly behind attacks on hospitals, schools, and governments, stealing login credentials and locking computer systems to demand payment. Microsoft’s door-to-door replacement operation is just one piece of the attempts to stop it, but it’s an interesting ground-level tactic in the malware fight.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok parent company ByteDance still holding off on launching IPO</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="ByteDance, parent company of TikTok, may put its IPO on hold indefinitely" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1tUHBVs0gktvxmloWRC6Mcq6nmU=/0x1:5000x3334/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69571103/1232551963.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Omar Marques/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="E7RqSX"&gt;TikTok parent company ByteDance is not planning an initial public offering anytime soon, and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bytedance-shelvedipo-intentions-after-chinese-regulators-warned-about-data-security-11626078000"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; Monday that such plans have been “indefinitely” shelved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p8gCLn"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;reported that ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming made the call to postpone IPO plans in March after meeting with regulators who suggested the company should focus on data security concerns. Beijing-based &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-24/bytedance-hires-xiaomi-executive-as-cfo-while-it-weighs-ipo"&gt;ByteDance hired Shou Zi Chew&lt;/a&gt; as its chief financial officer in late March, which led to conjecture that an IPO may be imminent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N8CIjD"&gt;“We don’t comment on rumors or speculation,” a ByteDance spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; Monday in response to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oTv3lp"&gt;The company has not publicly announced any potential IPO plans, and in response to what it called speculation in the media, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/bytedance-ipo-idUSL4N2MG3DW"&gt;ByteDance said in April&lt;/a&gt; that the company was “not ready at this stage and do not have IPO plans yet.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="nPluwa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"WeChat deleted accounts of student LGBTQ groups in China","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22568597/wechat-lgbt-groups-deleted-accounts-censorship-tencent"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="6VGe38"&gt;Over the past several weeks, China’s regulators have been &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-tech-clampdown-is-spreading-like-wildfire-11622971802?mod=article_inline"&gt;cracking down on the country’s tech companies&lt;/a&gt; with a focus on anti-competitive practices, inconsistent pricing, and how companies and their apps handle users’ data. Earlier this month, Chinese ride-hailing company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/4/22562912/china-regulator-orders-didi-ride-hailing-app-removed"&gt;Didi removed its app&lt;/a&gt; from app stores in the country after the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) accused the company of illegally collecting users’ personal data. Didi &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/30/investing/didi-china-us-ipo-intl-hnk/index.html"&gt;went public on June 30th&lt;/a&gt; in one of the biggest IPO offerings ever of a Chinese company on a US stock exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cc0CdK"&gt;ByteDance and TikTok were among the Chinese companies targeted by the Trump administration via &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/10/21358505/trump-tiktok-wechat-tencent-bytedance-china-ban-executive-order-legal-sanctions-rules"&gt;a series&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215961/trump-executive-order-prohibiting-transactions-eight-chinese-apps-alipay-tencent-qq-wechat-pay"&gt;executive orders&lt;/a&gt; that blocked such apps from US app stores. None of the orders ever took meaningful effect, and in June, President Biden signed an executive order &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525953/biden-tiktok-wechat-trump-bans-revoked-alipay"&gt;revoking the bans&lt;/a&gt;. Biden’s EO also provided a framework for assessing any national security risks that the companies and their apps might present. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use Apple’s Private Relay feature with iCloud Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BJ9c9nReExFghy0D1qAUuly2oT4=/128x0:1073x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69571099/og__ishslgdhhimq.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XNwXJ6"&gt;One of the more interesting new features available with iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey is iCloud Plus, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522998/apple-icloud-plus-subscription-vpn-scurity-wwdc"&gt;Apple’s upgraded iCloud subscription service&lt;/a&gt; that adds a few key privacy features. Chief among those features is Private Relay, a VPN-like service that’s designed to mask your internet traffic on your devices from anyone trying to snoop in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lDxn53"&gt;Here’s how to use it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WR0wae"&gt;To start, you’ll have to be using iOS 15, iPadOS 15, or macOS Monterey and be a subscriber to one of Apple’s iCloud plans. All &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201318"&gt;paid iCloud plans&lt;/a&gt; — including the $0.99-per-month 50GB plan — are eligible, as are shared family iCloud plans or ones purchased through a shared Apple One subscription. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qdgVn7"&gt;Turning on Private Relay is extremely simple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="g9kVyX"&gt;On an iPhone or iPad, head to Settings &amp;gt; Apple ID &amp;gt; iCloud &amp;gt; Private Relay and then toggle on the “Private Relay” switch &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TTeoOd"&gt;On a Mac, head to System Preferences &amp;gt; Apple ID &amp;gt; iCloud, and check the box labeled “Private Relay”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dcwhq_PV63TgieTpsy7OMRDqLsI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22712561/IMG_2946.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The toggle for Private Relay in iOS 15.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iJtHa8bKqvJZ30MYqv9Drcr5GEo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22712565/IMG_2947.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Private Relay limits masking your IP address within your existing country and time zone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D89MqC"&gt;Unlike most VPNs, Private Relay only offers one configurable option: the ability to choose your IP address location. Apple gives you two choices here: you can use your “general IP address” so that websites can still give you approximate location data, or you can choose a broader IP address somewhere in your country and time zone (which offers greater anonymity at the expense of more accurate online content). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xFMDzO"&gt;Notably, though, Private Relay still only lets you navigate the web through your existing (rough) geographic location, so you can’t use it for more popular VPN activities — like streaming Netflix content from a different country or skirting local sports blackout rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vnmLtG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s missing a few major VPN features&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qT2H4x"&gt;Apple says Private Relay is actually more secure than a traditional VPN, noting that traffic is masked twice. When you navigate to a URL in Safari, it’s first sent to Apple, which strips out your identifying IP address information, and then sends it on to a second server — maintained by an as-yet-unidentified third party — to assign a new, temporary IP address. The net result is that neither Apple, the third-party relay company, nor the website can track you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8MYW61"&gt;There are some limitations to Private Relay. To begin, it’ll be unavailable in a number of countries: China, Belarus, Colombia, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkmenistan, Uganda, and the Philippines. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/apples-new-private-relay-feature-will-not-be-available-china-2021-06-07/"&gt;Apple tells &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this is due to regulatory limitations in those countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YthMoV"&gt;In addition, Private Relay only works with Safari — not other web browsers or apps — making it a far more limited option than other VPN services, especially when combined with the fact that it can’t be used for dodging geographic location limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TnDmvA"&gt;But considering Private Relay is included as a free add-on for iCloud subscribers, it’s a nice addition, especially if you’re the kind of user who is more interested in the privacy benefits of a VPN for regular web browsing than more specific VPN use cases. The Safari-only limitation could help push users toward using Apple’s browser over competitors like Chrome or Firefox, too. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LeBron James is coming to Fortnite this week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TATdPs7mC1fpd9IUPNPl5lzwPOA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69571048/LeBron_James_Tune_Squad.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bkWZ9R"&gt;LeBron James is the latest celebrity to enter the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; metaverse. Starting on July 14th, players will be able to purchase two different versions of the NBA star: a regular LeBron with a handful of outfits, and another modeled after his role in the upcoming movie &lt;em&gt;Space Jam: A New Legacy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uLkooR"&gt;The two skins, and their associated accessories, will also be available as part of a bundle. And both will sport the player’s upcoming shoe, the Nike LeBron 19. Even better: one of the optional outfits pays homage to a classic LeBron game day look from 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="T6Xvfx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10648111"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0aqdhB"&gt;Rumors of a LeBron skin have existed since May, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417523/fortnite-party-royale-lebron-james-zion-the-rock-epic-apple"&gt;when some of developer Epic’s plans came out as part of the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial&lt;/a&gt;. Real-world celebrities have increasingly become an important part of the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; universe, including everyone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21065235/ninja-fortnite-skin-announced-stream-tyler-blevins-available-date"&gt;from streamer Tyler “Ninja” Blevins&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;rapper Travis Scott&lt;/a&gt;. More recently, the spotlight has turned to sports, with skins featuring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443608/fortnite-nba-uniform-jerseys"&gt;the uniforms of NBA teams&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22231705/fortnite-soccer-skins-manchester-city-juventus-ac-milan-faze-clan"&gt;professional soccer clubs&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/25/22399880/fortnite-neymar-skin"&gt;stars like Neymar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wo2XJ9"&gt;The same leak that revealed a LeBron skin &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; suggested a skin based on The Rock could be coming to &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, so the celebrity train likely isn’t stopping any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android 12 will let you play games as you’re downloading them</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MNaU-sne2wdELQdP-hgPzXMM_2k=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69571040/VRG_1777_Android_12_002.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wtuR7x"&gt;Google is announcing a big new feature for its upcoming Android 12 update on Monday: you’ll be able to play games as you’re downloading them. For particularly large games, this could be very useful, as it means you won’t have to wait as long to jump into a game and start playing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ketsu6"&gt;You can get an idea of just how much faster you might be able to hop into a game in the below GIF shared by Google. The difference, at least in this case, is quite noticeable, and Google says it is already “seeing games being ready to open at least 2 times faster.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YgXJsprL7GsPgM9QClLa4_Fdats=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22711564/ezgif_4_9c47602cb947.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bp7DjE"&gt;The feature works with games that use the &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/asset-delivery"&gt;Play Asset Delivery system&lt;/a&gt;. If they do, developers won’t need to do anything to turn the feature on, according to Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v5d5w6"&gt;The news comes as part of the &lt;a href="https://developersonair.withgoogle.com/events/game-dev-summit-2021"&gt;Google for Games Developer Summit 2021&lt;/a&gt;, which runs from July 12th through the 13th. At the event, Google also announced a new game dashboard for Android 12 that gives you easy access to utilities like screen capture and recording. The dashboard will be available on “select devices” later this year, Google says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pexHoq"&gt;Android 12 is also set to bring a bunch of other big changes to Android, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;including a major new design&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SpDzvH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Authenticated brand logos in Gmail will roll out over the coming weeks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yai1whB5paxAA8vaen087siDmn0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69571036/acastro_180424_1777_gmail_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uYkZk0"&gt;Authenticated brand logos in Gmail, a security feature that was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21333886/google-gmail-bimi-logo-authentication-trial-brand-indicators-for-message-identification"&gt;first announced last July&lt;/a&gt;, will be rolling out over the coming weeks, Google announced on Monday. The feature is enabled by the Brand Indicators for Message Identification (&lt;a href="https://bimigroup.org/"&gt;BIMI&lt;/a&gt;) standard, which Google joined the working group for &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/google-joins-authindicators-working-group-and-commits-to-bimi-pilot-300890074.html"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BDf3WE"&gt;The idea is that an organization’s logo will show up in your inbox when they send you an email that’s authenticated &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/2466580?hl=en"&gt;using the DMARC standard&lt;/a&gt; to help reduce the likelihood that you’ll open and act on an email posing as one from a legitimate source. Ideally, the authenticated brand logos will function like a verified badge you might see on social networks that tell you that an account is actually owned and operated by the entity it claims to represent.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/irZdPPqzepb0ebxogN8-ROyDjE0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22712571/Mobile_Default_Camera_Move_B.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="E47pOy"&gt;Here’s how it works behind the scenes, according to Google:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="pogAMb"&gt;Organizations who authenticate their emails using Sender Policy Framework (SPF) or Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM) and deploy DMARC can provide their validated trademarked logos to Google via a Verified Mark Certificate (VMC). BIMI leverages Mark Verifying Authorities, like Certification Authorities, to verify logo ownership and provide proof of verification in a VMC. Once these authenticated emails pass our other anti-abuse checks, Gmail will start displaying the logo in the existing avatar slot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Jnodfj"&gt;Gmail users won’t have to do anything to see the authenticated brand logos, the company says. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft acquires cybersecurity firm RiskIQ as the threat of ransomware intensifies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3KOioh-DAxlLRiQT4HtiFbFwUwo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69570969/acastro_180507_1777_microsoft_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R4l3JY"&gt;Microsoft is officially acquiring RiskIQ, a security software vendor. RiskIQ provides management tools and threat intelligence gathering against a wide range of cyberattacks across Microsoft’s own cloud services, AWS, on-premises servers, and supply chain attacks. While Microsoft hasn’t valued the deal, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-11/microsoft-is-said-to-be-buying-cybersecurity-company-riskiq?sref=rfAB4PXT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that the company is said to be paying more than $500 million for RiskIQ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="waKAKV"&gt;The cloud-based RiskIQ software detects security issues across networks and devices, and the company lists Box, the US Postal Service, BMW, Facebook, and American Express as customers. RiskIQ was originally founded in 2009 and has gradually become an important player in analyzing security threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HoPEUj"&gt;Microsoft hasn’t laid out a detailed plan for how it will integrate RiskIQ into its own security offerings, but it’s bound to utilize RiskIQ’s software across Microsoft 365 Defender, Microsoft Azure Defender, and Microsoft Azure Sentinel eventually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3UUArh"&gt;“RiskIQ has built a strong customer base and community of security professionals who we will continue to support, nurture, and grow,” &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fsecurity%2Fblog%2F2021%2F07%2F12%2Fmicrosoft-to-acquire-riskiq-to-strengthen-cybersecurity-of-digital-transformation-and-hybrid-work%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;says Eric Doerr&lt;/a&gt;, vice president of cloud security at Microsoft. “RiskIQ’s technology and team will be a powerful addition to our security portfolio to best serve our mutual customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRQaeS"&gt;Microsoft has been gradually growing and improving its security tools amid an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22545675/ransomware-cryptocurrency-regulation-hacks"&gt;intense battle with ransomware&lt;/a&gt;. The software maker even &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fsecurity%2Fblog%2F2021%2F06%2F02%2Fmicrosoft-acquires-refirm-labs-to-enhance-iot-security%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;acquired ReFirm Labs last month&lt;/a&gt; to help protect servers and Internet of Things devices from security attacks. The acquisitions come after months of troublesome ransomware attacks. The Russia-linked REvil ransomware group has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22564054/ransomware-revil-kaseya-coop"&gt;wreaking havoc with ransomware&lt;/a&gt; and supply chain attacks in recent weeks, and the security industry is still reeling from a sophisticated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22248631/solarwinds-hack-cybersecurity-us-menn-decoder-podcast"&gt;SolarWinds hack&lt;/a&gt; that breached everything from Microsoft to US government agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Death Stranding: Director’s Cut isn’t a director’s cut, says director Hideo Kojima</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Death Stranding" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-TQoGWOh9q_7C-xiTUxWbc3G9ZY=/300x0:1920x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69570882/DEATH_STRANDING_20200406165104.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fJpU8s"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death Stranding: Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22569182/death-stranding-directors-cut-new-features-release-date-ps5"&gt;coming to the PS5 on September 24th&lt;/a&gt; — but don’t call it a director’s cut, according to director Hideo Kojima (&lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-07-12-kojima-disagrees-with-death-stranding-directors-cut-title"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JGviEl"&gt;“A director’s cut in a movie is an additional edit to a shortened version that was either released reluctantly because the director did not have the right to edit it, or because the running time had to be shortened,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1414442896367915015"&gt;Kojima explained on Twitter this morning&lt;/a&gt;. “In the game, it is not what was cut, but what was additionally produced that was included. Delector’s [sic] Plus? So, in my opinion, I don’t like to call ‘director’s cut’.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Jhmg63"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;2/2&lt;br&gt;In the game, it is not what was cut, but what was additionally produced that was included. Delector's Plus? So, in my opinion, I don't like to call "director's cut".&lt;/p&gt;— HIDEO_KOJIMA (@HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1414442896367915015?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eYxdTB"&gt;Based on Kojima’s tweets, it seems that the new content coming to &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding: Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt; isn’t missions or mechanics that had to be cut out due to time or budget. Kojima’s directorial vision for the game isn’t only now being restored; the PS5 version is just getting new elements that are created specifically for this re-release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GUjzxa"&gt;It’s a misuse of the idea of a director’s cut that Sony has already started to lean on with the recently announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22559264/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-sony-ps4-ps5-sucker-punch-iki-island"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which adds a new island to explore with added story content, characters, armor, and enemies; a long-awaited fix for proper lip-syncing for the game’s Japanese voiceover; and DualSense-specific features like adaptive triggers and haptic feedback. They’re nice additions, but no one at Sony or Sucker Punch seems to be claiming that they’re part of &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima&lt;/em&gt; directors Nate Fox and Jason Connell’s original restored vision. (Neither Fox nor Connell is &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/07/01/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-arrives-on-ps5-and-ps4-consoles-on-august-20/"&gt;even mentioned in the announcement&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="qqUN6T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Ghost of Tsushima is getting an enhanced director’s cut on the PS4 and PS5","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22559264/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-sony-ps4-ps5-sucker-punch-iki-island"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="U9ztsL"&gt;Rather, it seems that Sony is using “director’s cut” as a catch-all phrase for an expanded edition of a game that it’s re-releasing for next-generation consoles with some added DLC. It’s the sort of title that gives the re-releases a veneer of artistic high ground that an “expanded edition” or “game of the year” release doesn’t. Charging an extra $10 or $30 for a PS5 version of a title with a few minor upgrades is a tough sell. But charging that price to play Kojima’s unadulterated vision of &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding &lt;/em&gt;is presumably an easier sell, even if the reality just isn’t the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tn2XKJ"&gt;Of course, contentious director’s cuts are nothing new: consider the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/3/16404444/which-blade-runner-version-to-watch-ridley-scott-theatrical-cut-final"&gt;infamous &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner: Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which was based on a workprint version of the movie but wasn’t actually produced directly by director Ridley Scott. (Scott was able to produce a version of the film with total artistic control in 2007, known as &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner: The Final Cut&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cm1r9B"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
