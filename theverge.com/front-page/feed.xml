    <title>Asus’ pocket-sized Zenfone 8 arrives in the US for $629</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="putYtw"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22431051/asus-zenfone-8-review"&gt;Zenfone 8&lt;/a&gt;, Asus’ well-specced and compact competitor to the iPhone 12 mini, has launched in the US. The company is currently selling two versions of the phone on &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/category/ZF8"&gt;its website&lt;/a&gt;. There’s a model with 128GB of storage which will eventually sell for $629 once its early bird pricing of $599 expires on July 13th, while the other has 256GB of storage and costs $699. Both are equipped with 8GB of RAM and are compatible with AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile’s networks, but not Verizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jrkGR"&gt;We liked the Zenfone 8 when we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22431051/asus-zenfone-8-review"&gt;reviewed it last month&lt;/a&gt;. Its 5.9-inch display makes it a relatively compact device in comparison to the rest of the Android market, and its 120Hz refresh rate and Snapdragon 888 processor mean it feels snappy and responsive to use. Its smaller size means its battery life is only okay, and its camera performance could be better, but those might be acceptable compromises if a compact phone is your priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="att6JM"&gt;Unfortunately, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22430948/asus-zenfone-8-flip-price-specs-availability"&gt;larger Zenfone 8 Flip&lt;/a&gt;, which comes with a flipping camera mechanism that turns its three rear cameras into selfie shooters, isn’t currently planned for a US release. In Europe, the 8 Flip costs €799, compared to €599 for the regular Zenfone 8.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s latest Alexa trick is helping kids read</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KMHMWfolFM35lOWdOYmmGaJF_qE=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69518198/dseifert_201025_4263_0008.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Amazon Echo Dot Kids Edition&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MndFny"&gt;Amazon has announced a new feature for its Kids Plus service on Fire tablets and Echo smart speakers called Reading Sidekick. Designed to help kids improve their reading skills and ability, the Reading Sidekick allows kids to read either physical or digital books along with Alexa by taking turns at reading the books aloud with the digital assistant. The Reading Assistant is included in the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ftu/home"&gt;Kids Plus service&lt;/a&gt; that comes with the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-10-Kids-tablet/dp/B08F5Z2MC2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kids edition Fire tablets&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Echo-Show-5-2nd-Gen-Kids/dp/B08LMSC4WZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo speakers&lt;/a&gt; or as a $2.99 per month ($4.99 without Amazon Prime) or $69 per year ($99 without Prime) subscription plan and is available starting June 29th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QLeKnM"&gt;The Reading Sidekick works with most Alexa-enabled devices, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review"&gt;Echo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21452312/amazon-echo-dot-led-redesign-sphere-features-alexa-price-release-date"&gt;Echo Dot Kids&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/10/16631956/amazon-echo-plus-alexa-smart-home-review"&gt;Echo Plus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review"&gt;Echo Show&lt;/a&gt;. Once the Amazon Kids mode is enabled on the smart speaker or smart display (through the Alexa smartphone app), a child can then say “Alexa, let’s read” to start the Reading Sidekick. They will then be prompted to choose a book, either physical or digital on a Fire tablet or in the Kids Plus app on other devices; opt to read a lot, a little, or take turns; and then begin reading the book. Amazon says that “over 700” books are available in the system now, with more releasing each week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4glTSZ"&gt;Once a book is started, Alexa will listen to the child’s reading and automatically assist with pronunciations or other challenges while reading the book. It will provide encouragement through phrases like “good job!” when a child finishes a book or gets through a particularly tricky section. In the “read a little” mode, it will take the lion’s share of the reading, expecting the child to follow along in the book and then read one page or paragraph every few pages. The “read a lot” mode is the opposite: the child will be expected to read four pages consecutively, with Alexa reading one after that. The “take turns” mode is simple alternation of reading a single page or paragraph between the child and Alexa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6wMolH"&gt;What the Sidekick doesn’t do is follow up with any sort of comprehension questions to see how much the child retained or understood from the book. There’s no test or quiz component; it’s best to think of this as edutainment than a replacement for a proper learning curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KzZDJTiTuyiKLM7RMbqw52BgKus=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22687691/Reading_Sidekick_Echo_Show_Book_Cover.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Reading Sidekick works with both audio-only Echo devices and ones with screens.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/39MnX7hBvaxN0-AEUFCBFDt0vRU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22687687/Reading_Sidekick_Echo_Show_Book_List.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reading Sidekick suggestions on an Amazon Echo Show.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fIiJ2p"&gt;The Reading Sidekick works with both Alexa smart speakers and smart displays, but it won’t show the text of a book on a smart display’s screen, and instead uses that real estate for book recommendations. Alexa can also provide recommendations on a basic Echo speaker, so it’s not necessary to use the Reading Sidekick with a screen. Parents can view the books their kids have been reading on the Kids Plus web dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ji30Qf"&gt;Amazon says that it is also starting to roll out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/10/11/16460120/amazon-echo-multi-user-voice-new-feature"&gt;Alexa Voice Profiles&lt;/a&gt; for Kids this week. This will allow the Echo to recognize the voice of a specific child and then personalize the experience to them, which can be helpful when multiple children are sharing a single Echo device. If the child is speaking to an Echo that doesn’t have the Kids mode enabled and Alexa recognizes their voice, it will switch into Kids mode and provide age-appropriate answers, filter explicit music, limit calls and messages to approved contacts, and limit access to approved skills. Parents will be able to set up to four unique voice profiles for their kids in the Alexa app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="q91TTX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon Echo Show 5 (second gen) review: small screen, small updates","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22529891/amazon-echo-show-5-2nd-gen-alexa-smart-display-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="FJXmsa"&gt;In an interview ahead of today’s announcement, Marissa Mierow, Amazon’s head of Alexa learning and education, said that the Reading Sidekick is “meant to build fluency and a love of reading” within children and that Amazon developed it because of how closely reading skills are related to success in academics and social life after school. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7WpDjN"&gt;The company says it took nearly a year to build this feature, adjusting Alexa’s patience, ability to detect when a child is sounding out a difficult word and understand kids’ pronunciations, and more. Mierow says the company put together an advisory council of teachers, science researchers, and curriculum experts to help guide the development of the service as it was being built. It’s releasing the feature now in a hope that it will help combat the “summer slide” in reading ability that happens when kids are out of school for six to eight weeks between grades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qf457v"&gt;Mierow says the “sweet spot” age range for the Reading Sidekick is six to nine, as the child needs to have some reading ability to follow along with Alexa, even in the most simple modes. Most of the books in the supported library are aimed at these beginning readers, though there are some more advanced books for older kids who want to use the service.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DM3c6Hi0Hw43Ldk3yUKRFM01isg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22687724/Screenshot_20210628_195627_copy.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Reading Sidekick section on Fire tablets for kids shows all of the supported books.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vXVCoq"&gt;I had an opportunity to try out the Reading Sidekick with my six-year-old ahead of today’s announcement. We were able to test reading physical and digital books with Alexa on both a standard Echo Dot with Kids mode enabled and the recently released Echo Show 5 Kids Edition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZhwzWU"&gt;Based on our experience, the ideal setup for Reading Sidekick is a Fire HD Kids tablet (or the Kids Plus app on an iPad or similar device) and an audio-only Echo speaker. Though the Reading Sidekick works with physical books, my child had a hard time keeping up with Alexa as it read, since turning the page requires swifter dexterity than just swiping the screen like they can do with a digital book on a tablet. Additionally, the tablet can access the entire library of books that are compatible with the service, whereas it might be hit-or-miss with the books you have at home. (Though Amazon will highlight physical books in its store that are compatible with the Reading Sidekick.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="13iGlm"&gt;On the Echo Show, the Reading Sidekick app would frequently quit to the homescreen and start displaying a clock or the weather, even though Alexa was still listening to my kid reading. This was confusing for them, as they’d stop reading when they noticed that the screen changed. The recommendations on the screen are also duplicative of the recommendations on the tablet itself, rendering the screen mostly moot — the experience was just better with the speaker-only Echo. Naturally, it works best in a quiet room where Alexa can hear a child’s voice easiest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ewc0k"&gt;The Reading Sidekick crashed in the middle of reading a book on both devices — Alexa would just stop listening to the book and we’d have to start the whole process all over again. We were able to pick up where we left off, but it’s an annoying process and I’m not sure my kid would have been able to figure it out without me there helping them through it. Amazon says this isn’t something it saw during beta testing of the Reading Sidekick, but it’s possible that it’s related to the company expanding availability of the feature from the preview group I was in to the general population of Echo owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FJjWP9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Sidekick did help my child through difficult sections automatically and corrected pronunciations on a handful of words&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="93uuoa"&gt;When the Sidekick was working as expected, it did help my child through sections they were having trouble reading automatically and attempted to correct some of their odd pronunciations. It also rewarded them for finishing a book with a message of encouragement. But once we were done testing the feature, my kid just wanted to play with the apps and games on the Fire tablet and didn’t have much interest in reading more books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TKTA2b"&gt;There are, of course, some immediate concerns with having your kid read with a robot. One is privacy, though if you already have an Echo speaker in your home, this isn’t really any different from that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0nBok9"&gt;The larger concern might be that with the Reading Sidekick, Alexa is taking the traditional place of a parent or teacher in teaching reading. Many parents cherish the time spent teaching their children to read and see it as both a developmental and bonding activity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pbXLVt"&gt;Still, plenty of parents would love their kids to read more than they do and just don’t have the time to devote to it due to the many obligations of modern life. The ability to have their child practice their reading with Alexa to supplement any reading they might do together as a family might be appealing. Unlike a parent, Alexa won’t ever tire of reading the same book over and over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ncql1N"&gt;Parents will have to reckon with their anxieties over privacy and an Amazon-powered robot teaching their child, but they’ll also have to deal with the decently hefty hardware requirements. This service requires at least one Amazon device and a subscription to the Kids Plus service. It really works best when you have both an Echo speaker and a Fire HD tablet (or another tablet with the Kids Plus app), doubling the number of devices you need to buy or already own to get the most out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YXNhqu"&gt;The Reading Sidekick is an example of Amazon figuring out more ways to make Alexa and its artificial intelligence useful in our lives, while of course keeping things within the Amazon ecosystem as much as possible. It’s also unlikely to be the last educational tool given to Alexa: many kids already use the virtual assistant to help with simple mathematics and other trivia questions. It’s not a leap to think that’s where the Alexa learning and education team might be headed next.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram tests letting anyone share a link in stories</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kBa_TpHHPy8XKdh8rzDPXAtrkXw=/84x0:996x608/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69518247/199306424_1004326343706419_871286131944844992_n.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AIwu2A"&gt;Instagram has always limited who can post swipe-up links to their stories, but today, the company is starting a new test that could widen that ability. In this case, however, it isn’t a swipe up that people will be able to offer, but instead a linking sticker. These stickers will operate the same way a swipe-up link does, except with a tap instead of a swipe. People will also be able to respond to stories that include a sticker, which they can’t currently do with stories that have a swipe up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cJLQVA"&gt;For now, the test is small, and Vishal Shah, Instagram’s head of product, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it’s mostly to learn how people might take advantage of links. They’ll be watching for the types of links people post while keeping a particular eye on misinformation and spam. Plus, stickers, he says, fit more into the current way people use the platform, so he says this test “brings links into the same kind of overall system, which from a simplicity of system perspective, also makes a lot of sense.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vSAvDZ"&gt;He adds that link stickers are the eventual goal for Instagram, whether that be for everyone or just people who already have linking privileges. “That is the sort of future system we would like to get to,” he says. “And that’s what we hope to roll out, if we’re able to make this work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pBw4E0"&gt;Links will be limited to stories for now, however. Shah says there’s “no plan” to bring them to the feed or any other part of the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aHdAV6"&gt;This test seems mostly targeted at people who’ve found a voice and reach on the platform, but maybe not to the levels that Instagram requires to gain swipe-up privileges. (Users have to be verified or have at least 10,000 followers.) Activists, for example, have mastered the art of call-to-action posts but haven’t been able to direct people to website resources. This might make that possible. Again, it’s only a small test, so the platform won’t rapidly change overnight, but it might be the start of people web browsing from within the Instagram app more frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="SmW9k2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"The Verge Instagram","description":"Join our 1.4 million followers on Instagram for original photography and video from The Verge","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2KrtHrI"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Razer’s Basilisk Ultimate includes a $50 Steam gift card at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tlLUq_e7DnVgillg93-lOtiGw-A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69518106/akrales_191104_3773_0019.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PT8LeW"&gt;Best Buy is offering an attractive deal on Razer’s Basilisk Ultimate wireless gaming mouse that includes a charging dock. The current price is $40 off, and you’ll get a $50 gift card to Steam for no extra cost. Amazon is selling this mouse for a similar price, but the Steam gift card bundle is exclusive to Best Buy. Perhaps it’s no coincidence that Steam is looped into this deal since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549213/valve-steam-summer-sale-halo-sekiro-hades-horizon-zero-dawn"&gt;its big Summer Sale is happening&lt;/a&gt;, bringing discounts to many digital PC games through July 8th. This $50 could get you several games or pay for all of &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt;, as an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZfPMXK"&gt;Compared to other mice in Razer’s lineup, this one has perhaps the most features. The scrollwheel can tilt for extra inputs, the DPI clutch for your thumb is handy for sniping or making other precise movements, and the resistance of the scrollwheel itself can be tweaked with a dial on the Basilisk Ultimate’s bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yb9zbo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10392735"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="sVLs8s"&gt;
&lt;p id="lJqSyH"&gt;Both Woot and Best Buy are offering solid discounts on Intel’s 9th Gen Core i9-9900K eight-core processor (3.6GHz base clock, 5GHz boost). It costs $310 at &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13142085?sid=verge&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcomputers.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fintel-core-i9-9900k-8-core-processor%3Fref%3Dw_ngh_dd_cp" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1744799110096238949" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; is selling it for $316. It’s not a bad deal for a high-end model that, despite releasing in late 2018, should still be a very solid performer for gaming and other processor-intensive tasks for years to come. When it launched, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/8/17950968/intel-9th-gen-core-chips-2018-desktop-processors-8-core-i9-9900k" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Intel called the i9-9900K the “best gaming processor in the world.”&lt;/a&gt; Plus, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554245/microsoft-windows-11-cpu-intel-7th-gen-amd-zen-1-pc" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s definitely modern enough to meet the requirements&lt;/a&gt; for Windows 11 — murky as those currently are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p5uOvB"&gt;In case you weren’t aware, Intel’s 11th Gen CPUs require newer motherboards that support the LGA 1200 socket size to fit correctly. The 9th Gen processors have an LGA 1151 socket that makes them compatible with &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fp%2Fpl%3FN%3D100007627%2520601304476" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;motherboards that are often more affordable&lt;/a&gt; than ones made to fit Intel’s latest processors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="T5xG42"&gt;Sony’s 55-inch A8H OLED 4K television &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084KQFNBX/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is $1,298 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, down from its original $1,900 price. This model sold for $100 less during Prime Day last week, and it was a very popular deal. But whether you missed out or just decided to hold off, this certainly isn’t a bad deal if now is a better time to buy. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Palm Pre home button was the first to be the last</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l3zOV8whYGjc86JbBpmaliPhGlg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69518062/dbohn_210622_4651_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The original Palm Pre.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="naZwsh"&gt;Physical home buttons are all but extinct on modern smartphones, and the Palm Pre ended them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwC9oK"&gt;It’s not hard to notice that smartphones have steadily shed their buttons throughout the years: keyboards, numpads, call and hang up buttons, directional navigation keys, and more have all fallen to the wayside in favor of more versatile touchscreens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2vucRL"&gt;In 2007, the iPhone — with its then-revolutionary 3.5-inch multitouch display — helped to push that trend along by reducing navigation down to a single home button. But even as touchscreen sizes grew and buttons fell away, the humble home button stubbornly stuck around. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/2/28/18244645/apple-home-button-user-interface-iphone-7-fake"&gt;Apple wouldn’t ditch the button&lt;/a&gt; for over a decade, when the iPhone X arrived in 2017.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qSuMvH"&gt;But it was the Palm Pre, and its largely unnecessary center button, that showed home buttons could be removed for good.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M8Hu0k23dB3Ulpv_sx22hS6AC3M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22687394/dbohn_210622_4651_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pre’s home button (left) and the button-less Pre 2 (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XSwpP4"&gt;The original Pre, launched in 2009, may not have seemed like the harbinger of home button doom. After all, the Pre &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; a home button, at least for its first iteration. But crucially, the Pre’s home button was effectively a vestigial organ — an appendix that evolution hadn’t quite managed to weed out just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tOma6B"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The first device to prove that gesture-based navigation could work&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ptp40g"&gt;Pressing the Pre’s home button did exactly one thing: brought up webOS’s “Card” app switcher, something that could also be accomplished with a swipe gesture. Everything else about the Pre’s navigation was focused instead on the touch-sensitive area around the button. Gestures were used to return home, go back a screen, pull up a dock of favorite apps, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ODSrpW"&gt;The home button itself served more as training wheels for users used to seeing one on other touchscreen devices, rather than a necessary part of the user experience, one that was wholly optional to the actual function of the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wmxlaN"&gt;It’s no wonder that just a year later the Pre 2 would go on to skip the nearly useless button entirely in favor of an illuminated LED strip for gestures. That familiar-looking white pillbox has been aped by the modern iterations of both iOS and Android for multitasking gestures. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l1BGztDEjtgjW8jLrUt6LGbni7A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22687393/dbohn_210622_4651_0002.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="T5dhxV"&gt;There were, of course, issues with Palm’s implementation: some of the gestures were unintuitive, and for users making the jump from a more traditional Palm device, there were a lot of new concepts that had to be learned from scratch. Conversely, more modern smartphones benefit from the advantage of users who are far more familiar with touchscreen interfaces, along with far more real estate to make those gestures work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7iG3NY"&gt;But while the Pre would ultimately fail, it still stands out in history as arguably the device with the ultimate home button in the history of smartphones — and as the first device to prove that gesture-based navigation could actually succeed in replacing home buttons. And taking a look at any popular smartphone in 2021, it’s clear that at least in that regard, Palm was way ahead of the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hSUc2W"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNF1f5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Pavilion Aero 13 is HP’s lightest consumer laptop ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The HP Pavilion Aero 13 open on a desk. The screen displays a large wave. To the right is a cup of pencils, pens, and scissors. Above is a shelf with notebooks and a protractor." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aQTqa8274Grly41vMQOz5RWJAeE=/0x298:1000x965/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69517882/HP_Pavilion_Aero_13_Laptop_PC_NaturalSilver.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the HP Pavilion Aero 13.&lt;/em&gt; | HP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xk5yit"&gt;HP has announced the Pavilion Aero 13, the lightest consumer laptop yet. It has a maximum weight of 2.18 pounds (0.987 kg), making it one of the most portable laptops you can buy of any type or size. It’s also powered by AMD’s Ryzen 5000 mobile processors, up to a Ryzen 7 5800U. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pl8jF0"&gt;On the outside, the Aero is available in four colors: pale rose gold, warm gold, ceramic white, and natural silver. Weight isn’t the only thing getting slimmed down, as this is the first Pavilion with a 90 percent screen-to-body ratio. The Pavilion has traditionally been HP’s budget line, with a bigger and clunkier design than the company’s pricier lines, but HP has been shrinking the bezels and chassis footprints on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276459/hps-pavilion-x360-convertible-laptops-streaming"&gt;a number of its models&lt;/a&gt; this year. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The HP Pavilion Aero 13 closed on a red background. To the right is a pair of pink sunglasses." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PwnT_swd6bB21J2MOSvPfxnKyJg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22686896/HP_Pavilion_Aero_13_Laptop_PC_NaturalSilver_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screen will reach 400 nits of brightness.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QFGxre"&gt;It’s not surprising that this product will be AMD-only. The latest Ryzen generation has been running more efficiently than competing Intel chips across the board. Since they require less heavy-duty cooling to run well, the 5000 generation has enabled manufacturers to put out impressively thin and light systems this year. Razer was able to release its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22548663/razer-blade-14-review-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-9-5900hx-nvidia-rtx-3070"&gt;thinnest and lightest Blade laptop ever&lt;/a&gt; with AMD’s Ryzen 9 5900HX inside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i95U4P"&gt;Ryzen chips are also a reasonable fit for the Pavilion line, since many have been priced lower than comparable 11th Gen Intel chips recently. While AMD systems have been making their way into higher-priced tiers over the past few years, price is still one of the primary areas where they’re competitive. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22538867/asus-zenbook-13-oled-review-amd-ryzen-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus’ Ryzen-powered Zenbook 13 OLED&lt;/a&gt; has made a statement as one of the most affordable OLED systems currently on the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EYFIGD"&gt;The Aero 13 OLED will be available in July for a starting price of $749. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PY3fJn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0z65Hs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony acquires Returnal developer Housemarque, hints Bluepoint is next</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AJdqfSWyHBXnI_APN54LNuUKy4o=/85x0:1003x612/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69517791/Welcome_Housemarque_210628_scaled.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4SQN47"&gt;Sony has acquired Housemarque, the Finnish studio behind recent PS5 exclusive &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/06/29/welcoming-housemarque-to-the-playstation-studios-family/"&gt;the company announced today&lt;/a&gt;. It was announced &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nibellion/status/1409822833631502338?s=21"&gt;with a tweet&lt;/a&gt; which suggests Sony might also be about to acquire Bluepoint Games, the studio behind the recent &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt; remaster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o40aks"&gt;In a blog post announcing the acquisition, PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst said that the studio “is one with incredible vision, capable of creating memorable new games that resonate with our community.” Although Housemarque has produced games across multiple platforms including PC, iOS, and the Xbox 360, the majority of its recent titles have been exclusive to Sony’s platforms. Prior to &lt;em&gt;Returnal &lt;/em&gt;it was best known for the &lt;em&gt;Super Stardust &lt;/em&gt;games, which have appeared on the PS3, PS4, and PSP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="E59MNw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Thrilled to announce &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Housemarque?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Housemarque&lt;/a&gt; has officially joined PlayStation Studios! The extremely talented studio with a proven track record and best-in-class gameplay has a bright future and we couldn’t be more excited to be part of it! &lt;a href="https://t.co/B47YlfmgCs"&gt;pic.twitter.com/B47YlfmgCs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Hermen Hulst (@hermenhulst) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hermenhulst/status/1409818077349306374?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CJKty3"&gt;In a statement, Housemarque’s co-founder and managing director Ilari Kuittinen welcomed the acquisition, saying that it “gives our studio a clear future and a stable opportunity to continue delivering on gameplay centric approaches, while still experimenting with new methods of narrative delivery and pushing the boundaries of this modern artform.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Uqbhcw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;..so apparently PlayStation Japan uploaded the wrong image with their first tweet on Housemarque's acquisition, and it actually mentions a Bluepoint acquisition &lt;a href="https://t.co/yQBHtLbG5c"&gt;pic.twitter.com/yQBHtLbG5c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Nibel (@Nibellion) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Nibellion/status/1409822833631502338?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CHKdhl"&gt;News of the Housemarque acquisition arrived alongside a tweeted image that suggests Sony is about to acquire another studio. It appears that when Sony’s PlayStation Japan Twitter account tried to tweet about the Housemarque acquisition, it accidentally used a promotional image announcing an acquisition of Bluepoint Games instead. The high quality of the image suggests it’s official but premature. The original tweet and image have since been pulled, but &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Nibellion/status/1409822833631502338"&gt;Twitter user Nibel&lt;/a&gt; has verified via TweetDeck that the image came from the official PlayStation Japan account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fSq44d"&gt;Bluepoint Games is another studio with a long history of collaborations with Sony. As well as the recent &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt; remaster, it’s also remastered other PlayStation titles like &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Colossus&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; trilogy, and &lt;em&gt;Flower&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x739OV"&gt;Sony’s acquisition(s) comes as its main console rival, Microsoft, has been on a spending spree of its own. In recent years the Xbox manufacturer has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22319124/microsoft-bethesda-acquisition-complete-finalized"&gt;acquired Bethesda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/10/17446914/microsoft-studios-the-initiative-undead-labs-playground-games-ninja-theory-compulsion-games-xbox-e3"&gt;Ninja Theory, Playground Games&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/9/18658920/microsoft-acquires-double-fine-psychonauts-e3-2019"&gt;Double Fine&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/10/18082922/microsoft-xbox-inxile-obsidian-entertainment-studio-acquisition"&gt;Obsidian Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;. Acquisitions like these are important for filling Microsoft’s and Sony’s consoles with exclusive games to entice would-be buyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FySpK2"&gt;However, in an &lt;a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/housemarque-sony-playstation-acquisition"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;GQ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Hulst denied that Sony is in an “arms race” with Microsoft. “I’m always looking for people that have a similar set of values, similar creative ambitions and work very well with our team that we can further invest in and help grow as creators,” Hulst said, “It’s not like we’re going around and just making random acquisitions.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dell’s versatile UltraSharp 4K webcam uses AI to keep you in the frame</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oQG3mCMs6JjEWjaENsSJ3h-o_IM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69517763/dellultrasharphero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The UltraSharp shown on its two included mounts.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Dell&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qsr9Lw"&gt;Dell has launched a high-end UltraSharp webcam that costs $199.99 and is available now worldwide. Its cylindrical design is reminiscent of Apple’s old but iconic iSight external webcam, but its features are aimed to compete with Logitech’s Brio and other modern 4K-ready webcams. In addition, it aims to serve as a more affordable and easier-to-set up alternative to mounting a DSLR camera behind your monitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mzfRRQ"&gt;The UltraSharp is a USB-C webcam that houses a Sony STARVIS CMOS 8.3-megapixel sensor. It’s capable of recording or streaming in 4K at 30 or 24 frames per second and in 1080p or 720p at 24, 30, or 60 frames per second. You can tweak the field of view (FOV) between 65 degrees for a close crop, 78 degrees, or 90 degrees for the widest crop available. The webcam has a bevy of auto-light correction features that aim to make your picture look good regardless of your lighting. It supports up to 5x digital zoom and has autofocus. Dell claims the UltraSharp offers the best image quality in its class. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Dell UltraSharp webcam" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jXSJjkk5gQQamRK8CVNjVcjzn10=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22686315/dellwebcam.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Dell&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The USB-C cable can be routed through the monitor mount for easy cable management. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tVCN06"&gt;This webcam can work without drivers on Windows 10 or macOS computers, but many of its features are accessible only in Dell’s Peripheral Manager software. One of the most appealing features that the software unlocks is the AI auto-framing mode that lets it follow your movements to keep you centered in the frame. The webcam doesn’t actually move, but the video feed appeared to pan and deliver smooth, seamless motion tracking during a live demo shown to &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; (The GIF below is an accurate portrayal.) A similar feature has appeared recently in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22429549/amazon-echo-show-8-5-camera-update-price-kids-edition"&gt;Amazon’s new Echo Show smart displays&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;the latest iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s a perk that currently sets Dell’s webcam apart from the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Dell UltraSharp webcam" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ffL0E1_lkOlQpExUrZUtjgvU6n4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22686368/dellultrasharpAI.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFdZZ4"&gt;Other noteworthy features include its infrared sensor that can log you in to your PC via Windows Hello facial recognition. It also has a proximity sensor that, on Dell PCs, can take advantage of the company’s Express Sign-In feature that can log you in and out automatically depending on whether you’re sitting at your PC or not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GxQWA6"&gt;The UltraSharp includes a standard monitor mount as well as a tripod mount. It can connect magnetically to either one. (There’s also a magnetic lens cap included.) The monitor mount seems like it’ll be a solid option for most — even for people who own monitors with the slimmest of bezels. And for streamers or people who are looking for a specific angle, it’s great to have the option to easily put it on a tripod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XPpHYO"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t2WVqBHV10I?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3ajYXn"&gt;But $199.99 isn’t cheap for a webcam, and I haven’t even gotten to its biggest omission: it doesn’t have an internal microphone. Dell said it was focused primarily on optics for this model, so you’ll need to source your own microphone — whether that’s a standalone USB or XLR mic or a headset. That might be a deal-breaker for some, but mic aside, this one’s stacked with enough thoughtful features that might make it worth the price still. We’ll be testing this one, so check back for more in-depth impressions soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nothing&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4IDnYd"&gt;Tech startup Nothing will announce its debut pair of true wireless earbuds, the Nothing Ear (1), at 9AM ET on July 27th, the company’s founder &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/getpeid/status/1409829386308624388"&gt;Carl Pei announced today&lt;/a&gt;. The launch comes around a month later than the June launch window &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22428397/nothing-ear-1-true-wireless-earbuds-launch-carl-pei"&gt;Nothing previously announced&lt;/a&gt;, after Pei &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/getpeid/status/1405911656929054730"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that the company was delaying the launch because it had “a few things left to finalize.” Carl Pei is best known as one of the co-founders of OnePlus, a company he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519785/oneplus-carl-pei-departure"&gt;parted ways with last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KhkhK"&gt;Details about the Nothing Ear (1) are thin, but the company has teased several details about them over the past few months. We know they’ll have a “stripped-down aesthetic” featuring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22320915/nothing-true-wireless-earbuds-teenage-engineering-concept-1"&gt;transparent materials&lt;/a&gt; in their construction, and that they’ve been designed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298802/nothing-teenage-engineering-swedish-design-founding-partner-audio-headphones"&gt;in collaboration with Teenage Engineering&lt;/a&gt;. But Nothing has been far less forthcoming about the earbuds’ tech specs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="inZCMs"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Are you ready for the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SoundOfChange?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#SoundOfChange&lt;/a&gt;? The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nothing?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Nothing&lt;/a&gt; ear (1) Launch Event is on 27 July! &lt;a href="https://t.co/1qZaJaKQvD"&gt;https://t.co/1qZaJaKQvD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Carl Pei (@getpeid) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/getpeid/status/1409829386308624388?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xD70jF"&gt;Wireless earbuds are the first product category that Nothing is planning to tackle, but Carl Pei has talked about moving into more areas over time. In an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22250653/nothing-brand-oneplus-carl-pei-announcement-consumer-technology-smart-devices"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in January, Pei said the company eventually hopes to build up an entire ecosystem of interconnected devices. “The ultimate vision of having everything connected in a seamless way, that can only happen when you have multiple categories of products,” Pei said. &lt;/p&gt;
