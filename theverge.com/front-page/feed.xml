    <title>Chris Pratt can be Mario because they’ve apparently got that whole Italian thing figured out</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yuuN7gL5vr429MeDADYqyf6XAck=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70184768/Screen_Shot_2021_09_23_at_4.14.59_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vjcBj8"&gt;Chris Pratt’s voice as Mario is “phenomenal,” says one of the men who has the most to gain if that’s true. But Pratt likely won’t be putting on Mario’s familiar fake Italian accent for the majority of the film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qGzmgU"&gt;When asked to defend the casting of Chris Pratt (a white American man best known as the &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt;’s Star-Lord) as Mario (a denizen of the Mushroom Kingdom &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Eudb_Tqg8"&gt;previously voiced&lt;/a&gt; by a white American man of French descent attempting to sound like an Italian plumber from Brooklyn at the request of the character’s Japanese creators, just so we’re clear), producer and Illumination CEO Chris Meledandri &lt;a href="https://toofab.com/2021/11/22/mario-producer-chris-meledandri-defends-casting-non-italian-chris-pratt/"&gt;suggested to &lt;em&gt;TooFab&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it’s OK because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="u4myl5"&gt;Meledandri himself is an Italian American.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LmXfz9"&gt;Charlie Day, the actor playing Luigi, “actually comes from Italian heritage,” so they’re covered there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XGktO0"&gt;They’re not going to lean heavily into the “It’s-a-me, Mario!” fake accent in the movie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="sz0X15"&gt;“We cover it in the movie, so you’ll see we definitely nod to that, but that’s not the tenor of the performance throughout the film,” says Meledandri. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="K7MGUr"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;absolutely incredible defence of Chris Pratt Mario by an Illumination exec&lt;a href="https://t.co/HRX6Lll22L"&gt;https://t.co/HRX6Lll22L&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/eLlKmtIoCe"&gt;pic.twitter.com/eLlKmtIoCe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— James Whitbrook (@Jwhitbrook) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Jwhitbrook/status/1463152087307542545?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c2yGhZ"&gt;I’m not quite sure how we got to this point, but I’m enjoying the show! I suppose we’ll just have to wait and see why Pratt got cast as Mario when the movie arrives in December 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBdB7s"&gt;Oh, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/1/22758214/chris-pratt-garfield-movie-mario"&gt;he’s also playing Garfield&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Funko’s new Star Trek NFTs show that resistance is futile</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ks3r8XEkT4UbwRK-ykvZA0f7e2I=/168x0:1590x948/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70184515/Screen_Shot_2021_11_23_at_2.54.42_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zbYvqq"&gt;Funko Pop is teaming up with ViacomCBS for its latest “Digital Pop” NFT collectibles, with a new series of blockchain-based cards featuring classic Star Trek characters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qzRkVT"&gt;Funko’s “Digital Pop” NFTs aren’t a new thing: they’ve been around since July, &lt;a href="https://digital.funko.com/drop/12/star-trek-series-1"&gt;and the new Star Trek ones&lt;/a&gt; are just the latest incarnation. And as is the case with the other Digital Pop sets, certain specific rare NFTs cards will also include a free physical Funko Pop figure too, which is a potentially nice bonus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ndWqV"&gt;But there’s something uniquely depressing about Star Trek NFTs specifically, given the utopian ideals of the Federation and the very intentionally post-scarcity world in which the franchise is set. Thanks to the ubiquity of advanced technology like replicators (gadgets that can instantly materialize any item out of thin air), &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;’s worlds (broadly) don’t revolve around money.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zoc77wGychSoyUJJKUPL26eEBus=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23038192/Screen_Shot_2021_11_23_at_3.05.22_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1GFM8I"&gt;NFTs, on the other hand, are intentionally limited digital items based on environmentally dubious cryptocurrencies that create a false dichotomy of ownership and scarcity for the purpose of attaching an artificially inflated value — or more or less the opposite of the future &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; envisions. The entire concept feels more like the kind of straw man a classic &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; episode would set up, with a moralizing speech about how “greed is bad... in space!” hamfistedly closing out the episode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zcvxUr"&gt;Or, as my colleague Adi Robertson more put it, “Ah yes, &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;, the series that famously explored the concept of ‘What if computer-created items were extremely scarce and induplicable?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FbGmfL"&gt;The new series of 120 digital cards will include various characters &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: The Original Series, &lt;/em&gt;rendered in Funko’s inexplicably popular style, will go on sale on November 30th at 2PM ET. A total of 48,000 packs of cards will be sold, with 36,000 standard packs with five Digital Pop cards going for $9.99, while 12,000 premium packs with 15 cards will set you back $29.99. As with the other Digital Pop NFTs, you’ll have to buy them on the Droppp.io app, using the WAX Blockchain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yDRU2Y"&gt;Resistance is futile. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple sues NSO Group for attacking iPhones with Pegasus spyware</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l-EGsMPxGf0PtaoDncVOe6B8NEA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70183455/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oJFqiU"&gt;Now Apple has followed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20938676/whatsapp-nso-group-spyware-hack-encrypted-chat-lawsuit"&gt;WhatsApp and its parent company Meta&lt;/a&gt; (formerly known as Facebook) in &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/apple-sues-nso-group-to-curb-the-abuse-of-state-sponsored-spyware/"&gt;suing Pegasus spyware maker NSO Group&lt;/a&gt;. Along with promising new information about how NSO Group infected targeted iPhones via a zero-click exploit that researchers later dubbed ForcedEntry, Apple says it’s “seeking a permanent injunction to ban NSO Group from using any Apple software, services, or devices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ck7oLY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple: NSO agreed to the iCloud Terms of Service&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rpQ3TQ"&gt;Senior VP of software engineering Craig Federighi &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761724/apple-craig-federighi-ios-sideloading-web-summit-2021-european-commission-digital-markets-act"&gt;didn’t mention sideloading this time&lt;/a&gt; but says in a statement, “State-sponsored actors like the NSO Group spend millions of dollars on sophisticated surveillance technologies without effective accountability. That needs to change...Apple devices are the most secure consumer hardware on the market — but private companies developing state-sponsored spyware have become even more dangerous.” Apple and WhatsApp aren’t alone in their push against NSO Group in court, as last year, tech companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22194930/microsoft-google-cisco-vmware-internet-association-amicus-brief-nso-group-spyware-whatsapp-facebook"&gt;including Microsoft and Google filed a brief supporting Facebook’s lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tYaPnj"&gt;Pegasus spyware is designed to let governments remotely access a phone’s microphones, cameras, and other data on both iPhones and Androids, according to Apple’s press release. It’s also designed to be able to infect phones without requiring any action from the user and without leaving a trace, according to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22589942/nso-group-pegasus-project-amnesty-investigation-journalists-activists-targeted"&gt;reports that came out earlier&lt;/a&gt; this year from a journalistic coalition called the Pegasus Project and Apple’s complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zuwfvv"&gt;Apple also cites reports that the spyware has been used against journalists, activists, and politicians, despite &lt;a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3912882,00.html"&gt;NSO’s claims&lt;/a&gt; that its governmental clients are forbidden from using the spyware against those sorts of targets. It’s understandable why Apple, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/5/18169781/apple-google-privacy-troll-billboard"&gt;“what happens on your iPhone, stays on your iPhone” company&lt;/a&gt;, would be upset about its devices and services being used to carry out what it calls “human rights abuses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0UK4TH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The lawsuit is a “stake in the ground” for Apple&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hmGje8"&gt;Apple’s senior director of commercial litigation Heather Grenier says in a statement to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/23/technology/apple-nso-group-lawsuit.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the lawsuit is meant to be a “stake in the ground, to send a clear signal” that the company won’t allow its users to suffer “this type of abuse.” Part of Apple’s argument &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/pdfs/Apple_v_NSO_Complaint_112321.pdf"&gt;laid out in the complaint&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) is that NSO violated Apple’s terms of service because the group created “more than one hundred” Apple IDs to help it send data to targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="8cZ79H"&gt;The Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants because, on information and belief, they created more than one hundred Apple IDs to carry out their attacks and also agreed to Apple’s iCloud Terms and Conditions (“iCloud Terms”), including a mandatory and enforceable forum selection and exclusive jurisdiction clause that constitutes express consent to the jurisdiction of this Court&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="znIVpi"&gt;In Apple’s complaint, it breaks down how the attack worked — using the Apple IDs it created, NSO would send data to a target via iMessage (after determining that they were using an iPhone), which was maliciously crafted to turn off the iPhone’s logging. That would then let NSO secretly install the Pegasus spyware and control what was being collected on the phone. Apple says that the specific vulnerability that NSO was using was patched in iOS 14.8, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22672352/apple-spyware-gateway-iphone-software-update-nso-pegasus"&gt;you can read more about here&lt;/a&gt;. The summary is that NSO was sending files that exploited a bug in how iMessage rendered GIFs and PDFs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E62I1t"&gt;Apple says in its press release that, thanks to improvements it’s made to iOS 15 security, it “has not observed any evidence of successful remote attacks against devices running iOS 15 and later versions.” When the Pegasus Project was publishing its reports in July, Amnesty International said that the latest versions of iOS (at the time iOS 14.6) were susceptible to attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K40P9H"&gt;For more information about the reporting done on Pegasus, its capabilities, and its potential targets, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22589942/nso-group-pegasus-project-amnesty-investigation-journalists-activists-targeted"&gt;see our explainer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="nI8lDS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"NSO’s Pegasus spyware: here’s what we know","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22589942/nso-group-pegasus-project-amnesty-investigation-journalists-activists-targeted"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="jMtOKu"&gt;In addition to its lawsuit against NSO, Apple says it’ll be supporting “organizations pursuing cybersurveillance research and advocacy,” both financially and with technical resources. The company says it’ll distribute $10 million (plus any damages it wins from its lawsuit) to groups working on counter-surveillance and pledges in its press release to give free “technical, threat intelligence, and engineering assistance” to Citizen Lab, a group of researchers that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22672352/apple-spyware-gateway-iphone-software-update-nso-pegasus"&gt;were involved with the Pegasus Project&lt;/a&gt; and that helped Apple discover and patch NSO’s exploits. Apple also says it’ll do the same for other organizations “where appropriate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ozzFC"&gt;NSO was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761565/nso-group-pegasus-spyware-entity-list-us-government-human-rights"&gt;recently added to the US Entity List&lt;/a&gt;, which limits the ways American companies can sell or provide their technology to the company. According to &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/11/23/1040509/france-macron-nso-in-crisis-sanctions/"&gt;a report by the MIT Technology Review&lt;/a&gt;, the sanction has been seriously detrimental both to employee morale at NSO Group, and the company’s ability to do business. The report says the company has to request permission from the US government to purchase items like laptops running Windows and iPhones, and that the government has said its default decision would be to turn down those requests.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PlayStation is facing a gender discrimination lawsuit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Sony presents new games for playstation" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/11dSBahxyQ0nolg21h7PclAIHMU=/0x56:5592x3784/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70184178/1040895722.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Henning Kaiser/picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o0jXqW"&gt;PlayStation has been hit with a lawsuit that alleges gender discrimination and wrongful termination, as first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/playstation-lawsuit-alleges-gender-discrimination-6d3b5ef7-b34c-4e45-94e5-f6424983e8a7.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. According to the details of &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21116609-majosony?responsive=1&amp;amp;title=1"&gt;the lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, former IT security analyst Emma Majo is seeking to establish a class action suit to represent other women who might’ve been affected by PlayStation’s alleged gender discrimination. The lawsuit claims that “Sony tolerates and cultivates a work environment that discriminates against female employees,” alleging that women were denied promotions and weren’t paid equally to male workers who held similar positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwyZyG"&gt; This comes less than a week after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787848/playstation-boss-jim-ryan-calls-out-activision-blizzard-staff-memo"&gt;PlayStation boss Jim Ryan sent out an email&lt;/a&gt; to employees condemning Activision Blizzard’s response to reports of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785457/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-ceo-wall-street-journal-wsj-report-allegations"&gt;CEO Bobby Kotick’s alleged abusive behavior and history of harassment&lt;/a&gt; during his 30 years at the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q6ut3k"&gt;In the company-wide notice, Ryan stated that he was “disheartened and frankly stunned to read” that Activision Blizzard “has not done enough to address a deep-seated culture of discrimination and harassment.” He also said that PlayStation doesn’t think Blizzard’s “statements of response properly address the situation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4wjUMb"&gt;The lawsuit against Sony describes Majo’s experience as a female employee at Sony from 2015 to 2021, alleging she was continually denied an answer about how to get a promotion and claims that she was demoted because of her inquiries about it. Majo also claims that she heard managers “make gender-biased comments about female workers” that implied women are more “emotional” and “less professional” than male employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YsDcog"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Majo claims that she was wrongfully terminated “because she is female”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="idXW3b"&gt;Majo submitted a signed statement to Sony that addressed the company’s supposed gender bias in 2021, the suit claims. She got fired “soon after,” allegedly due to the closure of a department that Majo says she didn’t belong to. Instead, Majo argues that she was wrongfully terminated “because she is female and because she spoke up about discrimination against females.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ag7NrF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to Sony with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ConstitutionDAO will shut down after losing bid for Constitution</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IhrOMB9C9XNzcXDNn5Qtwh4Q-30=/0x0:1746x1164/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70184153/constdao.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;One of 13 remaining copies of the Official Edition of the Constitution. | Image: Sotheby’s&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rkbs0O"&gt;The organizers behind ConstitutionDAO have decided to shut the group down after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787993/constitutiondao-crypto-buy-us-constitution-copy-sothebys-ethereum"&gt;raising $47 million in cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22790452/constitutiondao-loses-auction-for-rare-us-constitution-copy-sothebys"&gt;failing to win an auction&lt;/a&gt; for a rare copy of the US Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h36IN2"&gt;Many members of ConstitutionDAO had expressed hope that the group could live on, albeit with some alternative goal given that there are currently no other famous copies of the Constitution at auction. Group leaders initially floated launching a new token for members who wanted to take part in the group’s continuation, called We The People tokens, but later backtracked, saying they should have given it more consideration. It was never made clear what, exactly, the group might focus on if it were to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Z1pGbZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The community has taken all actions that it was organized to accomplish.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1fvdGC"&gt;Now, five days after the auction, group organizers say they’re shutting down ConstitutionDAO for good. “The community has taken all actions that it was organized to accomplish,” Graham Novak, a ConstitutionDAO organizer, wrote in the group’s Discord. The Discord channel will remain operational for the next two weeks, then shift into a read-only mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TX0AQ9"&gt;“We have determined that building and maintaining an ongoing project is not something that we as a core team are able to support, given the technical and administrative requirements of doing it properly,” Novak wrote. He said there will be “no time limit” on claiming refunds for those who contributed Ether for the auction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8YSAXX"&gt;Organizers didn’t say how much money has been returned via refunds yet, but there’s been concern that contributors may get back much less than they put in. Gas fees — the transaction fee you have to pay to accomplish things on the Ethereum network — are fairly high, even for something as basic as sending money to another party. So someone who sent their money to ConstitutionDAO and now requests it back may find themselves with a lot less after paying for the round-trip journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eRrqMy"&gt;Novak calls ConstitutionDAO a “landmark event” that showed the power of “web3.” The group organized rapidly over the course of a week in an attempt to win an early printing of the US Constitution at an auction at Sotheby’s. The group &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791989/citadel-ceo-ken-griffin-won-constitutiondao-sothebys-auction"&gt;ultimately lost to Ken Griffin&lt;/a&gt;, a billionaire hedge fund CEO, who bought the document for $43 million. ConstitutionDAO organizers later said spending more would have left too little money to care for the document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DVasy1"&gt;“It is our sincere hope that this project will spark many others,” Novak writes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Simplisafe Black Friday sale is here</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x1t_1y7RnJow-1Y4EppgJd0xA34=/8x0:851x562/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70184082/Screenshot_2021_11_23_123108.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mb79Fz"&gt;The home security experts at &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeSimplisafeSale112321/https://simplisafe.com/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Simplisafe&lt;/a&gt; are offering big discounts on their home security systems during a Black Friday sale that runs until December 1st. This sale is marking down any new security system by up to 60 percent and will throw in a free indoor camera for your trouble. (If you’re still shopping around, make sure to pay a visit to our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday hub&lt;/a&gt; with ongoing coverage of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;best early Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JPaUwV"&gt;Our own smart home expert, Jennifer Pattison Tuohy, says that “Simplisafe is a good, easy-to-use smart security system that doesn’t rely solely on an app — you can manage the whole system from its keypad. It also has a decent selection of smart home devices to add on to your system, including an excellent door lock and new outdoor camera.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cuzh3Y"&gt;We largely consider Simplisafe products to be a solid value for anyone looking to step up their home security. However, Simplisafe products aren’t compatible with any products outside of their ecosystem and require ongoing subscriptions to continue monitoring. The standard plan costs $15 a month, but if you want to access your system through their mobile app, expect to pay $25 a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="stQAve"&gt;If you’re at a bit of a loss when it comes to home security, Simplisafe has a few pre-fab options for you to consider that we’ve listed below. Just note that the 60 percent discount requires you to sign up for a free month of interactive monitoring. This isn’t a huge deal, as you can cancel after your first month and still reap the benefits. Every system, whether you build your own or use a suggestion from Simplisafe, still gets a free indoor camera.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>High-speed internet could be coming to Antarctica</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Overhead photo showing McMurdo Station in Antarctica" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1eW4h36sPit0HSiA-Ye7CamrBfA=/0x3:7360x4910/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70183859/McMurdo_2.12.13_a_HR.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;McMurdo Station in Antarctica | United States Antarctic Program&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4WGZKV"&gt;On a volcanic rock just off the coast of Antarctica, McMurdo Station is abuzz with scientific research this time of year. Run by the US National Science Foundation, the station sees up to 1,000 visitors in the Antarctic summer from October to February, who travel here to conduct research on topics ranging from climate to ocean science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PCAZXs"&gt;But despite its central role in Antarctic research, McMurdo is lacking something most scientists working at 21st-century laboratories take for granted: high-speed internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eAwdmR"&gt;McMurdo sits on the only continent that doesn’t have a high-speed fiber optic cable connection to the rest of the world. That could soon change, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kJxJ8R"&gt;Earlier this year, the NSF began seriously exploring the possibility of building a fiber optic cable that would travel along the seafloor from Antarctica to neighboring New Zealand or Australia. The idea was first raised a little over a decade ago but lost traction as other projects took priority. If this latest effort to modernize Antarctica’s internet is a success, scientists say it would transform both research and daily life on the frozen continent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l5jIrG"&gt;“It would change the fundamental experience of living in Antarctica,” said Peter Neff, glaciologist and assistant research professor at the University of Minnesota. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i5tBvYRx_hM7W8xDlBrDBygyR60=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23037567/Notional_McMurdo_NZ_Cable_Route_Showing_existing_subsea_cables_11_23_2021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;National Science Foundation&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A proposed high-speed fiber line could connect McMurdo Station to New Zealand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Yu4x9P"&gt;Today, researchers working in Antarctica rely on low-bandwidth satellites to communicate with the outside world. Compared with a typical rural household, the amount of bandwidth available per person at McMurdo is limited, says Patrick Smith, technology development manager at the NSF.  Researchers often have to store their data on hard drives to physically bring back home rather than exporting it for their colleagues to analyze in real time. This creates a bottleneck that slows scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JNsRTl"&gt;In late June, the NSF sponsored a&lt;a href="https://www.pgc.umn.edu/workshops/antarctic-cable/"&gt; three-day workshop&lt;/a&gt; that brought together US and international researchers to discuss the transformative potential of a fiber optic cable to Antarctica, including how it will impact research, education, and the well-being of those who spend time at McMurdo Station. In October, &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ao4Hz6-bBheFMpGSR4nMvSZJ9kHpjj0o/view"&gt;workshop organizers released an extensive report&lt;/a&gt; highlighting key points, potential routes, and how the fiber optic cable could be harnessed to collect additional scientific data in this remote realm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6hS2Q4"&gt;Participants at the conference said daily life and research at McMurdo Station would change in myriad ways if a fiber optic connection became available. Researchers could livestream daily operations instead of relying on archival recorders, weather forecasting could be improved, satellite images could be analyzed in real time, cybersecurity could be advanced, and project participation could be broadened beyond those conducting the research in the field. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kd3w4J"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Having that type of interactivity allows for people to imagine themselves in that situation”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="feJbIz"&gt;In addition to analyzing data more efficiently, the physical presence of the cable could make it possible to collect new kinds of data. For instance, the fibers in the cable could be used to collect seismic data via&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;a new technique called&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-11986-4"&gt;distributed acoustic sensing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt;”&lt;/strong&gt; Sensors could be added to the cable to make continuous observations of temperature and pressure in Antarctica’s Southern Ocean, a key site for understanding how quickly climate change is unfolding. The Southern Ocean is poorly observed, Neff says, and as temperatures rise, such continuous observations in real time could greatly improve scientists’ understanding of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hgciwu"&gt;Beyond the research opportunities, faster internet would make it easier for station visitors to get in touch with their family, their colleagues outside of Antarctica, and the broader public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QX2Bs0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re looking at this as a transformative opportunity”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HheyFc"&gt;“Having that type of interactivity allows for people to imagine themselves in that situation and see what that work is like day to day,” says Antarctic filmmaker Ariel Waldman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mq1Szr"&gt;In 2018, &lt;a href="https://antarcticsun.usap.gov/features/4398"&gt;Waldman traveled&lt;/a&gt; to Antarctica for five weeks to film life under the ice through NSF’s Antarctica Artist and Writers Program. Waldman said that having faster internet will make a big difference for science communication because it will allow communicators to interact with people outside of Antarctica in real time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A5u76R"&gt;Although a high-speed internet connection could offer many benefits, some scientists also worry about how such a change will impact the culture in McMurdo Station. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Ross Island Earth Station antenna being placed" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/01BsPLWDObCFkEfPh507FU6LNGA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23037579/2021Nov16_RIES_dish_placement_2_HR.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;United States Antarctic Program&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ross Island Earth Station, an antenna intended to supply satellite internet to McMurdo next year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sLQkf2"&gt;“Another important conversation is how it would change the way that the community functions,” Neff said. Antarctic research stations are tight-knit communities because of their isolation, Neff explained. Full connectivity could change a lot, including how researchers interact with each other and how focused they are on fieldwork versus events back home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ALla7"&gt;The next step in making Antarctica’s high-speed internet upgrade a reality is a formal desktop and engineering design&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;study that NSF will be conducting with assistance from the Department of Defense. Completing that study, which will include pricing out the cable and related infrastructure, studying the route, and developing a schedule for getting everything installed, is a key milestone. After that, NSF will decide whether to proceed with the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PbGC0r"&gt;“Improving the communications will remove some burdens, make it a lot easier for [people] to be deployed in the field, and extend the experience to folks that couldn’t deploy,” Smith said. “We’re looking at this as a transformative opportunity.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mozilla is ending support for its Firefox password manager sync app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xbiPAZmQwP2QtUFHvyRxsF6DaEQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70183796/acastro_200207_3900_firefox_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YdbjfI"&gt;Mozilla announced last week via a &lt;a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/end-of-support-firefox-lockwise"&gt;support article&lt;/a&gt; that its Firefox Lockwise password manager app will reach end-of-life on December 13th. The final release versions are 1.8.1 (iOS) and 4.0.3 (Android) and will no longer be available to download or reinstall after that date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I2iaUX"&gt;What started in 2018 as a small &lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla-lockwise"&gt;experimental mobile app&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/10/17552242/mozilla-firefox-lockbox-ios-password-manager-experiment"&gt;Lockbox&lt;/a&gt; ended up bringing a way to access saved passwords and perform autofills on iOS, Android, and desktop devices to a small but enthusiastic following of Firefox fans. The app was also later adapted as a Firefox extension. It seemed like it was apt to stick around for the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Three screenshots of the Firefox lockwise app showing features" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R8yAGW30IDQHsR-nYS2qw0CQBVk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23037958/Firefox_lockwise.001.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The login screen for the Lockwise app in iOS advertises Mozilla’s other active products like Mozilla VPN and Firefox Monitor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hjpU78"&gt;The support article recommends that users continue accessing passwords using the native Firefox browsers on desktop and mobile. In an added note on the support site, Mozilla suggests that later in December, the Firefox iOS app will gain the ability to manage Firefox passwords systemwide. The note alludes to Mozilla adopting the features of Lockwise and eventually integrating them into the Firefox browser apps natively on all platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LOJibr"&gt;With many &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363424/mozilla-layoffs-quarter-staff-250-people-new-revenue-focus"&gt;layoffs&lt;/a&gt; last year, it's no surprise Mozilla continues to streamline the projects it keeps on its plate. The company, over the years, took down the team building the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/2/14486812/mozilla-shutting-down-connected-devices-group"&gt;operating system&lt;/a&gt; behind the defunct Firefox phone, shut down its &lt;a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/what-happened-firefox-send"&gt;file transfer tool&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/1/9832148/mozilla-proposes-splitting-off-thunderbird-email-client"&gt;spun off&lt;/a&gt; its Thunderbird email platform.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best early Black Friday laptop deals 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DmgfRt-2sXFIcBDHMsslkFiVs1k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70183676/vpavic_052011_4016_0042.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5aO9CW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday&lt;/a&gt; are often thought of as times to stock up on smaller investments on the cheap, like headphones, games, and other gadgets you may not have wanted to pay full price for. But it’s also a great time to save on big-ticket items, like that laptop you’ve maybe had your eye on. The shopping holidays have brought some seriously good discounts on laptops, whether you’re keen on sticking with Mac, or you want a Windows PC. Both often come in very slim designs, but for people who don’t mind a heavier laptop, we’ve included some gaming laptop picks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UADRPQ"&gt;The kinds of deals you can get on laptops vary depending on the retailer, so that’s how we’ve split up the deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="TflOti"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"},{"title":"The Oculus Quest 2 comes with a free $50 gift card through Saturday","url":"https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/11/21/22789487/oculus-quest-2-vr-headset-50-gift-card-black-friday-promo"},{"title":"Win a mystery bag from The Verge jam-packed with free stuff","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22771977/mystery-bag-sweepstakes-gear-tech-entry-rules-black-friday-2021-holidays"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="TsME5p"&gt;Best Buy’s best laptop deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Ar1B52"&gt;Apple’s MacBook Air with the M1 processor is $150 off at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3RoIuL8ib" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; starting Wednesday, November 24th. This will bring the starting price down to $850 for the base model that has 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="nKDdM8"&gt;Several models of Microsoft’s Surface Go 2 are discounted, but &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3RsGTE97D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;we recommend the 8GB / 128GB model that’s just $399.99&lt;/a&gt;. That’s an impressive $150 discount. Note that you’ll need to purchase a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3Rubet26I" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Type Cover separately&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kRtndY"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3Ru5RcAZc" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The 15.6-inch Samsung Chromebook 4 Plus is just $199&lt;/a&gt;, which is $100 off its usual $299 price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gfEE7I"&gt;Many Surface Pro 7 models are discounted. Our recommended model is the configuration that includes &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3RweJ6ZjV" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage for $699 &lt;/a&gt;($200 off). Note that this Surface also doesn’t include a Type Cover, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3RyIlOumZ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;those run for $129 and up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1MTqnV"&gt;Google’s Pixelbook Go is seeing a slight price drop, and the base configuration below that we recommend is just $599. This is one of the best Chromebooks you can buy, and compared to some others, it has a great typing experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="EzwkqD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10873327"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="87JY8c"&gt;If you want an even better screen than the Pixelbook Go, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3RL8VuWpD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Chromebook that has a vivid 4K touchscreen is just $599&lt;/a&gt;, down $400 from its original $999.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3DKHNg"&gt;Another appealing 4K-equipped laptop, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3RXPQMhUY" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lenovo’s Yoga 9i, is $1,349&lt;/a&gt;, a steep $400 price cut from its original $1,749.99 price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PHTZLk"&gt;Several of Microsoft’s Surface Laptop 4 laptops are discounted by $150, and if you ask us, we recommend the Ryzen-equipped ones over the Intel models. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3R0ueCNkt" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;This model&lt;/a&gt; with an AMD Ryzen 5 processor, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD costs $1,049.99 instead of $1,200.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="69ZUMb"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3R1IXWCwp" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell’s 2021 G15 gaming laptop&lt;/a&gt; with an AMD Ryzen 7 CPU, Nvidia’s RTX 3050 Ti graphics chip, 8GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD costs $879.99, down $270 from its original price. This is a great price for an entry-level gaming laptop, and it also has a 120Hz refresh rate display.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Polestar’s Precept concept becomes Polestar 5 electric sedan</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qA0XDTbxz-kpN_r2sfbNZn2buFM=/269x0:1450x787/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70183497/640858.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7D6CGE"&gt;Polestar teased its gorgeous sedan concept, the Polestar Precept, giving it a new name — Polestar 5 — and a 2024 production date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m5mli6"&gt;The company first revealed the Precept in concept form back in February, with sporty intentions, a software system powered by Google’s Android, and an interior chock-full of sustainable material. This week, Polestar posted a video in which we got the closest look at the new car yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hhLR7q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The company first revealed the Precept in concept form back in February&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hr9wRb"&gt;Polestar, which started out as the performance sub-brand of Volvo, has emerged as one of the more interesting EV companies on the market. The company, which is jointly owned by Volvo and Volvo’s parent company, Geely, recently announced plans to go public by merging with a special acquisition company, or SPAC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mmnv0c"&gt;Polestar has only released two vehicles so far: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/17/16487290/polestar-volvo-hybrid-electric-revealed"&gt;the $155,000 hybrid coupe Polestar 1&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21365032/polestar-2-hands-on-first-drive-electric-android-automotive-photos-range"&gt;all-electric fastback sedan Polestar 2&lt;/a&gt;. The Polestar 3, an electric crossover SUV, is expected to be revealed in late 2021. The fourth vehicle is also expected to be an SUV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MSc2Lv"&gt;The Polestar 5 is a four-door sedan with a hatchback in the rear. The company is calling it “an electric performance 4-door Grand Touring car,” which likely will mean it will compete with other luxury EVs, like the Tesla Model S, Mercedes-Benz EQS, Audi E-tron GT, and Lucid Air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Svd4mS"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GmVsIdWZknA?rel=0&amp;amp;start=3" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nymueh"&gt;Polestar declined to release most of the relevant specs, including price, battery size, range, and motor configuration. For what it’s worth, the Polestar 2 sports a 78kWh battery pack, which enables 291 miles (470 kilometers) of range. The electric motor puts off 408 horsepower, allowing for a 0–60 time in under five seconds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bn31Kv"&gt;When it was first released in concept form, the company laid out the Precept’s environmental bona fides: interior panels and seat backs are made out of “flax-based composites”; seats that have been “3D-knitted from recycled PET [or polyethylene terephthalate] bottles”; bolsters and headrests made from recycled cork vinyl; and carpets made out of reclaimed fishing nets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bsxAc1"&gt;Polestar also has teased a deeper integration of Android Automotive, Google’s native infotainment system, in the Precept. The sedan will recognize the driver as they approach the car and automatically ready their favorite applications and settings. Google Assistant would recognize more languages, including local accents, and be capable of more natural conversations. Polestar also imagines video streaming becoming a bigger component of the in-car experience — while parked or during charging, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
