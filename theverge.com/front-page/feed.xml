    <title>Andy Jassy will become Amazon’s CEO on July 5th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Amazon Web Services Head Andrew Jassy Speaks At The AWS Summit" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CZU304oBOav2JOxI9cphu6TSPso=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69346383/670451728.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q0mEM5"&gt;Andy Jassy will officially become the CEO of Amazon on July 5th, the company announced at a shareholder meeting on Wednesday. The company picked that date because it marks 27 years to the day that Amazon was incorporated, according &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dee_bosa/status/1397604817879674882?s=20"&gt;to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DaveLeeFT/status/1397604693182795776"&gt;reporters&lt;/a&gt; who transcribed remarks from outgoing CEO Jeff Bezos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QYBJaQ"&gt;Amazon announced that Jassy, who currently is CEO of Amazon Web Services (AWS), would replace Bezos as CEO of the entire company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22263039/amazon-new-ceo-jeff-bezos-andy-jassy-executive-chair-board-q3-2021"&gt;in February&lt;/a&gt;. Bezos will become executive chair of Amazon’s board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2B31r1"&gt;“As Exec Chair I will stay engaged in important Amazon initiatives but also have the time and energy I need to focus on the Day 1 Fund, the Bezos Earth Fund, Blue Origin, &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, and my other passions,” Bezos said &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/email-from-jeff-bezos-to-employees?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=1&amp;amp;imprToken=f6bcd4df-67a6-55b3-d4e&amp;amp;tag=curbedcom06-20&amp;amp;linkCode=w50"&gt;in a statement in February&lt;/a&gt;. “I’ve never had more energy, and this isn’t about retiring. I’m super passionate about the impact I think these organizations can have.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VW8geF"&gt;Jassy is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264425/amazon-new-ceo-andy-jassy-replacement-jeff-bezos"&gt;one of the most important executives&lt;/a&gt; in Amazon’s history, having led the hugely successful AWS, the cloud computing technology that underpins Netflix, Spotify, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, and other major services, to astronomical heights. He joined the company in the late ‘90s, and was tasked with exploring what would become AWS around 2003. Since then, it has become a massive revenue-driver for the company — for example, it earned $13.5 billion in revenue &lt;a href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Amazon-Q1-2021-Earnings-Release.pdf"&gt;last quarter&lt;/a&gt;, up from $10.2 billion the year before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="XJKNPf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Meet Andy Jassy, Amazon’s next CEO","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264425/amazon-new-ceo-andy-jassy-replacement-jeff-bezos"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="19VJyy"&gt;Jassy is taking the helm of Amazon at a time of significant change and continued growth. Just this morning, Amazon announced that it would be buying film and TV company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22441644/amazon-mgm-acquisition-prime-video-subscription-service-james-bond"&gt;MGM for $8.45 billion&lt;/a&gt;, giving it a huge set of entertainment assets that could help bolster its Amazon Prime Video offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="olk3au"&gt;But the company’s massive size and market power have also put it in the spotlight for intense scrutiny from all sides. The DC attorney general launched an antitrust suit against Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453125/dc-attorney-general-amazon-antitrust-lawsuit-favored-nation"&gt;on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, and the company was accused of antitrust violations in the EU &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21558119/amazon-european-union-antitrust-charges-competition-commission-margrethe-vestager"&gt;in November&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="geROoO"&gt;And Amazon employees are making increased demands of company leadership, including calling for Bezos and Jassy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453784/amazon-employees-support-palestine-sever-business-contracts"&gt;to support Palestine&lt;/a&gt; and to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453516/amazon-workers-pollution-petition-letter-demand"&gt;stop polluting near communities of color&lt;/a&gt;. The company is also dealing with the aftermath of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22445940/amazon-union-nlrb-hearing-mailbox-bessemer"&gt;a contentious union drive in Bessemer, Alabama&lt;/a&gt;, and although employees voted against forming a union, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union is contesting the results &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22423366/amazon-union-election-appeal-hearing"&gt;in an appeal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uLEy2K"&gt;It seems likely that Jassy as CEO will run the company much like Bezos has, given his long tenure at the company and as a Bezos lieutenant for years. But his experience making AWS the giant it is today seems to indicate that he’s well-suited for the role — now we’ll just have to see what he does when he takes the top job on July 5th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SdOjiY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>BlizzCon 2021 has been canceled</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ac0c6jJuWFHl2Gz8nO9WAR4LhDs=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69346325/D4_Rogue_Campfire.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Diablo IV&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Blizzard&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9qiVQd"&gt;BlizzCon, Blizzard’s annual fan convention, has been canceled this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21271059/blizzcon-2020-canceled-blizzard-entertainment"&gt;like it was last year&lt;/a&gt;. However, the company plans to host a “global event” set for “the early part of next year,” &lt;a href="https://blizzcon.com/en-us/news/23655116"&gt;the company announced on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lGEQ44"&gt;“Building an in-person BlizzCon is an epic and complex affair that takes many months of preparation—not just for us, but also for the many talented production partners, esports pros, hosts, entertainers, artists, and other collaborators we team up with locally and globally to put all of the pieces together,” Saralyn Smith, BlizzCon’s executive producer, said in a statement. “The ongoing complexities and uncertainties of the pandemic have impacted our ability to properly move forward on many of these fronts, and ultimately we’re now past the point where we’d be able to develop the kind of event we’d want to create for you in November.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x8WJyS"&gt;The global event for next year will comprise an online show like the BlizzConline that took place &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22285677/blizzcon-2021-news-trailers-diablo-wow-burning-crusade"&gt;in February&lt;/a&gt; and “smaller in-person gatherings.” The company says it will reveal more about that event in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="SOtYyu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The biggest news and trailers from Blizzcon 2021’s opening keynote","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22285677/blizzcon-2021-news-trailers-diablo-wow-burning-crusade"},{"title":"BlizzConline will bring back Blizzard’s canceled convention as an online show in February","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21449517/blizzconline-blizzcon-blizzard-entertainment-event-convention-19-20-date"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>1Password’s web extension now supports Touch ID, Windows Hello, and dark mode</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Avt2mxiD9j7OJm2-NYfQLEbTXvU=/0x51:1196x848/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69346263/popup_dark.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DBTE5i"&gt;If you use 1Password in your browser, it’s getting a big upgrade: support for biometrics — like Touch ID or Windows Hello (and even some Linux biometrics systems) — dark mode, and a new password-saving and updating UI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SCj5Ct"&gt;The biometric support will require the desktop version of the app to be installed, but the UI updates, along with the list of other improvements featured in &lt;a href="https://releases.1password.com/b5x/stable/#touch-id-windows-hello-and-biometric-unlock"&gt;1Password’s blog post&lt;/a&gt;, should be coming even if you’re browser-only. (This also includes a welcome language change, where the term “Master Password” has been replaced with just “password.”)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/clDnhLw_OTMPYYg-XRuv-IO0Fds=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541148/browser_touch_id_unlock.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: 1Password&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s beautiful.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="I9bcwn"&gt;If you’ve been reading this and thinking, “I’ve had most of these features for a long time,” that could be because you’re a Safari user: &lt;a href="https://support.1password.com/safari/"&gt;1Password for Safari&lt;/a&gt; seems to be a different extension from &lt;a href="https://support.1password.com/getting-started-browser/"&gt;the one that’s compatible with Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Brave&lt;/a&gt;. If you use any of those browsers, this update is bringing some very nice changes, which should automatically appear the next time you launch your browser.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google isn’t ready to turn search into a conversation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/28sNo3-CGC6EqAVlMZdLDhIEBZ4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69346200/dseifert_171008_2042_4560_02.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oOr41H"&gt;The future of search is a conversation — at least, according to Google. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oyVO4J"&gt;It’s a pitch the company has been making for years, and it was the centerpiece of last week’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22435419/google-io-2021-event-recap-biggest-announcements-pixel-android-12-wear-os-workspace"&gt;I/O developer conference&lt;/a&gt;. There, the company demoed two “groundbreaking” AI systems — LaMDA and MUM — that it hopes, one day, to integrate into all its products. To show off its potential, Google had LaMDA &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442328/google-io-2021-ai-language-model-lamda-pluto"&gt;speak &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; the dwarf planet Pluto&lt;/a&gt;, answering questions about the celestial body’s environment and its flyby from the New Horizons probe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wcl7bM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google’s dream is to speak and the machine will answer&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="suIVa3"&gt;As this tech is adopted, users will be able to “talk to Google”: using natural language to retrieve information from the web or their personal archives of messages, calendar appointments, photos, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kdbAft"&gt;This is more than just marketing for Google. The company has evidently been contemplating what would be a major shift to its core product for years. A &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.02274.pdf"&gt;recent research paper&lt;/a&gt; from a quartet of Google engineers titled “Rethinking Search” asks exactly this: is it time to replace “classical” search engines, which provide information by ranking webpages, with AI language models that deliver these answers directly instead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMMNz0"&gt;There are two questions to ask here. First is &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; it be done? After years of slow but definite progress, are computers really ready to understand all the nuances of human speech? And secondly, &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; it be done? What happens to Google if the company leaves classical search behind? Appropriately enough, neither question has a simple answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="dpYt4k"&gt;Can it be done?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="NP7E2x"&gt;There’s no doubt that Google has been pushing a vision of speech-driven search for a long time now. It debuted Google Voice Search in 2011, then upgraded it to Google Now in 2012; launched Assistant in 2016; and in numerous I/Os since, has foregrounded speech-driven, ambient computing, often with demos of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/18/11702284/google-home-io-2016-ai-voice-search-advertisement"&gt;seamless home life orchestrated by Google&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cppgHL"&gt;Despite clear advances, I’d argue that actual utility of this technology falls far short of the demos. Check out the introduction below of Google Home in 2016, for example, where Google promises that the device will soon let users “control things beyond the home, like booking a car, ordering dinner, or sending flowers to mom, and much, much more.” Some of these things are now technically feasible, but I don’t think they’re common: speech has  not proven to be the flexible and faultless interface of our dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xeusUR"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UHJ0uOPs4s0?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="enNSgX"&gt;Everyone will have different experiences, of course, but I find that I only use my voice for very limited tasks. I dictate emails on my computer, set timers on my phone, and play music on my smart speaker. None of these constitute a conversation. They are simple commands, and experience has taught me that if I try anything more complicated, words will fail. Sometimes this is due to not being heard correctly (Siri is atrocious on that score), but often it just makes more sense to tap or type my query into a screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gjbf13"&gt;Watching this year’s I/O demos I was reminded of the hype surrounding self-driving cars, a technology that has so far failed to deliver on its biggest claims (remember Elon Musk promising that a self-driving car would take a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/10/10746020/elon-musk-tesla-autonomous-driving-predictions-summon"&gt;cross country trip in 2018&lt;/a&gt;? It hasn’t happened yet). There are striking parallels between the fields of autonomous driving and speech tech. Both have seen major improvements in recent years thanks to the arrival of new machine learning techniques coupled with abundant data and cheap computation. But both also struggle with the complexity of the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F6CRRi"&gt;In the case of self-driving cars, we’ve created vehicles that don’t perform reliably outside of controlled settings. In good weather, with clear road markings, and on wide streets, self-driving cars work well. But steer them into the real world, with its missing signs, sleet and snow, unpredictable drivers, and they are clearly far from fully autonomous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TeTTkP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The richness and flexibility of language make it one of humanity’s greatest tools and one of computer sciences’ greatest challenges”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VH2e9S"&gt;It’s not hard to see the similarity with speech. The technology can handle simple, direct commands that require the recognition of only a small number of verbs and nouns (think “play music,” “check the weather” and so on) as well as a few basic follow-ups, but throw these systems into the deep waters of conversation and they flounder. As Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai commented at I/O last week: “Language is endlessly complex. We use it to tell stories, crack jokes, and share ideas. [...] The richness and flexibility of language make it one of humanity’s greatest tools and one of computer sciences’ greatest challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hOolEr"&gt;However, there are reasons to think things are different now (for speech anyway). As Google noted at I/O, it’s had tremendous success with a new machine learning architecture known as Transformers, a model that now underpins the world’s most powerful natural language processing (NLP) systems, including OpenAI’s GPT-3 and Google’s BERT. (If you’re looking for an accessible explanation of the underlying tech and why it’s so good at parsing language, I highly recommend &lt;a href="https://daleonai.com/transformers-explained"&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; from Google engineer Dale Markowitz.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BdbQSa"&gt;The arrival of Transformers has created a truly incredible, genuinely awe-inspiring flowering of AI language capabilities. As has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21346343/gpt-3-explainer-openai-examples-errors-agi-potential"&gt;demonstrated&lt;/a&gt; with GPT-3, AI can now generate a seemingly endless variety of text, from poetry to plays, creative fiction to code, and much more, always with surprising ingenuity and verve. They also deliver state-of-the-art results in various speech and linguistic tests and, what’s better, systems scale incredibly well. That means if you pump in more computational power, you get reliable improvements. The supremacy of this paradigm is sometimes known in AI as the “&lt;a href="http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html"&gt;bitter lesson&lt;/a&gt;” and is very good news for companies like Google. After all, they’ve got plenty of compute, and that means there’s lots of road ahead to improve these systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HhAVgi"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Google’s LaMDA AI language demo shows what it’s like to have a chat with Pluto. Yes, the planet. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoogleIO?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GoogleIO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/sC4aSJImr5"&gt;pic.twitter.com/sC4aSJImr5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— The Verge (@verge) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/verge/status/1394711723714793483?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M4lJbl"&gt;Google channeled this excitement at I/O. During a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442328/google-io-2021-ai-language-model-lamda-pluto"&gt;demo of LaMDA&lt;/a&gt;, which has been trained specifically on conversational dialogue, the AI model pretended first to be Pluto, then a paper airplane, answering questions with imagination, fluency, and (mostly) factual accuracy. “Have you ever had any visitors?” a user asked LaMDA-as-Pluto. The AI responded: “Yes I have had some. The most notable was New Horizons, the spacecraft that visited me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kn7N5p"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/s7t4lLgINyo"&gt;demo of MUM&lt;/a&gt;, a multi-modal model that understands not only text but also image and video, had a similar focus on conversation. When the model was asked: “I’ve hiked Mt. Adams and now want to hike Mt. Fuji next fall, what should I do differently to prepare?” it was smart enough to know that the questioner is not only looking to compare mountains, but that “preparation” means finding weather-appropriate gear and relevant terrain training. If this sort of subtlety can transfer into a commercial product — and that’s obviously a huge, skyscraper-sized &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; — then it would be a genuine step forward for speech computing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="7Sw4bz"&gt;Should it be done?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="wrG7nB"&gt;That, though, brings us to the next big question: even if Google &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; turn speech into a conversation, &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; it? I won’t pretend to have a definitive answer to this, but it’s not hard to see big problems ahead if Google goes down this route. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B4WLqI"&gt;First are the technical problems. The biggest is that it’s impossible for Google (or any company) to reliably validate the answers produced by the sort of language AI the company is currently demoing. There’s no way of knowing exactly what these sorts of models have learned or what the source is for any answer they provide. Their training data usually consists of sizable chunks of the internet and, as you’d expect, this includes both reliable data and garbage misinformation. Any response they give could be pulled from anywhere online. This can also lead them to producing output that reflects the sexist, racist, and biased notions embedded in parts of their training data. And these are criticisms that Google itself has seemingly been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22370158/google-ai-ethics-timnit-gebru-margaret-mitchell-firing-reputation"&gt;unwilling to reckon with&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g2Zmu2"&gt;Similarly, although these systems have broad capabilities, and are able to speak on a wide array of topics, their knowledge is ultimately shallow. As Google’s researchers put it in their paper “Rethinking Search,” these systems learn assertions like “the sky is blue,” but not associations or causal relationships. That means that they can easily produce &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21346343/gpt-3-explainer-openai-examples-errors-agi-potential"&gt;bad information&lt;/a&gt; based on their own misunderstanding of how the world works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fk4cmR"&gt;Kevin Lacker, a programmer and former Google search quality engineer, illustrated these sorts of errors in GPT-3 in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21346343/gpt-3-explainer-openai-examples-errors-agi-potential"&gt;this informative blog post&lt;/a&gt;, noting how you can stump the program with common sense questions like “Which is heavier, a toaster or a pencil?” (GPT-3 says: “A pencil”) and “How many eyes does my foot have?” (A: “Your foot has two eyes”). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sRAlSU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;AI language models “do not have a true understanding of the world”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lC6eWp"&gt;To quote Google’s engineers again from “Rethinking Search”: these systems “do not have a true understanding of the world, they are prone to hallucinating, and crucially they are incapable of justifying their utterances by referring to supporting documents in the corpus they were trained over.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AiLwbt"&gt;These issues are amplified by the sort of interface Google is envisioning. Although it’s possible to overcome difficulties with things like sourcing (you can train a model to provide citations, for example, noting the source of each fact it gives), Google imagines every answer being delivered &lt;em&gt;ex cathedra, &lt;/em&gt;as if spoken by Google itself. This potentially creates a burden of trust that doesn’t exist with current search engines, where it’s up to the user to assess the credibility of each source and the context of the information they’re shown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pXSh3Q"&gt;The pitfalls of removing this context is obvious when we look at Google’s “featured snippets” and “knowledge panels” — cards that Google shows at the top of the Google.com search results page in response to specific queries. These panels highlight answers as if they’re authoritative but the problem is they’re often not, an issue that former search engine blogger (and now Google employee) Danny Sullivan dubbed the “&lt;a href="https://searchengineland.com/googles-one-true-answer-problem-featured-snippets-270549"&gt;one true answer&lt;/a&gt;” problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SCVF0i"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VAGOcIyMc5I?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9cvMv1"&gt;These snippets have &lt;a href="https://theoutline.com/post/1192/google-s-featured-snippets-are-worse-than-fake-news"&gt;made headlines&lt;/a&gt; when users discover particularly egregious errors. One example from 2017 involved asking Google “Is Obama planning martial law?” and receiving the answer (cited from a conspiracy news site) that, yes, of course he is (if he was, it didn’t happen). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rtXyDO"&gt;In the demos Google showed at I/O this year of LaMDA and MUM, it seems the company is still leaning toward this “one true answer” format. You ask and the machine answers. In the MUM demo, Google noted that users will also be “given pointers to go deeper on topics,” but it’s clear that the interface the company dreams of is a direct back and forth with Google itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JPY1R8"&gt;This will work for some queries, certainly; for simple demands that are the search equivalent of asking Siri to set a timer on my phone (e.g. asking when was Madonna born, who sang “Lucky Star,” and so on). But for complex problems, like those Google demoed at I/O with MUM, I think they’ll fall short. Tasks like planning holidays, researching medical problems, shopping for big-ticket items, looking for DIY advice, or digging into a favorite hobby, all require personal judgement, rather than computer summary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="B1WO9j"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google’s desire to deliver the “one true answer” could ultimately hurt it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WxrzuH"&gt;The question, then, is will Google be able to resist the lure of offering one true answer? Tech watchers have noted &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/19/google-search-results-monopoly/"&gt;for a while&lt;/a&gt; that the company’s search products have become more Google-centric over time. The company increasingly buries results under ads that are both external (pointing to third-party companies) and internal (directing users to Google services). I think the “talk to Google” paradigm fits this trend. The underlying motivation is the same: it’s about removing intermediaries and serving users directly, presumably because Google believes it’s best positioned to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uf6O5t"&gt;In a way, this is the fulfillment of Google’s corporate mission “to organise the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.” But this approach could also undermine what makes the company’s product such a success in the first place. Google isn’t useful because it tells you what you need to know, it’s useful because it helps you find this information for yourself. Google is the index, not the encyclopedia and it shouldn’t sacrifice search for results. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia teases GeForce RTX 3080 Ti announcement for May 31st</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="nvidia, nvidiastock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z8OUa9Y3BAagQ0BqpTT7uDzGRIo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69345761/DSC00697.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IPFgKC"&gt;Nvidia is teasing a GeForce event for May 31st, the same day the company is rumored to be launching its new GeForce RTX 3080 Ti graphics card. A mysterious 11-second teaser video has appeared on Twitter today, simply revealing a GeForce event for 10PM PT on May 31st, or 1AM ET on June 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qJLZoD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419668/nvidia-rtx-3080-ti-leak-may-launch-rumors"&gt;Recent rumors have suggested&lt;/a&gt; the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti will be revealed alongside the RTX 3070 Ti on May 31st. The RTX 3080 Ti will reportedly include 12GB of GDDR6X memory, a 2GB increase over what’s found on the existing RTX 3080. A wider 384-bit bus is also rumored, matching the RTX 3090 — and an increase to the memory bandwidth over the RTX 3080. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="leiLQg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Get Ready.   &lt;a href="https://t.co/VuDCcKXrry"&gt;pic.twitter.com/VuDCcKXrry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NVIDIA GeForce (@NVIDIAGeForce) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NVIDIAGeForce/status/1397568207448326144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MLEPWe"&gt;The new RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti will undoubtedly include a hash limit for Ethereum cryptocurrency mining. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441847/nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-ethereum-mining-drivers-limit-cryptocurrency"&gt;Nvidia introduced this limit&lt;/a&gt; on newly manufactured RTX 3080 and RTX 3070 cards recently, branding new cards with a “Lite Hash Rate” or “LHR” identifier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3RPeB7"&gt;Leaked specs appear to suggest the RTX 3080 Ti will sit between the RTX 3080 and RTX 3090, offering performance somewhere between the two. Since the RTX 3090 retails (on paper at least) at $1,499, it’s possible we’ll see RTX 3080 Ti pricing at around the $1,000 mark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t22AAA"&gt;Not that retail pricing really matters, as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;street prices of new GPUs are utterly out of control&lt;/a&gt;. A global chip shortage has pushed GPU prices up, and demand is still incredibly high during ongoing supply constraints. Nvidia has already warned these supply issues will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385261/nvidia-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-warning-comments-2021"&gt;continue throughout 2021&lt;/a&gt;, so launching a new RTX 3080 Ti isn’t going to help here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch two whole seconds of the increasingly real Uncharted movie</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yxRqgWBJKfCv3SwkJIQzT_PbGLk=/58x0:1849x1194/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69345755/Screen_Shot_2021_05_26_at_8.37.42_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mark Wahlberg in the &lt;/em&gt;Uncharted&lt;em&gt; movie.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Yox4PV"&gt;After more than a decade in development and several directors, release dates, and scripts, the &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; movie increasingly seems like it may actually, really, for real become a movie we can watch, thanks in part to our first actual footage (via &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Nibellion/status/1397505699308048388"&gt;Twitter user @Nibellion&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3lWQ1x"&gt;The sneak peek is in this &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/TF8MrJPTy7w"&gt;YouTube video from Sony&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/TF8MrJPTy7w?t=92"&gt;timestamped here&lt;/a&gt; if you want to skip right to it). Get excited:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mRSHbk"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TF8MrJPTy7w?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=93&amp;amp;start=93" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xPeF5A"&gt;Did you blink? If so, you might have missed everything that happened. I made a GIF to make sure you can see it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nUnTaHVl-0nKSUtcGnyL17TNTNU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22540946/May_26_2021_08_08_23.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="487EfB"&gt;Okay, so maybe the two whole seconds here aren’t &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; exciting. And disappointingly, none of the footage shows any of the &lt;em&gt;Indiana Jones&lt;/em&gt;-inspired action for which the &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; game series is known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oPX6eZ"&gt;But seeing Tom Holland’s Nathan Drake and Mark Wahlberg’s Sully actually appearing on camera is a promising sign that the &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; movie will really come out after &lt;a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/uncharted-movie-development-hell-a-timeline-of-all/2900-3354/#32"&gt;years in development hell&lt;/a&gt;. And better yet, this is the &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; shred of evidence we’ve seen this week that the movie is real: &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; published &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/24/business/media/video-game-movies-sony-playstation.html"&gt;a new photo&lt;/a&gt; of Holland and Walhberg in a scene together on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dfIOe9"&gt;The movie is currently set to release on February 18th, 2022. Here’s hoping.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Merlin Labs wants to fill the sky with pilotless planes carrying cargo and passengers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QS7HjwJpbi4hws3ch3uufeSCC7k=/42x0:1695x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69345686/Screen_Shot_2021_04_13_at_7.34.34_PM.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RrxerP"&gt;Autonomous flight startup Merlin Labs is coming out of stealth mode to announce that it’s raised $25 million in funding from Google Ventures and First Round Capital. The company has also struck a deal with aviation services contractor &lt;a href="https://www.dynamicaviation.com/"&gt;Dynamic Aviation&lt;/a&gt; to begin putting its pilotless plane technology into commercial operation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oFZg2J"&gt;The two announcements are the first steps toward Merlin Labs’ larger goal of filling the sky with pilotless planes carrying cargo and passengers. As part of its deal with Dynamic, the startup will supply its autonomous flight technology to 55 of the contractor’s King Air aircraft. Merlin is already conducting test flights with the first King Air plane outside its dedicated flight facility at the Mojave Air and Space Port. Merlin Labs is co-located in Boston; Los Angeles; Denver; and Auckland, New Zealand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ObLjz8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“What we’re working on is creating a truly autonomous digital pilot”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4D346B"&gt;“What we’re working on is creating a truly autonomous digital pilot,” Merlin Labs CEO Matt George told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, “either to be able to go and take that airplane and fly it totally unmanned, but then also on larger aircraft to be able to reduce crew. So taking existing aircraft that are already out there, and enabling those aircraft to be able to go fly autonomously.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2Y8Q96"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YZPf_V_vHog?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0zDwgr"&gt;These are not aircraft that are being joy-sticked by a remote operator in some terrestrial office park somewhere, like a Predator drone, George said. Merlin Labs “doesn’t believe in remote piloting...  we fundamentally believe that the vast majority of the autonomy needs to be on the aircraft.” If the aircraft loses signal with the remote operator, then you would have “a huge chunk of metal hurtling through the sky,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tdRQwg"&gt;Merlin envisions the role of its remote pilots as supervisory, monitoring dozens of aircraft in the sky at once, but leaving the vast majority of the tasks, from communication with air traffic control to navigation, to the autonomous software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BSI3dx"&gt;The technology that allows Merlin’s aircraft to fly without a pilot is pretty simple, George says. “The reason that that autonomy up in the air is so much easier is that you have complete vision, at least in the United States, of everything that’s up in the sky, with ground based radar,” he said. Its aircraft use the air traffic control network’s radar system to plot a safe course. And the digital transponders that are required as part of the &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/faqs/"&gt;Federal Aviation Administration’s NextGen&lt;/a&gt; system help the planes understand where there are other aircraft in the sky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="seljAd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Autonomous flight isn’t as outlandish as it may sound&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CXTpL5"&gt;Autonomous flight isn’t as outlandish as it may sound. It’s commonplace for planes to come equipped with autopilot technology. Pilots of large commercial aircraft, for example, will typically handle the take-off and then let the software handle the flying and landing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9RwpsP"&gt;But automation is also becoming increasingly problematic in the world of aviation. In 2016, the Department of Transportation’s Inspector General &lt;a href="https://www.oig.dot.gov/sites/default/files/FAA%20Flight%20Decek%20Automation_Final%20Report%5E1-7-16.pdf"&gt;released a damning report&lt;/a&gt; calling out the FAA for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/12/10756640/faa-airline-pilot-automation-inspector-general-report"&gt;failing to ensure pilots receive enough training&lt;/a&gt; in manual flying. In fact, commercial pilots may be relying so much on automation that they lack the skills to take over when the system fails, the IG concluded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gq8kKu"&gt;This came up again with the fatal crashes of two Boeing 737 Max jets in 2018 and 2019. US &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/13/18263751/boeing-737-max-8-pilot-complaint-autopilot-mcas"&gt;pilots complained&lt;/a&gt; that they weren’t being properly trained to handle all of the Max aircraft’s many automated features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9kMuAe"&gt;This is where you run into problems, George said. “When you have a human sort of in control and the machine sort of in control is where you get really bad stuff,” he said. Echoing his counterparts in the world of autonomous vehicles, George said he believes that full autonomy is the only way to ensure these systems are as safe as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MV9AmV"&gt;Unlike other companies in the autonomous flight space, like Xwing or Reliable Robotics, Merlin isn’t seeking to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/10/18657150/autonomous-cargo-drones-delivery-boeing-aircraft-faa-regulation"&gt;become its own cargo carrier&lt;/a&gt;, which would require obtaining a Part 135 air carrier certificate from the FAA. Merlin is working to certify its technology with the agency, but it would rather license its technology to preexisting cargo carriers than seek to supplant them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4qdfKr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“When you have a human sort of in control and the machine sort of in control is where you get really bad stuff”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wgxn7G"&gt;“We’re partnering with a bunch of Port 135 operators around the country,” George said. “But we’re gonna focus on what we do well, which is not figuring out how to run an airline, you know, which is pretty difficult.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kaDZsX"&gt;George has experience in the transportation startup world, having run the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/1/15501764/bridj-on-demand-bus-startup-fail-ford"&gt;on-demand bus service Bridj&lt;/a&gt; for several years. The company shut down in 2017 after having failed to land a major deal with an unnamed car company. Working with automakers like Ford provided him with a close look at the race to deploy autonomous vehicles. And that got him thinking about where autonomy would work best. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7ACN9"&gt;“Where is autonomy going to take effect first?” he asked. “Is he going to be on the ground? Or is autonomy actually much easier in the air, where we know where everything is?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="blHbh1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FBrjw3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="X6gjOu"&gt;Google has made a deal for access to patient records from HCA, which which &lt;a href="https://investor.hcahealthcare.com/news/news-details/2021/HCA-Healthcare-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Results/default.aspx"&gt;operates 181 hospitals&lt;/a&gt; and more than 2,000 healthcare sites in 21 states, so the tech company can develop healthcare algorithms, &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-strikes-deal-with-hospital-chain-to-develop-healthcare-algorithms-11622030401"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGoAsz"&gt;Google will store anonymized data from patient health records and internet-connected medical devices. That data will be used to build programs that could inform medical decisions made by doctors. The deal is described as “multiyear” by the &lt;em&gt;WSJ, &lt;/em&gt;without specifying how many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wAFLzj"&gt;As health records moved online over the past few years, hospitals and tech companies jumped at opportunities to take advantage of the glut of digitized medical information collected at each doctor’s visit. Microsoft and Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/hospitals-give-tech-giants-access-to-detailed-medical-records-11579516200?mod=article_inline"&gt;also have deals&lt;/a&gt; with hospitals to analyze their patient information. Google previously partnered with healthcare system Ascension to gather patient records in a secretive project &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/11/20959771/google-health-records-project-nightingale-privacy-ascension"&gt;called “Project Nightingale.”&lt;/a&gt; The company was criticized for starting in on the project without disclosing the work to patients and doctors. HCA is a major win for Google, since &lt;a href="https://hcahealthcare.com/util/forms/press-kit/HCA-presskit-fact-sheet-a.pdf"&gt;its facilities handle 5 percent of the hospital services provided in the US&lt;/a&gt; — around 30 million patient interactions each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="19J7ng"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We want to push the boundaries of what the clinician can do in real time with data”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AiSNXl"&gt;Along with using that data to develop algorithms, Google could also build healthcare tools independently and then pass them off to HCA to test on its own. “We want to push the boundaries of what the clinician can do in real time with data,” Chris Sakalosky, managing director of healthcare and life sciences at Google Cloud, told &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mnQUhk"&gt;Healthcare privacy laws in the US allow hospitals to share information with contractors and allow researchers to &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/special-topics/research/index.html"&gt;analyze patient data&lt;/a&gt; without express permission from those patients. Healthcare companies can use that information in any way they see fit, including to boost profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QTdba4"&gt;HCA made $3.75 billion in profits during 2020, despite the COVID-19 pandemic. National Nurses United &lt;a href="https://www.nationalnursesunited.org/press/hca-safety-cuts-huge-profits-amid-pandemic"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in February that the company prioritized income over patient and staff safety. Nurses reported staff shortages and cutbacks on personal protective equipment. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford is making an electric Explorer, boosts EV investment by $8 billion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c6qA6s5pBbH4rlQS0ZeGgxDMGLs=/905x0:6220x3543/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69345598/All_New_Ford_E_Transit_09.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ford&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sPMEFK"&gt;Ford will spend $30 billion on electric vehicles by 2025, and says 40 percent of its global fleet will be all-electric by 2030. The company is working on an all-electric versions of its Explorer and Lincoln Aviator SUVs. And it’s developing two new electric vehicle platforms: one that will power full-size pickup trucks, and one that can easily flex between all- and rear-wheel drive to fit multiple vehicle types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JlW9we"&gt;The company had previously committed $22 billion to EVs and had announced a goal to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287284/ford-electric-vehicles-ev-europe-2030"&gt;all-electric in Europe by 2030&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2dAvl"&gt;Ford is also creating a standalone business for its commercial vehicle division called Ford Pro. The company hopes that by offering more dedicated services to these customers, it can build on what is already a dominant position, as it makes up 43 percent of the commercial truck and van market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V6h7iD"&gt;This barrage of announcements is part of a new business plan Ford has rolled out called Ford Plus, which the company says is all about creating “close, enduring customer relationships” that last beyond the purchase of a vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ES3u1e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A new focus on “close, enduring customer relationships”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zw14Ig"&gt;To do that, Ford spent a good chunk of time during an investor event on Wednesday talking about how it plans to make sure its future vehicles are fully networked, something it wants to do quickly. At one point, CEO Jim Farley said Ford plans to have more vehicles capable of being updated by over-the-air software updates than Tesla by mid-2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NU4b4J"&gt;Better-connected cars would let Ford offer things like more convenient mobile service, which could entice more customers to turn to the automaker when their cars need something fixed, for example. Connected services are also a big part of the plan for Ford’s commercial vehicle division. The company says it already has 160,000 customers that pay subscription fees for the advanced version of its fleet telematics offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7s5Qmj"&gt;“We are reinventing our customer experience,” Alex Purdy, who runs Ford’s connectivity team, said during the event. “The path to winning [market share] requires daily interaction” with customers, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9DOPp"&gt;“I cannot overstate the magnitude of the shift taking place at Ford,” Purdy said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xwElii"&gt;Ford Plus is yet another attempt to rethink Ford’s overall business, something the century-old automaker has spent a lot of time doing over the last few years. Its previous CEO, Jim Hackett, led &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21353950/ford-ceo-jim-hackett-retiring-replaced-restructuring"&gt;a major restructuring at the company in 2017&lt;/a&gt; that led to decisions like Ford shutting down its manufacturing efforts in Brazil and partnering with Volkswagen on autonomous, electric, and commercial vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UNXewu"&gt;The moves Hackett made are starting to pay off. Despite some early hiccups, the Mustang Mach-E is off to a strong start. Ford says 80 percent of customers are opting for the more expensive extended range battery versions, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22408369/ford-mustang-mach-e-new-customers"&gt;70 percent overall are new to the brand&lt;/a&gt;. And on Wednesday, Ford shared that it has collected 70,000 deposits for the all-electric &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22442777/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-truck-specs-price"&gt;F-150 Lightning&lt;/a&gt; announced last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HfUk4q"&gt;Ford Plus, then, is meant to build on that momentum. In addition to the aforementioned announcements, Ford also spent time Wednesday talking about how it plans to make its own battery packs in the US with South Korean manufacturer SK Innovation — a deal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445688/ford-sk-innovation-ev-battery-production-joint-venture"&gt;it announced last week&lt;/a&gt;. The company will brand the lithium-ion packs for passenger vehicles as “IonBoost,” in a nod to its efficient EcoBoost engines. Lithium iron phosphate battery packs for commercial vehicles will be called IonBoost Pro. Ford is also developing solid state batteries and believes they will be ready by the end of the decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KEKXFm"&gt;Ford’s announcements come at a time of great change in the automotive industry. General Motors has said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254116/general-motors-carbon-neutral-vow-2040-tailpipe-emissions-ev"&gt;it hopes to only make zero-emission light duty vehicles by 2035&lt;/a&gt;, and the Ford rival also recently spun out its own commercial vehicle (and vehicle services) business &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225394/gm-brightdrop-electric-delivery-ep1-ev600-ces-2021"&gt;called BrightDrop&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PnpWPY"&gt;“This is our biggest opportunity for growth and value creation since Henry Ford started to scale the Model T,” Farley said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lockheed Martin and GM are working on an electric Moon buggy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gpPNqMddHRWIs31InlFeIzOEnCc=/466x0:5485x3346/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69345528/LM_GM_Lunar_Vehicles_teaser_2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A company illustration shows astronauts staring at a fleet of conceptual lunar rovers.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Lockheed Martin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VpdfPC"&gt;Lockheed Martin and General Motors unveiled plans on Wednesday to build an autonomous buggy-like vehicle that future astronauts can use to zip around the surface of the Moon. The two companies collaborated to pitch a conceptual Lunar Terrain Vehicle to NASA’s Artemis program, a Moon exploration campaign that calls for various robots, vehicles, and scientific bases to be planted on the lunar surface within the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I09IIE"&gt;Ahead of a presentation Wednesday morning, Lockheed and GM said in a joint press release that the vehicle will use the automaker’s autonomous driving technology and is “being designed to traverse significantly farther distances” than Apollo-era buggies. Just like those Moon buggies from the ‘70s, the Lockheed-GM concept will be fully electric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vhwo1p"&gt;The rover is still in early stages of development, so details on its size, weight and range aren’t set in stone yet, Jeff Ryder, GM’s VP of growth and strategy, told reporters in a press conference. It will be “made of very lightweight, strong and resilient materials,” but “exactly what those are is still in formulation,” says Lockheed’s lunar exploration vice president Kirk Shireman. “We want it to be as light and strong and have a long life as it possibly can.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JOYAsOy1W25Xnbej6xeAh-AV5Zk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541187/May_26_2021_12_21_27.gif"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An animated clip showing Lockheed and GM’s concept rover exploring the Moon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eZVWCO"&gt;The rovers “will dramatically extend the range of astronauts as they perform high-priority science investigation on the Moon that will ultimately impact humanity’s understanding of our place in the solar system,” Rick Ambrose, executive vice president of Lockheed’s space unit, said in a statement. NASA’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/13/18622415/nasa-moon-return-first-woman-astronaut-artemis-program"&gt;Artemis program&lt;/a&gt; calls for an initial astronaut Moon landing as soon as 2024 (a goal some say is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22323621/trump-moon-program-artemis-biden-nasa-timeline"&gt;unrealistic&lt;/a&gt;) with follow-up missions to build a sustained presence on the lunar south pole. Those missions will prove and test technologies that can inform future missions to Mars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9IXked"&gt;&lt;q&gt;NASA’s Moon buggy requirements: fully electric, rugged, and autonomous&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TlBqeF"&gt;The heavyweight collaboration between Lockheed and GM came after NASA asked the private sector to come up with ideas for two types of human-rated Moon vehicles: the Lunar Terrain Vehicle (or LTV) and a bigger “Lunar Surface Science Mobility System,” essentially a science lab on wheels. NASA had only a few minimum specifications for LTV concepts, including the capability of driving autonomously on the Moon’s hazardous, crater-laden terrain — a challenging environment for the computer vision technology that powers autonomous driving systems on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z8OMPX"&gt;GM, which is investing $27 billion in its autonomous EV portfolio, plans to put its self-driving technology on the Moon for the first time. “At this point, what we have is a tremendous toolkit, a commercial autonomy baseline that we can work from,” Ryder said. “We’re heads-down right now investigating how we would take those capabilities and apply them to these specific missions and operations associated with the Artemis program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LAHVqk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ideally, it should be a “pickup truck on the Moon, where we can pile as many people in the back as we want”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uD5OCF"&gt;A NASA LTV also needs to be fully electric and capable of recharging itself internally — either from onboard solar arrays or other systems — and externally from infrastructure that can be set up on the Moon, like NASA’s Human Landing System. It should be able to carry at least two fully suited astronauts, including the driver, as well as any cargo for a total haul capacity of 1,102 pounds on a single charge for at least 1.2 miles. How many astronauts will fit on the partnership’s early iterations of Moon buggies is still up in the air, though. “We think, initially, two” astronauts, Shireman said. “One is too few, and more than two might be too many initially.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a3hTyE"&gt;“I look forward to having a pickup truck on the Moon, where we can pile as many people in the back as we want,” he quipped. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C50V1lJUVpzHvlw4iZoYu-kpZuM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22540739/NASA_Apollo_17_Lunar_Roving_Vehicle.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apollo 17 astronaut Eugene Cernan aboard his Lunar Roving Vehicle on the Moon’s bumpy Taurus-Littrow landing site.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IhZkdQ"&gt;The rover also needs to be rugged and capable of withstanding the lunar south pole’s volatile surface temperatures, which can vary between 260 degrees Fahrenheit to negative 280 degrees during the Moon’s nighttime. NASA’s crewed lunar landers are expected to touch down on the flattest parts of the Moon’s surface, far away from the large boulders and shadowed craters that are believed to hold the most scientifically interesting specimens, including ice particles. The more versatile NASA’s lunar rover will be, the more science it can help astronauts conduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5vbDyP"&gt;Lockheed and GM were among the cadre of industry giants that built NASA’s first lunar landing systems and buggies under the Apollo program. GM built the chassis and wheels for the Lunar Roving Vehicles, as they were formally called, on Apollo missions 15 through 17. The rover for Apollo 17, the program’s final Moon mission in 1972, did the most roving: Astronaut Gene Cernan whipped the lightweight electric LRV more than 22 miles total on the Moon, going as far as 4.7 miles away from their lunar module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z1YLhH"&gt;Lockheed and GM said their new concept will travel much farther than the buggies of Apollo. “The result” of the companies’ engineering efforts, a press release said, “may allow astronauts to explore the lunar surface in unprecedented fashion and support discovery in places where humans have never gone before.”&lt;/p&gt;
