    <title>Twitter permanently bans Trump</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Donald J. Trump..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5UtfFFpp7jfX6inoUrkzkGj_tSM=/0x0:5505x3670/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68641193/1223057457.10.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e9BWTi"&gt;Twitter permanently banned President Donald Trump on Friday, days after a pro-Trump mob stormed the US Capitol leaving five dead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5uXIs8"&gt;“After close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence,” Twitter said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1347684877634838528?s=20"&gt;in a statement Friday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="au8oLY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;After close review of recent Tweets from the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@realDonaldTrump&lt;/a&gt; account and the context around them we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence.&lt;a href="https://t.co/CBpE1I6j8Y"&gt;https://t.co/CBpE1I6j8Y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1347684877634838528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nkSCC2"&gt;The ban comes after the president incited a mob that broke into the US Capitol building, disrupting Congress’ certification of Joe Biden as the President Elect. Twitter initially put a 12-hour ban on Trump’s account for “repeated and severe violations of our Civic Integrity policy” after he posted messages repeating lies that the election was stolen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ygTtKY"&gt;At the time, Twitter said Trump would be banned permanently if he continued to violate its rules, including those around civic integrity or violent threats. Twitter said in a statement Friday that two new tweets posted since Trump’s initial suspension violated the platform’s rules, prompting the permanent suspension. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CAzEDjOtMBq8lFfqzrh2uLiV0Mo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22223529/Screen_Shot_2021_01_08_at_3.22.26_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Twitter permanently suspending President Donald Trump’s Twitter account Friday evening.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OBmP9k"&gt;“Due to the ongoing tensions in the United States, and an uptick in the global conversation in regards to the people who violently stormed the Capitol on January 6, 2021, these two Tweets must be read in the context of broader events in the country and the ways in which the President’s statements can be mobilized by different audiences, including to incite violence, as well as in the context of the pattern of behavior from this account in recent weeks,” Twitter said &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/suspension.html"&gt;in its Friday blog&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fYjq67"&gt;Twitter decided the new tweets were “highly likely to encourage and inspire people to replicate the criminal acts” at the Capitol, and shared its reasoning in five parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="UOHV0r"&gt;President Trump’s statement that he will not be attending the Inauguration is being received by a number of his supporters as further confirmation that the election was not legitimate and is seen as him disavowing his previous claim made via two Tweets (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DanScavino/status/1347103015493361664"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DanScavino/status/1347103016311259136"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;) by his Deputy Chief of Staff, Dan Scavino, that there would be an “orderly transition” on January 20th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A91mvh"&gt;The second Tweet may also serve as encouragement to those potentially considering violent acts that the Inauguration would be a “safe” target, as he will not be attending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xtqrZ8"&gt;The use of the words “American Patriots” to describe some of his supporters is also being interpreted as support for those committing violent acts at the US Capitol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UXDAjH"&gt;The mention of his supporters having a “GIANT VOICE long into the future” and that “They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!” is being interpreted as further indication that President Trump does not plan to facilitate an “orderly transition” and instead that he plans to continue to support, empower, and shield those who believe he won the election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4VbraO"&gt;Plans for future armed protests have already begun proliferating on and off-Twitter, including a proposed secondary attack on the US Capitol and state capitol buildings on January 17, 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jFrZa1"&gt;Earlier Friday, more than 300 Twitter employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221386/twitter-employees-trump-ban-internal-letter-capitol-attack"&gt;signed onto an internal petition&lt;/a&gt; calling for Trump to be permanently banned following the January 6th Capitol riots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JVBVy8"&gt;“We must examine Twitter’s complicity in what President-Elect Biden has rightly termed insurrection. Those acts jeopardize the wellbeing of the United States, our company, and our employees,” the employees wrote in the letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ltCwtD"&gt;On Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;Facebook put an “indefinite” ban on Trump&lt;/a&gt; that it said would last at least through Inauguration Day. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the risks “are simply too great” to allow Trump continued access after he used the platform to “incite violent insurrection against a democratically elected government.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwGgn6"&gt;The suspension has been a long time coming. For years, Twitter has faced pressure to remove Trump from its platform due to the large megaphone it’s offered him to spread hateful language and lies. The company justified his continued presence on the platform as being in the public interest.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple and Google face pressure to deplatform Parler over calls to violence</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="This illustration picture shows the social media website from Parler displayed on a computer screen. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XO_GO-OWfrvK8Qozat1kLO5T484=/0x15:4000x2682/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68638888/1225872887.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WDGyqC"&gt;Apple and Google are facing new pressure to deplatform Parler, a social network founded as a less moderated and more conservative-friendly alternative to Facebook and Twitter. Late Friday, &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/apple-threatens-ban-parler?bftwnews&amp;amp;utm_term=4ldqpgc#4ldqpgc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Apple has given Parler 24 hours to put a moderation platform into place or be expelled from its App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uAey1R"&gt;Apple wrote to Parler executives Friday telling them it had received complaints about “objectionable content,” according to &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/em&gt;, “accusations that the Parler app was used to plan, coordinate, and facilitate the illegal activities in Washington D.C. on January 6, 2021 that led (among other things) to loss of life, numerous injuries, and the destruction of property. The app also appears to continue to be used to plan and facilitate yet further illegal and dangerous activities.” If Parler doesn’t comply, the app will be removed from the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="stWIeW"&gt;Activist group Sleeping Giants had called on both Apple and Google to ban Parler from their app stores in response to posts calling for violence against elected officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DBxgR6"&gt;As evidence, the group posted screenshots of Parler posts calling for Vice President Mike Pence to face a firing squad and encouraging “American Patriots” to return to the capital on January 19th “carrying Our weapons.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NSgQ3X"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Yesterday, we asked &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppStore?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AppStore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GooglePlay?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@GooglePlay&lt;/a&gt; to enforce their own Terms of Service on Parler based on the sheer number of violent threats on the platform with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PullParler?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#PullParler&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Look at the VERY CLEAR terms set by these two app stores below: &lt;a href="https://t.co/SpPuSCUxy4"&gt;https://t.co/SpPuSCUxy4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Sleeping Giants (@slpng_giants) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/slpng_giants/status/1347522919992336387?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fiVyHk"&gt;The group points out that both Google and Apple have clear rules against violent threats and moderation of content. Apple’s App Store says apps must have “a method for filtering objectionable material from being posted” and “a mechanism to report offensive content.” Google’s Play Store bars apps that “depict or facilitate gratuitous violence or other dangerous activities,” and that “we don’t allow apps that contain or facilitate threats, harassment, or bullying.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UfmlvL"&gt;Neither Apple nor Google replied to requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Parler also did not reply to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WNiOPG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557219/parler-conservative-app-download-new-users-moderation-bias"&gt;Parler saw its numbers skyrocket&lt;/a&gt; after Twitter and Facebook tightened their moderation, with conservative protesters finding a home among like-minded users. In a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/07/opinion/sway-kara-swisher-john-matze.html?"&gt;Thursday interview with Kara Swisher&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;em&gt;Sway&lt;/em&gt; podcast, Parler CEO John Matze said any posts on the site indicating Wednesday’s riots were “illegally organized and against the law” would have been removed. “But I don’t feel responsible for any of this and neither should the platform, considering we’re a neutral town square that just adheres to the law,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpnbBG"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552752/facebook-stopthesteal-ban-twitter-parler-discord-trump"&gt;“Stop the Steal” campaign&lt;/a&gt; challenging President Trump’s loss gained particular momentum among Parler users, as well as other conspiracy theories around the election that had been debunked elsewhere. In the wake of the Capitol raid, researchers have circulated &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Cbluedreams/status/1347405890505252864?"&gt;dozens of posts on Parler that encouraged violence&lt;/a&gt; leading up to the attack on the Capitol. “Chloroform. Silencers. SHARP knives &amp;amp; keep walking,” reads one, “take zip ties with you, sneak up on them like ninjas and zip tie their hands and feet,” reads another, to which someone replied: “around their neck, can’t get it off in time, they die.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YyhCUf"&gt;On Thursday evening, the site had posts from Trump supporters &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ddale8/status/1347570822437863424"&gt;questioning whether his concession speech&lt;/a&gt; was a deepfake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OmpzSI"&gt;There is some precedent for removing an app for hosting violent content. After a gunman killed eleven people in a Pittsburgh synagogue in 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/27/18032930/paypal-banned-gab-following-pittsburgh-shooting"&gt;PayPal banned the social network Gab&lt;/a&gt; from its platform, when it was revealed that suspect Robert Bowers had posted anti-Semitic rants on Gab ahead of the shooting. &lt;a href="https://www.inc.com/salvador-rodriguez/gab-apple-inauguration.html"&gt;Apple had rejected&lt;/a&gt; Gab’s application to appear in its App Store in 2016, and Twitter removed Gab’s access to its API. Google removed the app from the Google Play store in 2017 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/18/16166240/gab-google-play-removed-hate-speech"&gt;for violating its hate speech policy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VayTgj"&gt;Since Apple and Google control the biggest smartphone operating systems, the companies wield immense power over mobile app distribution. The inability to push its app on the two biggest app stores greatly reduced Gab’s reach, forcing users to find &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/12/20691957/mastodon-decentralized-social-network-gab-migration-fediverse-app-blocking"&gt;workarounds to use it&lt;/a&gt; on mobile sites. Gab’s desktop site, however, appears alive and well, with a new post from President Trump extolling the “great American Patriots who voted for me” leading the site’s “hot” posts on Friday morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wcmjee"&gt;Both Twitter and Facebook have implemented temporary bans on President Trump’s accounts, treating recent statements as likely to provoke violence. The platforms had previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552763/election-2020-tech-social-platforms-facebook-twitter-youtube-misinformation"&gt;adopted strict policies against election and voting misinformation&lt;/a&gt; during the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d2N9IJ"&gt;In a post on Parler Thursday, &lt;a href="https://parler.com/post/23a2c1d63ea94c74b04d03917ad03339"&gt;Matze criticized Facebook and Twitter&lt;/a&gt; for their actions against the president’s posts. “It’s clear that Facebook and Twitter believe the ends justify the means. They believe the American people are weak. They insult our founding fathers by suggesting Zuckerburg [sic] and Dorsey know what is best for us,” he wrote. “Parler is not an arbiter of truth. We believe in you. We believe you are wise enough to decide for yourself and trust that given access to all information we can self govern.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lhu6uU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 8th 6:05PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added report that Apple gave Parler 24 hours to add moderation or be expelled from the App Store&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>These are Sony’s first 360-degree audio speakers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gc4a7zTG6NNmscqzyA93l2vNWJg=/0x0:1000x667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68640844/jxdfau1hhb1wznu95f1c.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s SRS-RA5000 speaker.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e6Xhju"&gt;Earlier today, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220223/sony-360-degree-audio-video-speakers-software"&gt;Sony announced&lt;/a&gt; that it would be releasing two new speakers compatible with 360 Reality Audio, its spatial audio technology that replicates the feel of live music by placing different sounds and vocals in a virtual sphere around you. It said its plan is to release them this spring, but it didn’t share what the speakers would look like. We didn’t have to wait to learn more about them, though, as Sony’s UK website now has full product pages for the upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/wireless-speakers/srs-ra5000"&gt;SRS-RA5000&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/wireless-speakers/srs-ra3000"&gt;SRS-RA3000&lt;/a&gt; speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="50EA4J"&gt;The higher-end SRS-RA5000, pictured at the top of this post, will have three up-firing speakers, three side speakers, and a woofer. It’s also certified for High-Resolution Audio. The SRS-RA3000, pictured below, has two tweeters, two passive radiators, and a full-range driver. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XCdfVqh8RVZ_DdvHVORKjDUu9Mw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22223041/imydsjfdmwz4rleeuiah.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s SRS-RA3000 speaker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gwHxvM"&gt;Both speakers can calibrate themselves to the room they’re in with an internal microphone and a “unique Sony algorithm,” too. With the SRS-RA5000, you have to press and hold a button on the speaker, while the SRS-RA3000 can calibrate itself automatically. The two speakers also have Sony’s Auto Volume feature, which adjusts the volume of each track automatically to play them at a consistent volume. And both speakers support Amazon’s Alexa and Google Assistant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B55Fyr"&gt;The SRS-RA5000 will cost approximately £500 / €599, while the SRS-RA3000 is priced at about £280 / €359, according to the &lt;a href="https://presscentre.sony.co.uk/pressreleases/change-the-way-you-listen-to-music-at-home-with-sonys-new-srs-ra5000-and-srs-ra3000-wireless-home-speakers-3063448"&gt;press release on Sony’s UK website&lt;/a&gt;. That also says both speakers will arrive in February 2021, which is a bit sooner than the previous “spring” date we had heard before, so perhaps there will be different release dates in different regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="egt1vM"&gt;Sony said it is expanding the 360 Reality Audio platform from audio to video &lt;a href="https://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press/202101/21-001E/"&gt;earlier on Friday&lt;/a&gt;, and the company is working with major music labels and service providers to begin streaming video content with the codec later this year. Approximately 4,000 songs currently support the format, according to Sony.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter bans QAnon supporters, including former national security adviser Michael Flynn</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Former Trump National Security Advisor Michael Flynn Returns To Court" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/06EH7_0DatYPJHgeWsjKyciiRno=/0x41:3000x2041/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68640749/1151710958.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Alex Wroblewski / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XlITS5"&gt;Twitter has suspended prominent backers of the QAnon conspiracy theory, citing a potential for “offline harm.” &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/twitter-bans-michael-flynn-sidney-powell-qanon-account-purge-n1253550"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt; reporter Ben Collins reported&lt;/a&gt; the ban of former Trump administration national security adviser Michael Flynn, former Trump attorney Sidney Powell, and former 8kun administrator Ron Watkins. Other major QAnon accounts have apparently been banned as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rwx3Kg"&gt;Twitter told &lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt; that the accounts were suspended under Twitter’s “coordinated harmful activity” ban. “We’ve been clear that we will take strong enforcement action on behavior that has the potential to lead to offline harm, and given the renewed potential for violence surrounding this type of behavior in the coming days, we will permanently suspend accounts that are solely dedicated to sharing QAnon content,” a spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aZISQH"&gt;Flynn and Powell have both promoted theories linked to QAnon, a sprawling conspiracy movement united against a nonexistent cabal of devil-worshipping pedophiles. Flynn was convicted of lying to the FBI, but he was &lt;a href="https://chorus.voxmedia.com/compose/6e715a62-b3e8-4126-8507-7067fa39fd1a"&gt;pardoned by President Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; and has become a QAnon evangelist. Powell has been instrumental in promoting false claims that the 2020 presidential election was rigged, leading Dominion Voting Systems to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220553/dominion-conspiracy-theory-lawsuit-former-trump-lawyer-voting-machine"&gt;file a defamation suit against her&lt;/a&gt; earlier today. Watkins formerly helped run 8kun (formerly 8chan), the anonymous message board where QAnon head Q posts cryptic messages to followers. Researchers speculate Q &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgqj7x/qanons-mysterious-leader-q-is-actually-multiple-people"&gt;may be multiple people&lt;/a&gt;, and both Ron and his father Jim Watkins have been named as potential Q authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6FaxsU"&gt;Twitter is late in taking action against the group. Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21504887/facebook-qanon-ban-all-apps-pages-groups-instagram-accounts"&gt;banned QAnon content&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, calling the group a “militarized social movement.” TikTok likewise &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21522896/tiktok-removing-accounts-qanon-conspiracy-social-media"&gt;banned QAnon content&lt;/a&gt; for violating its disinformation policy. Until recently, however, Twitter hosted some of QAnon’s most high-profile figures. That included the names above, as well as David Hayes (known as “Praying Medic”), a major QAnon theory interpreter and part of a group that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21534900/youtube-qanon-channels-conspiracy-theory-lawsuit-deplatformed"&gt;sued YouTube for its own QAnon crackdown&lt;/a&gt; last fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gdkYwb"&gt;QAnon supporters were among the Trump backers who mobbed the US Capitol earlier this week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217411/capitol-building-lockdown-protesters-trump-supporters"&gt;attempting to overturn&lt;/a&gt; the results of the US presidential election. Trump himself has also expressed support for QAnon, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/535e145ee67dd757660157be39d05d3f"&gt;calling its supporters&lt;/a&gt; “people that love our country.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vape batteries can cause deadly explosions, consumer safety agency warns</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="No-Tobacco Day In Poland" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7Cw136W31E3xfm01c6Piry7rnyg=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68640697/1216547481.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dbgqOa"&gt;Consumers should not buy or use individual 18650 lithium-ion battery cells due to possible fire risk, &lt;a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2021/CPSC-Issues-Consumer-Safety-Warning-Serious-Injury-or-Death-Can-Occur-if-Lithium-Ion-Battery-Cells-Are-Separated-from-Battery-Packs-and-Used-to-Power-Devices"&gt;according to a warning&lt;/a&gt; just issued by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). The commission says it is working with e-commerce sites like eBay to remove listings of loose 18650 cells, which are sometimes used in vapes, e-cigarettes, flashlights, and toys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7RtWZl"&gt;“[T]hese battery cells may have exposed metal positive and negative terminals that can short-circuit when they come into contact with metal objects, such as keys or loose change in a pocket,” the agency wrote Friday. “Once shorted, loose cells can overheat and experience thermal runaway, igniting the cell’s internal materials and forcibly expelling burning contents, resulting in fires, explosions, serious injuries and even death.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Two rechargeable Li-ion batteries, an 18650 and an 14500, next to a standard AA for scale." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5TcRqb0E5M501StUAauLHaPcOjQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22223448/20210108_Sean_Hollister_Verge_1.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Two rechargeable Li-ion batteries, an 18650 and an 14500, next to a standard AA for scale.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lUJXnB"&gt;Injuries related to exploding 18650 cells have been documented for a few years now, but the frequency seems to have increased along with their availability on sites like Amazon or from wholesale retailers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x76jpY"&gt;One of the companies that makes 18650 cells, LG Chem, asked distributors of e-cigarette equipment in a late 2018 letter to stop selling them, warning that “[i]ndividual consumer use and handling” that could “lead to severe burns and disfigurement,” according &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/04/lithium-ion-batteries-amazon-are-exploding/587005/"&gt;to a report in &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung and Sony also warn consumers against using the cells. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1bT9b"&gt;We do have some questions about why the CPSC is unilaterally warning against &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; loose 18650 batteries, and why the CPSC is singling out the 18650 alone. “They are often misused as a stand-alone consumer battery, but do not have protection circuits,” writes the agency, but you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; buy 18650 batteries that &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; come with protection circuits — see an example in the picture above. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0FdH1"&gt;The 18650 isn’t the only Li-ion battery that has the potential for misuse, either — you can buy standalone 14500 cells as well, which are roughly the same size as a standard AA but more than twice the voltage (don’t put them into your remote). You can also purchase the 16340, a rechargeable cell similar to the single-use CR123A you might put into a smoke detector. We’ve contacted the CPSC and will update with any answers we get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YSQn24"&gt;18650 cells are larger, higher density, and often used in more heavy-duty commercial settings, and even power Tesla’s Model X and Model S vehicles — though the CPSC acknowledges that’s fine, since it’s their intended use. That said, there is a small but growing DIY community springing up around building &lt;a href="https://www.instructables.com/DIY-Professional-18650-Battery-Pack/"&gt;custom battery packs&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://evnerds.com/tech/ev-battery/how-to-build-a-diy-electric-bicycle-lithium-battery-from-18650-cells/"&gt;e-bikes&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RigE5x11kpY"&gt;electric cars&lt;/a&gt; using 18650 cells bought on the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tSodFx"&gt;This isn’t the first time the CPSC has intervened in battery tech. Back when hoverboards were bursting into flames, the agency &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/19/11060836/hoverboard-risk-letter-safety-certification-fire-cpsc"&gt;demanded manufactures recall their unsafe products&lt;/a&gt; and threatened to seize ones that were non-compliant at the border.  The agency was also in charge of investigating &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/11/13241032/samsung-galaxy-note-7-subpoena-seizure-cpsc"&gt;when the Note 7 started catching on fire&lt;/a&gt;, although in that case Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/15/12933410/samsung-galaxy-note-7-recall-us-cpsc"&gt;worked with the agency&lt;/a&gt; to get the product recalled before the agency forced them to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CnxHnW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hundreds of Twitter employees call for Trump to be banned</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vacEkOmDYY2swlGM9lV15AH1nOE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68640689/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3664ZB"&gt;More than 300 Twitter employees have signed an internal petition calling for President Donald Trump to be permanently banned from the platform following a raid on the US Capitol on January 6th. Roughly an hour and a half after we published this story, Twitter apparently agreed — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;President Donald Trump has been permanently banned from Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="4EpfOn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Twitter permanently bans Trump","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="SpvJ0i"&gt;The letter said that the employees are “disturbed” by the attack and that Twitter must “permanently suspend” Trump because of his involvement, according to a copy of the letter seen by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/08/twitter-trump-dorsey/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;first&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on the letter’s circulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="05uAJS"&gt;“We must examine Twitter’s complicity in what President-Elect Biden has rightly termed insurrection. Those acts jeopardize the wellbeing of the United States, our company, and our employees,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4K2L2c"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We must learn from our mistakes in order to avoid causing future harm.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZTsYBx"&gt;The letter writers also call for Twitter to “provide a clear account” of the company’s decision to temporarily suspend Trump’s account and to investigate “Twitter’s role in today’s insurrection.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hDVHbG"&gt;“We must learn from our mistakes in order to avoid causing future harm,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oHaJTf"&gt;The letter has been signed by more than 300 people over the last two days, according to a person familiar with its circulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uBGJAB"&gt;The pushback inside Twitter follows stronger action from Facebook, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;suspended Trump indefinitely&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday. Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and other platforms began removing posts or restricting his account on Wednesday after the president posted a video praising the mob that attacked the Capitol. The Alphabet Workers Union has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220778/alphabet-workers-union-demands-youtube-ban-trump"&gt;called on YouTube to ban Trump&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KV4AXm"&gt;Twitter employees have been pushing back against leadership in company-wide Slack rooms as well. “I feel like we’ve bent over backwards to craft policies to allow Trump to stay up and to say what he has,” one employee wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5LiCHJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Dorsey said Twitter had drawn “a very clear line in the sand”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yNAmqh"&gt;“This conversation has focused on how rigorously we have enforced our existing policies ... Do we consider that there may be problems with our policies themselves?” wrote another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wm0Ujd"&gt;On Thursday, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey sent a message to staff saying that the company’s actions around Trump were important for establishing trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VrxoMk"&gt;“It’s important we follow a clear and public rule set that can endure beyond any one moment,” Dorsey wrote. “Why? In order to earn trust. I know it may not feel that way right now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1d7nm"&gt;Dorsey also argued that it was up to elected leaders to repair the damage from Wednesday’s attack. “We aren’t the government,” he said. “Our elected officials must do the work to right this and bring the country together. Our role is around the integrity of the conversation of that work, and doing everything we can to promote healthy discourse, knowing it’s not always going to be accepted in the short term. But it will be over the long term. I’m certain of that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ojqd5O"&gt;Dorsey said that Twitter had drawn “a very clear line in the sand” by saying it would permanently suspend Trump if he further violated the platform’s rules. “If that line is crossed, we will do what we said we are going to do,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E4Xant"&gt;During a company all-hands meeting on Friday, employees were told there would be a “retrospective” on the company’s recent policy decisions, according to screenshots of a Slack conversation seen by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Employees were also urged not to leak more information to the media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xcy15h"&gt;In a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Twitter spokesperson said: “Twitter encourages an open dialogue between our leadership and employees, and we welcome our employees to express their thoughts and concerns in whichever manner feels right to them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1GirD1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 5:16PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Article updated with a statement from Twitter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eBSR4c"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 6:42PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter has now banned Trump&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Damages from US weather and climate disasters reached a new record in 2020 </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="wildfire smoke" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-GKv-xc5uwGa7vQYUYatNYDOmIM=/0x0:5380x3587/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68640637/1277648563.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oCYddB"&gt;The US experienced a record number of billion-dollar disasters in 2020. Twenty-two disasters cost the US a cumulative $95 billion last year, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). That smashes previous records set in 2011 and 2017, when 16 disasters caused at least a billion dollars of damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6JeQwy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Climate change is hitting the US hard in the pocketbook&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="klOuWG"&gt;NOAA’s &lt;a href="https://www.noaa.gov/stories/record-number-of-billion-dollar-disasters-struck-us-in-2020"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; is the latest signal that climate change is hitting the US hard in the pocketbook. It follows the release of &lt;a href="https://www.munichre.com/en/company/media-relations/media-information-and-corporate-news/media-information/2021/2020-natural-disasters-balance.html"&gt;another report&lt;/a&gt; by insurance company Munich Re that also tallied 2020 disaster costs and found they had nearly doubled in the US since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KQYBRM"&gt;“Climate change plays a role in this upward trend of losses,” Ernst Rauch, Munich Re chief climate scientist, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/07/climate/2020-disaster-costs.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i1g2ue"&gt;Heatwaves and droughts on their own caused $4.5 billion in damages, &lt;a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/events/US/2020"&gt;according to NOAA&lt;/a&gt;. The hot, dry conditions also fueled unprecedented wildfires that tore through the west. Flames ate up more than 10 million acres across the country, the most since 2000. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21537195/colorado-wildfires-beetle-infestations-forests-east-troublesome"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt; saw three of its largest wildfires ever last year, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21429437/san-francisco-sky-fire-drone-photographs-west-coast-wildfires"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; doubled its previous record for most acres burned. All in all, wildfire damages topped $16 billion in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rsFOIm"&gt;The extremely active Atlantic hurricane season was also costly. By the end of an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726487/2020-atlantic-hurricane-season-end"&gt;exhausting season&lt;/a&gt;, there were more tropical cyclones on NOAA’s billion-dollar disaster list this year than ever before. Those seven storms combined came with a price tag of $40.1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="IivXbb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s just been crazy.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Agzdz0"&gt;“It’s just been crazy,” Allison Wing an assistant professor of meteorology at Florida State University, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726487/2020-atlantic-hurricane-season-end"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; near the end of hurricane season in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dIBjzl"&gt;Ten more severe weather events made NOAA’s list, including hail storms in Texas and the derecho in the Midwest that damaged millions of acres of crops. In just 14 hours on August 10th, the wind storm caused more than $11 billion in damages. Tornado outbreaks also tore through the Southeast, taking out homes and buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WGQ0oE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The Metro Nashville Airport Authority announced Wednesday its John C. Tune Airport on the city’s west side sustained an estimated $93 million in infrastructure damage alone due to the recent tornado. &lt;a href="https://t.co/4nB7iPsdE7"&gt;pic.twitter.com/4nB7iPsdE7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NashvillePost (@NashvillePost) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NashvillePost/status/1235319309657874435?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 4, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OsoSNR"&gt;2020 was a doozy for a lot of reasons, but weather and climate-related disasters are part of a larger pattern of havoc wreaked by global warming. This marked the &lt;a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/"&gt;sixth year in a row&lt;/a&gt; that the US had experienced more than 10 billion-dollar disasters in a calendar year.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>John Legere is considering becoming the Un-Candidate</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: John Legere&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U6Gzx8"&gt;John Legere, former T-Mobile CEO and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/7/10729714/john-legere-carrier-bullshit"&gt;aspiring Batman&lt;/a&gt;, has reacted to the mob that attacked the Capitol like many other political and business leaders by calling for President Donald Trump to step down. But he’s also going a step further by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JohnLegere/status/1347374021495681024?s=19"&gt;considering a run for political office himself&lt;/a&gt;. Legere left his post as CEO and member of T-Mobile’s board after successfully negotiating the merger between the company and Sprint, so he very well could be looking far and wide for his next gig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wzfrsy"&gt;Legere’s time as T-Mobile’s CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/mobile/2013/3/26/4149204/tmobile-new-direction-no-contracts-lte-uncarrier"&gt;turned the company into the “Un-Carrier,”&lt;/a&gt; a plan that came with an end to contracts, revamped mobile plans, and a variety of freebies and perks for customers designed to set T-Mobile apart from its longtime rivals AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon. But what would political candidacy — or un-candidacy — look like for Legere?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;For the first time in my life I am actually considering the possibility of running for office. It’s clear somebody needs to help real Americans find change. I’m not sure I’m capable, but I can’t stand by simply watching this craziness.&lt;/p&gt;— John Legere (@JohnLegere) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JohnLegere/status/1347374021495681024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8XygjM"&gt;Well, if it’s anything like his Un-Carrier moves, it could be a mixed bag. Legere &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2016/6/3/11852870/t-mobile-legere-montage"&gt;was brash and unafraid to roast the competition&lt;/a&gt;, and his attitude and leather jackets lean more un-presidential (or Cool) than anything else. But given the last four years we’ve had, we’re probably all used to the unconventional at this point. Tone matters less than not attempting to dissolve democracy, so the bar is low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vFWyyr"&gt;In terms of policy, popular proposals like &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/2/24/21151143/bernie-sanders-2020-polls-medicare-for-all"&gt;Medicare-for-all&lt;/a&gt; fit nicely within the logic of Legere’s Un-Carrier programs. A large part of Un-Carrier’s offering was zero-rating data from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/18/5822996/t-mobile-music-freedom-net-neutrality"&gt;certain music&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/10/9704482/t-mobile-uncarrier-binge-on-netflix-hbo-streaming"&gt;video streaming services&lt;/a&gt; so it wouldn’t count against T-Mobile customers’ bills. Why not do the same thing with costly medical expenses? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Vj3ug"&gt;Of course, this opens up another can of worms. Legere was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/11/10/7190109/do-you-want-net-neutrality-or-not-john-legere"&gt;publicly in support of net neutrality&lt;/a&gt; while he was CEO but pushed programs that flaunted it. Those zero-rating schemes, like Binge On and T-Mobile’s other perks, actively favored the services that struck a deal with the company. A healthy internet and a strong Federal Communications Commission might not be at the top of Legere’s priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBl3s7"&gt;There’s no telling how serious Legere actually is or if a run would involve him appearing as the heightened version of himself that made him the unofficial mascot of T-Mobile, but there is a precedent. Executives from the wider world of the tech industry, &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2009-feb-10-me-whitman10-story.html"&gt;like former HP CEO Meg Whitman&lt;/a&gt;, have made attempts to hold a political office, and a businessperson thinking they could fix the country or a state in the same way they juice quarterly revenue is a common theme in modern US politics. I’m not holding my breath for a T-Mobile magenta paint job for the White House or press briefings styled as keynotes, but god it would make a good story.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Looks like Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Pro and SmartTags are a lock for January 14th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SbbyOY1_iDrZfzRaeGwmNzlwzwg=/457x0:2043x1057/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68639957/e31b969143b271229f5243aae0fc864fd5f050c10f701deba1a172fab2d354f7.0.jpeg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="liR6Ii"&gt;Samsung is widely expected to announce its Galaxy S21 lineup of phones at its upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/3/22206649/samsung-officially-confirms-galaxy-s21-event-on-january-14th"&gt;January 14th event&lt;/a&gt;, and now it looks like we can safely assume that Samsung will launch its next true wireless headphones and its Tile competitor at the event as well. A leaked marketing render of a promotion offering either the unannounced Galaxy Buds Pro or a Galaxy SmartTag alongside a preorder of the Galaxy S21 Ultra was shared by leaker Evan Blass &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1347616671960338435"&gt;on Friday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The leaked marketing image of the promotion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JncsUe"&gt;A lot of information about both the Galaxy Buds Pro and the Galaxy SmartTags have hit the web recently, so it’s not a big surprise that we can expect to see them announced on January 14th. Details about the Galaxy Buds Pro have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/24/22198622/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-price-specs-active-noise-cancelation"&gt;leaking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22193235/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-3d-spatial-audio-leak"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22180111/galaxy-buds-pro-360-view-samsung-wireless"&gt;weeks&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212894/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-leak-hands-on-video-specs-features-battery-life-sound-quality"&gt;YouTuber even posted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/VAGUMP0xsio"&gt;a hands-on&lt;/a&gt; with the true wireless headphones on January 3rd. We’ve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/1/22209216/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-tile-item-tracker-leak"&gt;also seen photos&lt;/a&gt; of the SmartTag tracker, which is rumored to be a Tile-like tracker that uses Bluetooth to connect with nearby devices, thanks to filings spotted on Taiwan’s telecom regulator’s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JPw2uc"&gt;The Galaxy Buds Pro may be a preorder gift that’s exclusive to the (presumably more expensive) Galaxy S21 Ultra, though. If you opt to preorder the Galaxy S21 or S21 Plus, you’ll be able to get a free pair of Samsung’s bean-shaped &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price"&gt;Galaxy Buds Live&lt;/a&gt; instead, according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheGalox_/status/1347506216596086785"&gt;Twitter user @TheGalox_&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zdujsb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;In most countries, Samsung will also have the same pre-order gifts:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Galaxy Buds Live &amp;amp; Smart Tags when you pre-order the S21 or S21+&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Galaxy Buds Pro &amp;amp; Smart Tags when you pre-order the Galaxy S21 Ultra &lt;a href="https://t.co/vnbucTbmPQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/vnbucTbmPQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Anthony (@TheGalox_) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheGalox_/status/1347506216596086785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zPoa6V"&gt;We’re just under a week away from Samsung’s January 14th event, and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; will be covering everything from the big day.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Among Us was 2020’s most downloaded mobile game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yho9_oGNaaGAwro1StqF1fVVVXg=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68639929/ss_eab32f16b59c005489c10f9063227ed7b54b31ec.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P4vZBG"&gt;In 2020, more mobile users downloaded &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; than any other game worldwide. Data released by &lt;a href="https://blog.apptopia.com/worldwide-us-download-leaders-2020"&gt;Apptopia&lt;/a&gt; ranks the year’s breakout hit at 41 million downloads in the US and 264 million downloads worldwide — beating out games such as &lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;, which both remain in the top 10 highest-grossing games of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="89Etw2"&gt;Despite being released in 2018, &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; didn’t find popular footing until the last year. The online multiplayer deduction game, in which spaceship crew members work together to complete tasks and root out imposters before they’re murdered, became a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21523878/aoc-twitch-stream-among-us-pokimane"&gt;hit on Twitch &lt;/a&gt;late into quarantine. In November, almost &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22196330/among-us-half-billion-players-november"&gt;half a billion people&lt;/a&gt; played the game, which is available on mobile, the Nintendo Switch, and PC. A release is &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/17/22187408/among-us-xbox-one-xbox-series-x-launch-release-dates-2021"&gt;also planned&lt;/a&gt; for Xbox One, Xbox Series S, and Xbox Series X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xE15LO"&gt;As for the team that made &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;, InnerSloth is an independent developer with only four employees. The game has become so popular that the developer actually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21453499/among-us-2-sequel-popular-canceled-developers-innersloth"&gt;canned a sequel&lt;/a&gt; in order to keep working on the original. &lt;/p&gt;
