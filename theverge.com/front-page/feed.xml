    <title>Discord adds mobile screensharing, and it’s perfect for casual hangouts with your friends</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6B8OhxnIWCjME1fsi_yqpLRhrK4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68523533/acastro_200318_1777_discord_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mP8Faq"&gt;Today, Discord is rolling out screensharing to its mobile users. It’s a smart move; earlier this summer, the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/28/21473602/among-us-downloads-discord-app-record"&gt;mobile app was hitting lifetime highs for downloads &lt;em&gt;every day&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CN2o6T"&gt;Mobile screensharing means that you can just share your screen — and whatever you’re watching — with anyone in a voice channel. That means you can watch everything from TikTok to Twitch with any of your friends from anywhere in the world, in real time. While chatting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DF3vkf"&gt;I saw a demo of the feature recently, and more than anything else, I found the simplicity astonishing. In our pandemic year, I’ve spent so much time socializing virtually — sometimes on Discord, sometimes not — and it’s underscored the importance of casual hangouts; spontaneity is one of the many things the pandemic has taken from everyday life.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HFgGXU"&gt;Features like this one can return a little bit of that back to social interaction, I think, because it allows users to drop in and out whenever. I can screenshare to a Discord voice channel and any of my friends can just join me in whatever I feel like doing, be it &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; or just scrolling through my camera roll. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9DGRTh"&gt;Anything that makes it easier to be with people is good, in my book. But given how much time I’ve spent with people in various Discord servers this year, a feature like this one feels quietly revelatory. I miss hanging out on a friend’s couch and talking about nothing in particular; after this year, it’s something I’ll never take for granted again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pUwz6z"&gt;This new feature is about as close as technology can get to replicating that feeling. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to slash buildings’ growing greenhouse gas emissions </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Sunset from the Empire State Building in New York City" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FUicyFkh28zG2OECLhPaUs5G5eA=/25x0:6127x4068/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68523525/1291515807.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&amp;nbsp;The view north to Rockefeller Center, Billionaires’ Row, Central Park, and One Vanderbilt as seen from the 102nd floor of the Empire State Building as the sun sets on December 15, 2020 in New York City. | Photo by Gary Hershorn/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZEMo7r"&gt;Carbon dioxide coming from the buildings where we live and work set a new record in 2019. What’s more, those planet-heating emissions will probably keep rising after the pandemic, the authors of a new &lt;a href="https://wedocs.unep.org/handle/20.500.11822/34572"&gt;UN report&lt;/a&gt; warn. The report urges governments to make structures more energy efficient and speed up a transition to renewable energy. Doing that could be a great way to address both the climate crisis and the economic downturn caused by COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ztTzQE"&gt;The building sector was responsible for a whopping 38 percent of carbon dioxide emissions globally in 2019, the report says. For comparison, all the planes, trains, automobiles, and other transportation in the world only pump out about 24 percent of global carbon emissions. Growing prosperity around the world, especially in developing nations that don’t yet have a lot of renewable energy, led to higher-than-normal rise in building sector emissions last year. When economies grow, there’s more construction, larger floor plans for buildings, and more energy-guzzling appliances and electronics filling those spaces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="U6tkOh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Air conditioning is one of the biggest worries&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J47wX3"&gt;Air conditioning is one of the biggest worries when it comes to energy-hungry buildings. Economic development in hotter climates comes with a big bump in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/14/16290934/india-air-conditioner-cooler-design-climate-change-cept-symphony"&gt;emissions from air conditioners&lt;/a&gt;. Historic heatwaves during 2019, the second hottest year on record, was another reason why that year saw the most building emissions on record, &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/tracking-buildings-2020"&gt;according to the International Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt;. “The need for more energy efficient air conditioning is so vital to the future of both emissions [and] the reality of what we’re building,” says Ian Hamilton, lead coordinating author of the new report. “Those lovely, great big glassy towers in hot parts of the world rely so heavily on air conditioning for them to be comfortable, livable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wK0miV"&gt;Economic prosperity doesn’t need to translate into more planet-heating pollution. About 10 percent of buildings’ environmental footprint comes from their construction and materials. But most of the emissions that buildings are responsible for come from the energy used for heating, cooling, and lighting. Right now, fossil fuels are still a large part of the energy mix — which is what report authors hope to see change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PoHRCU"&gt;“There’s still lots and lots of work to be done there,” says Hamilton. “If electricity isn’t decarbonized, our emissions are going to carry on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NJAuwa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Progress has actually slowed &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hmeY7Q"&gt;Progress has actually slowed over the past several years, the report found. Buildings’ rate of improvement dropped in half between 2016 and 2019. “This gives us a failing direction grade,” Hamilton says. “The reality is that we had been making progress in 2015, 2016 towards that goal of the Paris [climate] Agreement. But in the last few years, that really tailed off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZT183Q"&gt;The Paris Agreement is a global commitment to stop the planet from heating more than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. The world is still on track to surpass that threshold, which scientists warn could transform our planet in devastating ways. To hit the Paris goal, every corner of our economy will need to reach net zero carbon pollution — releasing no more carbon dioxide than they draw down — by 2050. For that to become reality, building sector emissions need to keep falling by 6 percent every year until 2030. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="3HS59o"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Pandemic recovery dovetails with efforts to tackle climate change&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RP2Ocd"&gt;The pandemic slashed global emissions by about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575347/united-states-greenhouse-gas-emissions-historic-plummet"&gt;7 percent&lt;/a&gt; this year. But in the future, pollution cuts will need to be intentional. There’s been a push from some concerned leaders to ensure that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21243011/clean-energy-renewables-coronavirus-recession-stimulus-unemployment"&gt;pandemic recovery dovetails with efforts to tackle climate change&lt;/a&gt;. In the US, President-elect Joe Biden plans to create &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167938/governors-us-climate-change-alliance-clean-energy-jobs"&gt;10 million new jobs&lt;/a&gt; in clean energy and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21324575/joe-biden-jobs-climate-change-plan-energy-elections"&gt;another million jobs&lt;/a&gt; in constructing and upgrading sustainable homes and buildings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F0IQbc"&gt;The new report also urges world leaders to include buildings in their plans to address climate change. Countries are expected to boost their plans for climate action by next year as part of the Paris Agreement. That’s really important for bringing more renewable energy to city grids and buildings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fFYeag"&gt;At a local level, cities can update their building codes. New York City, for example, passed a series of bills in &lt;a href="https://grist.org/article/new-york-citys-newly-passed-green-new-deal-explained/"&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/103-20/green-new-deal-mayor-de-blasio-new-energy-code-meet-challenge-global-warming"&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt; aimed at slashing carbon dioxide emissions from buildings that are responsible for 70 percent of the city’s greenhouse gases. That includes mandates to better insulate buildings and requirements for more efficient lighting, heating, and cooling systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="omyS2B"&gt;“Keeping us on track [for climate targets] will be a driver of construction jobs. It will be an opportunity to help the broader state economy get back on track with what was already a fast growing sector,” Alicia Barton, president and CEO of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21243011/clean-energy-renewables-coronavirus-recession-stimulus-unemployment"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. “Hopefully if we can think smartly about things the state can do and potentially see investments from the federal government, we have a good opportunity to seize a challenging moment and turn it into a moment of opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Firefox’s latest update brings native support for Apple’s Arm-based Macs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QzWZcPA_mhCFdLHBs09wyb2u5xE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68523482/acastro_200207_3900_firefox_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rrY0w1"&gt;Firefox’s latest update brings native support for Macs that run on Apple’s Arm-based silicon, Mozilla announced &lt;a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/84.0/releasenotes/"&gt;on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. Mozilla claims that native Apple silicon support brings significant performance improvements: the browser apparently launches 2.5 times faster and web apps are twice as responsive than they were on the previous version of Firefox, which wasn’t native to Apple’s chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QiJmQt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/upgrading-new-version-firefox-84-apple-silicon"&gt;Mozilla says&lt;/a&gt; that if you’re already running Firefox on your Mac and want to make sure that you’re running the native build, you’ll need to update to the newest version, Firefox 84, and then quit and restart Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KFyBOZ"&gt;I’ve got a MacBook Air with Apple’s new M1 chip, so I installed the new Firefox update and gave it a whirl. It seems speedy enough, but I can’t conclusively confirm Mozilla’s claims about performance improvements in my few minutes of testing. (And to be fair, most things have been pretty speedy on this new Mac.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oj7Svj"&gt;Firefox’s support of Apple’s Arm-based processors follows Chrome, which added support for Apple’s new chips shortly after the M1-equipped MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, and Mac mini were released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21572418/google-chrome-run-natively-on-apples-arm-macs-m1"&gt;in November&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dl5ICA"&gt;Firefox 84 is also the last release to support Adobe Flash, which got its final scheduled update &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166160/adobe-last-flash-player-update-support-ending-december"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="I38v2z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google’s native version of Chrome for Apple’s Arm Macs is out now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21572418/google-chrome-run-natively-on-apples-arm-macs-m1"},{"title":"Adobe just released the last Flash update ever","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166160/adobe-last-flash-player-update-support-ending-december"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>iOS 14.3 turns the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max into even better cameras</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QZTf4Wwz-AsxzbgiJBpQXh7JPM8=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68511660/bfarsace_201106_4269_028.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S0yKiG"&gt;If you’ve got an iPhone 12 Pro or 12 Pro Max and consider yourself something of a photographer, the latest iOS update will help you get the most out of your phone’s cameras. That’s because it includes the new ProRAW feature that Apple first announced back at its October event. ProRAW combines the editing flexibility of RAW with Apple’s computational photography tricks like Smart HDR and Deep Fusion for the first time. You no longer have to choose between the flexibility of a standard RAW file and a JPEG or HEIC file that has all of Apple’s computational magic but limited potential for post-processing because ProRAW gives you both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rn29Fn"&gt;Shooting RAW photos on an iPhone is nothing new; for some time now, apps like Halide and Adobe Lightroom have let you capture all of the data the iPhone’s sensor can gather. And all of the usual benefits of RAW are here with ProRAW — vastly improved control over white balance is always the biggest factor for me — but it gives you greater leeway with adjusting exposure, sharpness, dynamic range, and more. You can make better adjustments to facial tone in a portrait or nail the exposure in a landscape shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vHU4fB"&gt;But standard RAW images can look very grainy out of the iPhone since, well, these are still small smartphone camera sensors, and they’re without any computational photography optimization. Now, you should notice all the same detail as before but with less noise. That’s because ProRAW images do the same multiframe image processing as ordinary iPhone shots. Even with that, you get around 14 stops of dynamic range to work with in editing software. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnaQ11QShvs"&gt;This video from Josh Stunell on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; does a good job of illustrating the differences between RAW and ProRAW:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g3RPjZ"&gt;ProRAW can be used with all of the rear cameras on the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max — it’s not going to suddenly turn the ultrawide into a magic lens, but anything helps — and it also works in night mode. You can even access the people segmentation masks captured by the sensor to make portrait mode-style adjustments after the fact, provided your editing app allows you to control it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nXbqRsJXIdQky0lT_oSOdnY1foA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22022559/bfarsace_201106_4269_022.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can shoot ProRAW images with all three of the cameras on the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1x51ON"&gt;How to use ProRAW&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="F4ih6B"&gt;To use ProRAW, first, you’ve got to enable it under the camera options in the settings menu. After that, you’ll see a “RAW” button appear at the upper-right of the camera viewfinder, which is how you can quickly toggle ProRAW on and off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VLtObT"&gt;I should emphasize that while it’s easy to switch this on, you’re definitely not going to want to use ProRAW all the time. Files average around 25MB in size, which is dramatically larger than your everyday iPhone images. This is a feature best reserved for those very intentional photos with people you care about or at places that matter. ProRAW images appear in the camera roll like normal, but if you try to share them in apps like Instagram, you’ll get an error message. So you’ll want to export them as either a smaller JPEG or HEIC file first before sending them to social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qBt331"&gt;Another nice thing about ProRAW is since it uses Adobe’s widely supported DNG file format, there is already a plethora of apps that can open and edit the files without any update. But apps that use Apple’s own RAW converter will offer even more control since they’ll be able to access tone and distance mapping. Halide has already released an update to get the most out of ProRAW, and I’d expect others like Pixelmator, Darkroom, and Affinity Photo to follow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NP2Oib"&gt;Apps that have their own RAW converter, namely Adobe Photoshop, Lightroom, and Capture One, can edit the DNG files today but won’t have all of the same capabilities as those that use Apple’s RAW converter. It’s possible Adobe and others will update their conversion tools in the future to make them work better with ProRAW. You can, of course, also just edit the images inside the Apple Photos app, too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z_l3ZTohF359m1aD2dhoBqv9yx8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22169707/IMG_0912_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A sample ProRAW image edited in Darkroom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YBvhVB"&gt;If you want to share a ProRAW image, there are various ways to go about it depending on what you’re trying to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="wDL3C4"&gt;If you want to transfer an Apple ProRAW to the computer: ensure the photo is unedited, then either AirDrop or plug the device into USB and use Image Capture or the Windows Photos app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sQEb3m"&gt;If you want to share an edited ProRAW photo:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;edit the photo in the Photos app, then AirDrop, email, or send via Messages. A JPG with the edits will be shared. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VP6iXO"&gt;If you want to email a ProRAW DNG to someone: open the Photos app first and use the share button to share via Mail. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ayEVZd"&gt;If you edit a ProRAW and want both the original DNG file and the edited JPG: use Image Capture or Windows Photos app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UZbkyu"&gt;If a ProRAW is edited but you want to transfer a DNG: duplicate the photo, then revert the edits (makes it an unedited file). A DNG can then be AirDropped, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ic83mC"&gt;If you used a third-party app that can take RAW+JPG, and you want both: use Image Capture to grab each file individually&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="U7m9E1"&gt;I’ve been trying out ProRAW on my iPhone 12 Pro Max over the last few days, and I’m already appreciating the difference it can make. It’s just plain easier to get the most from a photo — retrieve highlights, boost shadows, fix the white balance, etc. — if you’re willing to put in the work of editing after the fact.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3luVi7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; An earlier version of this article stated that ProRAW provides depth information for editing after the fact. This is incorrect, ProRAW provides segmentation masks for people detected in the frame, which can allow you to create portrait-style images after a photo is captured.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Substack launches an RSS reader to organize all your newsletter subscriptions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Substack Reader screenshot showing a list of newsletters on the left and individual posts on the right." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eCQaUilaixkWl5oxIALJRFVehK8=/0x0:999x666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68522975/Substack_Reader_copy.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Substack&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gQ8zrq"&gt;If you’re worried about all your newsletter subscriptions getting lost in your inbox, Substack may have a solution. Today the platform is launching an RSS reader called &lt;a href="https://reader.substack.com/"&gt;Substack Reader&lt;/a&gt;, which offers a streamlined collection of your latest newsletters. Any Substack newsletter you already subscribe to will automatically show up, and if you want, you can add third-party RSS feeds, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QEOMWf"&gt;The goal was to “create a distraction free space” for people whose email inbox isn’t their ideal reading experience, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22159571/substack-ceo-chris-best-interview-newsletter-subscription-model-journalism-decoder-podcast"&gt;Substack CEO Chris Best&lt;/a&gt; told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LPmLQz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It could be a way to discover new writers you want to subscribe to”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K9lOIu"&gt;Substack Reader is launching as a beta, and it feels very much like a version one product. It presents a chronological list of every newsletter you’re subscribed to, and you can click on those entries to open them in a new window and read them. Right now, there’s no way to read stories inside of Substack Reader, like you can in a traditional RSS reader, and stories stay in your queue even after you’ve read them. (In-line reading is “something we are strongly considering for the future,” Substack co-founder Hamish McKenzie wrote in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VKExK8"&gt;The reader also separates out podcasts published through Substack, and it shows a lock icon next to subscriber-only newsletters, which could help to highlight just how much non-paying readers are missing out on. Anyone will be able to sign up for the beta starting today. At launch, it’s only available on the web. Mobile apps are “something we’ll look at,” Best said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="N6tDKp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Can Substack CEO Chris Best build a new model for journalism?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22159571/substack-ceo-chris-best-interview-newsletter-subscription-model-journalism-decoder-podcast"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c8Xo6X"&gt;RSS readers have traditionally struggled to gain a large enough audience for companies to keep supporting them. Google infamously shut down Google Reader in 2013; Digg launched Digg Reader in response the same year, then shut it down five years later. Substack seems to be thinking about its reader as a companion to its newsletters, more than as a competitor to full-on RSS readers like Feedly. Still, Best said he hopes to expand the audience for a reader app by making it “as easy and simple as it can possibly be to get started.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rBHNSW"&gt;Longer term, the service may finally give Substack a space to start recommending different newsletters to existing users. “I think one of the reasons that we think an experience like this could be really good is it could be a way to discover new writers you want to subscribe to,” Best said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="boh6lN"&gt;As Substack adds discovery features, Best said the service will stay away from putting “a bunch of clicky stuff in there that’s super tantalizing,” and stick to the platform’s existing goal of fostering a relationship between readers and writers they can trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8dV1oK"&gt;Substack is adding some basic new &lt;a href="https://substack.com/discover"&gt;discovery features&lt;/a&gt; to its website today, too. The service’s existing list of top publications is being expanded to include a number of specific categories (beyond the previous “top paid” and “top free” lists), so you’ll be able to see the top political newsletters or top business newsletters and explore by your interests.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stadia comes to the iPhone and iPad with new iOS beta</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-l-2xRQOLmTeGnH84RGqTR1vqnI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68522982/akrales_191113_3779_0319.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IHlTLd"&gt;Google Stadia has finally made its way to iOS over a year after launch. The company’s mobile web beta for the iPhone and iPad, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21571908/google-stadia-apple-ios-iphone-web-app-testing-safari-cloud-gaming"&gt;first announced last month&lt;/a&gt;, is launching today. That means any Stadia user on either its free tier or its paid Stadia Pro subscription will be able to access their library of Stadia games on Apple devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lsmvd1"&gt;Google, like other competing cloud services, is using mobile Safari due to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/20912689/apple-cloud-gaming-streaming-xcloud-stadia-app-store-guidelines-rules"&gt;Apple’s restrictions on cloud gaming apps&lt;/a&gt; that mean platforms like Stadia can’t exist in their current form on the App Store. You can access Stadia through its website on Safari or by creating a home screen icon that will turn the service into a progressive web app, so it acts almost identically to a native one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qcI7H"&gt;Unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21573311/nvidia-geforce-now-ios-launch-beta-release-safari-mobile-web-app"&gt;Nvidia’s GeForce Now&lt;/a&gt; or the planned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165280/microsoft-xcloud-ios-pc-launch-spring-2021-announced"&gt;mobile web version of Microsoft’s xCloud&lt;/a&gt;, however, Google Stadia has a free tier without restrictions and now offers two free-to-play games available (&lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Super Bomberman R&lt;/em&gt;), with more to come. That means anyone with a Gmail account looking to try Stadia can give it a shot on an iPhone or iPad with minimal effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="J29xgg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google Stadia now works on both Android and iOS, thanks to its new mobile web app&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jCnxaH"&gt;That accessibility could be key for Stadia’s growth going forward. Much of the early struggles of Stadia, and the many failed or otherwise unknown cloud platforms that have come before it, have to do with a mix of technical issues and economic hurdles, roadblocks that mean actually using the service as your primary gaming platform is more cumbersome and costly than the benefits. But Stadia is in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575100/google-stadia-one-year-anniversary-cloud-gaming-cyberpunk-2077-launch-test"&gt;much different place now than it was at launch&lt;/a&gt;. The service not only has a free tier and free-to-play games, but it also has access to high-profile holiday releases like &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla &lt;/em&gt;and the just-released &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V4UQFQ"&gt;CD Projekt Red’s new open-world sci-fi game has been plagued by bugs and performance issues &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167303/cyberpunk-2077-ps5-console-google-stadia"&gt;mainly affecting players on last-gen game consoles&lt;/a&gt;, which is a boon for the Stadia version. Google had to &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/12/13/stadia-cyberpunk-premiere-edition-ended/"&gt;shut down a promotion for the game&lt;/a&gt; that awarded free Stadia controllers and Chromecast Ultra devices to anyone who preordered or purchased &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; on Stadia up to a week after its release due to overwhelming demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9oTHDB"&gt;Adding iOS support may add to the momentum Stadia is experiencing right now. I’ve had access to the beta on &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Stadia test account for the last week or so where I’ve been testing &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; and other games on my iPad Pro and iPhone 11 Pro. It works remarkably well, even with the built-in touch controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H6rRdN"&gt;I wouldn’t recommend relying on those touch controls for anything that requires precise input, but it was nice to know I could still maneuver the &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; interface using my iPhone touchscreen to perform simple tasks, like carousing the in-game Tower hub to pick up bounties or check my character’s inventory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GIQB4B"&gt;Instead of touch, you’re better off using either a Stadia controller or one of the supported Bluetooth gamepads like Microsoft’s Xbox One controller or the Sony DualShock 4, and those controllers work seamlessly via mobile Safari with no issues I’ve encountered so far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="4KV7KW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google’s ‘Cyberpunk 2077’ promotion ended early due to overwhelming demand&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1ahaUq"&gt;I will say that you have to rely on a Wi-Fi connection to reliable play on iOS unless you happen to be the owner of a rather rare and situational Ethernet to Lightning or USB adapter accessory. That means you’re not going to get super smooth visuals or performance all of the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C3JZf7"&gt;Still, a lot of the visual hiccups you might experience from using Stadia on an average Wi-Fi connection on a larger screen are not as noticeable when playing on the iPhone or iPad. In particular, I’ve found playing &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; on my iPad Pro to be a pretty consistent and solid experience, more so in some cases than on my PlayStation 5 where I find the game often crashes numerous times during a single play session. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhm6ka"&gt;Due to Apple’s restrictions, Google says you will need to perform a tiny workaround to get the Stadia web version on your iOS device’s home screen as a progressive web app, and it’s created this graphic to explain it:  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vWtie2jMLEozrXhvuepl2VwNu2I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22174622/Stadia_iOS_setup.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EYTrB3"&gt;The big caveat right now is that there are not a whole lot of great games on Stadia that cater to mobile players. I don’t see anyone going out of their way to boot up the new &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; on an iPhone screen, except to marvel at the novelty of it. I think the iPad is primarily where Stadia on iOS will shine for the players who have a nice enough screen, a fast enough connection, and a controller to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="03WshK"&gt;But iOS support opens up a lot of avenues for Stadia — not just to bring it more players looking for a more robust mobile gaming solution but also to promote cloud gaming to developers making the kinds of games fit for mobile screens. If Google cozies up to more indie developers and starts supporting more of the less graphical-intensive experiences you might see on, say, a Nintendo Switch, that could make Stadia a much more competitive platform. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the shipping deadlines to get your holiday gifts there on time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TXy0n4hmacezCmw8o0jTVEsGyVo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68511387/acastro_191108_3782_blackfriday_guidebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Pemr8N"&gt;We’ve reached the final few days before the holidays, and in the interest of getting gifts delivered on time — and not paying handsomely for shipping — you should be wrapping up your shopping as soon as you can. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZQed2y"&gt;Thankfully, several retailers are making those shopping duties cheap and easy by offering free and fast shipping. It wouldn’t be the holidays without a little stress, but you can avoid at least some of it by finishing up your shopping before the window for on-time delivery comes to a close. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w2H0J7"&gt;We’ve also listed the delivery windows for FedEx, UPS, and the USPS in case you are shipping packages yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Walmart http://www.flickr.com/photos/walmartcorporate/5684733482/" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AogG2oBR7QpZVNk9k_zuZn-iv_E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/4153903/walmart.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="86BhAt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2020/12/15/theres-still-time-to-sleigh-the-holidays-with-walmarts-curbside-pickup-and-delivery-options"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1Neaev"&gt;Store pickup is always the best way to ensure you get your gifts in time, but (especially this year when many of us are staying at home) it’s luckily not your only option. Walmart’s pickup and delivery options are for eligible items and a $35 order minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="K5VU5w"&gt;Walmart’s free NextDay shipping will be available for eligible items until December 21st at 2PM local time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="f2pVCn"&gt;Free Two-Day delivery is available for eligible items until December 19th at 2PM local time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="StbHDt"&gt;Pickup and delivery slots from local stores are available to book through December 24th at 4PM local time, pending availability. (Check using your Walmart app.) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tiTnNI"&gt;Express Delivery lets you order by 1PM local time through December 24th for delivery in two hours or less, pending availability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rNf5bj"&gt;And finally, if you want to pick up your order at a local store on December 24th, you should make the order by December 23rd at 4PM local time &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Amazon box" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pE6frkFgU__XDKeRVNSzDpRBeho=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/798460/amazon-box.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="iN9Qwa"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/everything-customers-need-to-know-this-season-about-amazon-shipping-delivery-pickup-and-returns"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="UDGSQU"&gt;As is always the case, you’ll get your gifts faster if you have an Amazon Prime subscription. And it’s always a good idea to check to see if your purchase is eligible for any of the following delivery options since Amazon uses many third-party vendors whose products may not qualify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="5s5DYW"&gt;If you have Prime, have an order over $35, and live in an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b/ref=psdd_help?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=8729023011&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eligible ZIP code&lt;/a&gt;, you can get Same-Day Delivery on certain items through December 24th&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="okdEBJ"&gt;You can get One-Day Delivery for eligible products through December 23rd, free for Prime members with no minimum purchase&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4SJMEp"&gt;If you’re a Prime member in select cities, you can take advantage of two-hour grocery delivery through December 24th. In addition, Amazon stores such as Whole Foods Market and Amazon Pop-Up will be open on Christmas Eve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Target flickr" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t24pQLwhJ9pP7rXWt6uPHgxa4qc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/3325477/target.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="bQVKMy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22168049%2Fshipping-deadlines-free-delivery-amazon-walmart-best-buy-target#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="gi0tQJ"&gt;Target provided the following statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; for the 2020 holiday shopping season:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="el8DbS"&gt;We’re using our nearly 1,900 stores, just miles from 75% of the population, to fulfill online orders and give guests choices in how they get their online purchases. The fastest and most convenient way to shop online at Target is via our contactless same-day services – with Shipt delivery offered nationwide, and free Order Pickup and Drive Up at nearly every Target store. These services have orders ready the same day, and can be delivered or picked up whenever a guest chooses – no membership required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gkSahx"&gt;While same-day services are the fastest growing and most popular, we also anticipate shipping millions of items out the back of our local stores, which reduces the distance and time it takes for delivery. We don’t have a broad cutoff date to share at this time, but our guests are always able to see the date an item will arrive before checking out. Guests in need of last-minute gifts or other holiday items will have the option to place same-day pickup and delivery orders up to two hours before their local Target store closes on Christmas Eve (Dec. 24).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Best Buy UK store" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xhZlsHCXkJOCydmX5NcE4-UKnec=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/779529/best-buy-uk-store.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="QpkF9T"&gt;&lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/633495/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhelp-topics%2Ffree-shipping%2Fpcmcat276800050002.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat276800050002&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="YnrSWH"&gt;Through the holidays, Best Buy’s minimum purchase amount to receive free shipping on online orders is $35.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="bJOaMa"&gt;December 21st is the cutoff date in most areas for large home delivery items, but there are exceptions. The earliest delivery date will be available when you check out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="R6mOaE"&gt;For select items, you can check out before 8PM on Wednesday, December 23rd, to get your deliveries by December 24th&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="L58hlD"&gt;In select areas, 12PM local time on December 24th is the cutoff for same-day delivery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="h5YFWb"&gt;Lastly, 5PM local time on December 24th is the cutoff for store pickup&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p id="IeEpFU"&gt;Google’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;latest Chromecast with Google TV&lt;/a&gt; is filling in one of its biggest missing apps, with the company announcing that it’ll &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/google-tv/apple-tv/"&gt;soon be offering an Apple TV app&lt;/a&gt; in early 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aaG0na"&gt;The Apple TV app will function similarly to other versions of Apple’s service on other devices, allowing subscribers to watch Apple TV Plus original shows, movies, and documentaries (including &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso &lt;/em&gt;and other shows that are not &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;, which are therefore less good). Those Apple TV originals will be integrated into Google TV’s content aggregation system, too, allowing the software to recommend them based on your interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHUFpW"&gt;Additionally, the Apple TV app will give Chromecast users access to their purchased iTunes library of TV shows and movies, as well as any Apple TV channels to which they’re already subscribed. The news marks the second major addition of Apple services to Google products, following the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22157873/google-apple-music-assistant-nest-smart-speakers-displays"&gt;recently added support&lt;/a&gt; for Apple Music on Google Assistant smart speakers earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lipcwC"&gt;Google hasn’t given an exact release date for the Apple TV app, but it promises that the app should launch in early 2021 — first on the Chromecast with Google TV, then followed by other Android TV OS-powered devices. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;When we couldn’t go out, we watched anything and everything&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ygREiP"&gt;By the end of March, questions with friends and family went from “Any plans this weekend?” to “What are you watching now?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0xNYT1"&gt;The pandemic forced most of us inside, sometimes for weeks on end. Zoom hangs &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/21314793/zoom-fatigue-video-chat-facebook-google-meet-microsoft-teams"&gt;got tired pretty quickly&lt;/a&gt;, puzzles were finished in &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/11/09/932652740/puzzle-business-goes-bonkers-as-people-seek-pandemic-pastimes-at-home"&gt;rapid succession&lt;/a&gt;, and there are only so many home workouts to be &lt;a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/a33635518/chloe-ting-teenage-girls-and-the-quest-for-flat-abs-in-lockdown/"&gt;done in a day&lt;/a&gt;. My friends and I started catching up on shows we promised we’d someday watch but kept putting off (for many, that seemed to be &lt;em&gt;The Sopranos&lt;/em&gt;) or dove into &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, &lt;/em&gt;DC&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and Marvel Cinematic Universe marathons. Everyone was streaming all the time — to the point that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/27/21195358/streaming-netflix-disney-hbo-now-youtube-twitch-amazon-prime-video-coronavirus-broadband-network"&gt;data caps were instituted in countries&lt;/a&gt; around the world by regulatory boards that were worried the internet would crash under the strain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kjd8LI"&gt;The internet never collapsed, but streaming, once an isolated activity, became one of the only forms of connection we had. In March and April, Netflix’s eight-part documentary series &lt;em&gt;Tiger King&lt;/em&gt; was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21203686/tiger-king-netflix-meme-tiktok-twitter-live-tv-coronavirus-viral"&gt;one of the few things&lt;/a&gt; people could talk about outside of the pandemic. &lt;em&gt;Tiger King &lt;/em&gt;wasn’t special, but it became a show that everyone could obsess over and feel unified by. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jhrkSL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;At a moment when the world was isolated, streaming became a meaningful connection&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kLmpbm"&gt;At a moment when the world was so isolated and people were cut off from each other, what we were streaming became a meaningful connection. We’ve had that time and again throughout the pandemic: &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2020/11/queens-gambit-fake-deep-period-piece.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Queen’s Gambit,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22152431/the-mandalorian-season-2-episode-6-star-wars-dark-forces-trooper-baby-yoda-grogu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, Emily in Paris, The Undoing, &lt;/em&gt;and more. Not to mention we reconnected with friends over shows and movies we love so much: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/21/21266644/avatar-the-last-airbender-netflix-episodes-start-zuko-alone"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avatar: The Last Airbender&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, Grey’s Anatomy, Criminal Minds, Adventure Time, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Buffy the Vampire Slayer,&lt;/em&gt; to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="czPHnD"&gt;Companies took note. By the end of 2020, nearly every major company with a streaming service was peddling the same line to investors: streaming isn’t just a way to jump on a moment; it’s the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536842/streaming-disney-hbo-max-peacock-cbs-all-access-warnermedia-viacom-nbcuniversal"&gt;future of the businesses&lt;/a&gt;. Disney, WarnerMedia, NBCUniversal, and ViacomCBS have undergone massive shifts internally to restructure themselves around their respective streaming products — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562796/disney-plus-one-year-earnings-q4-mandalorian-streaming-subscribers-theaters"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22162918/christopher-nolan-tenet-hbo-max-warner-bros-streaming-service-cinematic-releases"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21324215/peacock-nbc-universal-comcast-app-how-to-watch-download-price-subscription-stream-shows"&gt;Peacock&lt;/a&gt;, and CBS All Access (soon to become &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21437729/cbs-all-access-paramount-plus-new-name-rebrand-2021-international-disney-hbo"&gt;Paramount Plus&lt;/a&gt;). Movies once designated for theaters are premiering on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;streaming platforms&lt;/a&gt;, features like group watch parties allow people stuck at home to make their streaming experience more interactive, and exclusivity deals continue to play out as each company vies for the biggest audience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nZfw16"&gt;We’re in the middle of a radical shift in the industry — in nearly &lt;em&gt;every &lt;/em&gt;industry — brought on by unprecedented forced acceleration. E-commerce is up because people are choosing to shop online; educators are adapting to teaching over Zoom; and in Hollywood, one message has carried forward throughout the year more so than any other: I stream, you stream, we all stream for eternity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zmYFvV"&gt;Every streaming service is trying to accomplish the same thing. Subscribers should be able to hit play, search, fast-forward and rewind, and enable subtitles without difficulty. It shouldn’t take long for machine learning algorithms to pick up on what a particular person is interested in and recommend shows or movies quickly. Each platform is also immensely different. Content design, user interface design, and the slightly different controls that create a streaming experience make all the difference in an enjoyable time navigating and watching a program and huffing in frustration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfH9Ps"&gt;Since streaming is so fundamentally important, and will remain so going forward, and because every platform is unique in its own way, I’ve decided to assign each service a grade. These are my personal feelings on streaming services that I use every single day (often for &lt;em&gt;far too many&lt;/em&gt; hours throughout the day). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="QDAwvw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Report Cards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gdopM7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HBO Max: B- &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id="p4Hkng"&gt;Pros: &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="et0FHm"&gt;One of the best film libraries of any streaming service, including the Studio Ghibli collection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="W5zLtz"&gt;Incredible lineup of animated shows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ceNE5y"&gt;All of HBO’s catalog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LxLFpu"&gt;Curated selection of episodes for high-profile shows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3pVNxY"&gt;Hubs for different franchises &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9a2o29"&gt;Offline downloads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id="025gZU"&gt;Cons: &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="uYESnn"&gt;Search functionality isn’t reliable &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yAYC6P"&gt;No fast-forward button &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RLjJvm"&gt;No 4K / HDR capabilities currently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GTwYFE"&gt;Not available on Roku &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tYYYIE"&gt;On the more expensive side&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LYvCpb"&gt;Glitchy &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="0DyIGm"&gt;HBO Max is my favorite streaming service. It’s the one I open most frequently, the one that I spend most time on, and the one that’s usually carrying a show that everyone is talking about. At the time of this writing, that show was &lt;em&gt;The Undoing, &lt;/em&gt;but I’m obsessed with &lt;em&gt;Industry, &lt;/em&gt;and I’m excited for &lt;em&gt;The Flight Attendant &lt;/em&gt;to drop. With a library that includes all of Studio Ghibli, some good DC movies, an incredible slate of cartoons, and animated programming from Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, HBO Max has everything I need. Still, despite how much I love it, the fact that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21324139/peacock-roku-amazon-fire-tv-hbo-max-streaming-warnermedia-nbcuniversal-disney-apple"&gt;it’s not on Roku&lt;/a&gt; (one of the biggest aggregators in the United States), can be glitchy, and doesn’t have 4K-enabled streaming are impossible to ignore. From a content perspective, HBO Max is an A+ service, but it’s everything else that drags it down. At $15 a month, not having access to those features becomes a problem. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aa1uCP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disney Plus: A-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6YhiXz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="1lmKqP"&gt;Big hubs for main film and TV franchises &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mJtsi4"&gt;Decent catalog of movies and TV shows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="asSZLg"&gt;4K / HDR streaming capable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8DHVUO"&gt;Watch parties are available &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="18DkjT"&gt;Available on all aggregators &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jWuBDY"&gt;Affordable pricing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zcNxCg"&gt;Offline downloads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Jfxe52"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="AFymIy"&gt;Confusing content design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aJgt23"&gt;Limited selection for subscribers &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hJVhwY"&gt;Not enough new content week after week &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="3fiw9r"&gt;There’s no question that Disney Plus is a breakout success. Parents can have &lt;em&gt;Frozen &lt;/em&gt;running all day to keep kids entertained, and shows like &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;or movies like &lt;em&gt;Hamilton &lt;/em&gt;are enough to keep people subscribed. The biggest issue, however, remains that Disney’s content design is often confusing. Searching for something should be a pretty seamless activity, but Disney Plus’ hubs ironically make it frustrating to find movies or TV shows even within their specific sections. The &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; section, for example, could be separated into various trilogies, animated shows, and others, but for some reason, it’s all thrown together in a nonsensical way. Streaming is more than just the content on a platform — it’s the experience of using said platform. Disney Plus could use a little work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cxk-fpsDpO58IMBUOQkLSb_V-vs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20051231/umbrella_academy.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="6FakUB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Netflix: A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="sqMGKY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="lZT44C"&gt;Most extensive library of films and TV shows, including new programming being added weekly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vf4KUX"&gt;Available on all aggregators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="d4Hzcy"&gt;4K / HDR capabilities &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QRmLfX"&gt;One tap fast-forward and rewind capabilities &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5pBNRd"&gt;Great audio control and options directly inside the streamer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="n4C99k"&gt;Offline downloads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="R4718z"&gt;Pretty good personal recommendations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="8KWAt6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="xypOrh"&gt;Quality of programming is inconsistent at best&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XXOfGe"&gt;Terrible content organization &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="6hDN1Q"&gt;Netflix is the be all, end all of streaming services for a reason. It’s not because Netflix has been around the longest (that goes to Hulu); it’s because Netflix is the equivalent to basic cable. There’s something for everyone at a relatively affordable price, with new shows and movies appearing all the time — not to mention Netflix’s international power means shows from different countries can find new audiences. The Spanish series &lt;em&gt;Money Heist, &lt;/em&gt;for example,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is one of Netflix’s most popular shows. Netflix’s worst quality is that navigating its interface can be a chore, and I end up searching for something for 10 minutes before settling on a &lt;em&gt;Hannibal &lt;/em&gt;rewatch because there’s too much &lt;em&gt;meh &lt;/em&gt;content. But for $14 a month, Netflix remains the best bang for your buck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GFE564xNwwF0w4lEIJtWSQEU6Do=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22154956/picard.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="fvnLL4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CBS All Access: B-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="5b9qDM"&gt;Pros:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="HiGGMj"&gt;Access to live news and some sports&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="J6PYFW"&gt;Excellent catalog of older titles &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1Meu3L"&gt;Affordable pricing options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OJTaqa"&gt;Available on all aggregators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="pHKV3x"&gt;Cons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="9XOFP9"&gt;Not 4K / HDR capable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4maPoE"&gt;Lack of new shows on a consistent basis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TOX3m4"&gt;Terrible UI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PmAtGe"&gt;Most shows I want are also available on Netflix&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="ldn6Ii"&gt;CBS All Access is like the channel you forget you have until you’re scrolling one night and see something that catches your attention. There’s nothing particularly wrong with CBS All Access, but there’s hardly any reason to sign up when compared to what competitors are offering. Originals bring people in; libraries keep them. CBS All Access has a stellar library of classic TV shows and films, but I can’t think of the last time I felt like I had to open CBS All Access to catch something. Even some of my favorite ViacomCBS shows, like &lt;em&gt;Avatar: The Last Airbender &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Criminal Minds&lt;/em&gt;, are available on Netflix. CBS All Access has yet to prove why it’s something I should want, let alone why it’s something any of us need. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="P9Lij1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon Prime Video: C&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Esko4T"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="V4bZ2b"&gt;Included with Amazon Prime account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fR1pK3"&gt;A number of projects from all-star creatives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="toDkYt"&gt;Available on all aggregators &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="f46ZX8"&gt;Offers 4K / HDR content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="ejL915"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="zXgr7g"&gt;Absolute garbage user interface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Nw5s8A"&gt;Search functionality isn’t optimal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="56qIFr"&gt;New content is sparse &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EPckvt"&gt;Library offering doesn’t compare to competitors &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hffvUm"&gt;Overall incredibly frustrating to use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dwotfn"&gt;No offline downloads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="CZ5Ov2"&gt;Considering that Amazon Prime Video is a massive undertaking from one of the biggest corporations in the world, one might expect it to work well. It doesn’t. Nothing about using Amazon Prime Video is a pleasant experience. The catalog is relatively weak compared to others, browsing and searching are more complicated than they need to be, and the experience of watching something through the streaming portal is dismal. If it wasn’t part of the Amazon Prime package, I don’t know why anyone would use it. &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Marvelous Mrs. Maisel &lt;/em&gt;isn’t &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; good. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="jTYfLu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hulu: B+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Q15x0W"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ts0Tzm"&gt;Incredible library of content &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1JZ0qN"&gt;4K / HDR capability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KvOSC5"&gt;Offline downloads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ADzVWF"&gt;Consistent stream of new content &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VKr9fR"&gt;Home to the FX on Hulu hub for prestige series&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7P8TwV"&gt;Excellent personalized recommendations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="flAtJr"&gt;Affordable pricing options &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="FF4n1u"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="wWEjYI"&gt;Not super intuitive &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3TPm5L"&gt;Browsing is a pain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AMLtyd"&gt;Content design is difficult to navigate &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="dKOBQ2"&gt;Hulu is one of the longest-running streamers, so the team has had some time to figure things out. It’s mostly worked out pretty well. Hulu has one of the best library offerings at an affordable price and allows for seamless viewing when a movie or TV show is selected. The biggest issues remain browsing, searching, and the content design. Hulu isn’t search friendly. The personal recommendations are great, but actually scrolling around trying to find something is annoying. There doesn’t appear to be any rhyme or reason to how Hulu is laid out, and it takes away from how great the service truly is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LhWRHAij6w_tXD7t_lM412ZuWHM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22136897/saved_bell.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Peacock&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="9fodjr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peacock: C&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="B3dvcw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="jXpvKa"&gt;Affordable pricing options &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="w90FUY"&gt;Offline downloads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aSNuHb"&gt;On all major aggregators &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gmjPci"&gt;Impressive catalog of classic TV shows &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="s3d9qy"&gt;Unique hubs (live content, traditional library)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="FeoOTg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="9f1uYa"&gt;No 4K / HDR capabilities &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UQuFOh"&gt;Terrible search functionality &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ovbUPh"&gt;Frustrating user interface &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5i1Dxr"&gt;Ads sometimes appear even on ad-free plan &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BHBIOM"&gt;“Channels” section is confusing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1VPyiU"&gt;Content design is counterintuitive &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="TyrgM3"&gt;Peacock is… well, that’s part of the issue. I’m still not quite sure what Peacock wants to be. It’s a general streamer that has one of the best collections of classic TV shows, thanks to NBCUniversal, but Peacock is trying to be too many things at once. It’s a bit of a mess. If it weren’t for the affordable pricing and library collection, I don’t see why anyone would return to it. There are some good series (I love the &lt;em&gt;Saved by the Bell &lt;/em&gt;reboot), and if I want to marathon &lt;em&gt;Law and Order: SVU&lt;/em&gt;, I can. But trying to figure out how to navigate the service takes more time than it should. There also aren’t enough new series or exclusive titles that make me want to open Peacock every day. Fans of &lt;em&gt;The Office &lt;/em&gt;might start doing that in 2021 when the show moves from Netflix to Peacock, but NBCUniversal needs to give me more reasons to open the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/08BvlC1iwh9TqpOBfV3I7DWw94g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22136898/ted_lasso.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple TV Plus&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="qFGB5x"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple TV Plus: B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ycmIbk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="fmM1bM"&gt;Cheapest of the group &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1wafY6"&gt;Quality programming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XEKmJC"&gt;Easy to navigate &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DZS0ke"&gt;Offline viewing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oWfGl8"&gt;4K / HDR capable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SkTHkB"&gt;Available on all aggregators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="9vXuw2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="jzuGI4"&gt;Not a huge library offering &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wPXwWm"&gt;No catalog of classic TV shows or movies &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="o1L1xe"&gt;Not enough consistent new entries &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="l19pCq"&gt;Much like Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV Plus has the advantage of belonging to a much bigger ecosystem. Buy any new Apple product, get Apple TV Plus for free. The downside is that there isn’t much to watch. And as far as downsides go, that’s a pretty big one. If the goal is to keep users subscribed and open the app every day, Apple’s lack of endless things to watch makes that a difficult ask. The upside is that many of the shows and movies being added to Apple TV Plus are worth checking out. I don’t use Apple TV Plus as often, but when I do, I enjoy what I watch. I feel pretty confident in saying that in a few years, that B- will be hovering around a B+ / A-.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Save up to $50 on Apple’s new Mac mini with M1 at B&amp;H Photo today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yJz18PtYp96dYMfepUXYW-UwDGw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68522344/cwelch_201114_4292_0005.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kZ8W3Z"&gt;Apple had a solid year of tech products across a wide variety of categories. From introducing the M1 chip on computers (including the MacBook Pro), releasing four new iPhones (including the first iPhone with the “mini” moniker), two new Apple Watches, and a few updates on some iPad models, this year’s releases spanned a wide gamut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nfjv0F"&gt;Today’s deals highlight some of the better discounts you can find right now if you want to buy some Apple tech this holiday season, including historically low prices on the Mac mini with M1 and multiple iPad Pro configurations discounted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eJ1uGJ"&gt;The new Mac mini with M1 is on sale at B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WdjsGd"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;new Mac mini with the M1 chip&lt;/a&gt; launched last month, and if you were looking to upgrade to this computer, you could get the base configuration with &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604799-REG%2Fapple_mgnr3ll_a_mac_mini.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB of memory and 256GB of SSD for only $669&lt;/a&gt; at B&amp;amp;H Photo. If you need a bit more storage, the &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604800-REG%2Fapple_mgnt3ll_a_mac_mini.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB of storage (and 8GB of RAM) model is $849&lt;/a&gt;, which is $50 off its usual price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tfJ0q8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9712859"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kDK6r3"&gt;Save up to $100 on select iPad Pro configurations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q7Xbyx"&gt;The 2020 iPad Pro models feature a dual-lens rear camera, 4K rendering for video editing apps, a 120Hz display, and Face ID. Multiple configurations for both the 11- and 12-inch models are on sale right now. You can get the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B08637NV8M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=dbd9ce34e100c6204a9e46023f4efb99&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;11-inch with 128GB of storage for as low as $794&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon. If you need a bit more storage, you can get &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1553813-REG%2Fapple_mxdd2ll_a_11_ipad_pro_early.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the 256GB configuration for just $829&lt;/a&gt; at B&amp;amp;H and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B08639YQTV/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=bfc1ddfaf50ba74c316ba45bc440a176&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="b11fC7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SDMSM8"&gt;Looking for an iPad Pro with a slightly bigger screen? B&amp;amp;H also has multiple iPad Pro configurations for this model on sale as well. You can spend as little as $949 on the base model, which includes &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0862JF4KR/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=verge-evergreen-20&amp;amp;linkId=958f5d1d759db7b7f32427d6bb516a5c&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB of storage at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1553841-REG%2Fapple_my2j2ll_a_12_9_ipad_pro_early.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. If you are okay with spending $999, then you can grab the 256GB model for that price at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08628L463/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=a6bf8fa6052c4027cd7b2995a5ba36a5&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;both&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1553828-REG%2Fapple_mxat2ll_a_12_9_ipad_pro_early.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;retailers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="liREYo"&gt;Get Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Super Mario Party for just $80 at Target &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UszOBy"&gt;The holiday season is a great time to buy an influx of video games, given how many holiday sales are available at various retailers. If you didn’t have luck getting a PS5 or Xbox Series X / S before the holiday season, perhaps consider picking up a Nintendo Switch if you have not already. If you do buy a Switch or already have one and need some games to play with family and friends, Target has a &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fmario-kart-8-deluxe-super-mario-party-double-pack-nintendo-switch%2F-%2FA-80960673%3Fclkid%3Dc9d24d41Ne08b11eab1b942010a246e26%26lnm%3D360518%26afid%3DSlickdeals_LLC%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe + Super Mario Party&lt;/em&gt; double pack&lt;/a&gt; for just $80 right now.&lt;/p&gt;
