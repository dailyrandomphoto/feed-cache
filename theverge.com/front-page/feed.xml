    <title>How Alan Wake Remastered strikes a balance between new and old</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/02798cPYVmbtjym5_4B0T2RTpts=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69963609/Unknown.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ikAJP7"&gt;“Remaster” can be a nebulous term in video games, covering anything from direct ports on modern platforms to wholesale graphical overhauls. &lt;em&gt;Alan Wake Remastered&lt;/em&gt;, which was released this week, lands somewhere in the middle and feels like an appropriate use of the term. The Xbox 360 action thriller from 2010 hasn’t been changed all that much, but Remedy and co-developer D3T have done enough to make it feel more at home on current hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jd1ZVT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alan Wake&lt;/em&gt; isn’t exactly a lost classic. The Xbox 360 version is downloadable on Xbox One and Series consoles, and the PC version on Steam holds up pretty well at higher resolutions and frame rates. That said, it never came out for PlayStation platforms, and Remedy felt there was an opportunity to bring it to fans of single-player games who hadn’t had a chance to play it before. “We wanted to bring the game to new (and old) audiences,” communications director Thomas Puha tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, noting that the company acquired the game’s publishing rights from Microsoft in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2TPfVo"&gt;I’ve been playing the PlayStation 5 version of &lt;em&gt;Alan Wake Remastered&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s a subtle but improved release. The game runs at a much higher resolution than the Xbox 360 original, of course, and at 60 frames per second. There are a lot of graphical tweaks, from reworked character models to sharper textures, and the studios even had a team solely dedicated to working on the foliage and forest environments, which feel much richer in this version. The graphics still aren’t what you’d expect from a brand-new PS5 title, and the overall level design remains identical, so you can tell you’re playing a game from a couple of generations back. But that was the plan from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pHiF83mxRQOTzqzogG6tTlG2R7Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22907050/Unknown_1.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="X3eElh"&gt;“We wanted to do a remaster, not a remake,” says Puha. “We were pretty much aligned from the start that there wouldn’t be changes to the experience outside of the visual improvements.” Remedy did feel tempted to go back and fix certain elements of the gameplay that might not have aged so well, like the occasional pacing issues with waves of enemies, or the way Alan can only sprint for five seconds before running out of breath, but ultimately decided to preserve the way the game plays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qDhBho"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You change one thing and that has a ripple effect over the whole project.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4u8CHV"&gt;“Those [elements] are part of the original experience,” Puha says. “That’s how it was then so that’s how it is going to be now. We didn’t change those things. You change one thing and that has a ripple effect over the whole project. If Alan could always sprint, then the combat changes drastically, we’d have to redesign the encounters to accommodate the change in speed and it’s a slippery slope ... soon the game is fundamentally different after a few ‘small’ tweaks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FoXg0X"&gt;The one way &lt;em&gt;Alan Wake Remastered&lt;/em&gt; does play differently from the original, at least on the PS5, is in its use of DualSense trigger resistance and haptic feedback. It’s one of the better third-party releases I’ve found in that regard, with the controller convincingly conveying subtle actions like light footsteps as you explore. The variable trigger resistance actually improves the combat, giving you helpful feedback on whether you’re readying your flashlight or your weapon depending on how far down you press L2.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lVJJDZOgdH-thjwW3pydY5UyZE4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22907051/Unknown_2.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wf8JgO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alan Wake&lt;/em&gt; went through a famously lengthy development cycle of more than five years; the game was announced before the Xbox 360 even hit the market, which made me wonder if there might have been any lingering complexities in bringing it to modern hardware. “There are always legacy issues and plenty of bugs under the hood that never get fixed in every video game,” Puha says. “The codebase of the original &lt;em&gt;Alan Wake&lt;/em&gt; was in pretty good shape considering the protracted development, but it took many months for D3T to study and research at the original codebase and gain an understanding how Remedy’s old engine works, all the various things we did in some special way … so you have to do quite a bit of learning and research, before you can actually start building and improving.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="meSFTF"&gt;As for those improvements, D3T had its work cut out. Technical director Andy Booth says that the majority of assets in &lt;em&gt;Alan Wake Remastered&lt;/em&gt; had to be built from scratch, giving the example of elements like rivets and handles that are now fully modeled in 3D as opposed to being part of a texture. However, the team always used the original assets as the basis of their rendering, and in some cases they were able to use existing textures that had been preserved in a higher resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6rW15k"&gt;“The general rule for the art team was to always utilize as much of the original art as possible, so that we could preserve the original creative intent,” Booth tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “If we did have to remake something, it was regularly compared against the original as part of the review process. This was a fine line to walk, as it needed to be, at a macro level, the same visual look as the original, but also be of a higher fidelity to look good on 4K screens.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v4m1DupEnr7d5aoouMfNTk-o1UA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22907052/Unknown_3.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Rqqahf"&gt;A major focus for the remaster was improving the cinematic sequences. “They weren’t great in the original game,” says Puha, “But they were the most complicated and time-consuming to upgrade without redoing them entirely, which would have been too costly, time-consuming, and impossible in the confines of the project.” Booth explains that the new cutscenes combine original animations with new motion capture and 3D models because these elements all still have to interact with the rest of the existing scene. One consequence of this is that the cutscenes run at 30fps, unlike the rest of the game, though Booth says this is “for both technical and cinematic reasons.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ySuyxH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A fine line to walk.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UmbTwI"&gt;Puha says Remedy has no plans to remove the original version of &lt;em&gt;Alan Wake&lt;/em&gt; from the storefronts on which it exists. All the same, I think anyone checking out the game for the first time would be better off with the remaster unless they have the PC version sitting in their Steam backlog. &lt;em&gt;Remastered&lt;/em&gt; preserves &lt;em&gt;Alan Wake&lt;/em&gt;’s mysterious, occasionally clunky appeal, but generally runs well and feels at home on a PS5 DualSense controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CRE2qU"&gt;And now is a good time to get on board, following some teases in Remedy’s previous big game &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;, because more &lt;em&gt;Alan Wake&lt;/em&gt; is likely on the way. When Remedy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/26/21195152/epic-games-publishing-label-control-last-guardian-inside"&gt;struck a publishing deal with Epic Games&lt;/a&gt; early last year it said there would be a major new project coming as well as a “smaller-scale project set in the same franchise” — and the studio has confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Alan Wake Remastered&lt;/em&gt; is indeed that latter game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QfkK8P"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Alan Wake Remastered &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is out now for PlayStation, Xbox, and on the Epic Games Store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It’s harder to resist Apple’s AirPods when they’re just $109</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A person wearing Apple AirPods" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WAi-KUqQWuuASI-9Cc2LFq0Sj1E=/0x1:1199x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69963594/airpodsmodel.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6Ph47e"&gt;Apple’s AirPods are no stranger to a decent deal, but they’re selling for close to their lowest price yet at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_xzpTrIW%253AoxyLRAEwUx0Mo36cUkB2MtVoExnTVM0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DxzpTrIW%253AoxyLRAEwUx0Mo36cUkB2MtVoExnTVM0%26sharedid%3Dverge%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeTrueWirelessHeadphones042921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. You can pick up the set that includes a wired charging case for $109 (originally $159). These don’t have the same great sound quality or active noise cancellation found in the more costly AirPods Pro. Still, the standard AirPods might surprise you. I picked up a set a few months ago after being a holdout, and they sound good enough for casual listening, but the best feature to me is their fast and strong wireless connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="t7daTP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bjfTaa"&gt;The set of AirPods that includes a wireless charging case for Qi chargers, but is otherwise the same as the set above, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is down to $129 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (originally $199).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rDnK31"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1bUsQD"&gt;Alternatively, if you want wireless earbuds from Apple’s Beats that have better sound quality, active noise cancellation, and USB-C charging (making them just as handy for Android as they are for iOS), consider the Beats Studio Buds. Normally $150, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096SV8SJG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;they’re $125 at Amazon in a few colors&lt;/a&gt;. These also include a wired charging case, but the similarities with the AirPods above stop there. The Studio Buds include three sizes of ear tips so you can find the right fit for your ears. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22532970/beats-studio-buds-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="fJ7MNC"&gt;If you’re looking for voice control of smart home devices and prefer the Google Assistant over Amazon Alexa or Apple’s Siri, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1505874-REG%2Fgoogle_ga00781_us_home_mini_charcoal_2nd.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F10%2F7%2F22713078%2Fapple-airpods-beats-google-nest-mini-gigabyte-gaming-laptop-zelda-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfJA2aQnTKB" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; have the best deal right now on the second-generation Nest Mini. The tiny smart speaker is 50 percent off at both retailers, dropping to just $25.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SpEXii"&gt;The Nest Mini doesn’t compete with Google’s own Nest Audio for sound quality, but generation to generation, its audio quality improvements are most noticeable when you mount it to a wall. Also, the fabric covering and color options ensure they should complement your home decor with a touch of style. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20921173/google-nest-mini-echo-dot-assistant-smart-speaker-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ak0qZy"&gt;The latest and greatest streaming box from Apple brings plenty to the table with Dolby Vision and Atmos support, 4K HDR, and support for Apple services like Apple TV Plus and Fitness Plus, but you might just love it because they finally improved the remote. Gone is the frustrating trackpad-focused remote of the prior model, now replaced with sizable physical buttons. If you own a previous Apple TV box, the speed improvements here should make upgrading worth the cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PNZNMD"&gt;While you can get a nice $169 price &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FFXH02LL%2FA%2Frefurbished-apple-tv-4k-64gb-2nd-generation%3Fafid%3Dp239%257C482924%26cid%3Daos-us-aff-ir&amp;amp;subid1=vergedeals100621" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;directly from Apple on a refurbished model&lt;/a&gt;, the best deal on a new in-box version of the Apple TV 4K is at &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Facmxgy2lla.html%3Femailprice%3Dt&amp;amp;subid1=vergedeals100621" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Adorama for $159&lt;/a&gt;. This discount of $20 was popular enough to quickly get backordered, but Adorama is still taking orders for the sale price and will not charge your card until the item ships. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22454960/apple-tv-4k-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The new Moto G Pure is a $159.99 4G phone with a MediaTek chip</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DQFr149R1ALHaMj-uBuZw-WzQLU=/0x71:3508x2410/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69963420/moto_g_pure_key_visual_horizontal.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto G Pure (2021) is a 4G phone that shares many of the same specs as the Moto G Play, but is $10 cheaper.&lt;/em&gt; | Motorola&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p3mI5W"&gt;Just in time for the holiday shopping season, Motorola is squeezing in one more budget-friendly phone into its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218732/motorola-moto-g-stylus-power-play-2021-one-5g-ace-specs-price-release-date-budget"&gt;2021 Moto G lineup&lt;/a&gt; — the Moto G Pure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o1SsMd"&gt;At $159.99, the Moto G Pure is the least expensive member of Motorola’s lineup, with the already-released Moto G Play only costing about $10 more at $169 (before discounts). Both the Moto G Power and the G Stylus, on the other hand, cost significantly more at $199 and $299, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2aWltE"&gt;The biggest difference between the Moto G Pure and the G Play is in their processors. The G Pure uses the MediaTek Helio G25, while the G Play uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon 460 chip from 2020. Based on processor comparison data from &lt;a href="http://Nanoreview.net"&gt;Nanoreview.net&lt;/a&gt;, the Snapdragon 460 is the faster and more energy-efficient octa-core processor of the two. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22408041/motorola-moto-g-play-2021-review-price-screen-specs"&gt;our review of the Qualcomm-powered Moto G Play&lt;/a&gt; already noted how under-powered that phone felt, so keep your expectations low for the MediaTek chip’s performance on the Moto G Pure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4kchl5"&gt;Like its more expensive sibling, the Moto G Pure also has 3GB RAM to support its processor, 32GB of internal storage that is expandable with a microSD card, and a 6.5-inch display at 720p that is a bit low-resolution for 2021. Other features that are unique to the G Pure: it is water repellent against light rain (IP52) and has a 4000mAh battery that Motorola claims can last up to two days, depending on use. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CMjnMKFDa1Iz8O2aVFG1g5Uj8gg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22904847/moto_g_pure_deep_indigo_combo.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Motorola&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto G Pure is water repellent (IP52), has an audio jack, as well as a radio antenna.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EyntJS"&gt;The G Pure’s camera system is similar to the G Play’s, but its 13-megapixel main camera has a slightly smaller f/2.2 aperture. There’s also a 2-megapixel depth sensor and a 5-megapixel front camera. Since Motorola is known for its fun photo software and smart AI, you can experiment with photography features like Spot Color, Auto Smile Capture, and Smart Compose on this phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TzYygv"&gt;The Moto G Pure is compatible with all the North American 4G LTE bands — from Verizon to Telus, but it doesn’t support any 5G networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rK2ZN2"&gt;If you want to get your hands on this Moto G Pure as soon as possible, you’ll need to pre-order the unlocked version on October 14th, which retails for $159.99. It’ll be available from Best Buy, Walmart, B&amp;amp;H Photo, Amazon and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2FMotorola.com&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F7%2F22709569%2Fmotorola-moto-g-pure-mediatek-4g-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Motorola.com&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X9PgEp"&gt;If you’re looking for carrier deals, Verizon will be offering this phone for “free” when you sign up for a new line with a 24–30-month payment plan (for $149.99 in value), starting October 14th. Metro by T-Mobile will also be offering a similar deal in the near future, but no timeline has been shared. Otherwise, you’ll need to hang tight for this phone to land in other carriers in both countries — within the next few months, according to the press release.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Surface Go 3 review: left behind</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The tradeoffs aren’t worth it anymore&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="fnJwjb"&gt;From what I can tell, Microsoft intends the Surface Go 3 to be sold to two kinds of customers: kids and IT professionals who need a tiny computer when they’re out in the field. I’m in the third category of potential customers: people who love tiny computers. For all three groups, the Surface Go 3 is a bummer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xKSISD"&gt;The Surface Go 3 is Microsoft’s smaller-sized Surface tablet. It has a 10.5-inch screen and one fewer port than its larger Pro sibling, but otherwise looks very much the same. That means it offers the same excellent build quality and overall premium design as full-sized Surface tablets. It is a great-looking device that’s often a pleasure to use — so long as you don’t use it to do too much or need it to last very long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="rWMkMz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Microsoft Surface Pro 8 review: the best of both worlds","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22709876/microsoft-surface-pro-8-review"},{"title":"Windows 11 review: a familiar home that’s still being renovated","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22708762/microsoft-windows-11-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="ELh3V1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10794418"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xid7aw"&gt;Once upon a time, if you could only spend a limited amount of money on a computer, you had to accept that it would be slow. Those times are behind us: you can get a Chromebook, an iPad, and even some Windows laptops for under $500 that will run circles around the Surface Go 3, even the higher-spec model that I’m testing with a Core i3 processor that costs $759.98 with the fancier Alcantara Type Cover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Pydw2"&gt;The Go 3 starts at $399.99 with a Y-series processor and a paltry 64GB of slower eMMC storage and 4GB of RAM. I can’t imagine anybody using that edition for anything more than light web browsing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Go 3 looks just like a tiny Surface Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3eNuDizdu8B0rm7vCqr7Pp1U4_4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22892211/vpavic_210930_4784_0028_Edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Go 3 looks just like a tiny Surface Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It works with Surface Pens, but doesn’t support the haptics on the newer pen" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T96SRgguUiRzqavdmlo8Q08ZTc0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22892219/vpavic_210930_4784_0073.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It works with Surface Pens but not haptics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MrarTl"&gt;I’ve always said the Surface Go is a fine little computer if you understand its limitations and are willing to work within them. But by the third generation, you’d think Microsoft would have found a way to either remove more of those limits or provide better tradeoffs for them. Unfortunately, neither of those things have happened this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eddVqV"&gt;The long and (especially) short of this review is simply this: four and a half hours. That’s the longest I was able to keep the Surface Go 3 running in active use. One of the apps I was running was power hungry (that’d be Slack), but the only other app was the Edge browser with somewhere around a dozen tabs. That’s it. When I took the Go 3 outside and needed to crank the brightness up, that battery life dropped to three. I’m not sure where Microsoft gets its 11-hour estimate, but it’s far from reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uVN2XM"&gt;If the battery life were better, my old advice about working within this computer’s limitations would still apply. It has Windows 11 by default — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708762/microsoft-windows-11-review"&gt;read Tom Warren’s full review here&lt;/a&gt; — and though the edges are rough, the interface overall feels really nice and usable on this smaller, 10.5-inch touchscreen. Snap Assist for tiling windows is especially useful with this smaller screen, since it’s harder to get windows to the arrangement I’m used to on bigger displays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b9kYF0"&gt;Windows 11 has an advantage over iPadOS in that it actually supports multiple users. And compared to ChromeOS, it can run many more useful apps (though not yet Android apps). But it’s possible to get all those Windows benefits without making all the compromises the Go 3 demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Windows 11 works nicely on the Go 3, albeit not quickly." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZM393CtPANRxBK8TApD_TjnNcMM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22892215/vpavic_210930_4784_0054.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 11 works nicely on the Go 3, albeit not quickly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The keyboard cover isn’t sturdy enough." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8wmX4kKzxK8F_ymO2REGNqWiaVg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22892210/vpavic_210930_4784_0023.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The keyboard cover isn’t sturdy enough.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Eo86RS"&gt;The overall physical design is unchanged — a bummer since the Surface Pro 8 got such a big update this year. It still works with the older Surface Pen design if you have one of those, but it doesn’t support haptics from the newer pen. The Type Cover still has a nice keyboard but a flimsy keyboard deck. It’s so flimsy that I often accidentally click the mouse simply by resting my hands on the palm rests when it’s on my lap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="toYwTr"&gt;Perhaps the most baffling part of the Surface Go 3 is that it isn’t using an Arm-based processor, like the Surface Pro X. If it did, I have to imagine it would get the benefits of longer battery life without taking too much of a speed hit (even the Core i3 version can’t be described as “fast”). Perhaps those aforementioned IT pros wouldn’t be able to run the apps they need on Arm — or perhaps Microsoft simply didn’t want to spend the R&amp;amp;D budget necessary to redesign the Surface Go 3 around a new chip.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A tiny computer that’s still easy to love, but hard to use." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L6xWDV6M5K452V29Q9JYtbAQQy0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22892218/vpavic_210930_4784_0069.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A tiny computer that’s still easy to love but hard to use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JbHNDR"&gt;Last year, I said the Surface Go 2 was easy to love and hard to live with. And despite everything, there are times I really do love using the Surface Go 3. There is something wonderful about having such a tiny, light device that theoretically can do anything a bigger Windows computer can do — albeit more slowly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cwFiPb"&gt;Unless having a tiny Windows tablet is an absolute necessity, there are better options. If you don’t need Windows, ChromeOS and iPad devices can be this small and last longer on a charge. If you do need Windows, there are plenty of computers that are just slightly larger but offer way better value. In fact, at this price I’d recommend tracking down a used or refurbished Surface Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="EqLsUA"&gt;The Surface Go 3 is always a joy to carry and often a joy to use, but I wish I could use it for longer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="28o5Hw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10790097"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Pixel 6’s rumored 23W wireless charging stand and more details leak early</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iAEtmEQqo6bq6jnMSFekIe1fvTQ=/0x0:660x440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69963141/FBE7SLCXsAIyNeO.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Pixel 6 handset on its rumored wireless charging stand.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1446002228410658816" target="_blank"&gt;EVLeaks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rvgrvH"&gt;Leaked images of Google’s upcoming Pixel 6 have given us our best look yet at new features coming to the search giant’s next flagship smartphone. The images, which were leaked by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1446002191110639616"&gt;Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt;, reveal shots of a second generation Pixel Stand wireless charger, user interface details, and camera specs, and include a mention of face unlock biometric security. They’ve arrived a little under two weeks before the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are due to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22691850/google-pixel-6-event-2021-fall-announcement"&gt;officially announced on October 19th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LuaWIg"&gt;There’s not much in these pictures that hasn’t already leaked, but what they offer is a better look at the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro’s rumored features. The beefy new Pixel Stand, for example, is believed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22651097/google-pixel-6-pro-stand-23w-wireless-charging"&gt;support 23W fast charging&lt;/a&gt; according to an August leak, which is more than double what was offered by Google’s first-generation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/9/17941176/google-pixel-stand-wireless-charger-announcement-price-release-date"&gt;10w wireless charger introduced with the Pixel 3&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VcJ2np"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/wrmq5KfUPE"&gt;pic.twitter.com/wrmq5KfUPE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— E (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1446002208793845765?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U7kR5z"&gt;The wireless changing stand was previously reported to have a &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-dp3-hidden-features/#android12dp3wirelesschargingfan"&gt;built-in fan for cooling&lt;/a&gt;, and these images suggest you’ll be able to switch the wireless charger between “Performance mode” and “Quiet mode” depending on whether you prioritize a faster charge or silence. The photos also show the wireless charging interface with shortcuts to media playback and smart home controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k1BAS4"&gt;Less has been reported about the phones’ face unlock functionality, which appears in one image on a settings page titled “Security.” Google previously included face unlock on the Pixel 4, but the feature was entirely absent from the Pixel 5 lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="byDGJL"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/k52z1kuU2g"&gt;pic.twitter.com/k52z1kuU2g&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— E (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1446002222777737221?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qYxTpK"&gt;There’s also a shot of the rear of the Pixel 6 Pro, showing off its three-camera setup. Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml#:~:text=It%20has%20three,the%20telephoto%20camera."&gt;previously confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that the 6 Pro will have an ultrawide and a telephoto flanking the main camera, but this image confirms &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pixel-6-camera-features-revealed/"&gt;rumors&lt;/a&gt; that they’ll use 12-megapixel, 48-megapixel, and 50-megapixel sensors, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jR1DLD"&gt;Other shots include a look at the phone’s charging brick, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628702/google-pixel-6-charger-not-included"&gt;which won’t be included in the box&lt;/a&gt;, as well as photos of the phone splashed with water, suggesting it’ll have an IP-rating for dust and water resistance. The latter isn’t particularly surprising, since even Google’s mid-range &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;Pixel 5A&lt;/a&gt; includes an IP67 rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMz3Vm"&gt;The main feature the images aren’t able to offer any more details on is the Pixel 6’s&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676099/google-pixel-6-tensor-processor-rumor-arm-cortex-x1-core-mystery-strange"&gt; custom-designed Tensor processor&lt;/a&gt;, which Google says will improve the phones’ machine learning capabilities. For those details, we’ll have to wait until the Pixel 6’s official launch later this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B6EE9F"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Kinect is back, thanks to Sky’s new all-in-one TVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g4-csRzDFwuhaR6QYqSukNmFj9Y=/171x0:2010x1226/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69962968/skyglasscamera.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sky Glass camera looks like a Kinect.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sky&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TGUqX6"&gt;Sky is resurrecting the original dream of Microsoft’s Kinect accessory next year. The British satellite broadcaster &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714076/sky-glass-tv-streaming-service-uk-pricing-release-date"&gt;announced its new Sky Glass TVs&lt;/a&gt; this morning, and the company has built a separate 4K camera that includes motion controls and gestures support. It even works across games, and has a social TV sharing feature built in partnership with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ya2N3k"&gt;“Working with Microsoft we’re also building a fantastic feature that lets us watch TV together even if we’re miles apart,” explains Fraser Stirling, Sky’s chief product officer. “It syncs your TV with other households, with integrated video and chat on-screen, and you can choose content from the biggest channels — including Premier League matches, movies, and all your favorite entertainment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bIwPSf"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Sky Kinect|104260" data-volume-uuid="54ac06370" data-volume-id="104260" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-279" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="chorus"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sky’s new watch together feature is a partnership with Microsoft.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SPPVU5"&gt;The social TV feature is exactly what Microsoft tried and failed to do with its Kinect accessory in 2013. The Xbox One launched with Kinect, and the console included a HDMI-in port to access TV satellite providers like Sky and cable boxes. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/8/5075216/xbox-one-tv-microsofts-plan-to-take-over-the-living-room"&gt;Microsoft had some big plans for TV on Xbox&lt;/a&gt;, and even experimented with social features allowing Xbox owners to watch TV together. Ultimately, the Kinect bundling failed and the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/28/12049584/first-click-the-xbox-one-isnt-my-cord-cutting-dream-anymore"&gt;walked back all of its bold TV plans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IPkify"&gt;Sky’s watch together feature, built in partnership with Microsoft, will allow people to see each other’s reactions instantly. You can also pause, skip, and replay as you watch together. Where this camera gets really interesting is the motion controls and gesture support for gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v6wMIE"&gt;Games will be available on Sky Glass TVs that specifically support this new camera, including a Paw Patrol-branded title and &lt;em&gt;Fruit Ninja. &lt;/em&gt;The camera will enable multiplayer games, too. “Pick your opponent, either at home or another household and play through your body movement or gesture control,” says Stirling. “Family games are never going to be the same again.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AZWjzMPHBZfzaybIdyODPl16CKc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22907065/skyglasscamera.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sky&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sky Glass camera will support motion controls for games.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Fd1VMD"&gt;Sky is also investing heavily into voice controls on its Sky Glass TVs. “Hello, Sky” activates Sky’s voice commands, much like a digital assistant, and you’ll even be able to use it to switch HDMI ports by saying “Sky, Xbox” to switch to an Xbox console if you have one connected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r4HiTM"&gt;It all sounds and looks very much like Kinect. Microsoft dreamed big about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/8/5075216/xbox-one-tv-microsofts-plan-to-take-over-the-living-room"&gt;taking over the living room&lt;/a&gt; with smart cameras and voice controls, and now Sky is trying to keep that dream alive.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bl6ETq"&gt;Anker’s Soundcore brand is today refreshing its flagship true wireless earbuds with the new $169.99 Liberty 3 Pros. Both the earbuds and their slider-style charging case look very similar to the Liberty 2 Pros, though the buds are 30 percent smaller and have an “air pressure relief structure” in their wingtips for added comfort. Anker has made more significant improvements to the features they offer: the new earbuds have active noise cancellation — you’d hope for as much at this price — and the “HearID ANC” system is optimized for efficiency and comfort. Anker says it monitors outside ambient noise while also taking in-ear pressure into account, so the level of ANC automatically adapts to the environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iGatIW"&gt;The dual-driver acoustic architecture of the Liberty 3 Pros has been refined, and these earbuds join Sony’s WF-1000XM4s in offering upgraded audio quality thanks to their support for the LDAC codec. There aren’t many wireless earbuds out there that offer LDAC (though aptX HD is more common), so hopefully, this will be the start of a trend. AAC and SBC codecs are also supported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTf8GG"&gt;The charging case charge features wireless charging, and Anker says the earbuds can hit up to six hours of continuous playback with ANC enabled or eight with it off. The case stores an additional 24 or 32 hours, respectively. Anker says its fast charge capabilities can give you three hours of playback if you plug in and charge the earbuds over USB-C for just 15 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="due9HN"&gt;Anker will offer the Liberty 3 Pros in four different colors: black, white, silver, gray, and purple. They’re rated IPX4 for water and sweat resistance and have three different transparency modes for when you do need some environmental awareness. You can order the new buds starting today. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22323748/anker-liberty-air-2-pro-review-wireless-headphone-price"&gt;Becca reviewed the Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Pros&lt;/a&gt;, which have a more AirPods-esque design and are priced at $130. As is often the case with Anker, they’re a very competitive product for the asking price. But with the Liberty 3 Pros priced a good bit higher, Anker will be facing off with plenty of worthy alternatives. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snap is taking action to address fentanyl dealing on Snapchat</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WuGqcuw-1OGdDzXHxYwHrIcFuGE=/0x0:911x607/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69962866/Heads_Up_Triptych___cropped.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Users will be directed to an educational portal if they search for certain keywords.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Snapchat&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gjFI6O"&gt;Snapchat has announced a series of measures it’s taking to counter drug dealing on its platform, and to educate users about the dangers of fentanyl and other drugs. When users search for drug-related keywords like “fentanyl,” Snap says it will direct them to a new educational portal called Heads Up. It’s also ramping up actions against drug dealers on its platform, including improved in-app reporting tools and proactive detection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cfb0Vq"&gt;The announcements follow a recent &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/pills-bought-on-snapchat-deadly/index.html"&gt;investigation by &lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; into a spate of deaths involving teens and young adults who were suspected of having bought fentanyl-laced drugs through the social network. The report alleged that drug dealers are able to use Snapchat to find buyers, and that the platform isn’t doing enough to remove their accounts and keep them off the platform. The social network was also accused of taking too long to provide information to law enforcement. However, Snap says the initiatives have been in development for months, and that today’s announcement would have happened regardless of the &lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt; report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kY0FoM"&gt;Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that’s complicit in an alarming increase in deaths in the United States in recent years. In 2019, nearly 50,000 people in the US are believed to have died from overdoses involving opioids, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/drug-topics/opioids/opioid-overdose-crisis"&gt;National Institute on Drug Abuse&lt;/a&gt;. According to Snap, drug dealers include fentanyl in counterfeit Vicodin or Xanax prescription pills, which are then bought by unwitting customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LJj34P"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A new Heads Up portal will direct users to educational content&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xMP1Sy"&gt;In its blog post, Snapchat stresses that it’s taking more enforcement action against dealers on its platform. It says that enforcement rates have more than doubled in the first half of 2021, and that its systems have proactively detected 260 percent more material than it did previously. It says that nearly two-thirds of drug-related content is proactively discovered by its artificial intelligence systems and adds that it’s improved its response time to valid law enforcement requests by 85 percent year over year. Nevertheless, Snap admits it still has more work to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mK7t5X"&gt;As well as more proactively removing drug dealers from its platform, Snap points towards research its commissioned that suggests some users are unaware of how dangerous fentanyl can be — something its Heads Up portal is designed to address. Snap says it will be promoting the portal, as well as the dangers of fentanyl more generally via a new filter, and that it will also discuss the crisis in upcoming episodes of its Snap Original show &lt;em&gt;Good Luck America&lt;/em&gt;. Expert organizations contributing to Heads Up include Song for Charlie, Shatterproof, and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), with resources from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to be added in the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Obac45"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 7th, 6:51AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated with Snap’s statement that its work on the initiatives predate the report from &lt;/em&gt;NBC News&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sky’s new Glass TVs ditch satellite dishes for Wi-Fi</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Su3sncNLg53FCTLJzGios1cm-ps=/469x0:5532x3375/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69962840/Sky_Glass___Racing_green___Home_page.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sky Glass TVs stream channels over Wi-Fi instead of satellite dishes.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sky&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e5tGLM"&gt;British Satellite broadcaster Sky is moving away from the satellite dishes that have defined its TV service for decades. Sky Glass is launching today, an ambitious effort to sell television sets that stream Sky TV content over Wi-Fi directly to consumers. There’s no external box, no satellite dish, and no need for a soundbar. Sky calls the all-in-one TV “no fuss.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s0yBdX"&gt;Although announced for the UK today, Sky has global aspirations for Glass TV “built on technology borne of the collaboration as part of the Comcast Corporation.” As such, we might be looking at the platform underpinning Comcast’s rumored &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22685538/comcast-xclass-tv-sky-q-smart-tv-hisense-x1-operating-system"&gt;XClass TVs&lt;/a&gt; for the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QHF5Qz"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sky.com%2Fglass&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F7%2F22714076%2Fsky-glass-tv-streaming-service-uk-pricing-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sky Glass TVs&lt;/a&gt; will be available in three sizes: 43-inch, 55-inch, and 65-inch. Each 4K TV will stream Sky’s TV channels, and integrates in voice control (Hello Sky) and 21 apps to access additional content like Netflix, Spotify, or Disney Plus. Sky hasn’t named the TV manufacturer it partnered with yet, but the full specifications include a UHD Quantum Dot display, support for Dolby Vision, HDR 10, HLG, three HDMI 2.1 ports, and a single USB-C port. The rather chubby TV fits six speakers for up to 215W of Dolby Atmos surround sound: 3 outward firing speakers, 2 upward, and 1 central subwoofer. There will also be five color options: white, pink, green, blue, and black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y6_dvhGot_6yiby9aHrRZEhz1xo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22907030/skyglasstvs.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sky&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sky Glass TVs come in three sizes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KzZP5itoxFwj8Uf9GmLwobvJEKk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22907031/Sky_Glass_Voice_remote___lifestyle__TV_in_action.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sky&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s voice support or the usual TV remote.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fc6eVy"&gt;The price of a Sky Glass TV is designed to be baked into a monthly subscription to Sky’s TV service, known as Sky Ultimate TV, but you can also pay for the TV upfront if you want to lower the monthly costs. Sky Ultimate TV includes access to Netflix and some basic Sky channels, but Sky Sports and Sky Cinema are separate add-ons. What you pay will depend on the size of TV and whether you want to spread payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z8Tk1U"&gt;The smallest 43-inch model is £649 upfront, or you can spread the payments at £13 per month over 48 months, or £26 per month over 24 months. The 55-inch model works out at £849 upfront, or £17 per month over 48 months, and £34 per month over 24 months. The largest 65-inch Sky Glass TV is £1,049 upfront, or £21 per month over 48 months, and £42 per month over 24 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ugTPH"&gt;That means the cheapest option for a Sky Glass TV is £39 per month for the smaller 43-inch model, unless you’re willing to pay for it upfront and pay the £26 per month subscription separately. Sky has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sky.com%2Fglass%2Ftechnical-specifications%2F43inch%3Fcontract%3D48months%26irct%3DglassHome-glass-techSpecs&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F7%2F22714076%2Fsky-glass-tv-streaming-service-uk-pricing-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;full pricing options here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wzJWrF0mVbrhU2sGKW5zEG1QFPY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22907039/skyglasspucksandremote.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sky&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sky Stream pucks also let you stream Sky channels to existing TVs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qJO7JG"&gt;Sky is also offering Sky Stream pucks at £50 each upfront, which you can use in other rooms of your house to stream Sky content to existing TVs. These appear to be offered only as add-ons, much like Sky’s multiscreen offering, so you can’t purchase a Sky Stream puck without a Sky Glass TV. Sky Stream pucks will also require a £10 monthly subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YZugX9"&gt;Sky describes its new Glass TVs as a “voice-first” platform, so while there is a separate remote, the company is pushing voice commands more than ever before. “Hello Sky” activates Sky’s voice commands, much like a digital assistant, and you’ll even be able to use it to switch HDMI ports by saying “Sky, Xbox” to switch to an Xbox console if you have one connected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k0IInO"&gt;Sky is also working on a 4K smart camera that will attach to its Sky Glass TVs and will launch in 2022. It looks a lot like Microsoft’s Kinect camera, and it even includes body tracking and motion controls just like Kinect. Sky boldly claims it will “transform how we chat, play games, workout, and share entertainment at home.” It will support apps like Zoom, and includes noise-cancellation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oW_pW3SfiX2feqEPrMTmO2vSwT4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22907038/skyglasscamera.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sky&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sky Glass 4K webcam looks like a Kinect.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DlRlSJ"&gt;The most interesting aspect of the camera is Sky’s collaboration with Microsoft to watch TV together with others. Sky demonstrated a software experience that allows you to watch TV channels with others, and see each other’s reactions to sport in real time. This is something Microsoft always wanted to deliver through its Kinect work, so it’s interesting to see the company with Sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HDUlQS"&gt;This camera includes motion controls, allowing Sky Glass owners to access “family games” and control them with their body. This was always the dream of Kinect on Xbox, and it looks like Sky is trying to resurrect it with Sky Glass TVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="peBibH"&gt;While Sky has detailed its hardware today, we’re still waiting to hear more on how the company is streaming its content over the web. TV providers have struggled to stream live TV without a delay over the internet, which is particularly jarring when you’re watching live sport and neighbors cheer or you see the score on Twitter before it happens on your screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNJi7n"&gt;Sky says you’ll need a minimum connection of 10Mbps to stream HD content through a Sky Glass TV, or 25Mbps for 4K. That’s identical to the minimums for Netflix, but Sky hasn’t detailed what bitrates and streaming protocols it’s using yet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vE7wNVg5KKQN2B2nf8Im3Ill8Nk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22907034/white3.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sky&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;It’s not the thinnest of TVs.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nwjjKD"&gt;Sky also says it will be the first TV manufacturer in the world to have a swap program, allowing customers to swap old Sky Glass TVs for newer models when they’re available. It’s not immediately clear how that will work, but it will likely only be offered to those who spread the cost in Sky’s monthly subscriptions instead of buying the TV upfront.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VO1fIG"&gt;Sky Glass won’t be limited to the UK, either. Sky has built these TVs so other telcos and television operators can launch Sky Glass TVs, too. Australia’s Foxtel Group will launch Sky Glass at some point in the future, and Sky says this is the “first of many collaborations as Sky Glass is scaled across the globe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CSQ1Vc"&gt;Sky Glass TVs could also form the basis of Comcast’s XClass TVs, as Sky notes its TVs are “built on technology borne of the collaboration as part of the Comcast Corporation.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22685538/comcast-xclass-tv-sky-q-smart-tv-hisense-x1-operating-system"&gt;Rumors suggest&lt;/a&gt; Comcast’s upcoming TVs will run Comcast’s X1 OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cDqK6t"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Comcast is an investor in Vox Media, The Verge’s parent company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox Cloud Gaming is now fully powered by faster Xbox Series X hardware</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D9AzVTO8-NlHpWbmmzgiyxot1v0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69962830/acastro_210429_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1m9G7M"&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox Cloud Gaming service (xCloud) is now fully powered by custom Xbox Series X hardware. Microsoft tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it recently completed the upgrade, which improves both framerates and game load times for players streaming Xbox games over the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gHNjNb"&gt;While Microsoft has moved Xbox Cloud Gaming to 1080p and 60fps streams in recent months, the company has yet to unlock the full potential of custom Xbox Series X hardware to deliver 4K streams. It’s not clear when this will be available, but Microsoft has been moving towards delivering Xbox Cloud Gaming beyond just mobile devices and browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1WkLc"&gt;Microsoft is currently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527420/microsoft-xbox-tv-app-streaming-stick-xcloud"&gt;working on a dedicated Xbox app for TVs&lt;/a&gt; that will allow Xbox players to stream games without a console. Standalone streaming devices that you can plug into a TV or monitor are also planned, and it’s reasonable to assume there could be further upgrades to the Xbox Cloud Gaming resolution to match this TV push.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fA5Sjfsim5U23N2FXiJUwzr7yjA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22802300/Xbox_Game_Pass___Minecraft_Dungeons.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xbox Game Pass is getting integrated into the Xbox dashboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="R4iVxE"&gt;Xbox Cloud Gaming started off as a way to play games on mobile devices, but with its upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22698101/microsoft-xcloud-xbox-cloud-gaming-console-integration"&gt;integration into the Xbox dashboard&lt;/a&gt; and TVs, it’s already becoming a lot more than just a mobile offering. Microsoft is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710708/microsoft-xbox-web-store-xcloud-cloud-gaming-wishlists-features"&gt;integrating Xbox Cloud Gaming into its new Xbox web store&lt;/a&gt; that’s starting to rollout, and we’re still waiting to hear more about its plans to bring its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299032/microsoft-mixer-closing-facebook-gaming-partnership-xcloud-features"&gt;xCloud technology to Facebook Gaming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ubqJ95"&gt;Microsoft also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22701912/xbox-cloud-gaming-xcloud-australia-brazil-mexico-japan-launch-october"&gt;recently expanded Xbox Cloud Gaming&lt;/a&gt; to Australia, Brazil, Mexico, and Japan, shortly after completing its custom Xbox Series X hardware upgrade for the service. Microsoft’s xCloud tech is now available in 26 countries, and the company has previously hinted at “new subscription offerings for Xbox Game Pass,” so we could see additional tiers that provide access to Xbox Cloud Gaming soon.&lt;/p&gt;
