    <title>LG denies the Rollable phone has been put on hold</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TqQeaVOklqPzLrYnZIpT9moH_yE=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68859280/LGRollable.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="71AgBO"&gt;LG Electronics has told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company’s phone with a resizable screen, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226532/lgs-rollable-phone-launch-release-date-ces-2021"&gt;the LG Rollable&lt;/a&gt;, has not been put on hold. “I can firmly deny that any such decision on future mobile products has been finalized,” says an LG spokesperson. The denial comes in response to &lt;a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20210222005600320"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;Yonhap News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that LG had reportedly told parts suppliers that the Rollable had been put on hold and that they could request a refund for their development efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WO1AeI"&gt;Denying that a final decision has been made is not quite the same thing as reassuring everyone that the Rollable is still coming in 2021, but it could reflect the general uncertainty that comes with designing, manufacturing, and shipping complicated electronics during a global pandemic. And it could also be that the &lt;em&gt;Yonhap News&lt;/em&gt; report is somewhere near the truth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iidMdy"&gt;LG also firmly denied a report in January that it was planning to exit the smartphone business, and Korean outlet &lt;em&gt;TheElec &lt;/em&gt;wound up deleting that report, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22240282/lg-smartphone-business-exit-2021-internal-memo"&gt;only to see LG turn around later and admit that it was indeed considering an exit from smartphones&lt;/a&gt;, even if the decision hadn’t been finalized yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1cqafV"&gt;If LG did decide to put the Rollable on hold, it could be to change release dates or to re-engineer some part of its design. Not every change in manufacturing schedule necessarily means cancellation. It would probably come as a surprise to LG employees if it did get canceled, though: &lt;em&gt;TheElec&lt;/em&gt;’s now-deleted story originally suggested that smartphone business or no, Project I (LG’s codename for the Rollable) would continue, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/lg-not-shutting-down-smartphone-business/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; wrote&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TgPYyP"&gt;LG has had a hard time competing with other smartphone makers like Samsung or Huawei, and its smartphone business has lost approximately $4.5 billion over the last five years. But it has seemed committed to making sure the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536659/lg-wing-review-dual-screen-price-specs-features"&gt;LG Wing&lt;/a&gt; isn’t the last “unique” phone design it releases. The Rollable’s future is uncertain, but the story definitely isn’t over yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cLBw29"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BATTGi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FDHcEJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ejHZqN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Is1ek"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWy0oK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google has finally added iOS’s privacy labels to Gmail</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lDiTaGgRPH8tpV59gVwCp7BsgcU=/0x0:1125x750/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68859215/IMG_0879.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Screenshot: &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0Pn0zK"&gt;Google has finally added Apple App Store privacy labels to its Gmail app, almost a month after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250648/google-apple-app-store-privacy-label"&gt;we ran an article wondering what was taking so long&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/22/google-gmail-app-privacy-labels/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The app is the second major Google app to get the labels, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/13/22282000/google-bug-fix-ios-youtube-app-privacy-apple-gmail-docs-search-update"&gt;they were added to YouTube&lt;/a&gt; when it was updated earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ohaNAl"&gt;So how does it look? Well, that’s up for you to decide. The app apparently shares your coarse location and user ID with advertisers, as well as information about your interaction with advertisements. According to the privacy label, though, it doesn’t collect your name, physical address, or phone number (though as an email client, Gmail obviously collects your email address). Location data is also used for analytics and there are some features of the app that will request it as well. If you want to see the full label, there’s a video below that scrolls through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Xqi01Q"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;What does the app privacy label for Gmail look like? See for yourself. &lt;a href="https://t.co/LpOPfg4Iq2"&gt;pic.twitter.com/LpOPfg4Iq2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mitchell (@strawberrywell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/strawberrywell/status/1364014742419828743?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jIwgfq"&gt;For contrast, here’s the app privacy information for another email app, Hey. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oIoCTNloyt8hSUXVNmV2j_Uazt8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22321818/IMG_0882.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The information Hey requests fits on one page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="57dzTT"&gt;It is worth noting that Apple’s app privacy labels are meant to show all the things that the app &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; access, not what information that app &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; access. For example, an app may only use location data when it needs to show you a map, but the privacy labels don’t make that clear — it’s just a binary used/not used. Also, the information in the labels is submitted by the company itself, and Apple doesn’t make promises about its accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="59vquM"&gt;Strangely, Google added the labels without actually updating the Gmail app, even though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22277304/google-ios-apps-out-of-date-update-message"&gt;it was literally crying out for an update&lt;/a&gt; (because of a fun bug). The last time Google updated the iOS app was two months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2zzyIO"&gt;So far, Google’s other large apps like Maps, Photos, Docs, and Chrome haven’t gotten the labels yet. But the fact that both YouTube and Gmail have had them added indicates that Google is starting to roll them out to its bigger apps.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk says Starlink internet speeds will double to 300 Mbps this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ssh5y_HqBQk8flDyMaCEK7q7SOA=/426x0:2418x1328/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68858859/Screen_Shot_2020_09_03_at_10.38.05_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: SpaceX&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4g4FjE"&gt;Starlink, SpaceX’s satellite-based internet provider, will double in speed “later this year”, according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1363763858121256963?s=20"&gt;a tweet by Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt;, posted as a reply to someone who had just received their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536073/spacex-starlink-public-beta-testing-email-user-terminal"&gt;Starlink beta kit&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/elon-musk-spacex-will-double-starlinks-satellite-internet-speeds-in-2021/?ServiceType=facebook_page&amp;amp;UniqueID=D7D4F968-7539-11EB-B2F4-9E263A982C1E&amp;amp;PostType=link&amp;amp;ftag=COS-05-10aaa0a&amp;amp;TheTime=2021-02-22T18:14:45"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The company &lt;a href="https://www.starlink.com"&gt;currently promises speeds between 50 to 150 Mbps&lt;/a&gt;, and Musk specifically calls out a 300 Mbps goal in his tweet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Z4EGl"&gt;While 300 Mbps isn’t unheard-of speed, it’s faster than many people currently have access to, especially in the low-to-medium population density areas that Musk talks about targeting in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1363774017606348802?s=20"&gt;a second tweet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4z4Yxo"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Speed will double to ~300Mb/s &amp;amp; latency will drop to ~20ms later this year&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1363763858121256963?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="jAsFxM"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Most of Earth by end of year, all by next year, then it’s about densifying coverage. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Important to note that cellular will always have the advantage in dense urban areas. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Satellites are best for low to medium population density areas.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1363774017606348802?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MbHOoo"&gt;In the reply, Elon also tells the person that their latency should improve to around 20ms as well. In the speed test screenshots, their latency was at 34 and 44ms respectively, while Starlink’s website says to expect between 20 and 40ms during the beta. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FdLDn1"&gt;The speed increase and latency improvements should come as a nice surprise to anyone who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274385/musk-spacex-starlink-deposit-price-satellite-internet"&gt;put down a $100 Starlink pre-order&lt;/a&gt;. However, it’s well known that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/8/7/20758944/elon-musk-twitter-tesla-funding-secured-private-420"&gt;Elon’s promises about the future should be taken with a grain of salt&lt;/a&gt;, especially if &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/27/13024542/elon-musk-spacex-mission-to-mars-preview-budget-schedule-nasa"&gt;they’re about timelines&lt;/a&gt;. Still, this shows that SpaceX is looking to speed up Starlink, and it might be able to keep pace with what’s available from a copper wire running to your house. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lucid Motors is going public in a major SPAC merger</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lGzfPBEZNRPgCMsbUSBai1eVL3k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68858569/akrales_170324_1554_A_0021.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LX5SBy"&gt;Lucid Motors is going to become a publicly-traded company on the New York Stock Exchange in a deal that will leave the electric vehicle startup with $4.4 billion in cash. The California startup, which is majority-owned by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, plans to start shipping its first luxury electric vehicle — the 500-mile range Air sedan — later this year. An electric SUV is slated to follow in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VxUhx6"&gt;Much like many other startups in the automotive space have done over the past year, Lucid Motors is skipping the traditional path to becoming a publicly-traded company and is instead merging with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, Lucid Motors is merging with Churchill Capital Corp IV, which is already listed on the NYSE. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; first reported that Lucid Motors and Churchill — which is run by investor Michael Klein, who has architected deals for Saudi Arabia in the past — &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-11/lucid-motors-said-to-be-in-talks-to-list-via-michael-klein-spac?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;were in talks back in January&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QZLjky"&gt;Roughly $2.1 billion of that cash will come from Churchill. Some $2.5 billion will come from a new round of funding running concurrently with the merger, which is anchored by Saudi Arabia but includes BlackRock, Fidelity Management, and others. The deal values Lucid Motors at $24 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DMKFCk"&gt;Led by Peter Rawlinson, a former Tesla engineer who helped bring the Model S to life, Lucid Motors was founded way back in 2007 as Atieva. It was initially focused on battery technology, but ultimately pivoted into becoming an electric vehicle startup a few years ago. It has since grown to more than 2,000 employees and begun construction on a $700 million factory in Arizona where the Air will be built. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sp65Yt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony is bringing back Twisted Metal... as a TV show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vk0oCLWqIPpJD2lywHB0MeFlLtU=/0x100:1322x981/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68858065/Twisted_metal.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;em&gt;Twisted Metal Wiki&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dXeJYE"&gt;Sony is bringing back its &lt;em&gt;Twisted Metal &lt;/em&gt;franchise, but this time it’s going to be a TV show, not a video game. &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/twisted-metal-tv-series-deadpool-writers-1234911825/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the show is moving ahead in its production, with the writers of &lt;em&gt;Deadpool&lt;/em&gt; and actor Will Arnett signed on as executive producers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X5i8WA"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Twisted Metal&lt;/em&gt; games center mainly around getting in a heavily armored car and blowing other drivers up. The series, which the head of PlayStation Productions calls “one of the most beloved franchises from PlayStation,” started on the original PS1 and got releases on the PS2 and PS3 as well (though my personal favorite was &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twisted_Metal:_Head-On"&gt;the PSP version&lt;/a&gt;, which I sunk hours upon hours into). The series went dormant during the years of the PlayStation 4, however, with no signs of a console comeback any time soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JztXeL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The show will be going for a comedic (but probably not lighthearted) tone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9NcR4f"&gt;The show’s plot synopsis reads like a cross between &lt;em&gt;Mad Max &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Death Race&lt;/em&gt;, with a car thief and vague protagonist having to fight down highways to deliver a package. It’s also rumored to include Needles Kane, the terrifying clown whose face or ice cream truck (named Sweet Tooth) grace the cover of pretty much every game in the series. If you’ve been bummed that &lt;em&gt;Twisted Metal: Apocalypse &lt;/em&gt;never saw the light of day, maybe this TV show will scratch that itch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NpQjMW"&gt;While the idea for the series seemingly came from Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, who wrote the &lt;em&gt;Deadpool &lt;/em&gt;movies, the actual writing was done by &lt;em&gt;Cobra Kai&lt;/em&gt;’s Michael Jonathan Smith. It seems like the show will be going for a comedic (but probably not lighthearted) tone, with Sony Pictures’ Glenn Adilman, the company’s executive vice president of comedy development, calling the script “action-packed [and] brilliantly funny.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PXSpdb"&gt;The return to the property comes after a long drought: the first &lt;em&gt;Twisted Metal &lt;/em&gt;game came out in 1995, and the most recent one was released in 2012 for the PlayStation 3. It’s a bit strange that Sony is making a television show about a franchise that hasn’t seen a release in almost a decade — especially since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22261214/destruction-allstars-playstation-5-ps5-sony-interview-cars-demolition-derby"&gt;one of the flagship PS5 games is &lt;em&gt;Destruction AllStars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which has the same theme of vehicular violence. That’s not to say that &lt;em&gt;AllStars &lt;/em&gt;should’ve been a &lt;em&gt;Twisted Metal &lt;/em&gt;game, just that it might be a bit awkward if the &lt;em&gt;Twisted Metal&lt;/em&gt; show and &lt;em&gt;Destruction AllStars&lt;/em&gt; were stopped at a red light next to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XDwCgS"&gt;It’s unclear when the show will come out, but it probably won’t be any time soon — it seems like it’s just now cleared to start production. It’s also worth noting that Sony has tried to make a &lt;em&gt;Twisted Metal&lt;/em&gt; movie before, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2012/02/ghost-riders-brian-taylor-in-7-figure-sony-deal-to-writedirect-twisted-metal-movie-231020/"&gt;which was announced in 2012&lt;/a&gt;. In 2017, &lt;a href="https://collider.com/twisted-metal-movie-update-brian-taylor/#nicolas-cage-sweet-tooth"&gt;the man who was supposed to have directed&lt;/a&gt; it said that it fell apart because Sony didn’t want to spend the amount of money needed to make it feel like, well, &lt;em&gt;Twisted Metal&lt;/em&gt;. Hopefully the show will get the budget, otherwise fans may wish they had heeded the lesson &lt;em&gt;Twisted Metal &lt;/em&gt;games always end on: be careful what you wish for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d9xXVA"&gt;If and when the show starts hitting screens, it’ll likely be part of Sony’s first wave of PlayStation-based film and television content, including the upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/20/21583442/hbo-the-last-of-us-tv-show-playstation-neil-druckmann-craig-mazin-series-order"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Last Of Us&lt;/em&gt; HBO show&lt;/a&gt; starring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22277687/mandalorian-star-pedro-pascal-joel-hbo-the-last-of-us-tv-show"&gt;Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528606/tom-holland-nathan-drake-first-photo-uncharted-movie-sony"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; movie&lt;/a&gt; staring Tom Holland and Antonio Banderas. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dish is confident in its plan to offer 5G in its first major cities by end of Q3 2021</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QclUa4"&gt;Dish Network co-founder and chairman Charlie Ergen underscored the company’s commitment to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/26/8931827/dish-carrier-plans-5g-network-tmobile-sprint-us-confirms"&gt;building a 5G wireless network&lt;/a&gt; on today’s Q4 2020 earnings call. He restated the intention to bring 5G online in its first major cities by the end of Q3 2021 — that’s the period running from July through September — and was bullish on Dish’s ability to boost the US’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"&gt;somewhat dismal global position&lt;/a&gt; in terms of wireless network offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="px7YNP"&gt;Ergen spent several minutes on &lt;a href="https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/yi3fxcbb"&gt;today’s call&lt;/a&gt; recapping what the company has done so far in its network-building effort. With its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21309968/dish-boost-sprint-tmobile-acquisition-spinoff-closes-prepaid"&gt;acquisition of Boost Mobile&lt;/a&gt; last year, it’s currently offering prepaid service as an MVNO on T-Mobile’s network, but it has also been accumulating its own spectrum to make the move to a full-fledged carrier. That’s a good sign for wireless competition in the US; with Sprint no longer available as a choice, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20708411/dish-tmobile-sprint-carrer-merger-assets-spectrum-boost"&gt;Dish is positioned to step up&lt;/a&gt; as a fourth major carrier option. And it kind of has to in order to satisfy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21134278/sprint-tmobile-merger-court-ruling-opinion-decision-explainer-carriers-antitrust"&gt;the conditions of the T-Mobile-Sprint merger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PchgGb"&gt;To that end, Dish made low-, mid-, and high-band spectrum purchases last year, and it’s &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/regulatory/c-band-assignment-phase-kicks-off-february-8"&gt;estimated to have spent $2 billion&lt;/a&gt; in the recent C-band auction. With access to these different kinds of spectrum, Dish has the pieces of the so-called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21284203/5g-need-to-know-health-safety-radiowave-spectrum-verizon-att-tmobile-cellular-data"&gt;5G “layer cake”&lt;/a&gt; that will help it establish fast service with wide coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="PnayvP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"5G in the US is disappointing right now, but it’s going to get better","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"},{"title":"The iPhone 12 series is already driving 5G adoption in the US","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287683/iphone-12-pro-max-5g-sales-adoption"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="lKc9dQ"&gt;“This isn’t our first rodeo,” Ergen said, stressing his confidence in the company’s ability to execute, despite the considerable risks. He didn’t stop there either; Ergen believes Dish can “help the United States actually start leading again in wireless.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CUHguA"&gt;Maybe he’s right. There’s a big challenge ahead of Dish, but the company doesn’t face one of the challenges plaguing the major carriers right now: keeping 4G data flowing while adding 5G. This has led Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T, in particular, to turn to a technology called Dynamic Spectrum Sharing, or DSS, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22196060/verizon-5g-slower-than-lte-speed-test"&gt;poor results&lt;/a&gt;. Sadly, the bar is quite low at the moment for US networks, which might help Dish get a running start.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s where and when you can buy the Xbox Series S and Series X consoles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F-XyU5rsEElrPRnqeZ6FTPpJqdU=/0x0:1220x813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67448810/twarren_200909_4177_0030.0.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mlkkez"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update February 22nd, 2021 4:55PM ET: The Xbox Series S is currently available at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733050721171570442" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Best Buy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; for $299.99. You can find more information &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22296076/xbox-series-s-restock-best-buy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZoKH5"&gt;The Xbox Series S and Series X consoles are officially out, and if you missed out on preordering either (or both — look, I’m not going to judge), you might be able to snag one online soon. Due to the pandemic, combined with the high demand for these consoles, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551484/best-buy-playstation-5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-store-sales-holiday-2020"&gt;retailers like Best Buy and Target are only selling online&lt;/a&gt;. That means you won’t be able to walk into a store to pick one up — unless you’ve purchased it already online. Only then will you be able to arrange an in-store pickup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5s3rFB"&gt;Until we hear updates on stock replenishing from retailers, I recommend keeping it locked to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08H75RTZ8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl2&amp;amp;tag=verge-evergreen-20&amp;amp;linkId=e8ef14f64e0e9e1dacba6db0add8b578&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Fxbox-series-x-video-games%2F-%2FN-fd2hh&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21437954%2Fxbox-series-x-s-preorder-us-retailers-microsoft-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fconsoles" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fxbox-series-x%2Fconsoles" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fpromotions%2Fgaming%2F20-1310%2Findex.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg&lt;/a&gt;, and (if you have memberships) &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/xbox-brand-showcase.html"&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsclub.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-series-x%2Fprod24980179&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21437954%2Fxbox-series-x-s-preorder-us-retailers-microsoft-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sam’s Club&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723309405282483811" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy encourages shoppers to visit its site&lt;/a&gt; to order instead of showing up at its stores. It doesn’t have set time slots for when it expects stock to be available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lVxesu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="hLH7PZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ejjLHa"&gt;If you’re trying to decide between the Xbox Series S or Series X, my colleague Tom Warren recently reviewed both consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="cqFv0O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Xbox Series X review: a next-gen PC","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"},{"title":"Xbox Series S review: small console, big potential","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21549021/xbox-series-s-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h1 id="hCC7LP"&gt;Buy with the Xbox All Access plan&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="tnxiJL"&gt;As an alternative to paying full price upfront for each console, you can pay a monthly installment for either of them through the Xbox All Access plan. It’s a financing option that lets you get the console upfront at no cost. You’ll be billed one monthly payment for the console and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate together ($24.99 per month for the Series S, $34.99 per month for the Series X) for 24 months.

    <title>Xbox Series S is in stock at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D2Y_UmJIALkpuXAhDAF4zaVxpMQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68857913/vpavic_4275_20201030_0038.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6AgAag"&gt;Last November, Microsoft debuted two next-gen consoles — the Xbox Series X and the more affordable Xbox Series S. If you are looking for the more affordable next-gen Xbox, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733050721171570442" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; has the console in stock right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qyA4VQ"&gt;The Xbox Series S variant costs $299, is smaller, and is less powerful than the $500 Series X. One other important thing to note is the Xbox Series S is a digital-only console, meaning it lacks a disc drive to play physical games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RsBijG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QU1oLf"&gt;If you plan to buy this console, you may want to consider picking up a few accessories that will help you get the most out of your new gadget, most notably &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DF26MXW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an additional controller&lt;/a&gt; if you are playing a game with a local co-op with a friend or family member. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tp76dt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562380"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dv0OUa"&gt;As far as storage goes, both consoles have rather limited storage. If you plan to download some older games that do not take full advantage of the next-gen hardware and don’t want to deplete your limited SSD storage, you can grab an external hard drive. You can buy a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Game-Drive-Xbox-Special/dp/B072LX7WLP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;4TB external hard drive from Seagate for $100&lt;/a&gt;, and it includes two months of Xbox Game Pass, a Netflix-like digital video game subscription service for Xbox consoles. Or you can buy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TGNFVWV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three months of Xbox Game Pass&lt;/a&gt; if you don’t have any games you’re interested in buying yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0on2NA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546609"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WaqSo8"&gt;Of course, you can also upgrade your SSD as well, but there are a few things to keep in mind. Seagate is the only one with an SSD expansion card compatible with both consoles. Additionally, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Storage-Expansion-Solid-State/dp/B08K3S6WJM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SSD expansion card only comes in 1TB&lt;/a&gt;, and it is very expensive, costing $220. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="B0wXAe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562459"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="ffPtu8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Xbox Series S review: small console, big potential","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21549021/xbox-series-s-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>SpaceX announces second crew member of its all-civilian space mission</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A white woman with long, light brown hair smiling and standing with her arms crossed in front of a wall painted with planet earth and a star." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XNtxvTpv0HtoNYnyARwKu09fNGg=/1x0:1200x799/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68857769/Hayley_Arceneaux.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Hayley Arceneaux | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.stjude.org/inspire/series/st-jude-cancer-survivor-hayley-arceneaux-hope-inspiration4-worlds-first-all-civilian-space-flight.html" target="_blank"&gt;St. Jude&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7tgA4N"&gt;Hayley Arceneaux, a physician assistant at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, will join the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22261038/spacex-announces-first-all-civilian-mission-to-space"&gt;first all-civilian trip to space&lt;/a&gt;, SpaceX announced today. She will orbit Earth for up to five days in the Crew Dragon capsule as part of the Inspiration4 mission. Crew members are being selected based on “mission pillars of leadership, hope, generosity and prosperity,” according to the &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210201005905/en/World%E2%80%99s-First-All-Civilian-Mission-to-Space-Will-Usher-in-New-Era-of-Commercial-Space-Exploration"&gt;press release for the mission&lt;/a&gt;. Arceneaux, SpaceX said, will represent hope. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1HZeny"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/22/science/spacex-hayley-arceneaux.html"&gt;Diagnosed with bone cancer at 10&lt;/a&gt;, she had some of the bones in her left leg replaced with titanium as part of her treatment. She was treated at St. Jude, where she now works with children who are being treated for lymphoma and leukemia. With the upcoming mission, Arceneaux will become the first person with a prosthetic body part to go to space.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WPVAN1"&gt;The mission is slated for late 2021 and if all goes as scheduled, Arceneaux, at 29 years old, could also be the youngest American to go to space. The title of youngest person in space would still go to &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/05/gherman-titov-bad-boy-cosmonaut-turned-elder-statesman-of-space/"&gt;Gherman Titov&lt;/a&gt;, a cosmonaut who was 25 when he orbited Earth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lc85sQ"&gt;The selection process for crew members also involves a fundraising effort for St. Jude, with a sweepstakes where people can donate to St. Jude for chances to be the third member. The fourth crew member will be the winner of a contest sponsored by the billionaire Jared Isaacman, who is funding and commanding the mission. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="pvATSs"&gt;New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo will allow movie theaters in New York City to open with a limited audience capacity for the first time in nearly a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mc8UOv"&gt;As part of the restrictions, theaters will only allow a maximum of 50 people to sit in any one screening (restricting capacity to 25 percent). Attendees must wear masks and sit in their assigned seats. The theaters will also have to implement advanced air filtration systems, according to Cuomo. While theaters outside of New York City have been allowed to reopen over the last few months, high case numbers in the city have prevented people from going. Theaters originally shut down because of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21182499/regal-cinemas-close-all-us-theaters-march-17th-coronavirus"&gt;pandemic in mid-March 2020&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iNRxLB"&gt;Allowing New York City theaters to open is a big deal, especially for studios like Disney and Universal, whose executives are likely worried about timing for upcoming big releases like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21437889/black-widow-delayed-release-date-marvel-cinematic-universe-disney-streaming-mulan"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Widow &lt;/em&gt;(May 7th)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/12/21176895/fast-and-furious-f9-delay-universal-coronavirus-vin-diesel"&gt;&lt;em&gt;F9 &lt;/em&gt;(May 28th)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Ticket prices are much higher in key markets like New York City and Los Angeles (where theaters are still unable to open). Plus, New York and California make up 21.5 percent of &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/07/blockbusters-return-until-new-york-and-california-reopen.html"&gt;all US filmgoing audiences&lt;/a&gt;. Not having those theaters open, even in a limited capacity and with higher ticket revenue, is catastrophic for movies that could potentially make $1 billion in pre-pandemic days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8Zue8"&gt;While industry insiders speculated that Disney could move &lt;em&gt;Black Widow &lt;/em&gt;to Disney Plus as a Premier Access title and then release the film internationally where theater attendance is better, it was also increasingly apparent Marvel Studios didn’t want to go that route. &lt;em&gt;Black Widow &lt;/em&gt;is a $200 million-plus budget movie; moving it to Disney Plus, even as a $30 Premier Access title, would never generate the same initial revenue it could earn at a theater pre-pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YMZWKy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The alternative is a situation US audiences saw with ‘Wonder Woman 1984’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tfnRmo"&gt;Without New York City or Los Angeles, Disney likely would have delayed the film again. But with New York City theaters reopening, even at just quarter capacity, it likely gives studio executives hope that Los Angeles could follow in the coming weeks, and there may be a better shot at a decent release for &lt;em&gt;Black Widow &lt;/em&gt;(well, by pandemic standards). Add in a rebounding movie theater business in key markets like China, one of Marvel Studios’ most important demographics, and &lt;em&gt;Black Widow &lt;/em&gt;could break even — potentially even earning a slight profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R3nQvz"&gt;The alternative is a situation US audiences saw with &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt;. With a production budget of $200 million and additional tens of millions in marketing budget, the film needed to generate at least a couple hundred million dollars to break even. That wasn’t going to happen in December 2020 with New York City and Los Angeles theaters closed, as well as restricted capacity at theaters in other states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LIufW4"&gt;Warner Bros. decided to move the film to a simultaneous release, premiering it in theaters and on HBO Max in the United States on the same day. By the end of January, AT&amp;amp;T (Warner Bros.’ parent company) executives told analysts that &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984 &lt;/em&gt;pushed a swath of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22215274/wonder-woman-1984-hamilton-hbo-max-disney-plus-numbers-streaming-success"&gt;new subscribers to HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;, boosting numbers to 17.2 million accumulated activations, more than double the number of activations in AT&amp;amp;T’s previous quarter (8.6 million). The film  &lt;a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl3624109569/weekend/"&gt;ended up making $159.9 million&lt;/a&gt;, with roughly 73 percent of that total coming from outside the US. To compare, the first &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman &lt;/em&gt;film &lt;a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl578455041/"&gt;earned $821 million worldwide&lt;/a&gt; with roughly 50 percent coming from the US alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5BZAwR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Studio executives and theater owners can’t predict if people will actually show up to theaters right now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q1BtrV"&gt;It’s also a big win for theater owners, whose executives have asked Cuomo and California Gov. Gavin Newsom to open theaters in New York City and Los Angeles over the last couple of months. AMC CEO Adam Aron thanked Cuomo when theaters in New York state were allowed to open back in October 2020, noting at the time that the company continued “to work closely with state and local authorities about the reopening of New York City, which we now hope with increasing confidence is not far away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ixR2Jk"&gt;Still, studio executives and theater owners can’t predict if people will actually show up to theaters right now. As more vaccinations roll out across the country, people may feel safer about being in a theater with strangers while maintaining proper social distance. For others, however, it may be some time before they’re ready to watch a stranger six feet away toss popcorn in their mouth or sneeze. &lt;/p&gt;
