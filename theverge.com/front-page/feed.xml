    <title>Amazon will offer its health services to other companies</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AsiuFyC-AlZPB8Gh1ydYaKWCrz8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68981598/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="52RrAw"&gt;Amazon will offer its health program, Amazon Care, to other companies and its employees based outside of Washington state, the company announced today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mJPGRM"&gt;The platform includes virtual meetings with doctors through the app and in-person care at a patient’s home. It can dispatch nurses to someone’s door to draw blood or perform a physical examination. Amazon launched the program for its Seattle-area employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/24/20882335/amazon-care-telemedicine-employees-healthcare"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qRWIAm"&gt;Now, it’s opening the program to other companies based in Washington state. This summer, it will make the virtual piece of Amazon Care available to other companies and Amazon employees anywhere in the United States. It will also eventually open the in-person care in Washington, DC, Baltimore, and other cities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M7KyfT"&gt;“Amazon Care gives instant access to a range of urgent and primary care services, including COVID-19 and flu testing, vaccinations, treatment of illnesses and injuries, preventive care, sexual health, prescription requests, refills, and delivery, and much more,” the company wrote &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/workplace/amazon-care-to-launch-across-u-s-this-summer-offering-millions-of-individuals-and-families-immediate-access-to-high-quality-medical-care-and-advice-24-hours-a-day-365-days-a-year"&gt;in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5NMBra"&gt;Amazon partners with the Washington state-based medical practice Care Medical for its Amazon Care program. Over the past few months, the company has filed to do business in over a dozen states, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/03/03/amazon-care-medical-telemedicine-platform/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stat News&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. The company pitched Care Medical to Seattle-based Zillow last year, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-amazon-care-telehealth-employers-2020-12"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tzxEF1"&gt;The expansion is the latest move into health care for Amazon. The company acquired online pharmacy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/28/17515176/amazon-pillpack-walgreens-pharmacy-market"&gt;PillPack in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. It’s working on health functions &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18295260/amazon-hipaa-alexa-echo-patient-health-information-privacy-voice-assistant"&gt;for Alexa&lt;/a&gt;. It also started work on a health care initiative with JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway, which was &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/01/04/haven-shuts-down-amazon-jpmorgan-berkshire/"&gt;dissolved in January&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0mYTCl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best iPad deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tK0LbEtEShHQh97Hs1ENU1d_fQg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66899976/bking_200322_3945_0023.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1E6t41"&gt;Deals on Apple’s iPad are more common than you might think. Whether you’re after the affordable iPad, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or iPad Mini, there’s usually some sort of price cut happening somewhere. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers. But that’s what we’re doing each day when we hunt for deals, so let us help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzVhpS"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each of the current iPads available for purchase. Most of the time, there’s some sort of discount happening on a new or refurbished model. When there is a deal we think worth telling you about, we’ll let you know, along with any info you need to keep it in context. If there isn’t a current deal, we’ll tell you how much the most recent sale price was for, so you’ll know when to take the plunge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLLRFN"&gt;If you need a little help figuring out exactly which iPad is best for you, we’ve got you covered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21280856/apple-ipad-mini-air-pro-comparison-how-to-choose"&gt;with a comparison post featuring all of the latest models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;This is Apple’s most affordable iPad, usually costing $329 for the model with 32GB of storage or $429 for the 128GB model. Each has a 10.2-inch display and features the A12 Bionic processor, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hDQ0n6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508346"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="T559mJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The new 2020 iPad isn’t enough for Zoom school","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5m6ZrK"&gt;You can currently get the base iPad with 32GB of storage at Amazon for $299 ($9 off) in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B08J5J9699?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B08J65DST5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt;. If you need more space to store things like apps, you can grab a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B08J5J7BF1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB model for $400 if you buy it in gold&lt;/a&gt; (in stock on March 24th), which is $29 off its usual price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fmPtFu"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad mini (2019)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;Apple released a new iPad mini in early 2019, equipped with the same 7.9-inch display and design as previous iterations, but with refreshed internal specs. It has the A12 Bionic processor found in the base iPad, along with Wi-Fi support. Apple sells 64GB and 256GB models of the iPad mini, with prices set at $400 and $500 respectively. If you want LTE connectivity, the starting price is $530.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rG7i7T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515887"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="WEZSI9"&gt;Amazon also has the 256GB model on sale for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07NHN9W4J?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$529 in space gray&lt;/a&gt;, or just $1 more, you can get this model in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07PQ8XKZC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07PSK4LGQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="66nPkj"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad Air (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The 2020 iPad Air has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to the prior model’s 10.5-inch screen and features thinner bezels around the display. It has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGT87b"&gt;Like its predecessor, the fourth-gen iPad Air model comes in 64GB or 256GB storage configurations. The Wi-Fi models start at $599 and $749 respectively, making the starting price slightly more than last year’s models. The model that supports LTE starts at $729. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JhHVno"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546269"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="gwJ9Lp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple iPad Air (2020) review: take it from the Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ByT0LP"&gt;The best deal you can currently get on the iPad Air fourth-gen is at Micro Center. The retailer has the most competitive sale price right now at $540, where you can grab a 64GB model in all five colors (&lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628782/apple-ipad-air-4---green-(late-2020)"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628780/apple-ipad-air-4---rose-gold-(late-2020)"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628779/apple-ipad-air-4---silver-(late-2020)"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628781/apple-ipad-air-4---sky-blue-(late-2020)"&gt;sky blue&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628778/apple-ipad-air-4---space-gray-(late-2020)"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fzykEb"&gt;Amazon currently has the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08J61FCVN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fourth-gen iPad Air 64GB model with Wi-Fi in all colors on sale&lt;/a&gt;, for $559. Walmart has the same configuration on sale for $559 if you buy the 64GB iPad Air with Wi-Fi in &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-64GB-Green%2F968764839%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=VergeiPadDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-64GB-Silver%2F694429303%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=VergeiPadDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-64GB-Sky-Blue%2F462727496%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=VergeiPadDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sky blue&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-64GB-Space-Gray%2F650223175%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=VergeiPadDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wn6zsS"&gt;The 256GB configuration has also been discounted at Amazon; you can get this model for $680 ($69 off) in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J63W44Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J6FTH75?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;rose gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J6FVJMX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sky blue&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J6LJMT4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7PfM3l"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad Pro (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VbsKiA"&gt;Apple’s 2020 iteration of the iPad Pro looks a lot like the 2018 model, aside from its dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike the less expensive iPad models, the iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port. It also has Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor; it also has a high refresh display. In fact, the iPad Pro has the most stacked spec sheet of Apple’s entire iPad lineup, which comes at a price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MHHxDV"&gt;The 11-inch model with 128GB of storage starts at $800; bumping the screen size up to 12.9 inches raises the price to $1,000. Each model supports up to 1TB of storage, with the top-spec models going for $1,299 (11-inch) and $1,499 (12.9-inch). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dnrxd6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="XeRDay"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple iPad Pro review 2020: small spec bump, big camera bump","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="g8em56"&gt;If you are looking to pick up the 11-inch model at a discounted price, Amazon has the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B08639YQTV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB configuration on sale for $849&lt;/a&gt;.

Of course, if you have money to spend and want a ton of storage, you can buy the 11-inch &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B08631TDC3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB configuration in space gray for only $1,249 in space gray;&lt;/a&gt; that’s $50 off its usual retail price of $1,299.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Zobp6q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737960"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="48UoRv"&gt;If you want a slightly bigger screen, Amazon has the 12.9-inch iPad Pro on sale &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0862JF4KR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starting at $949&lt;/a&gt; for the base model, which includes 128GB of storage. If you need more storage, you can get the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0862HNWGK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model for $999&lt;/a&gt; or you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0862JK4BQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB for $1,199&lt;/a&gt;. The 12.9-inch 1TB model with Wi-Fi only is also discounted at Amazon. You can get it for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08631SHQJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,399&lt;/a&gt; in both colors. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SHxGNG"&gt;EA Play, EA’s games subscription service, will be available as a perk for Xbox Game Pass subscribers on PC beginning Thursday, March 18th, at 5PM ET, &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/03/17/ea-play-coming-to-pc-for-xbox-game-pass/"&gt;Microsoft and EA announced on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1VT1XA"&gt;EA Play has been included with Xbox Game Pass for consoles &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21493265/ea-play-xbox-game-pass-release-date-subscription"&gt;since November&lt;/a&gt;, and it was originally going to be available for PC subscribers in December. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176296/ea-play-xbox-game-pass-release-delayed-subscription"&gt;on the day&lt;/a&gt; it was supposed to become accessible, Microsoft announced that EA Play wouldn’t be coming to Xbox Game Pass for PC until 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>BMW unveils the exterior of the i4, its first electric sedan</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ba7bihD_ZbtxPl58IzqYu-fqtfA=/223x137:1823x1204/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68981502/P90416001_highRes.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: BMW&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X3cndw"&gt;BMW has &lt;a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0327873EN/a-glimpse-of-the-first-ever-all-electric-bmw-i4-at-the-bmw-group-annual-conference"&gt;pulled the wraps off&lt;/a&gt; of the exterior of its first electric sedan, the i4, after years of teasing a true follow-up to the i3 EV. The i4 is slated to hit the road by the end of the year — ahead of schedule, the company says — and BMW said Wednesday that it will also offer an M Performance model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UQjsqp"&gt;The German automaker showed off the i4 at an annual company conference ahead of a full breakdown of what the electric car can do scheduled to happen in the coming weeks. For now, BMW only shared a few specs. The company said the i4 will be available in different configurations, with a max range of around 300 miles and power of around 390kW (roughly 530 horsepower) that’s delivered from a single motor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HaE2cG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10397305"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QeVUTf"&gt;That’s all pretty much in line with what BMW detailed in the concept version of the i4, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/3/21162530/bmw-i4-electric-sedan-concept-geneva-motor-show-2020"&gt;broke cover last year during the digital-only 2020 Geneva Motor Show&lt;/a&gt;. If the production i4 really does wind up tracking closely to the concept version, expect it to be powered by an 80kWh battery pack, too. As for the interior, we already know it will use the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22332131/bmw-idrive-update-curved-screen-autonomous-electric-ix"&gt;new version of BMW’s iDrive software and infotainment platform revealed earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a far cry from the company’s first &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/i-still-cant-believe-bmw-gave-america-an-all-electric-r-1846490158?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;amp;utm_campaign=dlvrit&amp;amp;utm_content=jalopnik"&gt;pseudo-attempt at an electric car&lt;/a&gt; a decade ago with the small Active-E pilot program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="mil1A9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"BMW’s new curved iDrive display is a ‘major step’ toward autonomous driving","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22332131/bmw-idrive-update-curved-screen-autonomous-electric-ix"},{"title":"BMW’s electric i4 sedan finally shown off in concept form","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/3/21162530/bmw-i4-electric-sedan-concept-geneva-motor-show-2020"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="A3Ot7U"&gt;At Wednesday’s conference, BMW also detailed more of its plan to shift its vehicles to electric drivetrains. The company said it expects to sell at least one fully electric vehicle in 90 percent of the markets it’s in by 2023 and deliver 2 million EVs by the end of 2025. It expects the number of EVs it sells to grow by around 20 percent annually between 2025 and 2030. At that point, BMW says it expects half of all new vehicles it sells to be fully electric. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u9hEnk"&gt;That’s a far more optimistic take on the popularity of EVs than BMW had previously offered, especially as it spent years with the i3 as its only fully electric car on the market. The i4 will be a flagship of the company’s renewed push into EVs, though BMW has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/9/21171762/bmw-ix3-long-range-electric-suv-us-market-china-europe"&gt;already released the iX3 SUV in Europe and China&lt;/a&gt;. That said, it’s still a less aggressive strategy than other automakers are taking, especially in the face of a growing number of proposed bans on new gas cars. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Birth control apps show the contradictions in FDA device oversight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1OQXjbYdg7y5sys05XkjSYAL5Eo=/247x0:2047x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68981480/clue_period_tracking.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Clue&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The FDA says two types of digital birth control are the same, but one company disagrees&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="9wOYbT"&gt;Digital birth control company Natural Cycles wasn’t happy with the news that the Food and Drug Administration cleared a second birth control app at the start of the month. The company, which was the first to get sign-off from the agency, says it’s glad to have the competition — but it takes issue with the &lt;em&gt;way &lt;/em&gt;the FDA gave the new app, made by Clue, the okay.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MzT94c"&gt;The FDA can allow products to be sold and marketed in the US if they’re similar enough to something already available to consumers. In this case, the FDA is saying Clue is “substantially equivalent” to Natural Cycles — similar enough to earn the agency’s green light. But Natural Cycles doesn’t agree. “I feel this is slightly concerning,” Natural Cycles CEO Elina Berglund told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Ch84s"&gt;These sorts of disagreements happen regularly in health care — usually in the back rooms of hospitals where companies jockey to sell their products to providers. For companies, touting the differences between physical medical devices, like surgical screws, infusion pumps, or heart monitors can make a difference in how much of their products they can sell. Now, companies are navigating the same discussions around digital health apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="KvyzV3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s an old regulatory approach applied to very new types of products.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pj5Agt"&gt;“It’s an old regulatory approach applied to very new types of products,” says Nathan Cortez, an FDA and medical technology law expert at Southern Methodist University’s law school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2nbu6d"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pathways to clearance &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LgWHSu"&gt;Natural Cycles was cleared by the FDA as the first app-based birth control in 2018 — a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/19/18139681/natural-cycles-fda-approval-standards-de-novo-digital-health-devices"&gt;controversial decision&lt;/a&gt; that came after the app was linked to unintended pregnancies in Sweden. It’s a digitized form of a type of pregnancy prevention called fertility awareness, where people monitor their menstrual cycles and other physiological signs to predict the windows when they could become pregnant. People who use this method then avoid sex or use other birth control methods, like condoms, during that time. Natural Cycles predicts these windows using data, including the dates of users’ periods and their body temperature, which changes around ovulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LEmZjU"&gt;The Natural Cycles app is considered a medical device, not a drug, so the FDA didn’t review it in the same way it reviews a hormonal birth control pill. The agency also didn’t consider it a high-risk device, so it didn’t have to go through the most stringent clinical review process, a premarket approval. The FDA signed off on the device using a process called a de novo classification. This pathway is reserved for things that are unlike anything else on the market and the FDA considers &lt;a href="https://www.medtechintelligence.com/feature_article/expanded-use-of-de-novo-pathway-offers-opportunity-for-device-manufacturers/"&gt;low or medium risk&lt;/a&gt;. (It doesn’t think it will seriously hurt someone if something goes wrong.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ir4Tlz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Clue isn’t considered a high-risk device&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ImAFRZ"&gt;Like Natural Cycles, Clue isn’t considered a high-risk device, so it also didn’t have to get premarket approval. But it’s not novel: Natural Cycles was already available when Clue came online, so it didn’t have to go through the de novo process either. Instead, the FDA said the Clue app could be sold as a birth control because it was “substantially equivalent” to something that it already cleared. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9I5AR7"&gt;The policy is based on the idea that if the agency clears a product, it’s safe and effective — and we can assume that anything that works in a similar enough way would &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; be safe and effective. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uBQv9E"&gt;“Given that the category of ‘software application for contraception’ is already recognized by the FDA, Clue Birth Control and any future contraceptive app that raises similar regulatory questions can be assessed through the standard process for a recognized category,” a Clue spokesperson wrote in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tcm4c7"&gt;It’s always a tricky line to walk, Cortez says. Companies like Clue want to argue that they’re close enough to earlier competitors that they can take the less-intensive clearance pathway. But they &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; have to market their products as better than competitors. “Companies will say, yeah, this is substantially equivalent to this other product, but it’s better in the following ways,” he says. “It can create some confusion.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Q0e4nz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Similarities and differences &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="CBhBAn"&gt;Like Natural Cycles, Clue uses data on users’ menstrual cycles to predict the windows when they’re at the highest chance of becoming pregnant. Unlike Natural Cycles, which asks for temperature data, it doesn’t ask for any other information. That’s the crux of Natural Cycles CEO Berglund’s disagreement with the FDA’s determination that Clue and Natural Cycles are substantially equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8lo2D6"&gt;Berglund also says that the algorithm Clue’s app is based on, developed by Georgetown’s Institute for Reproductive Health, wasn’t tested in as large a study as Natural Cycles. The method used by Clue was tested in a &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2019/03/18/fertility-app-dot-bills-itself-as-contraception/"&gt;study of about 718 women&lt;/a&gt;. Natural Cycles’ FDA clearance was based on data &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-allows-marketing-first-direct-consumer-app-contraceptive-use-prevent-pregnancy"&gt;from 15,000 women&lt;/a&gt;, which was collected by the company itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CZVfeO"&gt;“Most women are not scientists, and maybe won’t read the papers, so I’m slightly concerned that they won’t really be able to tell the difference,” Berglund says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UjOLaM"&gt;Clue said in &lt;a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf19/K193330.pdf"&gt;its application&lt;/a&gt; to the FDA that it had different characteristics and used different data than Natural Cycles, but argued that the differences don’t affect safety or effectiveness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZzPx38"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Both are algorithm-based ways of determining the fertile window”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NlDWGv"&gt;The Natural Cycles algorithm is proprietary, so it’s not possible to directly compare its methods to Clue’s methods. The temperature readings are an identifiable difference between the two, says Rebecca Simmons, a researcher and fertility awareness specialist at the University of Utah who worked on the original algorithm Clue uses. But the temperature is just another piece of data that feeds the algorithm, she says. “Which essentially means that it’s the same — both are algorithm-based ways of determining the fertile window.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QKmx6P"&gt;The two fall into the same category, says Nathaniel DeNicola, an OBGYN and chair of telehealth at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists who is not involved with the apps. “The addition of body temperature gives a bit of additional information, but it isn’t a categorical difference,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4rmqsO"&gt;Still, he says, that data point could change the way the app makes predictions. “Each thing could add some level of accuracy,” he says. “It gives some more information.” The differences in how the products were evaluated are also important, he says: Clue’s method is based on research done by outside scientists, while the research on Natural Cycles was done by the company itself, which has a vested interest in a good result. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5EhMGi"&gt;But from a medical standpoint, they’re still both fertility awareness-based methods of birth control. The studies came to fairly similar conclusions about the app’s ability to prevent pregnancy, even though the data is fairly limited. “We’re really dealing with very small numbers of studies,” DeNicola says. He says he’d take the same approach to talking with patients who are interested in using them — focusing on the level of risk of pregnancy someone is comfortable with and the reasons for their interest in an app-based approach. “The main thing we would talk about is if it works for them.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_mMg6ZdGSe01AFHONb3FwFopcHE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22377259/Screen_Shot_2021_03_17_at_10.47.30_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Natural Cycles&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sdiuXt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FDA definitions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="DWXaro"&gt;A back-and-forth over the relative similarities and differences between the two products highlights one criticism of the FDA’s oversight of medical devices — particularly devices it considers low or medium risk. A clinician’s metrics for the things that would make one device similar to another aren’t necessarily the same as the FDA’s. “The FDA definition is not the same definition that any normal human would use,” says Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Center for Health Research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YrntfL"&gt;That’s part of Zuckerman’s concerns around medical devices cleared based on substantial equivalence. They don’t have to go through as rigorous a review process, and the decision is &lt;a href="https://www.carltonfields.com/getmedia/a9fcf127-d35a-43d1-a705-e35f3d5a70fb/Admissibility-Hurdles-for-510(k)-Evidence-in-Medical-Device-Litigation"&gt;based on how similar&lt;/a&gt; two products are, not if the new product is independently safe. That’s worrying if the new device is being compared to a product that’s itself controversial, like Natural Cycles, Zuckerman says. “Even if it is substantially equivalent, how good is the product it’s supposed to be substantially equivalent to?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jCtlwA"&gt;It’s particularly concerning for something like a digital birth control, Zuckerman says. Saying that the apps aren’t high risk is a subjective call. The app may not directly harm someone in the way a faulty medication pump could. But pregnancy can be physically dangerous and have major consequences for people who were trying to avoid it. “If the product doesn’t work, there’s a high risk it could be very harmful,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="SfAxpV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s a high risk it could be very harmful”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0TD9zY"&gt;Then there’s the fact that digital health products remain very new. The FDA is still sorting out how it treats apps that it considers substantially equivalent. “You’re going to see in the future different types of algorithms — what if one is a traditional closed machine-learning system, and another is an open one that relies on dramatically different data sources?” Cortez says. The agency also has to navigate software updates, which let digital products change much more easily than a physical device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJ9Dnc"&gt;Berglund says Natural Cycles reached out to the FDA with questions but hasn’t heard back yet. “We don’t necessarily expect that they will drop everything for this topic, but we’re looking into it,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vDdBFp"&gt;The FDA does not take company disagreements about equivalence into account during its decision-making process, an agency spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Tech companies can submit a &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/dockets-management/comment-proposed-regulations-and-submit-petitions#petitions"&gt;citizen’s petition&lt;/a&gt; if they want to voice their disagreement with an FDA decision, just like anyone else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="6gpx9v"&gt;“It’s an industry that likes to claim that everything is new and novel and unprecedented, so it’s kind of funny to see this old gray-haired regulator saying yeah, you guys are basically the same,” Cortez says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oLNgtX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VMWWZb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tK61qL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l4R8SX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chuck Schumer wants to replace every gas car in America with an electric vehicle</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A photo illustration of Chuck Schumer with yellow lightning bolts covering his eyes." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PjcTdtM8RNzEZcvZ4jPRkHv_MhM=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68981291/VRG_ILLO_4476_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo illustration by William Joel / The Verge | Photo by Tasos Katopodis / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The Senate majority leader is reviving his plan to give people discounts for swapping their gas car for an electric one&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="UnXkqU"&gt;With the $1.9 trillion COVID relief bill signed into law, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) is ready to tackle the next major challenge: President Joe Biden’s call for a massive infrastructure bill. As part of that package, Schumer said he plans to include his ambitious proposal to get every American to swap their gas-guzzling car for an electric one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4s4nuu"&gt;“It’s a bold new plan designed to accelerate America’s transition to all electric vehicles on the road, to developing a charging infrastructure, and to grow American jobs through clean manufacturing,” Schumer told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a brief interview this week. “And the ultimate goal is to have every car manufactured in America be electric by 2030, and every car on the road be clean by 2040.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9dBBWh"&gt;The top-line details of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931983/schumer-electric-car-trade-in-gas-discount-proposal-zero-emission"&gt;“cash for clunkers’’-style plan&lt;/a&gt; haven’t changed much since Schumer first proposed it in &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/24/opinion/chuck-schumer-electric-car.html"&gt;an op-ed in &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; in late 2019&lt;/a&gt;. But the political landscape has certainly shifted in favor of the Democrats, breathing new life into the idea. Under the proposal, anyone who trades in their gas car for an electric one would get a “substantial” point-of-sale discount, Schumer says. He wouldn’t say how much of a discount, only that it would be “deep.” A spokesperson later confirmed they are eyeing rebates that are “more generous” than the current $7,500 federal EV tax credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="a6zi7D"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Schumer wouldn’t say how much of a discount, only that it would be “deep”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5eDHPZ"&gt;He also wants to provide direct incentives to auto manufacturers to phase out their production of internal combustion engine vehicles and tax breaks for property owners to install EV chargers at their homes or apartment buildings. Lastly, he proposes to send direct subsidies to local governments to improve and expand the nation’s network of EV charging stations. Schumer would deploy $45 billion in grants to upgrade the nation’s charging infrastructure and $17 billion to encourage manufacturers to retrofit their facilities for EV production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ARyu2K"&gt;There are still details to work out, such as how much of a discount to give each person who trades in a car, and how to structure the plan so the lowest-income earners receive the most cash back. Schumer estimates that the plan will cost $454 billion over 10 years to implement, compared to the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/us/politics/biden-climate-plan.html"&gt;$2 trillion Biden has said he would spend&lt;/a&gt; on his infrastructure and climate proposal. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ojSVbU"&gt;Biden would probably be agreeable to Schumer’s plan — there are elements of it already included in the president’s Build Back Better proposal — though a spokesperson for the White House did not respond to a request for comment. Since taking office, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22249237/biden-electric-vehicle-government-fleet-ev"&gt;Biden has signed an executive order&lt;/a&gt; to replace the government’s fleet of almost 650,000 vehicles with all-electric models produced in the US. And he pledged to spend billions of dollars to add over half a million EV charging stations in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iESF99"&gt;Given those facts, Schumer’s convinced that Biden will be an easy sell. “I haven’t sat down and discussed the whole thing with them,” Schumer said of the White House, “but yes, I think it is going to be part of the infrastructure plan.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ulNm2O"&gt;Since first announcing the plan, Schumer has sought out support from labor unions and auto manufacturers. So far, three powerful labor unions have endorsed the plan: the AFL-CIO, UAW, and IBEW. With their buy-in, the majority leader is convinced that the proposal will have an easier path to approval, even with Republicans largely opposed to anything that originates from a Democrat’s desk. Still, he’s optimistic that he can peel away a few Republican votes, thanks to broad support for electrification from the auto industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uQkdVk"&gt;“I’m excited by the substance of the proposal,” Schumer said, “but I’m also excited by the politics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="gMbf1L"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’m excited by the substance of the proposal, but I’m also excited by the politics.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Gz2dPp"&gt;There has been &lt;a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2019/10/25/six-reasons-why-schumers-ev-plan-takes-a-wrong-turn/"&gt;criticism by transit advocates&lt;/a&gt; who would rather see that sum of money spent on strengthening the nation’s public transportation infrastructure, especially at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a huge drop-off in ridership. (The recently approved American Rescue Plan of 2021 includes $30.5 billion for transit.) The government shouldn’t be spending money on incentives for car purchases, regardless if they’re electric, they argue, when congestion and sprawl are such major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RJ43Ky"&gt;Schumer said he’s working on a “large investment in clean mass transit” right now, which he also hopes to include as part of the Democratic infrastructure proposal. “Transit is an integral part of the way to revolutionize the way we move around,” he said, though he declined to say whether more money should be spent on public transportation than his gas-for-electric swap idea. “I’m not going to compare. We need to do both.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="atFXkM"&gt;Another potential problem for Schumer’s plan is the current state of the electric grid in the US. Electric vehicles are only as green as their power source, and &lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/electricity/electricity-in-the-us.php#:~:text=Coal%20was%20the%20second%2Dlargest,in%202019%E2%80%94about%2023%25."&gt;according to the US Energy Information Administration&lt;/a&gt;, 38 percent of the nation’s power supply comes from natural gas, 23 percent comes from coal, 20 percent from nuclear power, and only 17 percent from renewable sources like wind, solar, and hydroelectric. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Senators Hold Media Availability On Capitol Hill" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E0RHnqsghCmTSVQfo0veYIT3cTo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22377115/1231753968.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Kevin Dietsch-Pool / Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Wdmh3V"&gt;Schumer noted that while his proposal doesn’t specifically address the electrical grid, he is a co-sponsor of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/10/21430616/democrats-thrive-agenda-economy-pandemic-racism-climate-change-resolution-congress"&gt;THRIVE Act&lt;/a&gt;, which calls for federal investments to boost renewable energy. Included among the 83 co-sponsors are Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), co-authors of the Green New Deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2OggfR"&gt;The progressive wing of the Democratic Party has pushed to get Schumer to sign on to the Green New Deal, but he says he prefers his alternative approach. “The THRIVE agenda is a practicalization of the Green New Deal,” Schumer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aW5NfZ"&gt;Schumer also wouldn’t go so far as to say he would support a federal ban on the sale of gas-powered vehicles. The European Union has said it wants to &lt;a href="https://www.coltura.org/world-gasoline-phaseouts"&gt;phase out gas car sales&lt;/a&gt; by 2035, with some nations like Ireland, Sweden, and the Netherlands saying they would ban the sale of new gas cars much sooner, by 2030. A number of US states have signed on to similar timelines, including California, the largest auto market in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kFjUbP"&gt;Major auto producers have also said they would sell only electric vehicles within the next 10 to 15 years, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287284/ford-electric-vehicles-ev-europe-2030"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254116/general-motors-carbon-neutral-vow-2040-tailpipe-emissions-ev"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22308851/volvo-electric-cars-only-2030-online-sales"&gt;Volvo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22325813/vw-volkswagen-power-day-battery-electric-car-announcement"&gt;Volkswagen&lt;/a&gt;, and others. But Schumer declined to say whether he would support a national plan to phase out the sale of gas-powered cars, saying he prefers using a carrot rather than a stick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i8FEuZ"&gt;“Our proposal will do the most that can be passed,” he said. “My goal is to pass into law the boldest change, and I think this is sort of the sweet spot where that is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="RTRqgG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Our proposal will do the most that can be passed.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="knRU7m"&gt;Today, anyone who buys an electric car is eligible for a $7,500 federal tax credit in addition to any local tax credits that exist at the state level, depending on where they live. The incentive was created by the Obama administration in 2009 to encourage automakers to embrace electrification. It was also meant to help consumers offset the price of a new EV, many of which were (and still are) too expensive for most Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FFicyf"&gt;But the credit was never meant to be permanent, and a cap of 200,000 vehicles sold was included. Once a car company passes that mark, the tax credit slowly phases out over a period of 18 months. In recent years, both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/12/17563908/tesla-federal-tax-credit-ending-date"&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/3/18166619/gm-ev-tax-credit-bolt-sales"&gt;GM&lt;/a&gt; have hit the 200,000-vehicle threshold and have begun to phase out the credit. But Schumer says the tax credit is targeted at “affluent” people, whereas his plan applies to everyone across the economic spectrum, including “people who don’t pay taxes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u4HZeb"&gt;Electric cars aren’t the only battery-powered vehicles that are changing the way people get around. Electric scooters and bikes have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22178543/bike-bicycle-boom-covid-pandemic-2020-sales-cities-infrastructure"&gt;exploded in popularity&lt;/a&gt; in recent years, with environmental advocates touting them as an even greener mode of transportation than EVs. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22295115/ebike-tax-credit-congress-bill-blumenauer"&gt;A bill was recently introduced in the House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; that would give a refundable tax credit of 30 percent on the purchase of a new e-bike, which Schumer says he would support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X9tMaE"&gt;“I would like to look at the broad range of transportation,” he said. “We’re looking at mass-transit buses and subways right now. And I’d like to make it as expansive as possible — scooters, everything. I’m a bicycle rider. Obviously, that’s very clean.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="DzvZCB"&gt;He added, “Things like that, we’d like to expand and incentivize.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f9nsY2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0SKaVo"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cIjRgy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="60bBfd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Labor board reportedly sides with Amazon workers who protested COVID-19 safety policies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wSpvb-puSS1hWet--4qYftXhRnU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68981248/mdoying_180411_2466_0050stills.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YYYZP0"&gt;Amazon and US labor regulators are reportedly negotiating a settlement for workers who protested Amazon’s COVID-19 safety standards. &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/03/17/amazon-covid-chicago-nlrb-strike/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) found merit in a retaliation complaint from Chicago warehouse employees. According to text messages obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt;, the NLRB said on March 10th that “Amazon has stated its intent to settle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DvvPen"&gt;Workers have requested, among other things, that Amazon contact employees and “make clear that their rights will not be violated again.” The complaint alleged that Amazon unlawfully retaliated against workers after they launched a series of safety strikes last year, asking for the company to cover COVID-19 medical costs and offer more transparency if a person on-site contracted the coronavirus. Amazon and the NLRB did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PV5MDu"&gt;The NLRB can’t assess penalties against Amazon, but it can require “make-whole remedies” that prevent future violations. As &lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt; explains, an investigation can also push companies to back off of intimidation campaigns or other offenses, making it easier for employees to organize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8D8585"&gt;If a settlement isn’t reached, the NLRB could issue a formal complaint and schedule a hearing on the case. That’s what happened last December, when it &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/amazon-worker-retaliation-coronavirus"&gt;found merit in a complaint&lt;/a&gt; from Philadelphia employee Courtney Bowden. Last month, the NLRB also sided with Alabama workers seeking to vote on a union, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22268280/amazon-nlrb-denied-union-election-alabama-warehouse"&gt;denying Amazon’s request&lt;/a&gt; to delay the vote. That vote — which could mark the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272213/amazon-union-bhm1-alabama-rwdsu-vote-begins"&gt;first US employee union&lt;/a&gt; in Amazon’s history — will conclude at the end of March.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mortal Kombat’s producer says the movie’s violence is ‘like Bambi’ compared to the games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KjWxp2EL8750cwK_WbvGtkMRDsw=/554x0:2354x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68981126/MK_T1_0073r.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Warner Bros. Entertainment&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6jNf9D"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/jBa_aHwCbC4"&gt;recent trailer&lt;/a&gt; for the upcoming movie adaptation of &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat&lt;/em&gt; makes the film look &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; violent. In one scene, &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat&lt;/em&gt; icon Sub-Zero slices an opponent’s arm with a sword, freezes the resulting blood splatter into a dagger, and uses that blood dagger to stab his foe. But in an interview this week, producer Todd Garner told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the movie’s violence isn’t nearly as over-the-top as it is in the classic game series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qyworz"&gt;“Compared to the game, we’re like Bambi,” says Garner. “We’re like a G-rated movie compared to the game. The game is just incredibly operatic in terms of the violence, and the Motion Picture Association of America would never let us do that much violence.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vnzO94h_Sab1FY2W-6rh-9KPuIg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22376688/MK_T1_0061.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Warner Bros. Entertainment&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9QIvyg"&gt;Fights in the &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat&lt;/em&gt; games are brutal, with blood often appearing following each punch, kick, throw, or weapon slice. And the series is famous for its Fatality finishing moves, where characters murder their opponents in exceedingly gruesome ways. (They often involve some kind of dismemberment.) Violence is part of playing the game, and it’s something that has only become more extreme as the series has progressed. In fact, it can be so bad that it’s even &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/id-have-these-extremely-graphic-dreams-what-its-like-t-1834611691"&gt;impacted members of the development team&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat&lt;/em&gt; movie isn’t trying to violence for violence’s sake, though, according to Garner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RUEAjM"&gt;“We’re trying to make a movie where you care about the people, it’s grounded, it has a realistic tone to it, and the violence comes from the rules of the world that have been established, but you’re not just trying to make torture porn,” he says. “You’re trying to do something that is faithful to the IP, but also comes from a motivated and grounded place that is motivated by real characters that feel like they’ve lived real lives up until this moment.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6hySmo45NrPL7PQZnecIFOtK1cE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22376684/MK_T1_0099.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Warner Bros. Entertainment&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FjDqnr"&gt;In a separate interview, director Simon McQuoid talked about how he wanted to do right by the series by including violence, but that also allowed him to make a more authentic movie. “I just wanted to do &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat&lt;/em&gt; justice,” McQuoid says. “It was about studying and looking at what the fundamental ingredients are of &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat.&lt;/em&gt; What are the key strands of DNA that make this what it is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5K2lG"&gt;“One of those, obviously, is kind of the brutality [of the series],” he says. “And what I liked about the blood aspect of that is that we could be authentic. We didn’t have to hold back on the fights.” For example, if somebody was stabbed through the head, “blood probably would burst down the back,” McQuoid notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PHYmKR"&gt;McQuoid’s not just saying that hypothetically. I’ve seen the first 13 minutes of the film, which included a big, blade-filled fight scene. And one of its most memorable moments features a knife being plunged into the top of someone’s head, and yes, blood does seep from the wound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6trSdp"&gt;But while the movie could come across as overly violent, “everyone knows &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat &lt;/em&gt;is known for that and was OK sort of doing that,” McQuoid says. “It wasn’t a great surprise. It’s not like it’s a Jane Austen novel that we’re turning super violent. That would not be good.” The violence “matters for this property,” he says. “It allowed us to be authentic in a stylistic approach and [it was] also just what’s right for &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Emgyiw"&gt;The new &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat&lt;/em&gt; movie will hit theaters and HBO Max on April 16th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook says it’ll start punishing group members who break its rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SGcD1yk2IjFys6qi0WAub8Mcro0=/0x0:2808x1872/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68981123/fbgroups.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QMxcfI"&gt;Facebook is trying to clean up its Groups experience and limit the reach of potentially problematic users and communities. The company announced multiple changes to groups today, including plans to put users who break rules on probation, further limit the reach of civic and political groups, and require more moderation in groups that have violated Facebook’s rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a12u55"&gt;Group members who break Facebook’s rules will suffer various new consequences. Initially, people with repeat violations will be prevented from posting or commenting in any group for a certain period of time. A spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; this time could be either seven or 30 days, depending on the number of violations and the severity of them. They also won’t be able to invite other people to any groups or create new groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ilNvXr"&gt;One of the biggest changes is around members who break rules. Groups that have numerous violations will soon come with a warning label, too. Whenever a user tries to join one of these groups, they’ll receive a disclaimer that the group has violated community standards, which might dissuade them from joining. Facebook will also limit invite notifications for these groups. For existing members, the company will reduce the distribution of the group’s content, meaning it’ll be shown lower in the News Feed. (It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/7/21554349/facebook-groups-probation-violating-rules-misinformation-election"&gt;first piloted&lt;/a&gt; this functionality around the 2020 US presidential election, but it’s now making it a regular feature.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="buFZgr"&gt;Finally, these violating groups’ admins and moderators will have to temporarily approve all posts whenever the group has a substantial number of members who have violated policies or were part of other groups that were removed for breaking the rules. If these admins or moderators just approve everything, even content that breaks the rules, the entire group will be taken down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6bCKw0"&gt;As a broader update, Facebook started removing civic and political groups &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55842587"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, as well as newly created groups, from recommendations in the US. It’s now making that the standard worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dBCNIs"&gt;Facebook has received much criticism for allowing &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/salvadorhernandez/facebook-profit-militant-extremist-groups-ads"&gt;extremist political groups&lt;/a&gt;, as well as groups that spread conspiracy theories or anti-vax rhetoric, to thrive on its platform. As one example, members of the group that plotted to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/gretchen-whitmer-kidnapping-plot-facebook-groups-militias-fbi/"&gt;used Facebook groups to organize&lt;/a&gt;, according to an FBI affidavit. And in the past, even its attempts to limit the reach of political groups have failed, according to &lt;a href="https://themarkup.org/citizen-browser/2021/01/19/facebook-said-it-would-stop-pushing-users-to-join-partisan-political-groups-it-didnt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which found that political recommendations still showed up for users. (A Facebook spokesperson says this error has now been corrected.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PntBqo"&gt;The company continues to be in a game of whack-a-mole, where it attempts to squash the bad groups and members, only to see others sprout up. These new rules might dissuade some people from behaving badly or limit their time on the platform, but there’s always a chance that they just create a new account or skirt around the rules without breaking them.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy A52 and A72 feature quad rear-camera arrays, though the A72 includes a telephoto rather than depth-sensing camera.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tJQJa4"&gt;At its second Unpacked event of the year, Samsung officially unveiled three of its next A-series phones: the Galaxy A52, A52 5G, and A72. While the company isn’t sharing US pricing or availability yet, it has confirmed European pricing: €349 for the A52 (about $415), €429 for the A52 5G (about $510), and €449 for the A72 ($534).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="laK8jm"&gt;Key specs across the board include IP67 water and dust resistance, brighter screens with faster refresh rates, and a 64-megapixel main camera with optical image stabilization. All three models include a microSD card slot for expandable storage and will ship with a charging brick in the box — features that you won’t find in the S21-series flagships. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="24r4ZA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The A52’s display will offer a 90Hz refresh rate, while the A52 5G will have a 120Hz screen&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N4Lex2"&gt;Each is built on an unspecified octa-core (dual 2.3GHz + hexa 1.8GHz) processor and will ship with Android 11 and Samsung’s One UI 3.0. Storage variants of 128GB and 256GB will be offered for all models, with RAM configurations that will vary by region. The devices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355777/samsung-android-os-update-promise-galaxy-phones-3-generations"&gt;meet the hardware requirements&lt;/a&gt; to receive three generations of Android OS platform updates, and, like all recent Galaxy phones, are guaranteed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates"&gt;at least four years of security updates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DdPhNi"&gt;The Galaxy A52 and A52 5G will both feature 6.5-inch Super AMOLED screens. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278488/samsung-galaxy-a52-a72-leak-90hz-refresh-rate-screen"&gt;As rumored&lt;/a&gt;, the A52’s display will offer a 90Hz refresh rate, while the A52 5G will have a 120Hz screen. Each will feature a rear “quad” camera array, though one of those four cameras is a 5-megapixel depth sensor. The main 64-megapixel f/1.8 camera is accompanied by a 12-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide 5-megapixel macro and 32-megapixel f/2.2 selfie cam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="TFaxC9"&gt;Samsung says the A52 models feature brighter screens — up to 800 nits as compared to last year’s 600 — and 4,500mAh batteries capable of two days’ use on a single charge. And naturally, the A52 5G includes 5G connectivity, though Samsung hasn’t confirmed yet which frequencies it will support in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RQP3P2"&gt;The Galaxy A72 offers a slightly larger 6.7-inch Super AMOLED screen with a 90Hz refresh rate. It offers the same basic rear camera array but includes an 8-megapixel f/2.4 3x telephoto camera instead of the depth sensor. The A72 is an LTE-only model; a 5G version is likely to come but Samsung hasn’t confirmed this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oVmRRQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10396033"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LhkerI"&gt;We should find out US pricing and availability for these devices — and potentially other A-series models — in the next few weeks. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/8/21212085/samsung-galaxy-a01-a11-a21-a51-a71-5g-mid-range-android-price-release-date"&gt;Last year’s&lt;/a&gt; A51 and A51 5G were introduced at $400 and $500, respectively, with the 5G version of the A71 coming in at $600. If this year’s models are priced similarly, these devices will be well-positioned to tempt midrange shoppers with features like fast refresh rate screens, stabilized main cameras, and IP ratings, which aren’t common in this class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bvSpSx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 17th, 10:50AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Added information about Android platform OS updates.&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
