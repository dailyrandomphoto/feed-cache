    <title>How Bezos’ latest plan to protect forests could backfire</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qcS7dk"&gt;Jeff Bezos’ $2 billion plan, announced last week, to plant trees and restore landscapes across Africa and the US has already raised red flags for some conservation experts and activists. Last year, after he pledged &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/17/21141132/jeff-bezos-earth-fund-ten-billion-climate-change"&gt;$10 billion&lt;/a&gt; to fight climate change, activists in the US &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266225/jeff-bezos-climate-change-earth-fund-amazon-pollution"&gt;called him out&lt;/a&gt; for not doing enough to cut down Amazon’s pollution or work with local communities while crafting his environmental plans. This time, he’s facing similar criticisms on a global scale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V4WmjR"&gt;The Bezos Earth Fund &lt;a href="https://www.bezosearthfund.org/announcements"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; its latest round of funding on November 1 during a high-profile United Nations climate summit taking place in Glasgow. There aren’t many details out yet, but the fund says it will funnel $1 billion towards planting trees and “revitalizing” grasslands in Africa, as well as restoring 20 different landscapes across the US. The other $1 billion will support sustainable agriculture initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M9pEfX"&gt;The hope with the new conservation investment is to preserve ecosystems that naturally draw down and store planet-heating carbon dioxide pollution. That builds on a commitment Bezos made in September to spend $1 billion to create and manage so-called “protected” areas for conservation. The Bezos Earth Fund also says it wants local communities and Indigenous peoples “placed at the heart of conservation programs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mQxvJU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The worst-case scenario is they do a lot of damage”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EscxjA"&gt;But without safeguards in place, the initiative could potentially harm ecosystems and infringe on local and Indigenous peoples’ rights, some experts say. Instead of flinging money into these projects, they’d rather see Bezos cut pollution from the behemoth businesses he’s founded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="giNOkY"&gt;“Organizations like the Bezos Earth Fund have tended to sort of hire people in Seattle to fix Africa. And that doesn’t work,” says Forrest Fleischman, who teaches natural resources policy at the University of Minnesota. “Sort of the best-case scenario [with inexperienced donors] is that they waste all the money, and the worst-case scenario is they do a lot of damage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wuvFn4"&gt;There are heated debates flaring up right now around how to conserve and restore ecosystems. That’s, in part, because of a stream of splashy, new projects to tackle climate change and biodiversity loss. Last year, for instance, the World Economic Forum launched an initiative to plant a trillion trees. That was met with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21115862/davos-1-trillion-trees-controversy-world-economic-forum-campaign"&gt;pushback&lt;/a&gt; from a cadre of forestry and conservation experts, who warned that aggressive tree-planting campaigns have, at times, led to monocrops of a single species of tree. Those tree farms don’t offer the same kinds of ecological benefits as natural forests that are teeming with diverse species. They might even harm ecosystems by putting a lot of trees where they don’t belong, like in savannas and grasslands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2zCoL"&gt;“Many believe that nothing bad can possibly come from planting trees, but planting trees ...in grasslands and savannas does irreversible damage to grasslands and savannas,” Rhodes University ecologist Susanne Vetter wrote in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Environmental groups like the World Resources Institute have mistakenly mapped those ecosystems as degraded forests suitable for tree planting in the past, Vetter wrote in an opinion &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2020.549483/full"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems in 2020. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBZxQE"&gt;The Bezos Earth Fund said that it will work with AFR100, a partnership between 31 governments in Africa that is advised by WRI and aims to restore 100 million hectares of land across the continent by 2030. AFR100 “advocates actively against the conversion of natural ecosystems, like grasslands and savannas, into tree plantations,” a spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Each country that’s part of AFR100 ultimately makes decisions based on input from experts and local communities, says Bernadette Arakwiye, a research associate for WRI based in Rwanda. The maps Vetter referenced in her paper have been updated and don’t necessarily inform decisions on which lands to restore, according to Arakwiye. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pcJsdq"&gt;But splashy climate change commitments like the Bezos Earth Fund can easily fall into pitfalls associated with tree planting because of their focus on speed and scale, says Prakash Kashwan, an associate professor of political science at the University of Connecticut. “Designing restoration projects that are environmentally good requires working with each individual landscape based on what the landscape is like,” he says. “If our goal is to learn from indigenous engagements with nature, one fundamental principle is to slow down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="BfeYMN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s a history of “green-grabbing”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6BTSLq"&gt;Taking the time to consult with local communities who use the land is also important because projects can also inflame old wounds inflicted upon Indigenous peoples in the name of conservation in the past. There’s a history of &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00139157.2021.1924574?journalCode=venv20"&gt;“green-grabbing” that’s tied to colonization&lt;/a&gt; around the world. Half of “protected” areas around the world occupy lands that were once Indigenous peoples’ homes and territories, according to a 2016 &lt;a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/IPeoples/SRIndigenousPeoples/Pages/Conservation.aspx"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by former United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples’ Victoria Tauli-Corpuz. After land has been set aside as a protected area, tribes might be pushed off their lands or could be barred from practicing traditions like hunting, even when done sustainably. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n4vMHt"&gt;There’s also a history of violent policing of protected areas. The World Wildlife Fund (WWF), for example, funded park rangers accused of killing, raping, and torturing local and Indigenous people at African national parks and wildlife reserves, a 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/collection/wwfsecretwar"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Buzzfeed News &lt;/em&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt; found. In 2020, the Bezos Earth Fund awarded WWF &lt;a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/the-bezos-earth-fund-wwf-investment-in-community-and-climate#:~:text=The%20Bezos%20Earth%20Fund%20has,of%20people%20around%20the%20world."&gt;$100 million&lt;/a&gt; to protect and restore more lands.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YlAg2D"&gt;Experts &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke with have advice for how to avoid repeating the past. “This money should be targeted to wherever, to whatever local communities are already doing and think are the best approaches to [restore landscapes],” says Ida Djenontin, whose research focuses on environmental management and governance at Michigan State University and London School of Economics. Djenontin has also previously collaborated with AFR100. &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/6/3015"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; has found that forests fare better under the care of Indigenous peoples that depend on them for their livelihoods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="C6U6hB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Forests fare better under the care of Indigenous peoples&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JqvYGX"&gt;Kashwan is concerned that even if the Bezos Earth Fund is serious about wanting to center Indigenous peoples in its conservation programs, meaningful engagement could be hampered in developing nations that lack a strong, existing framework of legal protections for tribes. “These initiatives are fundamentally flawed because all they do is to [make] declarations of good intentions,” Kashwan says. There’s no institutional mechanism for accountability across much of the Global South, he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uXIli5"&gt;Even in the US, there’s still work to be done to make sure environmental philanthropy efforts are mindful of vulnerable populations. The Bezos Earth Fund says that 40 percent of funds earmarked for the US will go towards projects that “directly engage or benefit underserved communities.” That comes after grassroots activists &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22662529/jeff-bezos-earth-fund-150-million-climate-justice-amazon"&gt;pushed Bezos&lt;/a&gt; to invest more in communities of color disproportionately burdened with pollution. Some of those communities are still fighting for Amazon to clean up the air pollution its warehouses saddle their neighborhoods with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ICELp"&gt;Experts tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that perhaps the biggest impact Bezos could have would be to stop the harm Amazon does to the environment through its pollution. Even after making big pledges to tackle climate change, Amazon’s greenhouse gas emissions have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/23/21300427/amazon-climate-change-commitments-greenhouse-gas-emissions-jeff-bezos"&gt;continued to grow&lt;/a&gt; in recent years. As long as that’s the case, initiatives like Bezos Earth Fund amount to little more than corporate greenwashing, say experts like Fiore Longo, head of the conservation campaign at Survival International, a human rights organization that advocates for tribal peoples. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WqZrAl"&gt;Wealthy corporate figureheads, she says, “think they can just keep destroying the planet through producing emissions and then creating protected areas or planting trees somewhere and then magically, their emissions will be compensated for. In the key moment that we are in when we need real decisions for the protection of biodiversity and to stop climate change, we can’t allow ourselves this kind of distraction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K5r2zF"&gt;The Bezos Earth Fund declined &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton finally adds a pause button for its on-demand classes on its bikes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/buLtCNcVJt0ignuuJSkWFvnK850=/128x0:2306x1452/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70113322/Screen_Shot_2021_11_08_at_2.46.07_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kcyOtR"&gt;Peloton has announced that it’s &lt;a href="https://blog.onepeloton.com/pause-button/"&gt;finally added a pause button&lt;/a&gt; for its on-demand classes for its Bike and Bike Plus devices, allowing users to temporarily pause workouts in the middle of a class and then resume them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5kbsBC"&gt;It’s a feature that bewilderingly hasn’t been available until today — and, technically, still isn’t even available on all of Peloton’s products, as the pause button is only rolling out to its cycling bikes for now. The Tread treadmill is set to get a similar update sometime “in the future” — but for now, you’ll have to do your runs all at once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6IHfuG"&gt;While it’s easy to joke at Peloton’s expense for the outsized deal the company is making over adding so small a feature, it is worth noting that adding a pause button to Peloton classes &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; involve a bit more thought behind it than simply just pausing and resuming the class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZwaaYn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Rolling out today on the Bike and Bike Plus&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bX3zyN"&gt;That’s largely because of Peloton’s popular leaderboard and ranking system, which let customers compare how they’re doing in a particular workout against fellow Peloton users. Adding a pause button could sully the integrity of those metrics, allowing unscrupulous users to pause, catch a quick breather, and then resume the workout at maximum effort to skew their ranking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYA2yi"&gt;Pausing a workout, however, will automatically cause users to lose their rank on the leaderboard (although all the other usual metrics, challenges, achievements, and personal records will still be unchanged). Paused users will still appear on the “Here Now” list in the app and receive high fives from other Peloton users, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sKDJlg"&gt;Obviously, the new pause button only works for on-demand Peloton classes and not for live classes — Peloton is a powerful force, but freezing the forward motion of temporal space and reversing the entropic march toward the universe’s inevitable heath death remain beyond its capabilities. At least, for now. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rivian will start selling electric vans to non-Amazon companies in 2023</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pWZr0lgZQcjon48uXkbF9Nckass=/118x0:1558x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70113105/fleet_overlay_amazon_alzb8t.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Rivian&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zBm5Jo"&gt;Rivian says it will start taking orders for its electric delivery vans in 2022 and will deliver them to fleet customers in “early 2023,” calling into question the status of Amazon’s exclusive rights to the vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o8PI33"&gt;The buzzy EV startup — which is slated to go public this week at a valuation of $50 billion or higher — quietly announced the details about its fleet sales plans in a &lt;a href="https://rivian.com/fleet"&gt;new section of its website that went live Friday afternoon&lt;/a&gt;. It also said it will sell fleet versions of its R1T electric pickup truck and R1S electric SUV, meaning it will compete with Ford’s commercial version of the F-150 Lightning, as well as a fleet management platform called FleetOS and a charging infrastructure solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DPySLD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Electric vans, plus fleet versions of the R1T and R1S, will be available&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GvjywR"&gt;Selling electric delivery vans to commercial fleet customers other than Amazon could help Rivian make a lot more money in the near term, as the market for these vehicles is still wide open. But the startup runs the risk of biting off more than it can chew. Rivian’s ability to make vehicles at scale is still unproven; it has only just started making and delivering the R1T and is still preparing the delivery van for mass production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WppWmX"&gt;The fleet section of Rivian’s website was launched just one day after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22764212/rivian-discrimination-lawsuit-toxic-bro-culture-rj-scaringe-ipo"&gt;the company was sued by a former VP&lt;/a&gt; for alleged gender discrimination; among other things, she claimed Rivian had manufacturing quality problems and too-lofty delivery targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LwfT29"&gt;Amazon and Rivian announced that they were collaborating on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873947/amazon-electric-delivery-van-rivian-jeff-bezos-order"&gt;an electric delivery van in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. The conglomerate said it would order up to 100,000 vans through 2024, part of the effort to decarbonize its logistics fleet. Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/29/amazon-reveals-20percent-stake-in-electric-vehicle-maker-rivian.html"&gt;recently confirmed&lt;/a&gt; it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22711196/rivian-s-1-ipo-amazon-ford-r1t-electric-pickup-truck"&gt;owns some 20 percent of Rivian&lt;/a&gt; after participating in multiple funding rounds before the IPO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YlooF5"&gt;When Rivian announced its plan to go public earlier this year, it shared &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001874178/000119312521315537/d157488ds1a.htm#toc157488_14"&gt;further details about the deal with Amazon&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001874178/000119312521315537/d157488dex1013.htm"&gt;filings&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001874178/000119312521315537/d157488dex1014.htm"&gt;with&lt;/a&gt; the Securities and Exchange Commission. The two companies agreed that Amazon would have exclusive rights to the delivery van for four years after Rivian provided the first batch. Amazon would also have the right of first refusal for two years after that over any other companies that wanted to buy the vans from Rivian. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N0hFlJ"&gt;As a result, Rivian confessed to prospective investors that a “significant portion” of its “near-term” revenue would come from Amazon. And some were listening. “The exclusivity clause of this agreement may significantly hamper Rivian’s ability to capture market share,” equity research firm New Constructs &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/rivian-amazon-deal-could-backfire-ipo-startup-2021-11"&gt;wrote in a report last week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="06aEBk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Rivian’s IPO filing reveals Amazon’s prime influence","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22711196/rivian-s-1-ipo-amazon-ford-r1t-electric-pickup-truck"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="EGsFkt"&gt;Neither company would explain the current status of Amazon’s exclusive rights to Rivian’s van, though. The new section of Rivian’s site, which was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/4000sonnets/status/1456693374971375617"&gt;tweeted by communications director Amy Mast&lt;/a&gt;, says customers will be able to use an “online fleet configurator to plan and place your fleet order” in “early 2022,” and that “[d]eliveries of the [van] are scheduled to begin in early 2023.” Mast declined to comment, citing the SEC’s mandatory quiet period in the run-up to a public offering. Amazon also declined to comment when asked about the status of the exclusivity period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yNaZjl"&gt;There are a few provisions in the agreement with Amazon that could void the exclusivity period, though they don’t seem applicable yet. If Amazon doesn’t order 10,000 of Rivian’s vans in each of the two years after they go into production, it would have to reimburse the startup for certain costs and the exclusivity period would be voided. Same goes if Amazon terminates its agreement with Rivian before ordering all 100,000 vans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I2pNvh"&gt;Rivian still touts the deal with Amazon on the new fleet page, too. “To meet the demands of the largest retail seller in the United States, Rivian created vehicles and infrastructures to increase safety and efficiency while improving total cost of ownership,” the company writes. “Rivian plans to deliver 100,000 Electric Delivery Vans to Amazon to help Amazon take a significant step toward achieving its ambitious goals for the planet.” The startup confirms it still plans to deliver the first 10 delivery vans to Amazon by the end of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2QCCH6"&gt;There could be a semantic explanation for all of this. Rivian and Amazon’s exclusive agreement is in reference to “last mile delivery vehicles,” which the companies obtusely define as “any electric vehicles and other delivery carriers and systems designed or produced for use in a fleet for logistics or last mile transportation of goods to the final delivery destination.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvxtoo"&gt;Rivian’s new fleet site, however, refers to the van more broadly as a “commercial vehicle.” So it may be that Rivian is starting to detail efforts to sell vans to companies that aren’t in the delivery business, and that the exclusivity is more about keeping Rivian’s vans away from Amazon’s direct competition. (Though, FedEx has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225394/gm-brightdrop-electric-delivery-ep1-ev600-ces-2021"&gt;working with General Motors’ commercial EV effort&lt;/a&gt;, BrightDrop, and &lt;a href="https://arrival.com/us/en/news/ups-invests-in-arrival-and-orders-10000-generation-2-electric-vehicles"&gt;UPS invested in Arrival&lt;/a&gt;.) Whatever is happening, it appears that Rivian’s deal with Amazon is not as prohibitive as it initially seemed — and something the company will likely share more about after it goes public this week.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="710oE4"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/hdsiymnBBWM"&gt;“Out West” emote&lt;/a&gt;, which features audio of the Travis Scott song “Out West,” has been removed from the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; Item Shop. In fact, the entire section of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s &lt;/em&gt;Item Shop that housed the dance emote is gone. According to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-11-08-fortnite-pulls-travis-scott-emote-from-daily-shop"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the “Daily” section of the Item Shop has disappeared with no explanation, and Epic declined to comment to &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1Vq7jj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It’s known that the "Daily" section of the Item Shop has been disabled. This is intentional and the "Daily" section will return with the next Item Shop refresh. &lt;a href="https://t.co/rc6Kqh7qoW"&gt;pic.twitter.com/rc6Kqh7qoW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Fortnite Status (@FortniteStatus) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1457538163262607361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ArAmKt"&gt;The emote was apparently on sale to coincide with Scott’s music festival Astroworld, which ended prematurely when &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/07/us/astroworld-travis-scott-deaths.html"&gt;eight people died&lt;/a&gt; after being crushed in what witnesses are calling an overcrowded and unsafe venue. After the incident, Scott was criticized for allegedly continuing the concert as people were being crushed and for not having enough safety protocols in place. Last year, the rapper &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;held a &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; virtual concert&lt;/a&gt;, and multiple Travis Scott-themed items were created and sold to celebrate the event. It seems the “Out West” emote was the only Travis Scott item affected, and it is not known if Epic Games will disable other Travis Scott emotes or skins or if they will return to the shop in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford is already sold out of its electric crate motor but won’t say how many</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zpP_szesfMMWYCFFD-u4roJj5Qk=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70112866/All_electric_Ford_F_100_Eluminator_concept_truck_05.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="abbrzs"&gt;Days after Ford started selling its first-ever electric crate motor, it already sold out (via &lt;a href="https://fordauthority.com/2021/11/ford-eluminator-electric-crate-engine-sold-out-but-more-on-the-way/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ford Authority&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Ford just isn’t saying how many were sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zDvEdr"&gt;Ford caught the attention of EV and Ford enthusiasts alike when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759825/ford-electric-crate-motors-mustang-mach-e-gt-performance"&gt;it showcased the Eluminator&lt;/a&gt; in an all-electric 1978 F-100. The $3,900 crate motor is the same one that powers the Mustang Mach-E GT, sporting 480 horsepower with 634 pound-feet of torque. Batteries and other components aren’t included with the motor, although Ford plans on making those parts available individually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HYcDKr"&gt;“Demand has exceeded expectations,” a Ford spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. At this point, it remains unclear how e-crate motors were sold or if those numbers surpassed the typical sales for Ford’s gasoline-powered crate motors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T9H7cj"&gt;If you were hoping to get your hands on the Eluminator, whether to throw it in an existing build or to start a custom project, Ford notes that it will be back in stock soon. The Ford spokesperson told us that “interested customers can sign up online to be notified when they are available again to order” by entering an email or phone number on &lt;a href="https://accessories.ford.com/products/eluminator-mach-e-electric-motor"&gt;the Eluminator’s product page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Niantic launches platform to build ‘real-world metaverse’ apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TV1Sgh58QrFvGYQIswo9NKrUXsE=/917x0:2477x1040/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70112689/Metaverse_SmallFile.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Niantic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OVweE3"&gt;Niantic is releasing a platform for building what it calls “real-world metaverse” apps. Called Lightship, the platform is “built around the parts necessary to stitch together the digital and the real world,” CEO John Hanke tells me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Q0cVz"&gt;According to Hanke, Lightship will let mobile apps identify whether a user’s camera is pointed at the sky or water, map the surfaces and depth of an environment in real time, or place a virtual object behind a physical one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jsUc6e"&gt;Niantic is best known for creating one of the most &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761166/pokemon-go-ar-games-future-pikmin-harry-potter"&gt;successful mobile games ever, &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;With Lightship, Hanke says the company is “opening the vault of tech that we’ve been using to build our products” to help others build “planet-scale AR apps.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9s4jZl"&gt;Lightship has been in development &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/28/17511606/niantic-labs-pokemon-go-real-world-platform-ar"&gt;for quite some time&lt;/a&gt;. But starting Monday, it’s open for any developer to access. Most of the software toolkit is free, though Niantic will charge for a feature that can let multiple devices access shared AR experiences simultaneously. The company is also committing $20 million to fund new companies building AR apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n8BTnM"&gt;Niantic is already planning a major update to Lightship for next year, building what Hanke calls a “visual positioning system” for AR glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NPFqae"&gt;By using the new system, glasses with displays in them will be able to understand exactly where they are in the real world, which will let virtual objects (such as a Pikachu) stay anchored persistently to real-world locations. It’s a critical component needed to make AR glasses, such as the kind that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20997493/niantic-qualcomm-xr2-ar-glasses"&gt;Niantic is building with Qualcomm&lt;/a&gt;, useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wOmrw5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Niantic wants to “set a pattern for what AR can be”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7tcgzB"&gt;Hanke, who previously ran Google Maps before starting Niantic, says the goal with Lightship is to “basically set a pattern for what AR can be.” While tech giants like Meta and Apple are building similar software tools, he thinks Lightship’s support for iOS and Android will make it an attractive offering to developers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UUhKQj"&gt;“The state of the world today is sort of 50/50 between Android and iOS,” he says. “And I think it’s going to be much more diversified in the world of AR glasses. So a solution that actually solves the developer problem of being able to write something and create something that’s going to work across multiple platforms is really important.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2keq1N"&gt;In August, Hanke wrote a blog post calling the idea of the metaverse a &lt;a href="https://nianticlabs.com/blog/real-world-metaverse/"&gt;“dystopian nightmare.”&lt;/a&gt; He’s against the idea of technology pulling people out of the real world. Unlike the VR metaverse championed by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, he wants Niantic and Lightship developers building AR apps that keep people engaged with the physical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LCqs3T"&gt;“There’s a fork in the road,” he says. “One path goes in this direction of apps that are not connected to the world around us and not helping us connect with the people who we are around.” The other path Niantic is taking with Lightship, according to Hanke, is “encouraging people to do things together with other folks who are alive.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Buy two games and get one free at Target or Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="Games" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Np1DuI6gn9hjF77DrgiplfAsQhs=/0x0:765x510/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70112586/games-install.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QUSmms"&gt;Clear off some room on your bookshelf because Target and Amazon are having a “buy two, get one free” sale on video games. This sale is unfortunately restricted to physical copies but includes new titles like &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Vanguard&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22747428/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-review-ps5-square-enix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. While we’re definitely here for the video games, it’s worth mentioning that this deal includes tons of classic and contemporary board games as well, like &lt;em&gt;Exploding Kittens&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing Monopoly,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Sushi Go!&lt;/em&gt;. If you’re looking to fill out your game collection, we’ve linked to the landing pages for both retailers below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tuNxjQ"&gt;“Buy two, get one free” video games: &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/promotion/psp/A2NEKY0JEA1965"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;

Right now, this amazing headset has been discounted to just $130 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfXuffH6lfY" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, bringing it down to its lowest price ever. This deal is normally only available to My Best Buy members, but it’s available to the public for today only. This incredibly comfy headset supports USB-C charging, and although it lacks a built-in audio mixer to adjust game and chat volume, we were still impressed by the overall sound profile of this particular headset.&lt;/p&gt;

Currently, you can save $40 on this robust and customizable peripheral at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMicrosoft-Xbox-Elite-Wireless-Controller-Series-2-Black-FST-00001%2F784834522%3Fathbdg%3DL1200&amp;amp;subid1=vergeconsoles110521" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-one-wireless-controller-elite-series-2%2F-%2FA-76439797%3Fclkid%3D8f237b25N38d111eca5f31be93c0cebf1%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeConsoleDeals110821" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, bringing it down to $140. One of the big caveats in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20926499/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our initial review&lt;/a&gt; of this controller was the hefty price tag, and while we could certainly justify the investment, this deal just makes the Series 2 that much more appealing. This hefty controller features trigger stops for quick double taps, back paddles for additional inputs, as well swappable thumbsticks for a truly customizable experience. &lt;/p&gt;

Originally $300, these noise-canceling headphones are available for their lowest price ever in black, white, or grey colorways. While the lack of a USB-C connection might annoy some Android users, the lightning connection is perfectly suited for anyone that lives in the Apple ecosystem. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931329/beats-solo-pro-review-noise-canceling-on-ear-wireless-headphones-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Our review&lt;/a&gt; was impressed by the solid sound quality and effective noise cancellation of these unassuming headphones, and we were pleased with the overall improvement in their design over previous models.&lt;/p&gt;

While these products are second-hand, a certified refurbished product is one that’s been returned to Bose and thoroughly inspected to meet their standards. These are, by far, some of the best discounts we’ve seen on these products, and we’re unlikely to see a deal this good on new models.

    <title>The Israeli army is using facial recognition to track Palestinians, former soldiers reveal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SOMstKOhEbENKkhkpmxuzHiioX4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70112184/acastro_210512_1777_deepfake_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PfwC4W"&gt;The Israeli military has deployed an extensive facial recognition program to track Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, according to a new report by &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/israel-palestinians-surveillance-facial-recognition/2021/11/05/3787bf42-26b2-11ec-8739-5cb6aba30a30_story.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SnDH76"&gt;Former Israeli soldiers told the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; about a smartphone technology called “Blue Wolf,” which takes photos of Palestinians and stores them in a large-scale database. Once an image is captured, Blue Wolf matches that picture to a person in its database, and as the&lt;em&gt; Post&lt;/em&gt; describes, soldiers’ phones will then flash a specific color that signifies if that individual should be arrested, detained, or left undisturbed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cyD7Me"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“People worry about fingerprinting, but this is that several times over”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r2whaZ"&gt;The&lt;em&gt; Post&lt;/em&gt; notes that the Israeli army has been filling up the database with thousands of images of Palestinians over the past two years, and it even held “competitions” that rewarded soldiers for taking the most photos of people. The database is essentially a “Facebook for Palestinians,” a former soldier told the&lt;em&gt; Post&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZMPd3"&gt;The Israeli military has also set up cameras throughout the city of Hebron that scan Palestinians’ faces and identify them for soldiers at checkpoints. Meanwhile, a series of CCTV cameras, some of which point into people’s homes, provide live monitoring 24/7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lqRpMG"&gt;According to the&lt;em&gt; Post&lt;/em&gt;, the former soldiers were told by the military that the surveillance system was put in place to prevent terrorism. Either way, Israel’s system takes facial recognition to a dystopian extreme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="stCWmo"&gt;The largest city in the West Bank, Hebron has seen bitter and long-standing conflict between Israeli and Palestinian populations. A large portion of the city is administered directly by the Israeli military, which enforces curfews and other movement restrictions on the local population. But even in the context of the extreme security measures, the former soldiers who spoke to the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; found the facial recognition system alarming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ueid02"&gt;“I wouldn’t feel comfortable if they used it in the mall in [my hometown], let’s put it that way,” a former soldier told the&lt;em&gt; Post&lt;/em&gt;. “People worry about fingerprinting, but this is that several times over.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vmnx1L"&gt;There have been a number of similar systems implemented in other countries, and all have been controversial. China &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163499/huawei-uighur-surveillance-facial-recognition-megvii-uyghur"&gt;developed a similar facial recognition system&lt;/a&gt; to monitor the Uyghur minority population, although it’s unclear how widely the system was put into use. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728667/russia-face-pay-system-moscow-metro-privacy"&gt;Moscow recently added facial recognition payment systems&lt;/a&gt; to hundreds of metro stations, while the UK launched a similar &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22732330/uk-schools-facial-recognition-lunch-payments-north-ayrshire"&gt;face-scanning payment system for schoolchildren&lt;/a&gt; at lunchtime.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xFMmaN"&gt;There are countless brands that make standing desks, but Fully makes some of the best. And now through November 30th, the day after Cyber Monday, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=44880&amp;amp;u1=VergeFullyDeals110821&amp;amp;murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fully.com%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can get 15 percent off every item available on its online store&lt;/a&gt;. That includes its Jarvis standing desks and handy accessories you might want with one, like a monitor arm, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=44880&amp;amp;u1=VergeFullyDeals110821&amp;amp;murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fully.com%2Faccessories%2Fpowered-grommet-cover.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;powered grommet covers that give you extra plugs and USB charging ports&lt;/a&gt;, and more. These deals don’t completely change that these are still pricey products, but if you have a home office, you stand to level up a few rungs on the ergonomic ladder by taking advantage of these deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T7BnUl"&gt;If you’re looking for a real wood tabletop for your desk instead of less durable MDF material, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=44880&amp;amp;u1=VergeFullyDeals110821&amp;amp;murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fully.com%2Fstanding-desks%2Fjarvis%2Fjarvis-adjustable-height-desk-bamboo.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Jarvis standing desk with a bamboo top starts at $484&lt;/a&gt; instead of $569. The cost goes up from there depending on the size of desk you’d like, along with several other customizations that make the price go up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2A9Luf"&gt;We haven’t reviewed standing desks at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252470/work-from-home-remote-gadgets-recommendations"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252470/work-from-home-remote-gadgets-recommendations"&gt;Fully’s Jarvis desk has been mentioned several times&lt;/a&gt; by a few of us here who own one (including myself).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="n6pHIx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10852598"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="0O1PD5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"What’s on your Fully Jarvis desk, Jay Peters?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22310104/remote-work-desk-home-set-up-jay-peters-macbook-xbox"},{"title":"What’s on your Fully Jarvis desk, Dan Seifert?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22395531/remote-work-desk-setup-from-home-office-tech"},{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="EPqPPB"&gt;Fully makes less costly desks, too, like the Remi laminate standing desk, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=44880&amp;amp;u1=VergeFullyDeals110821&amp;amp;murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fully.com%2Fstanding-desks%2Fremi-standing-desk.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;which now costs $390&lt;/a&gt; instead of $459. The company also makes several fixed-height desks, which are seeing a 15 percent price drop right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WqFQrT"&gt;Whether you want to go in on a desk or not, Fully’s accessories are compatible with more than its own creations. For people who are on their feet at a desk, the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=44880&amp;amp;u1=VergeFullyDeals110821&amp;amp;murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fully.com%2Faccessories%2Fstanding-desk-mats%2Ftopo-standing-mat.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Topo anti-fatigue mat makes that far less of a strain&lt;/a&gt;. Normally $99, it costs $84. The &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=44880&amp;amp;u1=VergeFullyDeals110821&amp;amp;murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fully.com%2Faccessories%2Fstanding-desk-mats%2Ftopo-mini-standing-mat.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;mini version costs $67&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dmnAfR"&gt;Another great addition to your work space could be &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=44880&amp;amp;u1=VergeFullyDeals110821&amp;amp;murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fully.com%2Faccessories%2Fjarvis-monitor-arm.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fully’s Jarvis monitor arm&lt;/a&gt; that fastens to your desk. It has a wide range of motion, even letting your monitor twist to the side if you’d rather orient your setup that way. Normally $129, it’s $110 now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MD4zg2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10852592"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Apple macOS 12 Monterey review: the best is yet to come</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;It’s fine, but Apple has unfinished business&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="8VNIdt"&gt;Downloading &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21564490/macos-big-sur-review-apple-macbook-pro-air-mac-ipad-m1"&gt;macOS Big Sur&lt;/a&gt; was a big change for me — visually, pragmatically, philosophically. It was the biggest macOS redesign we’d seen in years. And it was a new direction for the ecosystem in general; macOS looked and felt like iOS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qlhZcb"&gt;Downloading macOS Monterey, by contrast, has not impacted my life much. I installed the first beta over the summer, forgot that I was using it within a few days, and tried to download it again the following week. It looks like Big Sur, with some tweaks here and there. Many of them seem to be catch-up efforts, equipping Monterey with features that iOS (or competitors) already had. A few of the features are useful for me, but they’re features you have to seek out and set up. And we’re still waiting on some of the most innovative parts of Monterey that Apple announced earlier this year to arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vWJr5y"&gt;So my ultimate view on this operating system is, “Sure.” It’s a stable release that I’ve been using reliably for a few months. Nothing’s terribly broken. If you’re someone who prefers to exercise maximum caution and wait a while before upgrading, you’re also not missing all that much. As is often the case with releases directly following a major redesign, this is a building year for macOS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="urYC6u"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple MacBook Pro 14 and 16 review: return to form","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review"},{"title":"Apple finally listened to the pros","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22733328/apple-macbook-pro-ports-professional-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="yxKxsM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10848473"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A blank MacBook desktop with a purple and pink gradient background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YwmUf3sTHLLQ3b7cz-kKzFHxKc0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22989814/Image_11_5_21_at_4.27_PM.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the desktop of a MacBook running macOS Monterey. Look familiar?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8x3fR1"&gt;FaceTime&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="YrJPaX"&gt;The tweaks that Apple seems to be most excited about concern FaceTime. While I won’t go so far as to insinuate that Apple is trying to make FaceTime a Zoom competitor, it’s certainly introduced a number of features aimed at making its service more viable for group calls. The significant one for me is that you can now create links to FaceTime calls (as you can with Zoom calls) and send them out to participants ahead of time. These links are very easy to create with a single button on the app’s home screen — certainly slightly less of a pain than they are in the Zoom client on macOS. (On the other hand, the FaceTime link is just a link; it doesn’t come with dial-in numbers and you can’t join from a landline.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dEX1JA"&gt;These links also allow Android and Windows users to join such calls for the first time. Joining a FaceTime call from a Windows laptop is eerily similar to joining a Zoom or Google Meet call — you click the link, the call opens in your browser, you’re asked to enter your name, and you wait around until the host lets you in. Also in the vein of targeting the business market (or, at least, the calls-with-multiple-friends market), FaceTime now supports Grid View, which lays the faces of participants in front of you when you’re on a call (an option &lt;a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362323-Adjusting-screen-view-settings-during-a-virtual-meeting"&gt;Zoom also has&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDefNl"&gt;There are a few other neat features that pop up in Control Center, including Portrait Mode (which blurs the background behind you), Voice Isolation (which mitigates background noise while you’re speaking), and Wide Spectrum (which picks up all of your background noise, if you’re doing a virtual guitar lesson or something). Portrait Mode, in particular, works quite well, is easy to toggle on and off, and is something I’ll continue to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A user faces the camera on a FaceTime call with their background blurred out. A drop-down menu from the Control Center indicates that Portrait Mode is active." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FSk6luq9rJYUC8aCy6NmdJXDSr0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22989881/Screen_Shot_2021_11_05_at_4.50.13_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s FaceTime blurring out my background on a call.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oQLqMt"&gt;These features are actually available for third-party apps to support as well, though who supports what seems to vary. I could use Portrait Mode in both Zoom and Google Meet but couldn’t use the microphone controls. I haven’t been able to find a list of apps that support these enhancements, but I have asked Apple for one, and I’ll update this review if they dig anything up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rKQeno"&gt;The most exciting new FaceTime feature, though — and the one that could really distinguish it from Zoom and other competitors when it comes to group calls — is still in beta. It’s SharePlay. SharePlay is a service similar to Teleparty, Scener, and Watch Together. It allows you and other people on your FaceTime call to watch or listen to streaming content together by syncing everyone’s video and playback controls. (So we’re both watching &lt;em&gt;Foundation &lt;/em&gt;separately on our own Apple accounts — but when I pause or rewind, your video pauses or rewinds as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of an Apple Music interface. A notification in the top right reads “Music: Content will SharePlay automatically”." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cPgYmk2ifvwLjeq3bc4WdznkcVk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22989957/Screen_Shot_2021_11_05_at_5.06.00_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you open up a supported service like Apple Music while you’re on a FaceTime call, content SharePlays automatically.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YDulur"&gt;SharePlay, unfortunately, doesn’t seem ready yet. For one, the official list of services the feature supports isn’t easy to find — I had to get Apple to send me this &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/story/id1583059388"&gt;App Store Preview page&lt;/a&gt;. The supported services are also relatively few, and it doesn’t include any non-Apple big players like Hulu, HBO, Netflix, or Spotify yet — which are the services that people I know reliably have. It also doesn’t have Apple’s own Podcast app yet. (It does include Tiktok, which is hilarious.) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522904/apple-shareplay-facetime-music-hulu-videos-tiktok-wwdc"&gt;Hulu,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22673907/apple-event-2021-apple-tv-plus-streaming-wars"&gt;Spotify and HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; are supposed to be adopting SharePlay at some point, but Apple hasn’t given me a timeline for Podcasts support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HtiILL"&gt;That aside, the beta version of SharePlay is a nice experience — when it works. I played a few Apple Music tracks on a group call, and I would say SharePlay worked about 50 percent of the time. It was a good experience, and all parties could pause and skip without issue. But if I changed songs, my fellow callers would often stop hearing the audio I was trying to share and get stuck on a loading screen (while it continued to play on my end), and I’d have to quit and restart the Music app to get us synced up again. All told, I hope that Apple is able to polish SharePlay up before its final release — it still seems to be a beta feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of Safari with the sidebar open and The Verge Reviews homepage, with the combined URL and tab bar." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XtCNXc3f7SGXs-2WzVtY4QRt08Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22989960/Screen_Shot_2021_11_05_at_5.11.56_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s Safari with the combined tab bar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of Safari with the sidebar open and the Verge Reviews homepage displayed with separate tab and URL bars." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WvI-pHmGIYcgonPYEtwoOqfnf-8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22989961/Screen_Shot_2021_11_05_at_5.12.18_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;And here it is with the two bars separate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VyElJZ"&gt;Safari&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xqxfMb"&gt;The latest version of Safari isn’t limited to Monterey — you can install it on Big Sur, too, but Apple tends to update it around the same time that it updates macOS. This year’s edition redesigns the way tabs look — or, at least, it tried to. In the first few Monterey betas, Apple combined Safari’s tab bar and URL bar into a single row. People ended up hating this — the franken-bar was a bit cramped, and it was easy to close tabs instead of selecting them — so Apple has brought back the old, discrete bars for the stable release. The combined tab bar is still an option if you want it — you can swap in Preferences. I encourage you to try both layouts if you’re a Safari user. I actually like the extra browser space that the compact tab layout affords, though it gets a bit unwieldy if you have tons and tons of tabs open. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bz36nA"&gt;Apple’s made a few other tweaks to tabs. They look slightly rounder now, and you can hover over one to reveal its full page title and URL. Safari also now has “tab groups” (another feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/13/21257446/google-chome-tab-grouping-feature"&gt;Chrome has had for a while&lt;/a&gt;). If you have three tabs open, you can click a little icon in the top-left corner to make them into a tab group. Later on, if you open the sidebar on the left of the Safari window, you’ll see it listed under a “Tab Groups” heading; you can click on it to reopen those three tabs. Also in that sidebar live your bookmarks and your reading list. This is — finally — an area where I think Safari is now a step ahead of Chrome. I’ve always found tab groups in Chrome to be quite confusing and have never used them, but they’re so simple in Safari that I’ve already made them part of my routine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8CRIO4"&gt;Tab groups also sync across devices (as do Bookmarks, extensions, etc.), though I had to dig into Settings on all my Apple products and give iCloud permission to do that before it worked. There are also a few new security features, including Intelligent Tracking Prevention, which prevents “known trackers” from viewing your IP address, and HTTPS Upgrade, which automatically switches sites from HTTP to HTTPS when possible.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="II5wcz"&gt;And then there’s Quick Note. Quick Note ostensibly gives you an easy way to take notes on an article you’re reading — you can right-click highlighted text to add it to a Note, which will then pop back up whenever you return to that web page. I was excited about this when I tried it in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22557880/apple-macos-public-beta-facetime-safari-updates"&gt;early betas&lt;/a&gt;, but I never quite got the hang of them and haven’t actually ended up using it. It might be more useful for students who often have to take notes on long readings; I have trouble finding a use case for myself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CeIQGG"&gt;The new Safari as a whole was quite stable and speedy. Things weren’t randomly crashing or quitting. But the new sidebar, and the ease with which you can operate Tab Groups, has seriously made me consider switching to Safari. It’s surprisingly useful to have bookmarks, tab groups, and my reading list all in one place. If all the Chrome extensions I currently use make it over there, I’ll probably do it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qwz6ZWtl78JzSglvvF6IjXqYjxM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22989963/Screen_Shot_2021_11_05_at_5.15.53_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="faVKTv"&gt;Continuity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Hirq8y"&gt;When I asked Apple if there was any unifying theme or goal behind the big dump of features that is macOS Monterey, the company told me it was meant to further the journey Big Sur began of unifying macOS and iOS. Monterey has a few additions that are clearly meant to do that, though the biggest one isn’t ready yet. Universal Control will allow you to use an iPad as a secondary screen to your Mac, so you can drag / drop files between the two devices and operate them with a single mouse and keyboard. This has been one of the most anticipated Monterey features since the software was announced, but it’s still nowhere in sight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fxAyVU"&gt;A few other iOS staples have made their way onto macOS Monterey. One is Focus, which allows you to filter notifications based on the task you’re doing. Within Focus preferences, accessible from the Control Center, you can create various Focus profiles for work, gaming, and other scenarios; for each profile, you’ll essentially whitelist applications or contacts that are allowed to send you notifications when that profile is on. You can schedule Focus to turn on automatically at various times, in various locations, or with the opening of various apps, and you can allow people and apps to choose to notify you anyway if something is urgent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="wbP1LW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Verge guide to macOS","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21281530/macos-mac-imac-user-guide-how-to-os-tips"},{"title":"Apple macOS 11 Big Sur review: a long time coming","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21564490/macos-big-sur-review-apple-macbook-pro-air-mac-ipad-m1"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="t9AIsE"&gt;This is a feature I really wish I’d had in college — it would’ve been great for turning off social media while writing papers and such. Employed me finds it mostly useful for shutting up Slack after work hours (though you could already do that within the app itself). Switching to Focus in macOS can also switch it on across your iOS devices. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QFdml7GZ791cQIXVPPM4iCAfwH0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22989971/Screen_Shot_2021_11_05_at_5.17.40_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KTRbbe"&gt;Another thing I’ve found surprisingly handy: Shortcuts. Yes, Siri Shortcuts are a thing on Macs now. I barely use these on my iPhone, but I’ve actually found a few of them handy on my MacBook because you can stick them on the menu bar for quick access. In particular, “Split Screen Two Apps” and “Start My Next Meeting” were convenient to have up there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TfmJ4A"&gt;Odds and ends&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2oDhp"&gt;Various other apps have gotten updates here and there. There’s a new tab called “Shared With You” in Photos, News, Safari, Apple TV, and Apple Podcasts, which displays media that you’ve recently received in Messages. This feature sounds potentially useful but didn’t actually work for me — nothing was showing up in my Shared With You tabs unless I pinned it. Apple is still trying to figure out what’s going on but tells me it’s not an issue they’ve seen before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="vYJ6P1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;iOS staples have made their way onto macOS Monterey&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FZ9cPU"&gt;Speaking of Messages, if you text someone multiple photos, they’re now displayed as a collage or a stack, depending on how many you send. Sure. It’s cute. The app also displays a new button next to the photos you receive, which you can click to quickly save those photos to your device. Again, sure. It’s now slightly easier to save photos (though it wasn’t that hard before). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="Wtn1h2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10848592"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T61d0j"&gt;You can now tag your Notes, which is such a no-brainer I’m surprised it took Apple this long to implement it. Just type a hashtag followed by a word anywhere in the note in question, and it’ll show up as a tag in a “Tag Browser” on the left sidebar. Useful! I will use these. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iPgeSs"&gt;Elsewhere, Apple seems to be trying to push Notes towards a similar vein to Google Docs. There are a number of new features that smooth out the process of collaborating on Notes in iCloud. You can now type an @ to get a friend’s attention within a Note and can see a summary of updates to shared Notes in a new Activity View. These things I’m not sure about — I already use Docs for the purpose Notes is moving towards here, and the former is still much more full-featured, not to mention more widely accessible outside of Apple’s ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cdrK5k"&gt;Maps, finally, has received what Apple says is its largest update yet. The main thing you’ll notice is that zooming all the way out reveals a cute interactive globe floating in space. You can click and drag to spin it around, and there are little details for mountains, rainforests, and such. When I say cute, I mean cute — it’s somewhat cartoonish and not like using Google Earth. But it’s neat to play around with, and I’ve had fun dropping pins in random places. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wym9hn"&gt;More pragmatically, city layouts have gotten more useful. Zoom in on San Francisco, and you’ll see icons over the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz, Fisherman’s Wharf, Oracle Park, etc. Click those icons, and little cards pop up with basically all the information you might need about these destinations: hours, accessibility information, phone numbers, addresses, etc. I have actually started using Maps to plan trips instead of Google Maps because of these cards — I much prefer the card layout to having the information pop up in the sidebar like it does on Google. It takes up less space on the screen and doesn’t move everything else around when you open it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of Apple maps viewing Manhattan, with Grand Central Terminal’s information card selected." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hV-g8rXlmkH_0f28Y-E7sisSVLQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22989991/Screen_Shot_2021_11_05_at_5.22.27_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neat!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Kydzj7"&gt;Should you upgrade?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Ozx1H9"&gt;Sure, with the caveat that waiting a few weeks to download this stuff is always the safest course of action. For what it’s worth, Apple seems to have ironed out most of the bugs I saw in early betas, and it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/5/22765759/apple-macos-monterey-t2-security-brick-bug"&gt;just released a patch&lt;/a&gt; to fix some upgrade headaches with older Macs. It’s also worth bearing in mind that two of the most anticipated parts of this operating system — SharePlay and Universal Control — aren’t ready yet. Other folks who are particularly cautious about bugs may want to sift through the new features and figure out which ones will benefit their lives. There may be some, and there may not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fm1SuQ"&gt;Here’s what those features are for me: Portrait Mode, Safari Tab Groups, Shortcuts, Notes tags, and the new cards in Maps. None of these things have changed the way I observe or interact with macOS, but they’re all handy things that not all competitors have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of the Notes app in macOS Monterey. The not reads “Here is a new note, #newnote. That was easy.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/86sAZRm9X8k_GkUe6-YC7Ggu92I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22990000/Screen_Shot_2021_11_05_at_5.24.49_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sure, why not.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4bN2c6"&gt;They are, I will note, also all things that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"&gt;also exist in iOS&lt;/a&gt;. In my review of macOS Big Sur, I noted that many of the port-overs from iOS weren’t as beneficial on a non-touchscreen laptop as they were on a phone. macOS Monterey is a more incremental step ahead, which is to be expected the year after a major redesign. But I think Apple has also done a better job this year of pinpointing the sorts of iOS features that make sense to have on a Mac. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MiKJDy"&gt;With that said, macOS Monterey isn’t finished (despite a rather lengthy beta period), and I think there are still plenty of people who will upgrade and find little to no change to their macOS experience. That may be the case until SharePlay and Universal Control are ready to take the stage. &lt;/p&gt;
