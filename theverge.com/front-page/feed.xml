    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DNHiPm"&gt;If you ask Jimmy Bailey what killed his best friend Mark Calivas, his answer is simple: “It was Apple.” How else could he explain how the Apple Store wellness champion — known for evangelizing therapy and mental health — would slide into a depression so profound he’d be forced to take medical leave and ultimately die by suicide? “It was nothing in his outside life that did this,” Bailey says. “It was work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IEf0VL"&gt;Calivas started at the Apple Southpoint store in Durham, North Carolina in March 2013. His colleagues laughed when he’d arrived in the morning with multiple changes of clothes (he went on a six-mile run up the American Tobacco Trail on his lunch break) and healthy snacks (he was on the keto diet and carried around two 64oz water bottles). “He always had so many bags,” Bailey remembers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FgrzDm"&gt;Calivas had his demons. His mother had died when he was young; he’d never really known his father. But his job at the Apple Store grounded him. It gave him a sense of dignity and purpose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B0tvm5"&gt;Then the store hired a new manager: a whip smart, data-driven woman. According to Bailey and another former colleague, if you were on her good side, you could get a good schedule, a special project, a promotion. But if you weren’t? “You’d be punished in the most strategic ways possible,” the former colleague says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="dEOTln"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“To help dreamers become doers, to help passion expand human potential, to do the best work of our lives.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="05UAOy"&gt;By all accounts, Mark Calivas was never on her good side. “She hated him, she told me,” the former colleague explains. “She just would constantly talk about how Mark wasn’t good enough, Mark wasn’t special, don’t give that opportunity to Mark because he hasn’t earned it, even though he had done everything to earn it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCaMbx"&gt;Over the years working under the manager, Calivas’ confidence started to wane. He felt trapped — intimidated and bullied by her behavior, according to his close friends. In 2021, he took medical leave to cope with his depression. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5M6EQx"&gt;Bailey and two former colleagues say there have been multiple HR complaints filed against the manager (Apple would not confirm the complaints). But nothing ever seemed to change. “I filed three, maybe four complaints myself,” one of the former colleagues says. “I participated in at least six investigations.” Eventually, employees lost hope that anyone at Apple’s corporate office would hold the woman accountable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wY5mhT"&gt;In response to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Apple spokesperson Nick Leahy said: “We are and have always been deeply committed to creating and maintaining a positive and inclusive workplace. We take all concerns seriously and we thoroughly investigate whenever a concern is raised and, out of respect for the privacy of any individuals involved, we do not discuss specific employee matters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CasmPp"&gt;The story illustrates a potentially widespread problem for Apple’s frontline workers. When something goes wrong — a bad manager, a missed paycheck, an untenable onslaught of work — many say they have no one to turn to for help. “Corporate makes decisions based on what they think will work in the stores without talking to people who work in the stores,” a former colleague says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Zl4IJu"&gt;&lt;section class="ad"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ad__inner"&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena-mobile"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eu7YEm"&gt;This struggle echoes a complaint made by some employees in Cupertino, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22700898/apple-company-culture-change-secrecy-employee-unrest"&gt;who’ve said that the employee relations team&lt;/a&gt; — Apple’s version of human resources — is more concerned with protecting the company than its workforce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xjANSH"&gt;But hourly workers at Apple may have it even worse. The employees who spoke to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;say that while the company is hyper concerned with customers, it treats its retail and customer service staff as an afterthought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3Zfdw"&gt;Over the past five months, Apple’s hourly workforce has been watching as corporate employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22609687/apple-pay-equity-employee-surveys-protected-activity"&gt;advocate for more pay transparency&lt;/a&gt;. Some have organized with employees in Cupertino &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638150/apple-appletoo-employee-harassment-discord"&gt;under the banner #AppleToo&lt;/a&gt;, to call for better working conditions. Others are just now beginning to speak out — realizing that the issues their well-compensated corporate colleagues are experiencing could be greatly exacerbated on the frontlines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MRCZOp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke with 16 current and former employees on Apple’s retail, support, and sales teams who say their complaints about working conditions and pay have largely been ignored. Some say they are governed more by algorithms and systems than actual managers, making it difficult to get holistic help. All of them note that while they came into the job believing in Apple’s mission, they see a profound breakdown in how the company’s corporate values translate to the frontlines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZQAEDv"&gt;“They say our soul is our people but it really didn’t feel like that to me,” a former employee says.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="kkef4x"&gt;Nearly every shift at an Apple Store starts the same way: an employee picks a line from the Apple credo and talks about how it applies to that day’s work: “We are here to enrich lives. To help dreamers become doers, to help passion expand human potential, to do the best work of our lives. At our best, we give more than we take.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VtfhTA"&gt;Workers say it’s easy to tell who wants to get promoted because they’ll pick the line “Turning dreamers into doers” and discuss how Apple’s devices can help customers do that. Not every retail worker buys into it, though. “People get emotional,” says a current retail employee in Philadelphia. “You see people go really deep in that stuff when they want to get promoted. It’s all just pandering.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RFKkVX"&gt;Part of the issue is pay. Apple’s retail employees make on average between $19 and $25 an hour in the United States, &lt;a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Hourly-Pay/Apple-Hourly-Pay-E1138.htm"&gt;according to Glassdoor&lt;/a&gt;. That’s good for the retail industry, but can be grating for employees who want to build a career at the tech giant. Some say that after staying at the company for six years, they’re making less than $21 an hour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2HZ7vQ"&gt;Then there’s the issue of how retail workers are evaluated. In the store, Apple uses something called a “net promoter score” to see how stores are performing. After a customer leaves, they’ll sometimes receive a survey asking them to evaluate the employee who helped them as well as the overall store experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="C4kFwa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Employees spent eight hours a day fielding inquiries from angry customers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ljeqNJ"&gt;Low scores can often be about factors outside the employees’ control — things like low inventory or wait time. But they still reflect poorly on staff. “There’s never positive intent assumed,” says a current employee in Pittsburgh. “It always feels like you’re a kid getting in trouble and you’re making an excuse.” The surveys are meant to give customers a consistent way to say whether the stores are meeting Apple’s standards — but they systematically place the customer over the employee, by design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qq4FU1"&gt;This can be particularly frustrating when the issue stems from Apple corporate. In 2017, Apple customers with older iPhones realized that if they replaced their phone batteries, the performance would significantly improve. This quickly became one of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/28/16827248/apple-iphone-battery-replacement-price-slow-down-apology"&gt;Apple’s largest customer experience scandals&lt;/a&gt;, as people realized the company had intentionally slowed down older iPhone models to (supposedly) preserve their battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zCeK0z"&gt;To quell public outrage, the company said it would replace phone batteries, free of charge, for a year. To meet rising customer demand, Apple told some retail workers to try to complete battery swaps in under 10 minutes, according to a former employee. The result was a disaster for workers, who say they didn’t have the supplies or resources necessary to meet the mandate. “You can’t replace a battery in 10 minutes,” a former retail manager says bluntly. “Nothing translates from corporate to the stores because they’re not in the stores.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AwaHmR"&gt;Set against this backdrop, the Apple credo has become increasingly important. It’s meant to inspire employees to provide exemplary customer service — to elevate even mundane parts of the job to stratospheric levels of importance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RJa16b"&gt;In the past, some employees assumed that it applied to how Apple treated its workforce. Wasn’t the company supposed to enrich the lives of its employees? To give more than it took?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9VQyvX"&gt;&lt;section class="ad"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ad__inner"&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena-mobile"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FToUXM"&gt;That started to break down on March 14th, 2020, in the early days of the pandemic, when Apple announced it was temporarily closing all its stores, sending retail employees home. In Pennsylvania, one current worker was selected to be part of a new program to answer calls from customers who needed tech support over the phone. The employee was relieved — his wife was immunocompromised, and he himself suffered from asthma, making the pair particularly vulnerable to COVID-19. Being able to work from home seemed like a perfect solution to stay safe and continue earning money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ybNdj"&gt;From the start, the job was stressful. Employees spent eight hours a day fielding inquiries from angry customers. They were evaluated based on call time and customer satisfaction. As with many hourly roles at Apple, people with high scores knew they’d eventually get better schedules, promotions, and opportunities. People with low scores could be placed on action plans to try to improve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hiBQkL"&gt;The Pennsylvania employee says he didn’t hear much from his manager until July 2020, when he was told that his scores were good. So good, in fact, that he was going to start taking tier two calls. If a lower-level adviser couldn’t answer a customer’s questions, they could escalate the call to him. He asked if the job came with a pay bump and was told it did not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZkD2aX"&gt;Apple tried to make up for the increased workload for hourly employees by sending employees in the work from home program a shirt as a gift for all their hard work. When it arrived, employees realized it had a large 14 on the back (for iOS 14) and 2020 printed on the sleeve. These were leftovers from WWDC 2020 — Apple’s live event that had been canceled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AGWyPI"&gt;The shirt felt like a slap in the face. Employees wanted a raise. Some had multiple roommates and worked two or three jobs to try to make ends meet. On top of that, they were dealing with the same existential angst as the rest of the population weathering a global pandemic — all while being yelled at on the phone by customers who barely treated them like people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tV4WZc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It starts to get into a game of fixing the numbers more than helping the customers.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wzI63A"&gt;The Pennsylvania employee said his mental health started to suffer. He was working in a poorly lit room, unable to leave the house because of the lockdown. When he tried to talk to his manager about how he was feeling, he was told to try opening a window or put a plant on his desk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xJI1Zm"&gt;One day, the employee was doing a screen share with a customer who was having issues with her display. The device wasn’t under warranty — he told her it would likely cost $500 to fix. The woman started to cry. “I’m a college student, can’t you make an exception?” she asked. He said he was sorry, but it wasn’t up to him. Then the woman opened Photo Booth on her computer screen — activating the webcam — and held a razor to her wrist. “This is what the stress you’re giving me is doing to me,” he says she told him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v97QKf"&gt;When the employee explained to his boss what had happened, the man asked if he needed half an hour to decompress. The employee responded that it didn’t feel like enough time. According to his recollection, his boss conceded: “Okay, take a breather, but try to keep it to 30 minutes because we need to keep our call time down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zpWZIg"&gt;In early 2021, Apple Stores started to reopen, and the employee asked to go back to in-person work. “I have asthma, my wife has a chronic illness, but we were forced to wager my mental health against my physical health to see if it was worth going back to the store,” he says. The decision wasn’t his anyway — he was told he needed to keep working from home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJ8MoG"&gt;It wasn’t until he asked to go on medical leave that he was finally able to go back to the store. “They let me come back to the store to keep me off leave,” he alleges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v8ABJz"&gt;In September, Apple announced that all retail and care employees who’d been with the company since March 31st would receive a $1,000 bonus. To some workers, it was a nice surprise; but after years of feeling mistreated, others believe the bonus had more sinister motivations. “I think it feels more like they don’t want to get sued for not offering hazard pay after making some of us work in public in the last year,” the Pennsylvania employee says.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="0xeMLe"&gt;The mental health strain that retail employees felt working from home during the pandemic gave them a glimpse into the lives of another organization at the tech giant: AppleCare. These employees are part of the company’s tech support team that answers customer questions in online chats and over the phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Bv6pE"&gt;One employee, a gay man living in the South, said that when he landed a job at Apple after high school, he knew he’d stay with the company for years. “This big company that everyone talks about, I had a chance to be a part of,” he says. “I always describe it as my longest relationship.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VsK8Gu"&gt;At first, the idea of working from home for a tech giant seemed too good to be true. But over time, he says sitting at a computer for eight to 10 hours a day started to take a mental toll. In 2021, he decided to take medical leave to cope with the stress of responding to customers in under two minutes, a requirement for his position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VPeSAC"&gt;As his medical bills started piling up, the employee says he and his partner ran out of money. “We had to start selling our belongings to pay bills,” he explains. “We downsized and spent most of the summer without electricity or air conditioning.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BAixJV"&gt;When his paycheck arrived in May 2021, he found it was just $23, due to health insurance deductions. He couldn’t afford to pay rent. When he contacted Apple’s corporate payroll team, he said the response was, “We’ll look into it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1fcM23"&gt;&lt;section class="ad"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ad__inner"&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena-mobile"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bXxUn1"&gt;“I’ve given the best years of my life, all my 20s working for Apple, now I need help and they’re not there,” the employee says. “I don’t think the corporate people or payroll teams have any idea what it’s like to live on the edge financially,” the employee says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZ7H0H"&gt;While Apple’s corporate offices take a proactive, deliberate approach to product development, Apple’s customer support function operates in a reactive mania, using a vast array of processes and metrics to keep employees on task. If workers go to the bathroom or are away from their computers for more than five minutes, they’ll sometimes get a note from their manager asking why they aren’t working. They’re monitored based on their customer satisfaction score, as well as after call work time, which dictates how much time after a call or chat they spend writing up notes, and average handle time (AHT), which indicates how long it takes them to solve a customer issue. A good AHT is around 15 minutes for phone calls and about two minutes for chats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AKkOyY"&gt;“It starts to get into a game of fixing the numbers more than helping the customers. They look at the numbers and assume that is helping the customer,” a former employee says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fd90iL"&gt;Employees who really want to help customers say they often have to sacrifice their personal metrics. “If I have an elderly person on the phone, am I going to be a little slower with them to the detriment of my personal metrics?” a current employee asks. “Yes, I can’t treat every person the same because they’re not all the same.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fXfBC8"&gt;On chats, the ability to resolve issues can be even more difficult, as employees are expected to speak to three people simultaneously during busy parts of the year. “It’s impossible to do a good job multitasking with that many scenarios,” a current employee explains. “Especially because we have to respond in two minutes — from an Apple ID issue to an iCloud issue to an iOS [or] Mac install.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="YhB1ke"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A month has passed and I still see him in that chair whether my eyes are closed or open.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="JaUc16"&gt;About four years ago, Apple started hiring vendors to manage some of the chats and calls. For tier two advisers — people who were tasked with taking calls that couldn’t be resolved by lower-level employees — this meant a sudden onslaught of angry customers. Vendors didn’t receive the same level of training as in-house Apple employees, according to multiple employees, meaning issues were constantly being escalated. By the time a tier two adviser got the call, customers were often irate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RmFliU"&gt;In September 2019, an AppleCare employee wrote a letter to management laying out the team’s grievances. The letter said the company should “eradicate triple chats and reduce double chats” and noted “Apple should include a cost of living adjustment in addition to our raises, because it’s fair and just.” They included links to studies about how multitasking increases chronic stress. (The employee declined an interview request from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yWRzeH"&gt;Then, in February 2021, tier two chat advisers were told those jobs were being eliminated. One employee says they were told that it was because customer satisfaction ratings weren’t as high for the tier two chat team as they were for the tier two phone advisers. “It was a self-fulfilling prophecy,” the employee explains, noting that taking three chats at a time is notably different than answering one phone call after another. “We equated it to being able to do your job with one hand tied behind your back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDEbs6"&gt;Employees felt like the promise of working at Apple — the idea that you could move up in the organization and eventually land a managerial role — was slowly being taken away. In the past, hardworking employees could be selected for a “team manager assistant” role — meaning they’d fill in for managers who were on vacation. The idea was that eventually they themselves would become the manager. In practice, however, it just meant that they took on managerial responsibilities, with the illusion of possible job progression, and received no extra pay. Now, even that thin reward felt elusive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZk8lv"&gt;Employees also saw a disparity in Apple’s financial success — reflected in the wealth of its executives — and their own financial pricarity. In 2015, Tim Cook announced that he planned to give away his $800 million fortune before he died. “When I saw Tim Cook was saying he’s worth nearly a billion dollars and he plans to give all of that away before he dies, I thought, ‘Well shit, he could start with us in AppleCare,’” a current employee says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="bqNaGO"&gt;
&lt;p id="ygS6iz"&gt;A few weeks before he died, Mark Calivas sent an email to an Apple human resources representative, according to a text conversation he later had with his friend Jimmy Bailey, excerpts of which have been viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Over seven years, I too have been a victim of intimidation, public humiliation, bullying, slandering, retaliation, and on one occasion, lies,” he wrote. “I have held out a long time for change, but to date, no Store Leader or Senior Manager has been able to keep me safe from [the manager]. I want to return to work for Apple. I want to keep contributing to the company. However, for my mental health, I don’t feel like I can do so while working in the same environment as [the manager].”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qL3l8C"&gt;Bailey says Calivas had lost hope that he’d be able to transfer to a different store. After all the investigations into the manager had gone nowhere, he felt — like some other employees at the store — that corporate just didn’t care. Unlike his three former colleagues, however, he was now too depressed to interview for another job and leave Apple altogether. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lC2foe"&gt;The morning of September 7th, 2021, Bailey walked into Calivas’ room to find him slumped over a chair, his arms hanging limp in his lap. He was wearing a bright yellow hazmat hood. A tube ran from the hood to a silver tank with a green painted top. The face of the hood was clear, and covered with condensation. “A month has passed and I still see him in that chair whether my eyes are closed or open,” Bailey says. Calivas had died from inhaling nitrogen, according to the coroner’s report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RVVRv0"&gt;“I want to end this speaking directly to Tim Cook,” Bailey says in a final interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Tim, I have emailed you about this issue. I explained the damage caused at Apple Southpoint. I spoke to an employee relations representative and expressed my concern. I told him that all they need to do is look into the records on hand to see the devastation that could have been prevented. What then, Tim, do you plan on doing? I still see Mark. I see him constantly. But even though I see him, he is gone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BWiKEg"&gt;In a statement emailed to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, an Apple spokesperson said: “We were devastated by the death of our colleague and our thoughts are with his loved ones in their time of grief.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM won’t make new Bolt EVs until at least late January 2022</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R6aJV4"&gt;General Motors won’t build any new Chevy Bolt EVs until at least the end of January 2022. The automaker will instead stay focused on making replacement batteries for the 140,000-plus Bolts that were recalled earlier this year after a series of fires. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ONx3T0"&gt;The Bolt production line at GM’s Orion assembly plant in Michigan will remain shut down “through the week of Jan. 24, 2022,” the company said in a statement Thursday. “We will continue to inform employees at the appropriate time of any additional production schedule adjustments, as we continue to focus on battery module replacements.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Y2OQm"&gt;GM had already said that it wasn’t going to make any more Bolts for the rest of this year, though Thursday’s announcement put a more fine date on things. But it’s very possible the shutdown will continue beyond then given how the recall has gone to date. Either way, it leaves GM in a weird spot where it’s being praised by President Biden for “&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-24/biden-s-praise-for-gm-overlooks-tesla-s-actual-ev-leadership-kwdh01el?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;leading the world in electric vehicles&lt;/a&gt;” while not currently selling any in the US. (The Bolt is the only EV the company currently has to offer stateside, at least until new vehicles like the GMC Hummer EV, Cadillac Lyriq, and others start to ship in the next few months.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uuiMLJ"&gt;GM originally recalled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21564217/gm-chevy-bolt-recall-battery-fire-lg-chem"&gt;2017–2019 model year Chevy Bolts&lt;/a&gt; in November 2020 following a few reported fires. In May of this year, it announced a plan to put new software &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417634/chevy-bolt-recall-fire-fix-software-update"&gt;on those older Bolts&lt;/a&gt; (and the new 2022 versions that launched this year) that was supposed to help prevent fires from happening. But that software didn’t work, and so GM &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590210/chevy-bolt-new-recall-battery-defect-fire-risk-fix"&gt;issued another recall&lt;/a&gt; in July. After a newer model year Bolt caught fire in August, GM recalled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22634721/gm-recall-chevrolet-bolt-battery-fire-fix-problems"&gt;all Bolt EVs ever made&lt;/a&gt; and stopped production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1QZ5JS"&gt;Both GM and LG, its supplier, have been working to produce &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684424/gm-bolt-lg-battery-defect-fix-recall-timeline"&gt;defect-free batteries since September&lt;/a&gt;, and the automaker has been swapping those into Bolts since October. LG is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722317/chevy-bolt-recall-paid-lg-electronics-gm-costs"&gt;paying GM around $2 billion to cover the cost of the recall&lt;/a&gt;. GM made a small number of Bolts with the new batteries in early November to be used as loaners for customers affected by the recall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AxJVPV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V7M0Ni"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GWLTqc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s new Office UI is now rolling out to everyone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p-n1BJ9_e3r5--NiL7UxFDjSE4A=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70219622/office_excel_powerpoint_windows_11_0A00000001674833.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BBuDi5"&gt;Microsoft is starting to roll out its new Office UI to all users this week. The visual update was originally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554676/microsoft-office-64-bit-arm-windows-11-beta-insider-redesign"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year and went into testing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22565676/microsoft-new-office-ui-rounded-insiders-testing"&gt;over the summer&lt;/a&gt;. Now it’s &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/visual-update-in-office-for-windows-now-available/ba-p/3016080"&gt;starting to roll out&lt;/a&gt; to all Office 365 and Office 2021 users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gofWGm"&gt;This new Office UI is designed to match the visual changes in Windows 11, and it includes a more rounded look to the Office ribbon bar, with some subtle tweaks to the buttons throughout Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook. It’s a relatively simple refresh, and Office will now match the dark or light theme that you set inside Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mEYvhvj5ovK6gSNx2N2n_O9Dz0Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23058116/microsoft_office_2021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Office visual update.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="czb6n6"&gt;The new look can be toggled on or off using the Coming Soon megaphone icon in the top right-hand corner of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or OneNote. It should be available for all Windows 11 users right now, and Microsoft says 50 percent of current channel subscribers will have the visual update enabled automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jQLQnJ"&gt;Most of the design changes are subtle, but Microsoft has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332483/microsoft-office-future-ui-design-ribbon-command-bar-interface"&gt;teased more dramatic changes to its Office UI&lt;/a&gt;, which included moving toward more of a command bar instead of the traditional ribbon interface. We’re still expecting to see these appear in the web and mobile versions of Office first, and Microsoft did say last year that its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332483/microsoft-office-future-ui-design-ribbon-command-bar-interface"&gt;bigger Office UI changes&lt;/a&gt; could take a year or two to roll out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Google search features make it easier to find the right doctor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4uaWs7GEmJcGW3B24S6hkLiEOgs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70219567/acastro_191014_1777_google_pixel_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="J5Obf1"&gt;As part of efforts to expand the health information it provides, today Google announced a new feature in search that will allow doctors to list which languages they can speak at their offices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SyfKq5"&gt;People who speak languages other than English often struggle to navigate the healthcare system in the United States and are at &lt;a href="https://www.jointcommission.org/resources/news-and-multimedia/newsletters/newsletters/quick-safety/quick-safety%E2%80%94issue-13-overcoming-the-challenges-of-providing-care-to-lep-patients/overcoming-the-challenges-of-providing-care-to-lep-patients/"&gt;risk of bad medical outcomes&lt;/a&gt; because they have more trouble communicating with providers. They get better care when they have access to trained interpreters or are seen by providers who speak their native languages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iYBNnH"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/search/making-healthcare-options-more-accessible-search/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, Google also drew attention to other recently added features that address challenges patients face with the health system, including the ability to see what insurance networks are accepted by providers listed in a search. On mobile, people can also now filter by providers who accept Medicare, a capability that spokesperson Iz Conroy told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has been ramping up over the past few months.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yCuzuCcDGozRihsgE6ukozDFZCY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23056515/careNav_languageAssist_3x.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Providers can list languages in which they offer assistance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fzdRI6"&gt;The updates join a set of other features that Google has available for healthcare providers, including the ability to add links to sites where patients can make appointments, to list the health conditions an office treats, and to note if a site is wheelchair accessible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uHYi2s"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twenty percent of Xbox Cloud Gaming players only use touch controls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hiK2x0jguAKZVYYRhjhUJrr-f2w=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70219528/maxresdefault.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h3Kgqp"&gt;Over the past year, Microsoft has been steadily adding custom Xbox touch controls to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22734392/xbox-touch-controls-game-pass-games-list"&gt;more than 100 games&lt;/a&gt; that can be streamed to Android and iOS phones using its Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud) service. While these controls may seem gimmicky to some, Microsoft is now revealing that 20 percent of players use these touch controls exclusively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pJOCB8"&gt;“[Twenty] percent of our Xbox Cloud Gaming users use touch as their exclusive method of playing games,” explains Monty Hernandez, a senior program manager at Xbox. “As such, it’s important to us that the touch-enabled games we launch are relevant and, most importantly, play well with touch controls.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="35XQ5C"&gt;It’s a surprising stat and there are even individual games where 30 percent of players use touch controls exclusively:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="MumdEf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3ysG2c"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Super Lucky’s Tale&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gomBUk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yakuza: Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uj2tYi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scarlet Nexus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yHfvRX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dragon’s Quest XI&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XFJrr8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minecraft Dungeons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vt5bHI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Football Manager 2022 Xbox Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="VtgkA5"&gt;Given the amount of usage, it’s not surprising that game developers have been keen to add these custom touch controls over the past year. Microsoft has made it relatively easy to do so, allowing game developers to build on top of a &lt;a href="https://github.com/microsoft/xbox-game-streaming-tools"&gt;sample layout from GitHub&lt;/a&gt; that can be customized to each game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0uJOPd"&gt;“We’ve seen, on average, a 2x increase in usage for titles available via Xbox Cloud Gaming, across genres, that implement touch controls,” says Hernandez. A lot of Xbox Cloud Gaming titles now have some impressive touch controls, with custom styling and iconography that helps players who are purely using a touchscreen. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SrMYpKRbhcmD7e08W0T3zJqmNLo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22535665/xboxsurfaceduo_1.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xbox touch controls on a Surface Duo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ezym1w"&gt;Xbox touch controls started off with &lt;em&gt;Minecraft Dungeons &lt;/em&gt;support, before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528377/microsoft-xbox-touch-controls-xcloud-game-streaming-features"&gt;expanding to 10 more games&lt;/a&gt; a month after the initial launch of xCloud. Microsoft has also been using Xbox touch controls &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22450941/microsoft-surface-duo-xbox-mobile-xcloud-cloud-gaming-dual-screen"&gt;for its dual-screen Surface Duo handset&lt;/a&gt;, turning its Android-powered device into more of a Nintendo 3DS with Xbox games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PaTHwA"&gt;With &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22734392/xbox-touch-controls-game-pass-games-list"&gt;more than 100 games&lt;/a&gt; now supporting these custom touch controls, and players apparently keen to use them, it’s clear we’re going to see many more games implement Xbox touch controls in the months ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rocket Lab unveils details of new reusable Neutron launcher</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EdGF_tI5VfbNnrqp3zAkH0aIRz0=/446x0:5246x3200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70219332/Neutron_Launch_Vehicle.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An artistic rendering of Neutron&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Rocket Lab&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mPyIhX"&gt;This morning, small satellite launcher Rocket Lab unveiled the details of its future, more powerful Neutron rocket — a launch vehicle optimized to carry satellites into orbit for future mega-constellations. Made out of a special carbon composite that Rocket Lab created, Neutron will also be mostly reusable, designed to land on a landing pad after launch — similar to how SpaceX lands its Falcon 9 rockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5udAj6"&gt;“This is not a conventional rocket,” Peter Beck, Rocket Lab’s CEO, said during the unveil, livestreamed on YouTube. “This is what a rocket should look like in 2050. But we’re building it today.” As of now, Neutron is slated for its first flight in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vRWFlk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is not a conventional rocket.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sLOTve"&gt;Rocket Lab already has one rocket called Electron, which the company has been launching to orbit since 2017. Electron is meant to carry relatively small satellites into low Earth orbit, to capitalize on the small satellite revolution. But in March, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22306971/rocket-lab-neutron-public-spac"&gt;Rocket Lab announced its intention to build another bigger rocket called Neutron&lt;/a&gt;, along with plans to go public via a SPAC merger. It was a big change for the company, since Beck once vowed he’d “eat his hat” if he ever made a reusable rocket or a larger rocket. During the March announcement, he did, indeed, eat an actual hat from a blender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eGLWHN"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A0thW57QeDM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tJC4hG"&gt;Neutron will stand at 131 feet (or 40 meters) tall, towering much higher than Electron which is just 59 feet (18 meters) tall. Propelled by seven new main engines called Archimedes, the rocket will be capable of putting between eight and 15 tons into low Earth orbit. Rocket Lab claims the vehicle will be perfect for launching medium-sized satellites that are part of proposed mega-constellations, massive satellite initiatives aimed at providing broadband coverage to the Earth below. However, Beck envisions other opportunities for Neutron, such as human spaceflight and even interplanetary flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fWtWDk"&gt;“We wanted to make sure that we didn’t go to all this trouble to make a launch vehicle that wouldn’t be able to be human certified and capable of human spaceflight,” Beck tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gUwVhu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“we didn’t go to all this trouble to make a launch vehicle that wouldn’t be able to be human certified.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="swTvbB"&gt;Perhaps the most notable thing about the Neutron design is that it will be reusable, meaning practically every single part of the rocket will be returned to Earth after launch. It also bucks modern convention of how most orbital rockets work nowadays. Typically, rockets are launched in “stages” or parts that are stacked on top of each other. During launch, as a rocket rapidly gobbles up its propellant, the first stage of the rocket — or most of the rocket’s body — will eventually break away and fall back to Earth. Depleted of fuel, the stage becomes needless weight. As the rocket body falls away, the upper portion of the rocket — or the second stage — will ignite its engine (or engines) and propel the payload farther into space and deploy it into orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GAc3IV"&gt;Neutron will be a little different. Rather than stack the stages on top of each other, Rocket Lab plans to put the second stage &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; of the first one. The second stage, propelled by one Archimedes engine, will be attached to the payload and stay housed inside of the full body of the rocket, completely protected during launch. Once in space, the top of the rocket will open up, releasing the second stage / payload combo. The two then continue their journey into orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vR9wG2CBsB97Sq8FQAaZ36Wbt4U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23057857/Neutron_Hungry_Hippo_Fairing.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Rocket Lab&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An animation of Neutron’s “Hungry Hippo” fairing design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dbecEv"&gt;And that’s where things get weird. For most typical rockets these days, the main payload or satellite being launched is encased inside of a nosecone, or fairing, during flight. The bulbous structure on top of the rocket protects the payload during the climb through Earth’s atmosphere. Once in space, the fairing then breaks apart and falls back to Earth, where it’s usually lost. That won’t be the case with Neutron. Instead, the fairing will &lt;em&gt;hinge&lt;/em&gt; open, allowing the payload to deploy into space while keeping the fairing attached to the rocket. That way, the fairings never leave the rocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zva0Cv"&gt;“The answer is not throwing away the fairings or even trying to catch them,” Beck said during the video. “The best way is never get rid of them in the first place.” Rocket Lab refers to the fairings as the “Hungry Hippo” fairing design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y0g8Vl"&gt;Once the second stage and payload are on their way, the main body of Neutron — with fairings in tow — will return to Earth and land upright on a landing pad. An animation of the process is very reminiscent of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket landing on a launch pad after takeoff. Beck says the entire process is meant to minimize operations costs. “Operations far dwarf the actual cost of putting something on orbit, than actually the building material or the components of the rocket,” Beck tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qjhiD3a2eASrg0QMucGj7rDfNjg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23057864/Screen_Shot_2021_12_02_at_8.31.07_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Rocket Lab&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beck with the battering ram and stainless steel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eb4fIa"&gt;During the presentation, there were plenty of subtle digs at SpaceX. For one, Rocket Lab does not plan to land Neutron on ships in the ocean, like SpaceX does. Plus, the fairing design seems to be in direct response to SpaceX, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/22/17039860/spacex-falcon-9-payload-fairing-mr-steven-net-catch"&gt;which tried for years to catch the fairings of its rocket&lt;/a&gt; using big nets attached to boats. While the company was successful in catching the fairings a handful of times, ultimately SpaceX abandoned the initiative due to poor reliability. Instead, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1379744947453054981?s=20"&gt;SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said in April&lt;/a&gt; that SpaceX would retrieve the fairings out of the water and refurbish them for reuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gMrH5n"&gt;Another nod to SpaceX came when Beck discussed the material from which Neutron would be made. Beck knocked stainless steel, the main material SpaceX is using to build its new Starship rocket. To further his point, he used a battering ram to hit a sheet of stainless steel, showing how it bends. Instead, Neutron will be made out of a special carbon composite material created by Rocket Lab, which the company insinuated is sturdier. (The battering ram, of course, didn’t bend that one.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N3Q6go"&gt;Ultimately Beck says he wasn’t singling out any company in particular. “Certainly there was no intention to make any references to SpaceX,” he tells The Verge. “It just so happens that, what, SpaceX uses stainless steel, but by the way, so does ULA.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cs8Pzy"&gt;However, one thing that Rocket Lab can’t quite claim is that Neutron is &lt;em&gt;fully&lt;/em&gt; reusable. Just like with the Falcon 9 rocket, the second stage will not return to Earth once its puts the payload into orbit. Beck says the company didn’t see any clear benefit in making the second stage reusable versus manufacturing one at a ”really, really low cost.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BL0JXW"&gt;But if it works, it will be a unique type of vehicle that’s not on the market yet. Rocket Lab says it’s already working on prototypes and that the Archimedes engine will do its first test ignition sometime next year. Until then, Neutron may look cool, but it’s still just an animation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ZtLYz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 2nd, 12PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story was updated to include an interview with Peter Beck.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why the metaverse is more than Mark Zuckerberg’s dream</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="A stylized image of Mark Zuckerberg staring at a Meta logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1jTXoRSXHzP1CbuLTvNvTpBCOy0=/300x0:1920x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70219269/VRG_VRP_Metaverse_Thumbnail_textless.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AjC5Ci"&gt;The company formerly known as Facebook has bet big on the metaverse. CEO Mark Zuckerberg hyped the already popular term in October, when he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22749919/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-meta-company-rebrand"&gt;changed the company’s name to Meta&lt;/a&gt; and led viewers through its dizzying vision of the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8q2j5g"&gt;But “the metaverse” is a much bigger — and more confusing — idea. From its origins in science fiction, it’s become a catchall for anything that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701104/metaverse-explained-fortnite-roblox-facebook-horizon"&gt;mixes people’s physical and virtual lives&lt;/a&gt;. That includes virtual and augmented reality headsets; 3D virtual worlds like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;; and decentralized Web3 services including cryptocurrency and non-fungible tokens or NFTs. Lots of “metaverse” proponents don’t agree on a single definition for the word &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; on how much people are already living in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ex778f"&gt;While Meta is making big investments, other companies have already built metaverse-style platforms — some, like &lt;em&gt;Second Life&lt;/em&gt; developer Linden Lab, years before Facebook even existed. Here, we delve into the ambiguities of 2021’s most omnipresent tech buzzword and why it might not look like &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of these companies have predicted.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The quest to make an AI that can play competitive Pokémon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k7jo5dj4YmRkbiV1tE-VJg0oibE=/106x0:5749x3762/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70219243/Switch_PokemonSwordPokemonShield_artwork_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;AI wanna be the very best, like no one ever was&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="7OSqWX"&gt;An AI can beat a chess grandmaster. An AI can become the &lt;em&gt;StarCraft&lt;/em&gt; esports champion. But creating an AI that could play &lt;em&gt;Pokémon &lt;/em&gt;at the competitive level has been a more elusive problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cggh9D"&gt;Thanks to the variety of monsters, stats, moves, and items, a &lt;em&gt;Pokémon &lt;/em&gt;battle has hundreds of thousands of factors for any player — or machine — to consider. But that hasn’t stopped some people from trying. Most recently, Future Sight AI, created by computer scientist Albert III, successfully made it into the top 5 percent of the competitive ladder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OV9DTg"&gt;Albert posted &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhvj7CmTRkg&amp;amp;ab_channel=TheThirdBuild"&gt;a video&lt;/a&gt; explaining how it all works, but to summarize, the bot takes in all the information it can about the current state of the game, extrapolates the possibilities for all the turns it could take, looks a couple of turns ahead to how these would play out, and then chooses the option that can lead to the highest number of best outcomes. By doing all of that within 15 seconds, turn after turn, it can beat all but the very best human players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Ly0bE"&gt;That’s pretty impressive, especially when you consider that Albert had almost no experience with artificial intelligence or other major aspects of the program before he started working on it. “I took classes in college about machine learning, [but] the real question is: was I paying attention?” he laughs. “The main software that it runs on is called Node.js. I hadn’t touched that at all before I started this project.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="hXTj3C"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rhvj7CmTRkg?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BCAhYS"&gt;“Even though computer science is my day job, it’s something that I love so much that I can’t help but do it in my free time, too,” he says. That passion, combined with pandemic boredom, propelled him to look into an idea that was first inspired by his interest in basketball. “[Some websites] would do this thing where you’d be able to watch a game and see the team’s current chance of winning, and I thought about doing that for &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt;,” he says. “Then just kind of one thing led to another and then I ended up with an AI on my hands.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="46WHZu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“One thing led to another and then I ended up with an AI on my hands.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vYV6oQ"&gt;One thing leading to another is a pretty good summary of Albert’s work on Future Sight AI. He says he wanted to learn new skills and simply broke them down into small enough tasks until he was able to create his vision. “This is such a bad reference but there’s that song in &lt;em&gt;Frozen 2&lt;/em&gt;, called ‘&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6g1yQV0dIY"&gt;The Next Right [Thing]&lt;/a&gt;.’ It’s just that. Just keep doing that until you get somewhere,” he says. Nowadays, for example, he knows Node.js so well that he can use it in projects at his day job, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zh58uX"&gt;His step-by-step approach means that he actually wasn’t aware of previous attempts to make similar AIs. Earlier projects are not as well documented as Albert’s, though there have been a few varying success levels that gained some attention within the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K7p4l0"&gt;An early example was &lt;a href="http://doublewise.net/pokemon/"&gt;Technical Machine&lt;/a&gt;, first created in 2010. Though it was updated through 2019, Technical Machine only ever fully supported &lt;em&gt;Pokémon &lt;/em&gt;up to Generation 4 and did not create its own teams, one of the key features of Future Sight. Additionally, at the time of its release, the competitive ladder base was not established in the same way, so it’s difficult to tell how successful Technical Machine was overall. One Reddit comment, however, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stunfisk/comments/e8kwqj/want_to_create_a_showdown_ai_some_basic_questions/"&gt;stated that&lt;/a&gt; “Technical Machine at its smartest was still leagues worse than a normal player.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CnglzQ"&gt;Another example &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stunfisk/comments/3i4hww/pokemon_showdown_ai/"&gt;was posted on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; in 2015 by a user who went by onmabd. Comments indicated that it was “one of the stronger bots to date.” The competitive ladder gives players a ranking of 1,000 to begin with, which then goes up or down depending on wins and losses. There’s no public way to view the data, and it changes over time, so it’s tricky to evaluate what a “good” rank is. However, during his creation process, Albert found that the average player’s ranking settles at around 1,170. Onmabd’s AI managed to reach 1,300, which would put it in the top 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Pokemon European International Championships" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JjVC2vFHtphSDFBcn18648xMoyU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23055386/875279370.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RneLoK"&gt;More recently, a user on &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; community forum Smogon going by pmariglia shared &lt;a href="https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/yet-another-pokemon-showdown-battle-bot.3648979/"&gt;another attempt&lt;/a&gt;. Their AI beat Technical Machine in a best of three and was able to reach a rating of between 1,250 and 1,350 — again, around the top 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rq5ii5"&gt;Future Sight AI ranked at 1,550 on average during testing. Though Albert &lt;a href="https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/future-sight-ai.3668916/"&gt;apologized&lt;/a&gt; on Smogon “for making it seem in my video that [Future Sight] is the first bot of its kind or the first to get as far as it did,” (as well as detailing where the two projects take different approaches) he says that ultimately he’s glad he didn’t know that other people had already attempted his project. “I don’t know why I never thought to look into it [but] if I’d gone down their path I might have ended up with the same results,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZtossU"&gt;He also was never expecting the video to gain as much attention as it did. For starters, when I ask about its creation, he laughs. “I have to reveal something,” he says. “That entire video was animated in Powerpoint. I have to say I don’t have much video production experience [so] I had an idea for what I wanted the video to look like and I just kind of kept working on it until I could get the tools that I knew how to use to do it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TkxWVu"&gt;Then, there was the delayed reaction. Posted in July, it was only viewed about 100 times in its first three weeks. The next week, it jumped up to 300,000. (As of late November, it’s almost at 600,000 views.) Albert thinks that it was picked up by somebody in the &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; community who posted it to Twitter, causing it to blow up, but he never found out who.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="FfsUg4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The whole point of what I’m doing is that I want to teach people about computer science.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BHzoFL"&gt;He says that it was difficult to process the sudden influx of viewers, but that he was appreciative of how supportive the &lt;em&gt;Pokémon &lt;/em&gt;community was. “I kind of just had to take a step back a bit because the whole point of what I’m doing is that I want to teach people about computer science,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lK1Zgi"&gt;In particular, as a Black man, Albert wants to be the kind of representation he never had in the field. “I figured I have experience in public speaking, I like doing projects that people might find interesting, so really I wanted to put out a channel that said, ‘This can be an example of someone like you doing fun things in computer science.’ That’s genuinely the core of why I’m doing all of this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pGqFwM"&gt;For now, his focus is on getting Future Sight playable in actual &lt;em&gt;Pokémon &lt;/em&gt;games. Thus far, it has used Pokémon Showdown, a community-created simulator that allows online battling and functionally forms the center of the competitive scene. But early on Albert was hinting that he wanted to make something that could tie in with the releases of &lt;em&gt;Brilliant Diamond&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Shining Pearl. &lt;/em&gt;Most recently, he’s managed to get it to beat the final boss of &lt;em&gt;Sword and Shield&lt;/em&gt;, despite not having any code to deal with Dynamaxing, which is banned in common competitive settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="ZacrK0"&gt;Beyond that, he doesn’t have too many concrete goals. “I mean this is such a corny thing, but I want it to be the very best like no one ever was,” he says, echoing the old &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; anime theme tune. “But seriously, I don’t know. I just started this for fun and I want to take it as far as I still find joy out of making it.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Govee’s immersive backlights are an affordable way to make your TV glow</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tQxpNE60vXxCMSU3ZwiyHIjNPIA=/0x171:4096x2902/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70219052/color_segmented_color.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both Govee’s newest and last-gen Immersion TV LED backlights are on sale today.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Thomas Ricker / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HEATvR"&gt;If you’re looking to step up your TV game and make watching movies and gaming more immersive, Govee offers a range of colorful lighting kits that also make for great holiday gifts. One of its most appealing products are the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22566408/govee-immersion-ambilight-tv-backlight-review"&gt;Immersion TV LED backlights&lt;/a&gt;, which sync to whatever you’re watching on your 55-inch or 65-inch screen, making it appear as if the TV colors are bleeding out of the frame and onto your walls. Responsive LED strips like these are typically expensive, but right now Govee’s 2020 backlighting kit costs just $61 once you clip the $10 off coupon at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Immersion-Backlights-Ambient-Assistant/dp/B08LVPWQQP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. That’s the kit’s best price to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SVGNj7"&gt;Prefer not to shop at Amazon? Govee is selling this product direct &lt;a href="https://us.govee.com/products/immersion-tv-backlights"&gt;for $63&lt;/a&gt;. There’s a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22725979/govee-tv-backlight-bars-review-specs-price"&gt;newer version&lt;/a&gt; of these lights, which farther extends the backlighting with Light Bars. Typically $150, you can &lt;a href="https://us.govee.com/products/govee-immersion-kit-wi-fi-tv-backlight-light-bars"&gt;buy this one for $130&lt;/a&gt; from Govee or for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Immersion-Backlights-Ambient-Assistant/dp/B09B7PY111?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$140 from Amazon&lt;/a&gt; when you clip the on-page coupon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Inb6v"&gt;If you intend to gift these to multiple people, Govee is additionally taking 5 percent off your purchase total when you buy two, 10 percent if you buy three, and 15 percent off if you buy five of them.

We found that both the 2020 model and this year’s version offer great value for the money, even before the discounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="megSUZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10681491"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="XieHFJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10896909"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VeCscB"&gt;If you missed out on a smart display deal during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, you’re in luck: Walmart is now &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSmart-Clock-Gen-2-Grey-Color-Smart-Bulb%2F507060083&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDealRoundup1222021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offering a 60 percent off&lt;/a&gt; deal on the Lenovo Smart Clock 2 with a bundled Lenovo Smart Bulb, bringing the final sale price down to $25. The Lenovo Smart Clock 2 incorporates a touchscreen display into a form factor that would be right at home on your bedside table. It’s one of the smallest smart displays you can buy, yet it still offers full Google Assistant capabilities and comes with a handy night light feature. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22714538/lenovo-smart-clock-2-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PzrRNa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10869431"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ybzbpN"&gt;The latest AirPods sold out relatively quickly after receiving some of their first significant discounts during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Thankfully, however, Amazon still is selling the third-generation AirPods for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQL3NWT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$150&lt;/a&gt; at checkout — the lowest we saw them drop to during the recent shopping holiday. That’s a $30 discount on the latest AirPods model, which sport shorter stems, IPX4 water resistance, and improved sound over their last-gen counterpart. However, they lack active noise cancellation, which is found in the AirPods Pro. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ji1ZJE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10887582"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="leY0cM"&gt;If you don’t mind buying refurbished, Sonos is discounting several products right now. For those interested in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/27/17507796/sonos-beam-speaker-soundbar-alexa-review"&gt;Sonos Beam&lt;/a&gt;, the first generation is selling for &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-11556673?sid=VergeRoundup12221&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fbeam-b-stock" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$319&lt;/a&gt; as opposed to $399, the full retail cost when purchased new. Although the soundbar lacks support for Dolby Atmos like the second-gen model, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701137/sonos-beam-gen-2-atmos-soundbar-review-specs"&gt;we found&lt;/a&gt; it’s still a competent smart speaker that shares many features in common with the newer version. Sonos is also discounting the third-gen Sonos Sub, selling it for &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-11556673?sid=VergeRoundUp212121&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fsub-g3-b-stock" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$599&lt;/a&gt; refurbished. That is $150 less than if you were to purchase the wireless subwoofer new. The second-gen model, typically $699, is also selling for &lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836598-11556673?sid=VergeRoundUp12121&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fsub-g2-b-stock" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$549&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cKhOhp"&gt;All of the products in this sale will arrive in a box with all original accessories and cables, and they’ve been certified directly from Sonos. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21530290/refurbished-tech-products-gadgets-where-to-buy-amazon-ebay"&gt;That means&lt;/a&gt; the company has tested and given each an internal and external cleaning and inspection. They also come with a one-year warranty and a 45-day money-back guarantee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="pyu4uR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sonos raises prices for majority of products amid supply chain crunch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667044/sonos-speaker-price-increases-announce-september-12"},{"title":"Sonos could soon announce a smaller, more affordable Sub Mini subwoofer","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22808243/sonos-sub-mini-leaked-features-design"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="TLuKxY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603369"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Nvidia GeForce Now ‘RTX 3080’ membership tier arrives in Europe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WONgmmhwy9Z4uocDO3OAB2U5Ew8=/0x0:1740x1160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70218979/geforce_now.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A selection of the devices GeForce Now streams to.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nvidia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2Vosai"&gt;Nvidia’s GeForce Now game streaming service is getting an RTX 3080-themed upgrade in Europe. Nvidia announced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738006/nvidia-rtx-3080-geforce-now-features-price-release-date-streaming-option"&gt;new membership tier in October&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s already available in the US. But, as of today, gamers in Europe can start streaming from the company’s new higher-performance servers, which offer improved resolutions, frame rates, and less latency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZhDzi"&gt;The RTX 3080 membership tier offers up to 1440p / 120fps gameplay through PC and Mac, or up to 4K HDR / 60fps when streamed to an Nvidia Shield TV. That’s up from 1080p at 60fps with the current Priority tier. Session lengths can also extend up to eight hours long rather than six, and Nvidia also says the tier offers lower latency. The big tradeoff is price, with the new tier costing £89.89 / $99.99 for a six-month subscription in the UK, up from £44.99 / $49.99 for six months of the Priority tier. But in our testing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750246/nvidia-geforce-now-rtx-3080-google-stadia-cloud-gaming"&gt;results are impressive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SnUqpu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Costing £89.89 for a six-month membership&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AVFit8"&gt;I should note that despite its name, the RTX 3080 membership tier doesn’t stream from servers literally equipped with retail RTX 3080 cards. Instead, it’s an Ampere GA102 chip on a server with an eight-core AMD Threadripper CPU, 28GB of DDR4 memory, and a Gen4 SSD. It’s a hardware combination that Nvidia says offers 35 teraflops of GPU performance, around three times what an Xbox Series X is capable of and actually more in line with the performance of an RTX 3090.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UZCWmx"&gt;Nvidia is starting the new tier’s rollout for people who’ve preordered the membership tier in Europe and says that “rollouts for accounts will continue until all requests have been fulfilled.” It’s accepting new orders “pending availability.” As well as the expansion of the membership tier to Europe, Nvidia is also announcing the 20 games that are coming to its service this month, which include indie darling &lt;em&gt;Untitled Goose Game&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ekDRuw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
