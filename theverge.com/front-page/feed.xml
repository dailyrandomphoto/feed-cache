    <title>FTC says Broadcom violated antitrust law with TV set-top box deals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Broadcom Expected To Beat Quarterly Earnings Expectations" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AenBV5qFLmmJuNSZBuw0ToH1pVE=/116x0:5213x3398/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69535145/1321540122.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mPsPIt"&gt;The US Federal Trade Commission has sued chip maker Broadcom for allegedly abusing a monopoly on semiconductor components. &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/1810205broadcomcomplaint.pdf"&gt;A newly issued complaint&lt;/a&gt; accuses Broadcom of threatening to charge higher prices, refuse technical support, or cut off chip sales if its customers bought other products from competing companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PWSiKw"&gt;Starting in 2016, Broadcom allegedly struck “exclusive or near-exclusive” deals with at least 10 companies manufacturing video set-top boxes and broadband devices like modems. It allegedly required these “strategic” partners to use a variety of Broadcom components even if they weren’t the best or cheapest option for a given device. Nonexclusive “tactical” partners were charged higher prices for slower product delivery and customer support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3AUWfl"&gt;When manufacturers bid to have cable and internet providers like AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon buy their products, the complaint says Broadcom “actively monitored” whether any of those products included components from Broadcom competitors. “Broadcom communicated to customers that disloyalty as to even a single bid involving a single relevant product could mean loss of strategic partner terms,” the FTC claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gAEGlw"&gt;In one case, Broadcom allegedly retaliated against a company that hadn’t yet agreed to exclusivity, cutting off “all supply and support” when it submitted a bid that included a non-Broadcom component. The company allegedly withdrew the bid and signed the exclusivity deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ciBAfN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are pleased to move toward resolving this broadband matter with the FTC”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8IsCMD"&gt;The FTC wants Broadcom to &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/7._acco_-_broadcom_-_executed.pdf"&gt;sign a consent order&lt;/a&gt; agreeing to back off its restrictive exclusivity agreements. In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Broadcom indicated it was willing to cooperate. “We are pleased to move toward resolving this broadband matter with the FTC on terms that are substantially similar to our previous settlement with the EC involving the same products,” said a spokesperson, referring to &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/european-antitrust-regulators-settle-with-broadcom-a-year-after-interim-measures-flex/"&gt;a 2020 agreement&lt;/a&gt; with the European Commission. The EC agreement included a commitment to suspend all exclusive or quasi-exclusive deals and refrain from signing new deals with similar terms for seven years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W4Gn3r"&gt;The spokesperson said Broadcom was “equally pleased” that the FTC had not proceeded with an investigation into other parts of its business; the agency had reportedly been looking at &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-20/broadcom-chip-business-targeted-in-widening-u-s-antitrust-probe"&gt;potential anti-competitive practices&lt;/a&gt; in areas like Wi-Fi chip sales. “While we disagree that our actions violated the law and disagree with the FTC’s characterizations of our business, we look forward to putting this matter behind us and continuing to focus on supporting our customers through an environment of accelerated digital transformation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WfL1rr"&gt;In its suit, the FTC claims Broadcom wanted to lock out potential competitors at a turning point for the set-top box industry. The complaint says Broadcom had particular dominance in the market for traditional broadcast TV set-top box components and faced more potential competition for streaming box components, a category that’s grown rapidly thanks to TV cord-cutting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oJSV7A"&gt;Broadcom allegedly recognized that “as many consumers cut the cord, there are many other consumers who will continue using broadcast [set-top boxes] for some time to come,” and companies will need support for those boxes for years. “Broadcom recognized these threats and opportunities,” the complaint says, and it used its power to make sure potential rivals’ sales opportunities were “severely restricted.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus is merging OxygenOS with Oppo’s ColorOS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aPHIxc6qbeKB7raEULtvG27U7zw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69535023/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0063_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sxGtmt"&gt;Following last month’s announcement &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538105/oneplus-oppo-merge-integration-ownership-bbk"&gt;that OnePlus was integrating with Oppo&lt;/a&gt;, effectively becoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22543184/oppo-oneplus-merger-brand-pete-lau-bbk-memo"&gt;a sub-brand of the phone manufacturer&lt;/a&gt;, the company &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/update-to-the-oxygenos-codebase-and-software-maintenance-schedule.1462181/"&gt;announced on Friday&lt;/a&gt; that it’s also merging OxygenOS with Oppo’s ColorOS operating system (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/07/02/oneplus-android-update-schedule-years-oxygenos-coloros/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OuNLqJ"&gt;Both companies’ software will remain separate and continue to serve their individual regions (OxygenOS for OnePlus phones globally, ColorOS on OnePlus and Oppo devices in China) but share a common codebase, which OnePlus says should standardize its software experience and streamline the development process for future OxygenOS updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="14iqGm"&gt;OnePlus says the change will also allow the company to guarantee better Android update  support going forward, something Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355777/samsung-android-os-update-promise-galaxy-phones-3-generations"&gt;has also tried to improve on&lt;/a&gt; in the last few years. OnePlus lays out the life span for updates as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="exG21w"&gt;Flagship phones including the T and R models get three major Android updates and four years of security updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dpAw7u"&gt;Nord and Nord CE phones get two major Android updates and three years of security updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FOtNuJ"&gt;Nord N phones will get one major Android update and three years of security updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="jIYDoF"&gt;OnePlus does limit those update commitments to the OnePlus 8 and up, so older OnePlus devices will be out of luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CsAxF6"&gt;As the next step in whatever is going on with OnePlus, Oppo, and the wider BBK Electronics umbrella, merging the companies’ software on the backend seems like a net positive for OnePlus users. How independent OnePlus is now that it’s “integrated” seems about as unclear as when it was independent, owned by BBK, and seemingly sharing some parts with Oppo, but as long as phones are supported, it hopefully shouldn’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Internal Apple survey shows concern about hybrid work model</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VJ1sL_BooPYAjFRe2TFOW0P1_DQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69534632/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GdAIoV"&gt;An internal survey designed by Apple employees shows respondents want the option to work from home and fear their colleagues may have to leave if the company forces people back to the office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uEnm38"&gt;In the survey, which was sent out in early June, nearly 90 percent of respondents said they “strongly agree” with the statement “location-flexible working options are a very important issue to me.” A total of 1,749 people answered the question. Employees defined “location-flexible” as the option to work from home indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LKJjwy"&gt;The news comes on the heels of Tim Cook’s announcement that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;Apple will be rolling out a new hybrid work model&lt;/a&gt; that will require employees to return to the office three days a week starting in early September. While the move is a big shift for Apple, which discouraged remote work prior to the pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22491629/apple-employees-push-back-return-office-internal-letter-tim-cook"&gt;it’s still too strict for some workers&lt;/a&gt;. They say that without the option to work from home whenever they want, some will be forced to resign. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="obip8K"&gt;The survey is not scientific — it was sent out in a Slack channel for employees to discuss remote work, and only a tiny fraction of Apple’s 147,000-person workforce likely even knew it existed. But the fact that well over a thousand employees participated in a grassroots survey that wasn’t sanctioned by Apple executives is significant. It hints at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453302/apple-culture-secrecy-leak-antonio-garcia-martinez-letter"&gt;a shift in Apple’s famously hierarchical culture&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PvY73t"&gt;In response to the statement “I am worried that some of my colleagues will have to leave Apple due to LACK of location-flexible work options,” 58.5 percent said they “strongly agree.” A total of 1,743 people answered the question. A smaller portion — 36.7 percent — said they are worried &lt;em&gt;they’ll&lt;/em&gt; have to resign due to the lack of flexibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CSIdpP"&gt;Employees sent the survey results to Cook and Deirdre O’Brien, senior vice president of retail and people, on June 14th. They included a video with personal testimonies from 24 Apple workers on why remote working options are important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nts8Qm"&gt;Two weeks later, Apple sent out a video &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22556615/apple-response-hybrid-work-model-employee-letter-remote"&gt;doubling down on the hybrid model&lt;/a&gt;, saying “we believe that in-person collaboration is essential to our culture and our future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G19vHQ"&gt;The video irked some employees, who felt executives hadn’t listened to their perspective. Even employees who don’t want to work from home forever say the company needs to consider more flexibility while &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/30/world/asia/virus-delta-variant-global.html"&gt;the Delta variant continues to surge&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4E0oqS"&gt;While Apple is encouraging employees to get vaccinated, it’s not requiring everyone to wear masks in the office, saying instead that “choosing to wear a mask in places where protocols have been lifted is a personal decision.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lsKatx"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Porsche recalls Taycans over sudden power loss problem</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-7KRz93wk3qaY_KPFgvq2nV20eQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69534559/porsche_taycan_0853.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U6RtiZ"&gt;Porsche is &lt;a href="https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/2021/products/porsche-taycan-recall-24987.html"&gt;recalling its first EV&lt;/a&gt;, the Taycan, to fix an issue where some cars suddenly lose power while in motion. The automaker has already sold around 43,000 Taycans globally to date, though it claims (without further clarification) that only a small number are affected. Owners will have to bring their electric Porsches to a dealer for the software fix, which the company says will take between 60 and 90 minutes. The fix is being applied to new Taycans coming off the production line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="knGpdz"&gt;The same issue is also affecting the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274376/audi-etron-gt-rs-electric-car-specs-price"&gt;new Audi E-Tron GT&lt;/a&gt;, as it is built on the Taycan’s electric powertrain. That recall involves far fewer vehicles, though, as Audi only just started shipping the electric sports car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DXwxFn"&gt;At least a dozen Taycan owners &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2021/PORSCHE/TAYCAN%252520TURBO%252520S/4%252520DR/AWD#complaints"&gt;have filed complaints to date&lt;/a&gt; with the NHTSA about the power loss problem, enough that the safety agency recently opened a probe into the issue. The agency discovered that the power loss is being caused when the 12-volt battery — that classic rectangular battery which powers accessories when a car isn’t running — runs out of charge. If the 12-volt battery dies while a Taycan is in motion, it can shut off the much larger 800-volt battery pack that powers the vehicle’s electric motors and other critical systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4AcR33"&gt;In a May &lt;a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2021/INOA-PE21013-3828.PDF"&gt;filing&lt;/a&gt;, NHTSA says that all of the customer complaints so far claim that this power loss happened “without warning [or] error messages.” Six owners say they weren’t able to restart their vehicle after the loss of power. There are no known injuries at this time. Forum posts &lt;a href="https://rennlist.com/forums/taycan/1190625-ev-s-and-12-volt-battery-pitfalls-taycan-edition.html"&gt;from early 2020 show&lt;/a&gt; that this has been an issue for a while, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ke9dM8"&gt;“Our first priority is the safety of our customers,” Porsche said in a statement. “With this in mind, Porsche notified the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that it will recall certain MY20 and MY21 Porsche Taycan vehicles to update the power electronics and engine control unit software. After recent review, Porsche determined that a software issue can, in certain instances, incorrectly and sporadically detect a potentially faulty communication and trigger a possible loss of motive power. A software update will help prevent this issue from occurring.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hRdqDh"&gt;Modern cars are full of all sorts of futuristic tech. But 12-volt batteries are still used to power low-level electronics, even in electric cars. And they can still cause problems like the one Porsche owners have been dealing with, despite there being a much larger battery pack on board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7dkwzS"&gt;Just a few months ago, as &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; first reported, some owners of Ford’s new Mustang Mach-E electric SUV &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373903/mustang-mach-e-deep-sleep-12v-battery-jump-start"&gt;started reporting that they weren’t able to start their vehicles&lt;/a&gt;. The problem had to do with software that was stopping the 12-volt battery from recharging by sipping power from the bigger battery pack. When the 12-volt battery ultimately died, it basically made it impossible to start the electric Mustangs back up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DVHSus"&gt;Porsche and Ford are not alone. Volvo has had issues with the 12-volt batteries in some of its electrified cars. So has General Motors with the &lt;a href="https://www.chevybolt.org/threads/12-volt-battery-issue.35408/"&gt;one in the Chevy Bolt&lt;/a&gt;. Even &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/09/15/tesla-fix-dying-12v-batteries-software-update-musk"&gt;Tesla has had trouble with this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ktsktT"&gt;Most of these companies still used lead acid 12-volt batteries. While they have come a long way in some sense — newer “absorbed glass mat” versions that can last longer, for example — this type of battery still has limitations. Porsche uses a lithium iron phosphate 12-volt battery &lt;a href="https://www.taycanforum.com/forum/attachments/2020-porsche-taycan-drivers-owners-manual-pdf.3634/?hash=f1054d844b404c69dc097ac2448c927a"&gt;according to the owner’s manual&lt;/a&gt;, which is supposed to be safer and lighter than lead acid while also offering extended life, though clearly the company hasn’t worked out all the software kinks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lWPkxO"&gt;Tesla recently &lt;a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-s-plaid-12v-lithium-ion-battery/"&gt;switched to a lithium-ion 12-volt battery&lt;/a&gt; in the new Model S Plaid, though CEO Elon Musk has &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/in-epically-nerdy-interview-elon-musk-discusses-build-1846181756"&gt;also talked about the potential benefits of using a 48-volt system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s latest diversity report shows jump in departures among women of color</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C_PY3kOyGlD9qbPOgXwy3KUcuYc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69534379/acastro_210104_1777_google_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GxE7i9"&gt;Google’s latest diversity report shows that despite some gains in the number of Black employees, the company is lagging in its goal to double the number of Black workers by 2025. And the search giant is having particular difficulty retaining women of color, the &lt;a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/diversity.google/en//annual-report/static/pdfs/google_2021_diversity_annual_report.pdf"&gt;report released Thursday&lt;/a&gt; (pdf) shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1AB9tx"&gt;Google uses a scale it calls an attrition index, with the number 100 used as a benchmark. The attrition figure for Black women on that index rose from 110 in 2020 to 146 in 2021, the report shows. Among Native American women the attrition index was up to 148 in 2021, compared to 123 in 2020. The 2021 attrition figures also were higher for Asian men and women and for Latinx men, the report showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KeNICs"&gt;“We recognize the platform that we have and the brand position that we have and we know that there are other companies that are watching us and looking at us,” Google chief diversity officer Melonie Parker &lt;a href="https://diversity.google/annual-report/"&gt;said in a video&lt;/a&gt; that accompanied the report. “And we want to make sure that we don’t just show our successes, but that we show the areas that we need to get better as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wrkqRr"&gt;The company made some progress in its representation and diversity goals, doubling the number of Black employees hired to its US leadership team to 7.1 percent from 3.6 percent the year prior, and the number of women in Google leadership around the world rose from 26.7 percent to 28.1 percent. Still, Google’s US workforce is 68 percent male and 32 percent female, the report shows. Fifty percent of Google’s US workforce is white, compared to 42 percent Asian, 6.4 percent Latinx, 4.4 percent Black, and 0.8 percent Native American. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FkC0Td"&gt;And Google faced a slew of criticism late last year and earlier this year, for how it handled the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150355/google-fires-timnit-gebru-facial-recognition-ai-ethicist"&gt;firing of Black AI ethics researcher Timnit Gebru&lt;/a&gt; after she wrote a paper that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/5/22155985/paper-timnit-gebru-fired-google-large-language-models-search-ai"&gt;questioned the dangers of large language models&lt;/a&gt;. Gebru accused Google of racism and retaliation, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22309962/timnit-gebru-google-harassment-campaign-jeff-dean"&gt;faced online harassment&lt;/a&gt; for months afterward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yweqd6"&gt;In October, &lt;a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/progress-racial-equity-commitments/"&gt;CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; that the company planned to double the number of Black employees by 2025 and increase the number of underrepresented workers in senior positions by 30 percent. “We’ll hold ourselves accountable for creating an inclusive workplace,” Pichai wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XkyXcx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Riot made some chill beats for creators to stream to</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m33TaJPJ_VCR1GJUM7iirA17id4=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69534288/P3_still.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ERfXBP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; developer Riot is making something new — and very chill. The company just released an album called &lt;a href="https://found.ee/sessionsvi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sessions: Vi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is packed with 37 lo-fi tracks from producers like &lt;a href="https://chromonicci.bandcamp.com/"&gt;Chromonicci&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://juniorstate.bandcamp.com/"&gt;Junior State&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://laxcity.io/"&gt;Laxcity&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://tennyson.bandcamp.com/"&gt;Tennyson&lt;/a&gt;. The idea, the company says, is to offer “stream-safe” music that creators on platforms like YouTube and Twitch can use, without having to worry about copyright strikes. The album is available to stream now on Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gWQRXX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Bait and Twitch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562372/twitch-soundtrack-riaa-music-youtube"},{"title":"Lo-fi beats to quarantine to are booming on YouTube","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21222294/lofi-chillhop-youtube-productivity-community-views-subscribers"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6fjW4U"&gt;In typical Riot fashion, there’s also a narrative album. The title is in reference to &lt;a href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/champions/vi/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; character Vi&lt;/a&gt;, a criminal with high-tech gauntlets, and Riot’s head of music Toa Dunn says the album is meant to reflect a day in her life. The tracks are divided into three main parts, with vibes to represent afternoon, sunset, and night. “It all comes down to storytelling. It gives a lot of context,” Dunn says of the structure. “This isn’t canon. We’re not trying to expand on Runeterra, but this is another look.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IqcX3G"&gt;Music has become an increasingly large focus for Riot, particularly within the fantasy realm of &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt;, with fictional groups like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21496800/kda-league-of-legends-k-pop-album-release-date"&gt;K/DA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20937187/league-of-legends-true-damage-hip-hop-group-kda-louis-vuitton"&gt;True Damage&lt;/a&gt; releasing albums and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/11/20959206/league-of-legends-worlds-2019-opening-ceremony-holograms-holonet"&gt;performing at esports competitions&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Sessions&lt;/em&gt; represents a different direction, but one that makes a lot of sense, given &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562372/twitch-soundtrack-riaa-music-youtube"&gt;the constant tension between streamers and the music industry&lt;/a&gt;. And Dunn says there’s likely more music in the “sessions” line coming in the future as well. “This is drop one of who knows how many,” he says. “We plan to continue to learn and figure out more and more what people like.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ME5ZwY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Tesla Model S Plaid caught fire in Pennsylvania, briefly trapping the driver inside</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VVujueJVLsFLoDWB7QReQDnR2go=/0x210:1536x1234/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69534231/E5ObJckVoAMsr4n.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/meiselasb/status/1410641707985641472" target="_blank"&gt;@meiselasb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LciM7T"&gt;A high-end Tesla Model S Plaid caught fire Tuesday night in Haverford, Pennsylvania, briefly trapping the driver inside, according to the local fire department. A lawyer for the owner said the vehicle “spontaneously combusted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Kmcb6"&gt;Firefighters from both the Gladwyne and Lower Merion Fire Departments arrived on the scene shortly before 9PM ET on Tuesday. The firefighters, who had been trained on how to respond to battery fires involving Tesla vehicles, “laid a 5 inch supply line into the scene so that we could keep a continual water stream on the fire to extinguish the fire and cool the batteries down to ensure complete extinguishment,” according to a statement from the Gladwyne Fire Department. The driver managed to escape and there were no injuries reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Lf2Lgi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tesla’s Model S Plaid is a high-end, ultra-quick version of the automaker’s original electric sedan&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CshC3g"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22528963/tesla-model-s-plaid-ev-price-specs-range-speed"&gt;Tesla’s Model S Plaid is a high-end, ultra-quick version&lt;/a&gt; of the automaker’s original electric sedan. Tesla CEO Elon Musk held a splashy event last month to announce the first customer deliveries of the $130,000 vehicle. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/meiselasb/status/1410641707985641472"&gt;According to Ben Meiselas&lt;/a&gt;, a lawyer who works for the firm representing the unnamed owner, the Model S Plaid was one of the first 250 vehicles shipped to customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xrKokD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10634637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="9t8huc"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Our firm &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AthleteDefender?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AthleteDefender&lt;/a&gt; represent an exec who purchased new Tesla Plaid Model S, which was 1/250 shipped. On Tuesday it spontaneously combusted. Our client was trapped &amp;amp; could have died. We tried reaching out to Tesla &amp;amp; have been ignored so far. This is  car after escape. &lt;a href="https://t.co/wXyJXbWggJ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/wXyJXbWggJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ben Meiselas (@meiselasb) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/meiselasb/status/1410641707985641472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uciJAm"&gt;“This is a harrowing and frightening situation and an obvious major problem,” said Mark Geragos, another attorney representing the owner. “Our preliminary investigation is ongoing, but we call on Tesla to sideline these cars until a full investigation can occur.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m1lFK7"&gt;There’s no evidence that electric vehicles catch fire at a rate that’s any different from internal combustion cars, but the topic has received increased scrutiny as more EVs hit the road. First responders are even being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/3/17530646/tesla-battery-fire-electric-vehicles-transportation-science"&gt;trained to handle EV battery fires&lt;/a&gt; since they can’t be extinguished via some traditional methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2uwWcy"&gt;Tesla’s vehicle fires have especially caught a lot of attention — to the point that Musk has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1120802953130995714?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;publicly pushed back on the coverage of those incidents&lt;/a&gt;. Some companies, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21564217/gm-chevy-bolt-recall-battery-fire-lg-chem"&gt;Chevrolet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357068/hyundai-kona-ev-recall-battery-fire-nhtsa"&gt;Hyundai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/10/18659983/audi-etron-recall-battery-fire-risk"&gt;Audi&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/27/18761067/nio-es8-electric-suv-recall-battery-fires-china"&gt;NIO&lt;/a&gt;, have issued recalls over the possibility of fires in their EVs. Others, like Jaguar, have experienced &lt;a href="https://www.caixinglobal.com/2019-05-02/deformed-chassis-put-nio-ev-on-fire-101410947.html"&gt;isolated&lt;/a&gt; fires with &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/a-jaguar-i-pace-ev-had-a-thermal-incident-while-parke-1830995550"&gt;their&lt;/a&gt; electric cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="H3KGBR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s no evidence that electric vehicles catch fire at a rate that’s any different from internal combustion cars&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CpCSIU"&gt;Tesla has maintained that its cars &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/VehicleSafetyReport"&gt;are the safest in the world&lt;/a&gt; and self-reports annual vehicle fire statistics that are far lower than those found in gasoline-powered cars. The company has made multiple changes to the Model S over the years to reduce the risk of fires, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K5MHSp"&gt;It shipped a software update in 2013 that &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/11/tesla-responds-model-s-fires/"&gt;made the Model S ride higher at highway speeds&lt;/a&gt; to lower the chance of debris puncturing the battery pack and added more physical protection to new packs coming off the line. Both those updates were sent after a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration investigation into multiple fires. (The agency closed the &lt;a href="https://www.industryweek.com/safety/nhtsa-halts-investigation-tesla-fires"&gt;investigation in 2014&lt;/a&gt;.) Tesla also released a software update in 2016 to “provide extra security during charging” &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2016/03/17/tesla-supercharger-fire-update-software-short-circuit/"&gt;after a Model S caught fire in Norway&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uw9J7M"&gt;Incidents involving Teslas tend to draw more media attention than other vehicles because of the company’s tendency to push the limits on technology, whether it’s battery density, partial autonomy, or vehicle design. Tesla is lauded by its many fans for its willingness to go beyond the comfort zone of more conservative, legacy automakers. And with that also comes more scrutiny from media outlets and regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N1iPEl"&gt;A spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment about the fire, which is unsurprising considering the company has dissolved its public relations department and hasn’t responded to any inquiry in the last two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OOAUuA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GMNRrO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla delivered over 200,000 cars in the second quarter of 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QxDCyMnqZ4PxNqSIJannNZCjq9I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69533799/jbareham_180213_2301_0168.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qkU2uy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-q2-2021-vehicle-production-deliveries"&gt;Tesla delivered 201,250 vehicles&lt;/a&gt; in the second quarter of 2021, a record for the company but still falling slightly short of Wall Street expectations. Elon Musk’s company also produced 206,421 vehicles during the same period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Np3aK"&gt;Of all the cars that Tesla produced during the quarter, the vast majority — 204,081 — were Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. On top of that, Tesla also produced 2,340 Model S and Model X vehicles — though the company did not break out how many Model S sedans were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22528963/tesla-model-s-plaid-ev-price-specs-range-speed"&gt;the high-end Plaid variant&lt;/a&gt; that just started reaching customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wDW7g4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the company did not break out how many Model S Plaid sedans were delivered&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TlO554"&gt;Earlier last month, Tesla held a delivery event for the redesigned Model S, featuring a new powertrain, more horsepower, a new landscape touchscreen and steering wheel, and more range. A Model S Plaid &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/01/tesla-plaid-fire/"&gt;recently caught fire&lt;/a&gt; in Pennsylvania, briefly trapping the driver inside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WO2znB"&gt;The second quarter delivery numbers broke the previous quarter’s record, when Tesla delivered nearly 185,000 vehicles. Tesla has been ramping up production capacity, including building new factories in Texas and Germany, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/2/22210191/tesla-delivery-goal-elon-musk-vehicles-2020"&gt;just nearly missed&lt;/a&gt; CEO Elon Musk’s goal of delivering 500,000 cars in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VIa93v"&gt;Tesla does not break out deliveries by region, so we don’t know how many vehicles the company is sending to customers in China. Tesla has been hit by a slate of bad news in the country, most recently announcing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/26/22551618/tesla-recalls-model-vehicles-china-cruise-control-safety"&gt;recall of more than 285,000 vehicles&lt;/a&gt; —most of which were made locally— over a safety risk with the vehicles’ cruise control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WxtLqG"&gt;Like the rest of the auto industry, Tesla has also struggled with the parts shortage, including a dearth of semiconductors. In May, Musk tweeted that prices were increasing as a result of “supply chain price-pressure industry-wide [sic].” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eNsY7x"&gt;The second quarter also saw the departure of several high-level Tesla executives, including former long-time acting general counsel Al Prescott in April, and both deputy general counsel Lynn Miller and former president of automotive and heavy trucking Jerome Guillen in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LG16dh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;By locating the battery in the floor of the vehicle, auto companies are making it difficult to convert EVs for wheelchair users&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="jU2oxZ"&gt;In a Super Bowl commercial that aired earlier this year, GM declared that its electric vehicles were designed for everyone. The ad closed with the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJf5Woythmk"&gt;image of a one-armed surfer&lt;/a&gt; to emphasize its point. But sometime later, that &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgdQfbaGPsE"&gt;surfer was replaced by an able-bodied counterpart&lt;/a&gt;, with no explanation for the switch. As a wheelchair user, I was left wondering whether people like me are being left out of the EV revolution?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1lT9H"&gt;There’s no doubt that EVs are going to be one of the pillars of our future, yet there are currently none on the market for the disabled. Retrofitting these vehicles with ramps seems close to impossible due to the architecture. And the only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22352748/volkswagen-id-buzz-electric-microbus-us-release-date"&gt;EV on the horizon&lt;/a&gt; that could be made accessible isn’t coming until 2023 — and even then, it’s unclear that it will be marketed toward disabled drivers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZcXT9V"&gt;I don’t drive because treatment for a brain tumor caused swelling that impacted my cranial nerves, corrupting my balance, motor skills, and causing my eyes to bounce. I did own a Dodge minivan with a converted ramp so that others could transport me in my electric wheelchair when I had to travel long distances or on tough terrain. For someone with an active life, these vans are a necessity. I was fortunate in that I had the financial support to purchase one, but for many disabled people who live off Social Security income or low-wage jobs, this option is prohibitive. And the price tag will only go up with new technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JV1eCv"&gt;But price is not the problem at this juncture. Most electric vehicles use a so-called “skateboard architecture,” which includes the battery pack, the electric drivetrain, and the electrical architecture that rests under the floor of the vehicle. This makes an EV harder to get into for those with physical disabilities — if only by a minimal amount — because the floor is placed above the battery pack. For disabled drivers, an untapped consumer base of 61 million with nearly $500 million of disposable income, that extra inch or two could be the reason for not getting a license or owning a car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="b04H6k"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I do feel that I might have a harder time getting into the driver’s seat if the battery raises the height of the floor.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="afVBzn"&gt;Kelly Dawson, a disability advocate and writer based in Los Angeles, has limited mobility due to cerebral palsy that mostly affects her legs. She can’t bend down to fill her tires with air because she can’t crouch and balance at the same time. But even as an ambulatory driver, she is worried about the challenges EVs might present her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OK0wLg"&gt;“I do feel that I might have a harder time getting into the driver’s seat if the battery raises the height of the floor,” she said. “With my current fuel-powered car, I can step or slide in, but an EV might be a tighter (potentially unsafe) squeeze.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PVHZTa"&gt;Dawson points out that “when cars were first introduced to the public at the beginning of the 20th century, disabled people were in no way a part of public life — they were actively excluded from it. The main difference with this chapter of automotive innovation is that it’s coming 30 years after the passage of the ADA [Americans with Disabilities Act].”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SqRAVz"&gt;Where this barrier for the disabled comes into focus is in the potential conversion of the vehicle. Dropping the floor of a gas-powered vehicle 10–14 inches would typically cost $25,000–35,000 and can be partially paid for with help from the state government or Department of Veterans Affairs. Roughly 20,000 of these conversions are done every year, according to Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst for e-mobility at Guidehouse. However, vehicle conversion companies like &lt;a href="https://www.mobilityworks.com/"&gt;MobilityWorks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.braunability.com/us/en.html"&gt;Braunability&lt;/a&gt;, while being able to add handbrake equipment, can’t convert electric vehicles to have a ramp due to the battery’s position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZCUVEjikxuiuXRUiH-ekl9yfRc8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22693492/Screen_Shot_2021_07_01_at_10.59.41_AM.png"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7oJtvl"&gt;Abuelsamid said that Braunability does offer a conversion for the Chrysler Pacifica plug-in hybrid, which has drop-down ramp access through the rear, but there are no fully electric minivans like that on the market today. Some larger electric vans will appear later this year in the Ford &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21559954/ford-e-transit-electric-delivery-cargo-van-price-specs-range"&gt;E-Transit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/gm-brightdrop-ev600-electric-van-ev-ces-fedex/"&gt;Brightdrop EV600&lt;/a&gt; from GM, but those are prioritized for commercial fleets. The first real electric minivan expected to arrive is the VW ID Buzz in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lkBmyJ"&gt;Kevin Frayne worked for 34 years at GM before joining Braunability as its quasi-futurist. He recently spoke on behalf of the US Access Board at the Department of Transportation’s forum on equity. And he works closely with companies to consult on designs. He said this task will be a difficult one. “It’s not insurmountable, but companies have to start working with us now,” Frayne said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="qg3Vg6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“In this case, everything has to do with geometry and triangles.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bHHCTf"&gt;“In this case, everything has to do with geometry and triangles,” he said. Frayne has to think about things like roof height because the ADA requires door openings to be 56 inches tall, which makes it a problematic crunch when the floor is raised. If he has two inches to fit an ultra-thin ramp between the floor and the battery, he has to devise a blueprint for the ADA-mandated slope ratio of one inch of rise for every four inches of ramp — though Frayne and others think it should be 1:6. And that doesn’t even take into account automated tie-down systems to secure a wheelchair once inside a vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XilhHL"&gt;But conversions are not the only potential barriers for the disabled community. &lt;a href="https://www.zap-map.com/electric-vehicle-charge-points-lack-accessibility/"&gt;A four-year study by Zap-Map and Motability in the UK&lt;/a&gt; found that one-third of drivers with disabilities had difficulty finding a charge station they could use. The survey only included 2,200 people, and 176 of those considered themselves disabled, but that might have something to do with EV ownership among the disabled being so low due to income and access. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nnN6e6"&gt;According to that survey, one reason for inaccessibility at charging stations is the heavy weight of charging cables. Like cellphone and laptop batteries, high-power charging generates a lot of heat in the cable, which is why they are typically insulated and liquid-cooled. This makes them heavier and harder to maneuver. Adding to the difficulty, the charging connectors need to be precisely aligned in order to slide in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gl67KN"&gt;Other issues include the force required to connect the cables to the EV, the lack of curb-cuts to access the charging station, and parking spaces bunched too closely together. Hopefully, as electric vehicles become cheaper and more popular, charging station operators will abandon the current side-by-side setup to support disabled drivers as well as trucks, buses, and vehicles pulling trailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="tM1xLL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It seems that disabled drivers and passengers are, at the moment, something of an afterthought”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kEU9Jv"&gt;In 2014, the Department of Energy released a &lt;a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/files/u/publication/WPCC_complyingwithADArequirements_1114.pdf"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; with measurements and images depicting a layout for charging stations. While it would be easy to install charging stations in old or unused parking spaces, by law, every lot must have four accessible spaces, and 1 in 6 must be van accessible. As EV expert Dan Caesar from &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/fullychargedshow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fully Charged&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; says, “It seems that disabled drivers and passengers are, at the moment, something of an afterthought for the nascent electric vehicle/charging sector.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QHxHtM"&gt;I asked Henry Claypool, technology policy consultant for the American Association of People with Disabilities, about the obstacle of EV batteries in the floor of the vehicle. He was optimistic, recalling how in 2019, Volkswagen convened a meeting with a range of stakeholder groups to discuss building a purpose-built wheelchair-accessible vehicle as part of the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.inclusivemobility.com/"&gt;Inclusive Mobility&lt;/a&gt; initiative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ajoMt"&gt;“At the end of this meeting, a few VW engineers came down to the parking garage to look at my aftermarket modified van,” Claypool told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “They observed the kneeling and ramp system and didn’t seem troubled by creating something like an electric vehicle with a battery in the floor. They seemed really committed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0XJvtO"&gt;Claypool said Toyota is another company that is really advanced in accessibility. “It will be exciting to see them unveil an accessible AV at the Paralympics in Tokyo, Japan,” he said. “And the thing is, when one OEM successfully does this, everyone’s going to follow.”                                               &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zLjIhi"&gt;What remains frustrating, though, is how disabled people are being used to sell products while being left out of the engineering decisions. The disabled community doesn’t want to drive gas-burning cars while everyone else zips around in zero-emission vehicles. Automakers shouldn’t put off the disabled community’s concerns because if we’re not included on a foundational level, it’s going to be more complex and expensive for everyone going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="6syBEw"&gt;“Disabled people are arguably the most innovative cohort of Americans,” says Dawson. “We shouldn’t just be behind the wheel of electric cars, we should also be calling the shots on how to build them.”&lt;/p&gt;
