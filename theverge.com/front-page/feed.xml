    <title>Xiaomi’s wireless charging pad is the latest clone to attempt the AirPower dream</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XmMpFLirD1-i5XfGi7XZF7kNv3E=/173x0:1586x942/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69042245/image__1_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QcfRDd"&gt;Xiaomi unveiled a new wireless charging pad during its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350245/xiaomi-mi-mix-liquid-lens-autofocus-focal-length-camera"&gt;Mi Mix event this morning&lt;/a&gt;. The pad is capable of simultaneously charging three devices without precise placement, similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/3/29/18287383/apple-airpower-wireless-charger-cancelled"&gt;canceled Apple AirPower charger&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CoSfpz"&gt;According to Xiaomi, this wireless charging pad features up to 20W of wireless power per device and includes &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/duanrui1205/status/1376506733493768192?s=20"&gt;19 coils&lt;/a&gt;, allowing users to place any three devices that support Qi wireless charging, according to Xiaomi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hTOOaT"&gt;Unlike most other clones out there, Xiamoi’s wireless charging pad is more affordable, selling for about $90. However, it is unknown if the charging pad will see a release outside of China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1lB9kW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Xiaomi is not the first company to make its own clone of the Apple AirPower&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wiAfR4"&gt;Xiaomi is not the first company to make its own clone of the Apple AirPower. In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/11/20909687/nomad-base-station-pro-wireless-charger-airpower-18-coils"&gt;Nomad released the Base Station Pro&lt;/a&gt;, an 18-coil wireless charger that can charge any three devices with no specific placement, but as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21399941/nomad-base-station-pro-review-wireless-charger-aira-freepower-price"&gt;noted by my colleague Chaim Gartenberg&lt;/a&gt;, one of the downsides was that aside from the iPhone, the pad only provided 5W of charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWuT8g"&gt;Alongside a new wireless charging pad, Xiamoi also unveiled the Mi 11 Pro, which includes 67W wireless charging as opposed to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363317/xiaomi-mi-10-ultra-announcement-twitter-fast-charging"&gt;Mi 10 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528249/huawei-mate-40-pro-plus-release-date-news-features-price-specs-cameras"&gt;Huawei’s Mate 40 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which have previously had the fastest wireless charging with 50W. Additionally, Xiaomi also announced a new 80W wireless charger. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>These TikToks are a playful look into the harsh realities of game development</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zK_9bqxJRpO24kRF1Bud7RS0oE4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69042206/acastro_210326_4492_famousStreamer_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FCimnf"&gt;Leslee Sullivant approaches the camera curiously. Her hair is pulled back into a ponytail, and she’s dressed in an olive green button-up against a bar background. “Are you one of the new hires?” she asks. “Oh, you’re the intern!” She offers to sneak you a drink when she learns you’re underage and asks about your boyfriend. You’re not like her wife, she says. The wife doesn’t really get the whole gaming thing. “If you’re looking for a mentor, I’m your guy,” she concludes. The caption on the TikTok video is “grooming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WOMoWn"&gt;The games industry struggles with #MeToo-style reckonings every few months, and Sullivant’s video is a pitch-perfect impression of one of the many insidious ways those problems happen. On TikTok and Twitter, where she later shared the video, people can relate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1fQIa9"&gt;As one woman put it: “raise your hand if you’ve met this person.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="7qf1TG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@famous_streamer/video/6942576723531713798" data-video-id="6942576723531713798" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@famous_streamer" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@famous_streamer"&gt;@famous_streamer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;grooming &lt;a title="greenscreen" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/greenscreen"&gt;#greenscreen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="fyp" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp"&gt;#fyp&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="foryoupage" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/foryoupage"&gt;#foryoupage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="gamedev" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/gamedev"&gt;#gamedev&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="gamedevelopment" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/gamedevelopment"&gt;#gamedevelopment&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="BiggerIsBetter" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/BiggerIsBetter"&gt;#BiggerIsBetter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - leslee" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-6942576598637873925"&gt;♬ original sound - leslee&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lpfYEX"&gt;Sullivant’s TikToks are more than a way to pass the time — they’re small performances of digital activism and education. “I’m always trying to find a way to make [the industry] better,” she tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, citing stories of abuse and harassment endemic to the field. “I don’t know how to fix it. In the past, I have raised issues internally only to get punished for them. I have written an article about my time in games, and that’s not going to move the needle. It’s really hard for one person to do something about it. Barring me raising money to start my own studio, which will what? Impact 10 people in 10 years? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0NuUS7"&gt;“I’m desperate to change the industry for the better. This seemed like one of the ways maybe it could be far-reaching and impactful.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AWJKF6"&gt;Through TikTok, Sullivant, a producer with a long career in games, has a chance to reach new audiences she’d never find through other platforms. It’s lower effort than a YouTube video, allowing her to edit in-app and get her point across in less than a minute. The app’s algorithm surfaces videos to users more organically than a place like Twitter, where Sullivant will repost her content to her followers. And the playfulness of TikTok makes it easier to tackle these issues in a direct, albeit tongue-in-cheek, way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bpetnQ"&gt;In one video, Sullivant plays a pair of writers interrupted by an executive with terrible advice and impossible standards. In another, she gives two employees, Todd and Amy, performance reviews. Todd gets high marks and feedback. Amy not so much: “Says here you’re a huge bi—” The video cuts.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wXTEZF"&gt;“I think a lot of these things happen and there aren’t a lot of great avenues to talk about them,” Sullivant says. “I think a lot of these discussions are discouraged, or they have to be done in secret.” That can make it hard for people to speak up at all, let alone find each other for support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;div id="UibP92"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@famous_streamer/video/6937750048876875014" data-video-id="6937750048876875014" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@famous_streamer" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@famous_streamer"&gt;@famous_streamer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;diversity &amp;amp; inclusion programs &lt;a title="fyp" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp"&gt;#fyp&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="foryoupage" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/foryoupage"&gt;#foryoupage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="gamedev" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/gamedev"&gt;#gamedev&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="gamedevelopment" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/gamedevelopment"&gt;#gamedevelopment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ tarawarolin wants you to know this isnt my sound -  ‍♂️" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/tarawarolin-wants-you-to-know-this-isnt-my-sound-6874404787064949510"&gt;♬ tarawarolin wants you to know this isnt my sound -  ‍♂️&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yEjo6J"&gt;“A lot of these videos talk about stakeholders or people in power,” she says. “God forbid you bring that up at work, or you run into that kind of thing. I’m hoping this is providing an outlet for that kind of emotion and validation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VcZz5q"&gt;Sullivant’s early TikToks are fashion-focused — they were motivation for her to get dressed even while working from home in a pandemic — but she was interested in making videos about millennial work culture. It just took some courage to put her face on camera. “I want to do something that really speaks to my actual work experience and the way I like to cope with my experiences in games, and that’s by poking fun of stuff that happens at game development,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LK34WP"&gt;She aims for “self-deprecating and also trying to highlight the weird issues” that come with a career in game development. And although she says some of her content does have some inside baseball talk, it’s still accessible to someone who doesn’t work in the industry — and maybe even still relatable for someone who doesn’t. “People don’t have to be in the know about how the games industry works to understand the impact of the thing that’s being explored in those videos,” Sullivant says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SFHKaT"&gt;Her videos aren’t based on any specific experience, she says, but rather a sort of conglomeration of her 11 years in development. “I was very scared at first, and I always have that sense of regret immediately after publishing a video,” she says. “Is this the one that’s going to get me doxxed?” Her aim isn’t to discuss players or the gaming community, but rather keep it within her industry, and what her peers — or future peers — experience. “The amount of people being like, ‘Oh, I didn’t realize this was a problem,’ or even the more senior game devs who were like, ‘I absolutely can see it now, but I didn’t in my 20s, and I want other young people to see this,’ was eye-opening,” Sullivant says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZAlg7p"&gt;“We can do a little bit of education and hopefully improve things for the better.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tyKqzV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XXYvgK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Echo Show 10 that moves is $40 off for the first time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wPodj7lFb1FHnnI9faV8l36lNa8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69042100/dseifert_210219_4433_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3BWttr"&gt;If you’ve been waiting for a deal on Amazon’s new Echo Show 10 smart display that can spin around to always be facing you, today’s your day. Normally $250, it’s down to $210 right now for the black or white versions, both of which feature a camera for video chats, as well as for tracking you in order to make sure the screen’s within view for convenience. This is the first price drop, and 16 percent off isn’t bad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qA5gIY"&gt;This deal is available through &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHZ41L8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733329406175831312#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-10-3rd-gen-hd-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-82381551%3Fpreselect%3D80770248%26clkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, but Amazon has the exclusive on a deal that &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/echo-show-10/dp/B08SQ2F8D2?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costs just $5 more&lt;/a&gt; and lets you checkout with the Blink Mini home security cam added to your purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="huV3QT"&gt;There are several other Echo Show models, and aside from the rotating feature, this one provides a similar experience. My colleague Dan Seifert &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review"&gt;reviewed this new model&lt;/a&gt; recently, saying “Alexa in the new Echo Show 10 is largely the same Alexa you get on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/8/17944022/new-amazon-echo-show-review-2018-alexa-speaker-video-camera"&gt;prior Echo Show&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/18/16161058/amazon-echo-show-alexa-dot-which-one-to-buy"&gt;every other Alexa-powered smart display&lt;/a&gt;. You ask it for information — a weather report, a favorite playlist, news, calendar appointments, and so on — and it will give you a polite response and show the requested information on the screen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="S9AZ16"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10362085"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u37uez"&gt;The Beats Flex wireless neckbuds usually cost $50, but you can get the black, sky blue, or bright yellow models for $10 off at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08L6ZYW21?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. These are Beats’ first headphones to charge via USB-C, making them equally suited for Android users as they are for the Apple ecosystem of devices. For folks heavily invested in Apple’s products, these have the Apple W1 wireless chip that makes these buds easily connect to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nrM4bN"&gt;I own these, and I’ve found the sound quality to be delightful for the price, and the controls are simple enough to learn. But, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522700/beats-flex-wireless-earbuds-review"&gt;as Chris Welch’s review mentions&lt;/a&gt;, they aren’t perfect. They aren’t rated for sweat resistance or waterproofing, and these don’t have great sound isolation when you’re surrounded by a fair amount of noise. Still, $40 is hard to turn down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kPjS3e"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9591203"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M4xEQq"&gt;If you have a Nintendo Switch and don’t yet own a high-capacity microSD card to store games on, Amazon’s deal of the day has your name on it. You can get a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GYG5SVQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;400GB SanDisk microSD card for $39&lt;/a&gt;, which is near the lowest-ever price (you’re getting more than 10GB per dollar here). Games for the Switch range in size between a few gigabytes to dozens, so this sub-$40 purchase should last you a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UGRcg4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10327706"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="BJozrz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Amazon is becoming the face of American inequality</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_tUoBVWclPCHOFXI2e6ict7m2r8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69042052/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Bezos has become a useful foil for Democrats&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="vKpbXM"&gt;In the days leading up to the Bessemer union vote, Amazon is throwing punches. They’re just not aimed at workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HBBqtf"&gt;As the Alabama warehouse votes on whether to unionize, Amazon has been facing mounting pressure from progressive lawmakers — and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22352977/amazon-twitter-feud-bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-trolling-labor-pee-bottles"&gt;on Friday, the company went on the offensive&lt;/a&gt;, calling out Sens. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) for their criticism of the company’s policies. Predictably, tweets &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1375502593863073792"&gt;provoked more tweets&lt;/a&gt;, turning into days of jousting between progressives and a corporate PR account. Over the weekend, &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/3/28/22354604/amazon-twitter-bernie-sanders-jeff-bezos-union-alabama-elizabeth-warren"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recode&lt;/em&gt; broke the news&lt;/a&gt; that Bezos had personally encouraged the callout, worrying that his company was being too passive in the face of progressive pressure. Whatever the risks, Bezos clearly sees this fight as a winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="yaI0Rq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Bezos sees this fight as a winner — so do Democrats&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DO1fvj"&gt;So do Democrats. It’s rare to see this much national involvement in a union drive, but President Biden jumped in earlier this month, expressing support in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22306952/amazon-union-biden-statement-bessemer-alabama-warehouse"&gt;hedged but unmistakable terms&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon is a useful foil for a party trying to recapture working-class voters, and Amazon’s loose tweets could spark a much bigger fight. As Democrats respond to the economic fallout of the pandemic, Amazon makes an ideal antagonist, making billions while the rest of the economy withers. The pandemic has only intensified that disparity, shutting down in-person retail while Amazon’s e-commerce business thrived. The company is the perfect villain for a party eager to tell a story about economic justice — and while the Bessemer election will be counted and done in a few days, the fight between Amazon and Democrats may not be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5QjqIu"&gt;Much of the Bessemer fight so far has come from Biden’s particular commitment to unions as a political force. Biden wants to be seen as enthusiastically pro-labor (a rare quality for a post-Clinton Democrat), and this is the most important labor effort in years for reasons &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/28/22352987/amazon-bessemer-alabama-union-vote-rwdsu"&gt;we describe in detail here&lt;/a&gt;. So the Bessemer fight lets Biden stick up for the little guy and suggest his labor board will come down hard on any irregularities from Amazon. It casts Biden as a different kind of Democrat with more to offer the working class. It’s not just the right thing to do; it’s also good politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxuLEz"&gt;But that political calculus extends far beyond the Bessemer fight. Biden wants to be seen as a bold, progressive president taking on entrenched inequality. A public spat with Amazon makes it clear he’s trying, even if more ambitious efforts like the $15 minimum wage (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/3/17929068/amazon-wage-raise-bernie-sanders-increase-15"&gt;Amazon’s preferred remedy&lt;/a&gt;) get lost along the way. And since tossing insults at Amazon is easier than reversing decades of economic damage, the feud gives Biden an easy way to show he’s trying. All he has to do is cast Amazon as the face of the problem — the leading edge of everything that’s wrong with the American economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="I21Xia"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon “not only altered the national landscape itself, but also the landscape of opportunity in America”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xLfPey"&gt;This month, &lt;a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374159276"&gt;a new book&lt;/a&gt; lays out the same story at a grander scale. Written by &lt;em&gt;ProPublica&lt;/em&gt;’s Alec MacGillis, &lt;em&gt;Fulfillment&lt;/em&gt; is less about Amazon’s business than the social dislocation left in its wake, pairing Amazon’s rise to power with the struggles of a cardboard packer in Dayton or a small office supply store in El Paso. Many of the figures in the book aren’t even officially Amazon employees, instead working for contractors or selling on the company’s marketplace. Still, the overall message is clear: Amazon is growing rich and powerful off of these people’s work, while they scramble just to stay alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T05fZK"&gt;In the introduction, MacGillis makes the case for Amazon as a poster child of this new style of American business explicitly. As he describes it, the idea for his book emerged when he realized Amazon was “an ideal frame for understanding the country and what the country was becoming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="znhs0n"&gt;[Amazon] served as the ultimate lens on the country’s divides because it was present just about everywhere… It had segmented the country into different sorts of places, each with their assigned rank, income, and purpose. It had not only altered the national landscape itself, but also the landscape of opportunity in America — the options that lay before people, what they could aspire to do with their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Duta0B"&gt;Of course, that economic chasm is much older than Amazon. The landscape of American opportunity has always been skewed, and the latest tectonics date back at least 50 years. Amazon has been at the forefront of many of those changes — particularly the shift to e-commerce, exurban fulfillment networks, and vastly scaleable online interactions. But Amazon didn’t cause those shifts; it just positioned itself to benefit from them. MacGillis acknowledges as much in how he describes the company: a lens, rather than the whole picture in itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="BYyX2E"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Political pressure will change Amazon in profound and unpredictable ways&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cvglRb"&gt;As Democrats scramble to connect with working class and rural voters, that lens can be a powerful political force. For decades, the party has struggled to describe the crushing divide in the American economy that has pushed wealth to major cities and left the rest of the country to decay. Since 2016, many of the voters on the wrong side of that divide have left the party for Trump, a trend that Biden is eager to reverse. Neither party has a meaningful plan to undo the structural damage, but Biden is hoping a surge in federal money will soften the blow, beginning with &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/2021/03/10/covid-19-stimulus-bill-joe-bidens-plan-explained-6-graphics/4601454001/"&gt;the trillion-dollar relief package&lt;/a&gt; and continuing with &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/03/25/biden-putting-final-touches-potential-3-trillion-economic-package/6986152002/"&gt;trillions more&lt;/a&gt; in infrastructure spending planned for this spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wPsF8K"&gt;Democrats are hoping to cast those bills as a contemporary New Deal, rescuing the country from economic ruin while uniting it politically. Portraying Amazon as the face of that ruin — and using a public fight with the company as proof the party is serious about taking it on — is just good messaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9760cR"&gt;A feud between Democrats and Amazon would also catch Republicans off balance, splitting the party between its populist rhetoric and pro-business policies. Since Trump, Bezos has been a rhetorical foil for Fox News, but Amazon &lt;a href="https://itep.org/from-0-to-1-2-amazon-lauds-its-minuscule-effective-federal-income-tax-rate/"&gt;benefited hugely&lt;/a&gt; from Trump’s tax cut and quadrupled in value over Trump’s four years in office. Even now, Republicans weighing in on the feud between Sanders and Amazon have found themselves &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kenklippenstein/status/1376318757845471232"&gt;in the awkward position&lt;/a&gt; of defending a company they’ve spent much of the past four years attacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="77pRqB"&gt;Amazon has plenty of resources to defend itself. The company is still wildly profitable, the second largest employer in the United States (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_United_States%E2%80%93based_employers_globally"&gt;after Wal-Mart&lt;/a&gt;) and the second largest federal lobbyist (&lt;a href="https://www.citizen.org/article/big-tech-lobbying-update/"&gt;after Facebook&lt;/a&gt;). It will have ample chance to soften the blow of any new policies and is better equipped to ride out the changes than nearly any other company on Earth. Congress’ efforts to change Section 230 have been focused on Google and Facebook rather than Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/28/21080720/amazon-product-liability-lawsuits-marketplace-damage-third-party"&gt;product liability issues&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21136641/amazon-microsoft-pentagon-contract-jedi-10-billion-paused"&gt;Pentagon contract aside&lt;/a&gt;, government work is still a relatively small part of the company’s business. After decades of unbelievable growth, there is only so much that can go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="BpnCQQ"&gt;But political pressure will still change Amazon in profound and unpredictable ways. Facebook was in this position in 2016 — suddenly blamed for Trump’s election, Brexit, and the fraying condition of liberal democracy across the world. Five years later, every new project is met with hostility, and ambitious politicians around the world look at the company as a prize waiting to be taken down. Most companies would try to avoid that fate. After this weekend’s dustup, Amazon seems to be leaning into it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OpenAI’s text-generating system GPT-3 is now spewing out 4.5 billion words a day</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eCB_yq1i0VB7wGza7_OzU_JLNGA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69041640/acastro_200730_1777_ai_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ojPk2Z"&gt;One of the biggest trends in machine learning right now is text generation. AI systems learn by absorbing billions of words scraped from the internet and generate text in response to a variety of prompts. It sounds simple, but these machines can be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21346343/gpt-3-explainer-openai-examples-errors-agi-potential"&gt;put to a wide array of tasks&lt;/a&gt; — from creating fiction, to writing bad code, to letting you chat with historical figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vi7SBS"&gt;The best-known AI text-generator is OpenAI’s GPT-3, which the company &lt;a href="https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-apps/"&gt;recently announced&lt;/a&gt; is now being used in more than 300 different apps, by “tens of thousands” of developers, and producing 4.5 billion words per day. That’s a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of robot verbiage&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;This may be an arbitrary milestone for OpenAI to celebrate, but it’s also a useful indicator of the growing scale, impact, and commercial potential of AI text generation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jmMKnT"&gt;OpenAI started life as a nonprofit, but for the last few years, it has been trying to make money with GPT-3 as its first salable product. The company has an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21451283/microsoft-openai-gpt-3-exclusive-license-ai-language-research"&gt;exclusivity deal with Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; which gives the tech giant unique access to the program’s underlying code, but any firm can apply for access to GPT-3’s general API and build services on top of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="d5A8Me"&gt;&lt;q&gt;No company stands to benefit more from GPT-3’s rise than OpenAI itself&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ibGXBb"&gt;As OpenAI is keen to advertise, hundreds of companies are now doing exactly this. One startup named &lt;a href="https://askviable.com/"&gt;Viable&lt;/a&gt; is using GPT-3 to analyze customer feedback, identifying “themes, emotions, and sentiment from surveys, help desk tickets, live chat logs, reviews, and more”; &lt;a href="https://fable-studio.com/"&gt;Fable Studio&lt;/a&gt; is using the program to create dialogue for VR experiences; and &lt;a href="https://www.algolia.com/"&gt;Algolia&lt;/a&gt; is using it to improve its web search products which it, in turn, sells on to other customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ISqdta"&gt;All this is good news for OpenAI (and Microsoft, whose Azure cloud computing platform &lt;a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2019/07/22/openai-forms-exclusive-computing-partnership-with-microsoft-to-build-new-azure-ai-supercomputing-technologies/"&gt;powers OpenAI’s tech&lt;/a&gt;), but not everyone in startup-land is keen. &lt;a href="https://bakztfuture.substack.com/p/how-to-build-a-startup-monopoly-with"&gt;Many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.allencheng.com/starting-a-business-around-gpt-3-is-a-bad-idea/"&gt;analysts&lt;/a&gt; have noted the folly of building a company on technology you don’t actually own. Using GPT-3 to create a startup is ludicrously simple, but it’ll be ludicrously simple for your competitors, too. And though there are ways to differentiate your GPT startup through branding and UI, no firm stands to gain as much as from the use of the technology as OpenAI itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eMro4T"&gt;Another worry about the rise of text-generating systems relates to issues of output quality. Like many algorithms, text generators have the capacity to absorb and amplify &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/12/04/1013294/google-ai-ethics-research-paper-forced-out-timnit-gebru/"&gt;harmful biases&lt;/a&gt;. They’re also often astoundingly dumb. In tests of a medical chatbot built using GPT-3, the model responded to a “suicidal” patient by &lt;a href="https://artificialintelligence-news.com/2020/10/28/medical-chatbot-openai-gpt3-patient-kill-themselves/"&gt;encouraging them to kill themselves&lt;/a&gt;. These problems aren’t insurmountable, but they’re certainly worth flagging in a world where algorithms are already creating &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21301759/facial-recognition-detroit-police-wrongful-arrest-robert-williams-artificial-intelligence"&gt;mistaken arrests&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/17/21372045/uk-a-level-results-algorithm-biased-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic-university-applications"&gt;unfair school grades&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/24/20929337/care-algorithm-study-race-bias-health"&gt;biased medical bills&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sJE6DI"&gt;As OpenAI’s latest milestone suggest, though, GPT-3 is only going to keep on talking, and we need to be ready for a world filled with robot-generated chatter. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Jony Ive and Marc Newson-designed Leica prototype is headed to auction</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The prototype Leica camera.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.leitz-auction.com/auction/en/auktion34/auction38/article/243.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI" target="_blank"&gt;Leitz Photographica Auction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V2LxXv"&gt;A rare prototype of a Leica camera crafted by former Apple luminary Jony Ive and famed designer Marc Newson is being &lt;a href="https://www.leitz-auction.com/auction/en/auktion34/auction38/article/243.html"&gt;sold at auction in June&lt;/a&gt;. The device, which is described as being in “B+” condition, has a starting price of €100.000 (around $118,000), and the Leitz Photographica Auction house estimates that it’ll sell for between €200.000 and €250.000 (around $235,000 to $295,000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oYBEe1"&gt;The prototype was produced during the development of the one-off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/8/4816514/jony-ive-leica-camera-pictures-for-charity"&gt;Leica M for (RED)&lt;/a&gt; camera, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/24/5140200/jony-ive-and-marc-newsons-red-charity-auction-raises-26-million"&gt;sold at a charity auction in 2013 for $1.8 million&lt;/a&gt;. While the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/8/4816514/jony-ive-leica-camera-pictures-for-charity"&gt;final product’s design&lt;/a&gt; shared a lot of similarities with Apple’s “cheesegrater” Mac Pro, this prototype appears to have a smooth reflective finish that looks like an absolute fingerprint magnet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;It’s equipped with a Apo-Summicron 2/50 mm ASPH lens.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h0mvHp"&gt;The prototype, which is described as showing the “final development step” of the design process, is equipped with a Apo-Summicron 2/50 mm ASPH lens. There’s no mention of whether it actually functions as a camera, however. Here’s the full description from Leitz Photographica Auction: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="LFicnl"&gt;“A beautifully sculptured aluminium body with a matching Apo-Summicron 2/50 mm ASPH. lens — both showing distinctive features both designers are famous for. Only one finished camera has been made and was sold in an auction in 2013 for an amazing $ 1.8 M! The prototype we have the pleasure to offer shows the final development step when the camera took its final shape after hundreds of prototype parts have been made and tried. It is a beautiful piece of design and a very special opportunity for Leica collectors!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="1c2Zgl"&gt;At the time, Leica said “a total of 561 models and nearly 1000 prototype parts” were made during the camera’s design process. The final Leica M for (RED) camera was sold alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/22/5133178/jony-ive-red-auction-sothebys-photos"&gt;over 40 other items&lt;/a&gt; at the auction, which raised &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/24/5140200/jony-ive-and-marc-newsons-red-charity-auction-raises-26-million"&gt;around $26 million in total&lt;/a&gt; for charity. Newson later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/5/6112035/apple-hires-legendary-designer-marc-newson-to-work-under-jony-ive"&gt;joined Apple to work under Ive&lt;/a&gt; the following year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4os5dN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Boston Dynamics unveils Stretch: a new robot designed to move boxes in warehouses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sjy85u1legXfkC92vCZgKG1Efy0=/0x0:8256x5504/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69041281/BOSTONDYNAMICS_STRETCH_WAREHOUSE_Credit_to_Boston_Dynamics.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stretch is Boston Dynamics’ latest foray into logistics. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Boston Dynamics&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YRuxfH"&gt;Boston Dynamics is best known for its robot dog Spot, a machine designed to work in a range of environments, from offshore oil rigs to deep underground mines. But in recent years, the company has increasingly focused attention on the logistics space, and today is unveiling a new robot with just one application in mind: moving boxes in warehouses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N0uRwo"&gt;The robot is called Stretch and looks relatively dull for a Boston Dynamics creation. It’s not modeled after humans or animals, and instead aims to be as practical as possible. It has a square mobile base containing a set of wheels, a “perception mast” with cameras and other sensors, and a huge robotic arm with seven degrees of freedom and a suction pad array on the end that can grab and move boxes up to 23 kilograms (50 lbs) in weight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ziX70S"&gt;What connects Stretch to other Boston Dynamics machines is a focus on mobility. Usually, when automation equipment is installed in warehouses the system is bolted down in one place with a workflow modeled around it. Stretch, by comparison, is designed to slide into any existing workplace where it could be useful loading or unloading goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Q7m9XE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It all depends what the problem of the day is.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qqHmOh"&gt;“That’s what’s exciting about this system: it can provide automation to environments that don’t have automation infrastructure,” Boston Dynamics’ VP of business development Michael Perry tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “You can take this capability and you can move it into the back of the truck, you can move it into aisles, you can move it next to your conveyors. It all depends what the problem of the day is.”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stretch can run off batteries for eight hours at a time or switch to tethered power. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HzELE7"&gt;This will allow Boston Dynamics to target customers who would otherwise avoid automation as too expensive or time-consuming to integrate, says Perry. Around 80 percent of the world’s warehouses don’t have any automation equipment, giving the company a sizable addressable market. But Stretch doesn’t have a price-tag yet, and it could be that for businesses with low margins, a robot isn’t worth the hassle no matter how mobile it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rdYKot"&gt;Boston Dynamics has been showing interest in the logistics space since 2019 when it &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/industrial-robots/boston-dynamics-warehouse-robots-acquires-kinema-systems"&gt;purchased&lt;/a&gt; Kinema Systems, a company that makes machine vision software for robots in warehouses. It then designed a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/28/18285923/boston-dynamics-handle-robot-updated-box-stacking"&gt;wheeled robot called Handle&lt;/a&gt; that could move boxes using a robotic arm, balancing itself with a huge swinging counterweight like a tail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SPZcf7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Boston Dynamics is bringing mobility to warehouse automation. Watch Stretch - our new case handling robot - move, groove and unload trucks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Read the announcement. &lt;a href="https://t.co/5B7wDDKC38"&gt;https://t.co/5B7wDDKC38&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/i3Dsoz9Tq8"&gt;pic.twitter.com/i3Dsoz9Tq8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Boston Dynamics (@BostonDynamics) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BostonDynamics/status/1376474451404058626?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3uagWe"&gt;Perry says Handle had “the right footprint and right reach” for warehouses, but couldn’t work fast enough. The robot’s arm is directly attached to its main body, meaning the whole machine had to move with each load. Stretch’s arm, by comparison, swivels freely thanks to some clever (and patent-pending) counterweights hidden inside its square base. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4pTwtM"&gt;“That’s really the secret sauce,” says Perry. “That base is able to handle the inertial force of the arm plus the box swinging at a fast weight, without having to rely on a several-thousand kilo steel plate bolted to the floor.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BdLXJwxjla0qXwdcFn1A99PpTFE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22404987/BOSTONDYNAMICS_STRETCH_CONTAINER_Credit_to_Boston_Dynamics.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Boston Dynamics&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stretch’s vacuum grippers mean it can only handle boxes with flat surfaces — limiting its usefulness in certain warehouses. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Xlxa1D"&gt;Stretch’s lineage can be traced back to Boston Dynamics’ two-legged Atlas robot, which is able to balance its weight so smoothly it can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/12/29/22205055/boston-dynamics-robots-spot-atlas-handle-dancing-video"&gt;run, jump, backflip, and more&lt;/a&gt;. “Atlas picking up a box isn’t just about extending the arms and moving them, it’s about coordinating the hips, legs, and torso,” says Perry. “A lot of that same design thinking has gone into Stretch.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T3hYjy"&gt;As a result, Boston Dynamics claims Stretch can move up to 800 cases an hour, a through-put rate that’s comparable to that of a human employee. High-capacity batteries mean Stretch can operate for eight hours at a time before it needs recharging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EP3Nna"&gt;That throughput rate, though, should be treated with skepticism. Putting robots to work in warehouses is incredibly difficult because of the sheer variation in these spaces. Workflows can change on a daily basis as different goods come and go, and what’s often valued is flexibility. The inability of machines to handle these challenges so far is what’s led to an all-or-nothing dynamic in automation. You either remake the entire warehouse so it’s regular enough for machines to understand, or you stick with humans, masters of the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iKcfVr"&gt;Boston Dynamics’ big claim is that Stretch will be able to bridge this divide. The company says the robot can be operated by anyone with just a few hours of training, and that its mobile base means it can slot into spaces designed for humans. Will it work? We’ll only find out once Stretch gets to grips with the job. Boston Dynamics says it’s currently looking for customers to pilot test Stretch, and is aiming for commercial deployment in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Tab A7 Lite leaks with budget looks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UVWsOgJHOLE701KNB4gtm0EtQzM=/318x181:2742x1797/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69041162/6f8ccd30a49e07d1d284f0e190931ac4e283a69c43cdd5908c07826cbb8ff5c0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Tab A7 Lite.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/this-is-the-samsung-galaxy-tab-a7-lite-1616956215-1805701457" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass / Voice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vegfzv"&gt;Images of Samsung’s unannounced Tab A7 Lite tablet have leaked, courtesy of &lt;a href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/this-is-the-samsung-galaxy-tab-a7-lite-1616956215-1805701457"&gt;Evan Blass on&lt;em&gt; Voice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The images show a decidedly budget-looking device, with a single rear camera and no flash. Internally the tablet is said to be running a modest MediaTek Helio P22T processor paired with 3GB of RAM and a 5,100 mAh battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W2EYyz"&gt;The Tab A7 Lite is one of two “Lite” tablets Samsung is expected to launch in June, if a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_h0x0d_/status/1362336000387637252"&gt;February leak from WalkingCat&lt;/a&gt; is to be believed. The other is the Galaxy Tab S7 Lite, which features a bigger 12.4-inch display compared to 8.7-inches on the A7 Lite, according to WalkingCat. &lt;a href="https://www.galaxyclub.nl/nieuws/samsung-brengt-de-galaxy-tab-s7-lite-straks-uit-in-deze-opvallende-kleuren/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GalaxyClub.nl &lt;/em&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt; the S7 Lite may be available with 5G or Wi-Fi-only connectivity, and that it could be powered by a Snapdragon 750G processor with 4GB of RAM. Available colors are said to include pink, green, black, and silver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7DIfsK"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/AJHLIKrOhY"&gt;pic.twitter.com/AJHLIKrOhY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— WalkingCat (@_h0x0d_) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_h0x0d_/status/1362336216310448132?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bIZC7O"&gt;The two Lite tablets follow their full-fat counterparts from last year. Both the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21444688/samsung-galaxy-tab-s7-plus-review"&gt;Tab S7&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22150980/samsung-galaxy-tab-a7-tablet-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Tab A7&lt;/a&gt; benefited from great displays and speakers, making them excellent for general media consumption. While neither were as well-suited to productivity tasks, that might not matter for the upcoming tablets if they’re priced affordably enough.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today I learned BMW charges extra for a ‘don’t blind other people’ software update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rl2rvx7sWJtEwRJcOMCNFr0CHYA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69040045/akrales_170313_1480_A_0336.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y8ardg"&gt;When you typically think of luxury car features, do you envision rich leather seating and extravagant trim? Advanced cruise control and intelligent self-parking? Whatever you’re imagining, I’m betting “dim my headlights so I don’t blind other people” isn’t it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RWPMfS"&gt;But not only has BMW used its “High Beam Assistant” as an upsell &lt;a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/united-kingdom/article/detail/T0013219EN_GB/bmw-announces-night-vision-and-high-beam-assistant?language=en_GB"&gt;for well over a decade&lt;/a&gt;, it’s also charging drivers &lt;em&gt;extra&lt;/em&gt; to unlock the safety feature that’s already built into their cars — by buying it as an over-the-air software update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UegYrJ"&gt;Apparently, this has been going on &lt;a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2019/08/20/video-bmw-introduces-over-the-air-upgrades-for-certain-models/"&gt;for nearly two years&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;em&gt;Car Magazine&lt;/em&gt; editor Jake Groves brought it to my attention for the first time this week in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_jakegroves/status/1374872023596417024"&gt;this viral tweet&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ei3i5G"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;For reference, this is the original pop up message I got on the system - couldn't snap it last night as I was mid-drive. BMW store says it's £160 for "unlimited" use... &lt;a href="https://t.co/zLbkuktEwV"&gt;pic.twitter.com/zLbkuktEwV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jake Groves (@_jakegroves) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_jakegroves/status/1375002783103995904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tjgKwX"&gt;Let’s forget the price for a moment, because that’s not what infuriates me. (In the grand scheme of things, £160 isn’t a huge amount for your average BMW buyer to spend.) It’s that &lt;em&gt;the rest of us&lt;/em&gt; are depending on BMW drivers being such good citizens that they’ll spend their own money to &lt;em&gt;avoid&lt;/em&gt; showing off the power of their blazing headlights, all because a car company locked a perfectly good public safety feature behind a digital paywall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PzYhgu"&gt;Perhaps there should be a law about this? Don’t expect the US to move on that anytime soon, though; a different technology called adaptive beam headlights are &lt;a href="https://www.autoweek.com/news/technology/a34417809/nhtsa-still-hasnt-ruled-on-adaptive-headlights/"&gt;actually still illegal in the United States&lt;/a&gt;, while we wait for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to issue a final decision on whether to even allow them, much less encourage their use. &lt;a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=202004&amp;amp;RIN=2127-AL83"&gt;That ruling&lt;/a&gt; was supposed to come last year. I’ve asked the NHTSA whether there’s been any movement, and I’ll let you know what I hear.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This Microsoft Flight Simulator mod features the cargo ship stuck in the Suez Canal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Suez crisis to trigger losses for Egypt, world trade" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T1bru1jDqRm1uvJvk8GgWSxKYMs=/0x0:8827x5885/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69039405/1231960271.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="obO0yn"&gt;The massive cargo ship Ever Given has been &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/03/28/world/suez-canal-stuck-ship"&gt;stuck for nearly a week in the Suez Canal&lt;/a&gt;, captivating the internet and frustrating the teams responsible for dislodging it and the governments hardest hit by the shutdown of the maritime trade route. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ZzE3Y"&gt;The ship (and its trademark “Evergreen” lettering painted on the side) has become so iconic, in fact, that it’s become a destination within &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, at least for one virtual pilot who appears to have created a mod that places the grounded vessel within the virtual Earth of the game,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/cargo-ship-stuck-suez-canal-shows-microsoft-flight-simulator-fly/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;GeekWire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRyt7i"&gt;Twitter user Mat Velloso shared a video from TikTok, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@donut_enforcement/video/6944600483172551942?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESMgowSX0XeT49TfTRlIDWRxg3g6t2lg9Zihh9bHS2F0VG10uco6J7WK%2F%2FocE%2F4Ec141fbGgA%3D&amp;amp;language=en&amp;amp;preview_pb=0&amp;amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAoH-du_eBDSCPaOby3Ck_T66ABwJ_VscOKDlIeoJLquR5Ror5ty0YSOXNXMEQv34Z&amp;amp;share_item_id=6944600483172551942&amp;amp;share_link_id=7B412BF6-71E3-4D43-9C86-E068D390C32B&amp;amp;timestamp=1616955896&amp;amp;tt_from=copy&amp;amp;u_code=d639892k2h9402&amp;amp;user_id=6687206843449132038&amp;amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;amp;utm_source=copy&amp;amp;source=h5_m"&gt;originally captured and uploaded by user “donut_enforcement,”&lt;/a&gt; showing off the the flyby of the cargo ship to a convincing-sounding pilot narration as the boat sits stuck between the banks of the canal. The scene looks shockingly realistic, which is a testament to the quality of the mod and also just the demanding visuals of &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="a86XVJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Cargo ship stuck in Microsoft Flight Simulator &lt;a href="https://t.co/SczumWI5mD"&gt;pic.twitter.com/SczumWI5mD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mat Velloso (@matvelloso) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/matvelloso/status/1376212622828167171?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J5atmB"&gt;Of course, there’s nothing stopping developer Asobo from updating the game with newer satellite imagery to include the ship for all players — there’s &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/26/satellite-images-of-ship-ever-given-in-suez-canal-shows-work-underway.html"&gt;plenty of such photographs&lt;/a&gt; having been taken over the last six days. But considering the game sources its imagery from Bing Maps and doesn’t always refresh in a timely manner, that means your game won’t have the Ever Given in it unless you’re able to mod it like in the video above. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aRJ2Va"&gt;There is currently &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/egypt-africa-middle-east-suez-canal-d73d015ffde50c3ddcffe4549e97d6ca"&gt;no concrete timeline for freeing the ship&lt;/a&gt; from its unfortunately angled predicament, so it’s certainly possible.  &lt;/p&gt;
