    <title>Teenage Engineering’s OP-1 finally gets USB audio support a decade after it was released</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8Auj3RgIqdnxUGmv555upqZeMW0=/1x0:4095x2729/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69580989/6076a6c4f88c8300047961c1_original.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YEEjEm"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/8/28/3270259/teenage-engineering-op-1-accessories-launch-profile"&gt;Teenage Engineering’s OP-1&lt;/a&gt; has one of the most iconic synthesizers around since it was first released over a decade ago, but the music-making machine is still getting new features: the company just announced its 243rd firmware update that adds USB audio support to the OP-1 for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0VzU4P"&gt;The added feature turns the OP-1 into a full-fledged external audio unit. That means you can directly send audio from an OP-1 to DAW software like Ableton Live, Pro Tools, or Logic Pro on a PC or Mac or mobile versions of those applications on iOS and Android (like Garageband) without having to use any workarounds or hacks. Additionally, you’ll be able to sample and record on the OP-1 directly from a connected USB audio device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XuJsyL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Send audio right to Ableton, no tricks or workarounds required&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="THciGL"&gt;It’s a major addition to the device, which should help make it a lot more useful for creators looking to use their favorite software to put together new tracks and remixes using the OP-1.   Teenage Engineering says it was able to add the new functionality by applying the work it had done in developing a similar USB audio feature for its newer OP-Z synthesizer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2opj77"&gt;The new firmware update (like the previous 242 ones) is free to all OP-1 owners, which is a nice touch to see for such a big update. Additionally, it’ll work on &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; OP-1 units, no matter how old. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EU proposes phasing out new internal combustion cars by 2035</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Exceeding the limit values for nitrogen dioxide in Germany" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_epzRPSLDXqa-wyPLdG2XcmN8XE=/128x0:2899x1847/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69580985/1233240471.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michael Kappeler / picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4Sjai9"&gt;The European Union has &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com./business/retail-consumer/eu-proposes-effective-ban-new-fossil-fuel-car-sales-2035-2021-07-14/"&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; phasing out gas-powered internal combustion engine vehicles by 2035, part of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/14/world/europe/climate-change-carbon-green-new-deal.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;a sweeping new plan&lt;/a&gt; to drastically reduce carbon emissions on the continent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oplpo4"&gt;If passed, the legislation would require a 55 percent cut in overall CO2 emissions from new vehicles by 2030 compared to current levels. As it stands, the EU only currently requires a 37.5 percent cut by 2030 — which is weaker than even the United States is targeting. By 2035, though, the EU proposes a 100 percent cut, effectively banning new gas and even hybrid cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uCCagJ"&gt;The effective ban would be an effective tool for cleaning up air pollution, as passenger cars make up about 12 percent of the total CO2 emissions in the EU. It would also be a big boost to all-electric vehicles, and the companies that have committed the most money to developing them like Volkswagen, which says it wants &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/13/volkswagen-wants-half-of-its-vehicle-sales-to-be-electric-by-2030.html"&gt;half of its total vehicles sold in 2030&lt;/a&gt; to be fully electric. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oPSvOx"&gt;To support the switch to electric, the EU said Wednesday in its proposal that it wants member countries to install public charging stations no more than 60 kilometers (37.3 miles) apart on major roads by 2025. The EU ultimately expects 3.5 million new charging stations by 2030 and 16.3 million by 2050. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4dq42c"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A big buildout of charging infrastructure is also part of the proposal&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OVDdmq"&gt;The proposal, which was developed by the EU’s executive branch, must be approved by the entire 27-country bloc. Some countries have already announced similarly aggressive targets, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287284/ford-electric-vehicles-ev-europe-2030"&gt;handful of automakers&lt;/a&gt; have laid out a roadmap for phasing out new gas-powered vehicles on the continent as well. But there could be resistance. France, for instance, is currently targeting an internal combustion phase-out by 2040 and is &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-12/france-pushes-back-against-eu-banning-combustion-cars-by-2035"&gt;looking for more wiggle room on hybrids&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H0OTS7"&gt;Outside the EU, the United Kingdom has announced plans to ban the sale of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21572312/uk-ban-combustion-engine-vehicles-sale-electric-cars"&gt;new combustion engine cars by 2030&lt;/a&gt;, while California is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452825/california-ban-combustion-gas-vehicles-cars-2035"&gt;looking to do the same by 2035&lt;/a&gt;. The EU’s regulations are particularly important, though, because it is home to many of the world’s biggest automakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AoMgm7"&gt;At the federal level in the United States, President Joe Biden has started to unwind Trump-era decisions to weaken vehicle emissions standards. In April, he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404403/california-tailpipe-standards-epa-transportation-department"&gt;moved to restore California’s power to set its own standards&lt;/a&gt;, and later this year, his administration is expected to set &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/01/climate/biden-electric-cars-tailpipe-emissions.html"&gt;average fuel economy standards of 51 miles per gallon by 2026&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to find and create live videos on TikTok</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qrm2yiI-kFOfKgpQoEtrRb9qkAA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69580942/acastro_200713_1777_tikTok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YJ9iXn"&gt;If you’re just starting to explore TikTok and you want to do a live video (as opposed to the usual recorded TikTok video), I’m afraid I have some bad news for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KSmOSp"&gt;You can’t — at least, not yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qjdXmm"&gt;Unlike Facebook / Instagram, which let anyone create a live video, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/creators/creator-portal/en-us/foundations-for-success/going-live/"&gt;TikTok only makes live videos available&lt;/a&gt; if you’re 16 years old or older and have more than 1,000 followers. Once you qualify, though, it’s a relatively simple process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oeLidK"&gt;But before we go into making a live broadcast, here’s a quick tip on how to find one. Note that, at present, you can only see live feeds from people you are following, so if you are really into live broadcasts, the best thing to do is follow a bunch of people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hn42n6"&gt;To find a live video&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="pxut3B"&gt;Tap the Inbox icon at the bottom of the screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xw5zRT"&gt;Look for the entry that starts with “TikTok: LIVE now:” If there is a current live feed happening, you’ll see it listed here. Otherwise, if you tap on the entry, you’ll see a listing of past live broadcasts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eWag3c"&gt;To gift a favorite creator&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="tsFIb3"&gt;Live videos offer one of the few ways that people can show their appreciation of their favorite TikTok personalities in a practical way. TikTok calls it Live Gifting, and while the process is a little convoluted, it is actually a way to toss a coin to your TikToker (but only if you’re at least 18 years old). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uMWBDD"&gt;Here’s how:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="JfU0R6"&gt;First, you have to purchase some virtual coins. Go to your profile page (by tapping the “Me” icon in the lower-right corner).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JhK51q"&gt;Tap the three lines in the upper-right corner to go to “Settings and privacy.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gpmCDs"&gt;Select “Balance” &amp;gt; “Recharge.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SH1wfM"&gt;Select the number of coins you want to buy. For example, you can purchase 70 coins for 99 cents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uNGZ6P"&gt;Select your payment method (through Google Pay, Apple Pay, a credit card, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can recharge your coin account on your balance sheet." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1EUzSNEWNI3exNkJNlwfndFbh2E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22716882/Screenshot_20210714_092917.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can recharge your coin account on your balance sheet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Choose how many coins you want to buy." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lBmff8yvv7CSqZ7JYHX1CgH3OFI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22716878/Screenshot_20210714_092953.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Choose how many coins you want to buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6jrmU3"&gt;Now, when you are watching a live TikTok video and you like what you see, you can tap the gift icon at the bottom of the screen to select what kind of virtual gift you want to send. (This only works for livestreams, not for recorded content.) Each gift has a different value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="To gift a live creator, tap the “gift” icon on the bottom of the screen." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/riJ41Dfocp3IjKFh1CxRvdJeqmU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22716801/Screenshot_20210713_172047.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;To gift a live creator, tap the “gift” icon on the bottom of the screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Then choose the gift you want to send." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LypEUd3N-6GHoknmi9t0EU6kEDU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22716802/Screenshot_20210713_172306.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Then choose the gift you want to send.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DSTw4y"&gt;What does the creator get? Well, besides good feelings from the virtual gift that just jumped across the screen, the creator does get cold, hard cash — although how much isn’t really clear. &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/legal/virtual-items?lang=en"&gt;According to its description&lt;/a&gt;, TikTok takes your virtual gift and transforms it into what it calls Diamonds. The creator can then exchange those Diamonds for real money. How much? Says TikTok, “The applicable monetary compensation will be calculated by us based on various factors including the number of Diamonds a user has accrued.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PHzkyk"&gt;Want to get in on this? Well, if you’re over 16 and have at least 1,000 followers, here’s how to begin a livestream on TikTok:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BJ7eRA"&gt;How to go live&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="nLlBso"&gt;Tap on the plus sign at the bottom of the screen (the same one you always do to start a new video).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4ugq4L"&gt;Below the record button, where it usually just says “Camera” and “Templates,” you’ll also have a new label that says “Live.” Tap it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NEm1cb"&gt;On the top of the screen, you can now add a description and a cover photo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Gwl7u2"&gt;Tap the big “Go Live” button. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="ivgut0"&gt;And you’re there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V3477P"&gt;According to TikTok, if you tap the three dots during your broadcast, you can change several visual settings and filter comments. (And since you’re live, you can also answer comments during the broadcast.) You can also add up to 20 moderators if things start to get busy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GUIVRy"&gt;How to check your Diamonds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="uw0HCG"&gt;If you want to see how many gifts you’ve gotten during your live feed, then you just go to the same place you’d buy virtual coins:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="M2NZpK"&gt;Tap the three lines in the upper-right corner to go to “Settings and privacy” &amp;gt; “Balance.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SzBLQo"&gt;Tap “LIVE Gifts” to see how many Diamonds you got today, how many you have in total, and how much actual cash is in your balance. You can withdraw cash by tapping on the “Withdraw” button at the bottom of the screen. Tap on the icon in the upper right corner to see your total earnings and how much you’ve withdrawn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="UkzZ7o"&gt;If you’re serious about your TikTok feeds, then going live is a great way to interact with your fans and friends and to encourage them to check out your recorded videos. And who knows? You may find yourself with a few virtual gifts to boot.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is changing the way it buys renewable energy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Helen Kendrick of SunPower Corp. walks alongside SunPower Co" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O_ukEuTk8fd9fM3ZtvVEO4V94Ig=/3x0:2961x1972/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69580797/94619674.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Solar panels that were installed on four buildings on the Microsoft Corp. campus in Mountain View, California, Wednesday, April 25, 2007.&amp;nbsp; | Photo by Tony Avelar/Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hCwEiw"&gt;With a new strategy for how it purchases renewable energy, Microsoft hopes to push electricity grids to get clean. The tech giant is now focused on making a local impact in the places where it operates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LYNkCE"&gt;Since 2012, the company has purchased enough renewable energy to match how much juice it uses to power its operations globally. But Microsoft isn’t actually running on renewables 100 percent of the time. All of those&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;clean energy purchases don’t necessarily connect&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to the same electricity grids that the company is plugged into. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fIYNw7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Clean energy purchases don’t necessarily connect&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to the same electricity grids that the company is plugged into&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bkXG8G"&gt;That could change if Microsoft is successful in its new goal. By 2030, it wants to make sure that its clean energy purchases are actually feeding into the local grids where it operates. The move is part of a broader push within tech and environmental advocacy to ensure that big energy guzzlers help phase out dirty fossil fuels wherever they work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZU9jaW"&gt;“[In 2012], we were like a kid building with those big chunky wooden blocks. The tools and the resources we had were somewhat rudimentary,” says Brian Janous, general manager of energy at Microsoft. But those building blocks are evolving, Janous says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VhjL9D"&gt;The company has pledged to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254483/microsoft-climate-change-pledge-update-carbon-dioxide-removal"&gt;carbon negative by 2030&lt;/a&gt;, meaning it plans to capture and store more carbon dioxide than it emits. The carbon removal technology necessary to achieve that goal doesn’t exist at scale yet, but Microsoft is funneling money toward its development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dBbVCp"&gt;Using less electricity in the first place will be a key part to achieving Microsoft’s climate aims. As part of that effort, the company has tried submerging its servers in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436746/microsoft-project-natick-data-center-server-underwater-cooling-reliability"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/6/22369609/microsoft-server-cooling-liquid-immersion-cloud-racks-data-centers"&gt;liquid baths&lt;/a&gt; to make them more energy-efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fxY65c"&gt;When it comes to using renewable energy, Microsoft and other companies with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254483/microsoft-climate-change-pledge-update-carbon-dioxide-removal"&gt;goals to tackle climate change&lt;/a&gt; were limited to how much renewable energy electricity grids could provide them. In the US, renewable energy still only makes up about 20 percent of the electricity mix. So companies like Microsoft, Apple, and Facebook often rely on Renewable Energy Credits to show that they’re funneling money to renewable projects elsewhere, which help offset some of their greenhouse gas emissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="b2gVVx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Every hour of every day, we need zero carbon resources being generated.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6EwSIc"&gt;Moving forward, that won’t be enough for Microsoft to fulfill its new climate target. To get enough locally generated renewable energy, the company is starting to change its power purchase agreements to demand more of its energy suppliers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XKlHzQ"&gt;“What we’re moving towards is a model where we’re really working with our providers to say, ‘Look, we have this goal and we’re putting out this goal publicly.’ Every hour of every day, we need zero carbon resources being generated,” Janous tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DY4C6o"&gt;Microsoft is now one of the largest corporate buyers of renewable energy in the world, but it isn’t alone in its new emphasis on local impact. Adobe, Google, Hewlett Packard, and several environmental groups sent a &lt;a href="https://www.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Federal-Higher-Impact-Carbon-Free-Electricity-Procurement-Memo.pdf?utm_source=newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosgenerate&amp;amp;stream=top"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; to the Biden administration in March advocating for policies that support what they call “higher-impact electricity procurement.” That’s a similar model of sourcing renewable energy from nearby sources on a 24/7 basis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YKafUp"&gt;Google set a &lt;a href="https://sustainability.google/progress/energy/"&gt;goal&lt;/a&gt; last year of running on clean electricity around the clock by 2030. On an even broader scale,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;President Biden has set a goal of getting US electricity grids to run on 100 percent clean energy by 2035.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The new Razer Blade 17 packs more GPU power into the same slim chassis</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/98LZKPa-0OJBntUZxzS43-CYDB8=/0x0:1504x1003/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69580790/Razer_Blade__D17_7___2021__Lifestyle_Shoot_4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f2wW2p"&gt;Razer’s largest laptop is getting big upgrades. The new mid-2021 refresh of the Blade 17 will add newer CPUs, higher-powered GPUs, and an updated webcam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l8gU4b"&gt;The new Blade 17, which drops the “Pro” designation of earlier models, catches the larger laptop up to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22428604/razer-blade-15-gaming-laptop-mid-2021-intel-h-series-nvidia-rtx-3080-thin-15-inch-specs"&gt;Blade 15 Advanced&lt;/a&gt; released earlier this year. It now comes equipped with the same &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22423545/intel-tiger-lake-h-mobile-processors-11th-gen-laptops"&gt;Intel 11th Gen H-Series processors&lt;/a&gt;, with a choice of the Core i7 11800H (2.3GHz base clock, 4.6GHz boost clock), or the top-tier Core i9 11900H (2.5GHz base, 4.9GHz boost), which isn’t available on Razer’s smaller models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vxaTkt"&gt;The laptop also features GPUs from Nvidia’s latest RTX lineup, including the 3060, 3070, and the 3080, with up to 16GB of video memory. Crucially, Razer has increased the Blade 17’s GPUs’ total graphics power to 130 watts, up from the &lt;a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Blade-15-Advanced-RTX-3080-TGP-95-W-beats-RTX-2080-Super-Max-Q-TGP-95-W.537439.0.html"&gt;95 watts&lt;/a&gt; of the Blade 15 Advanced. That additional power means more heat generated, which might be mitigated in part by the Blade 17’s larger chassis. But we can’t say for sure whether heat will be an issue until a full test of the laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jkeZPz"&gt;Speaking of the laptop’s size, it stays the same with dimensions of 0.78 inches (19.99mm) x 15.5 inches (395mm) x 10.24 inches (260mm) and weighs 6.06 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y1bvSwstEIT8nnpnc_SPQJgJtBE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22714938/Blade_17__2021__UHD_Render__3_.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Blade 17.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="E1C2T4"&gt;Razer has built the Blade 17’s RAM and storage drives to be user-upgradeable. The laptop ships with a 1TB PCIe NVME drive, with an extra M.2 slot for expanded storage, and up to 32GB of RAM. The motherboard supports up to 32GB of RAM and 2TB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o8fMU9"&gt;The Blade 17’s display options range from a 1440p display with a 165Hz refresh rate to a 1080p resolution with a quicker 360Hz refresh. One variant of the Blade 17 also packs a 4K touch display, though it only has a refresh rate of 120Hz. The sweet spot for most people is probably the 1440p model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xR6f9W"&gt;Some of the new features that round out the Blade 17 are the addition of anti-fingerprint coating previously added to the Blade 15 Advanced as well as an upgraded 1080p webcam with Windows Hello. The speaker system has also been upgraded, now with two speakers on each side of the laptop instead of just one.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3w87zyzX0674pgfzO9t7JeuEH7E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22714944/Razer_Blade__D17_7___2021__Lifestyle_Shoot_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="M9D05y"&gt;The Blade 17 will charge through USB-C at 100W and will ship with Razer’s standard 230W charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7f3ln0"&gt;There are also upgrades to the Blade 15 Base model as well, including the option of an i7-11800H processor and two PCIe 4.0 SSD slots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wWkTC7"&gt;You can preorder the Blade 17 and Blade 15 starting today, and Razer expects the laptops to ship in July–August.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft puts PCs in the cloud with Windows 365</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1MJxL7uNhcfQiiLoAbhIW6H0hEo=/30x0:930x600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69580792/windows365.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4xzS5c"&gt;Microsoft is putting Windows in the cloud. Windows 365 is a new service that will let businesses access Cloud PCs from anywhere, streaming a version of Windows 10 or Windows 11 in a web browser. While virtualization and remote access to PCs has existed for more than a decade, Microsoft is betting on Windows 365 to offer Cloud PCs to businesses just as they shift toward a mix of office and remote work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A1naOU"&gt;Windows 365 will work on any modern web browser or through Microsoft’s Remote Desktop app, allowing users to access their Cloud PC from a variety of devices. “Windows 365 provides an instant-on boot experience,” according to Wangui McKelvey, a general manager for Microsoft 365. This instant access lets workers stream their Windows session with all of their same apps, tools, data, and settings across Macs, iPads, Linux machines, and Android devices. “You can pick up right where you left off, because the state of your Cloud PC remains the same, even when you switch devices,” explains McKelvey.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D98Md45TfMYubBLAPoFCerUGy-Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22716693/windows365web.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 365 streams Windows to a web browser.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jceXwr"&gt;Windows 365 will only be available for businesses when it launches on August 2nd, with a per-user monthly subscription cost. Microsoft is not detailing exact pricing details until the service launches next month, but Windows 365 is designed for one-person businesses all the way up to enterprises with thousands of employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SYdHAL"&gt;There will be two editions of Windows 365: Business and Enterprise. Both are powered by Azure Virtual Desktop, and individual Cloud PCs can be configured with a single CPU, 2GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage at the low-end, all the way up to eight CPUs, 32GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage. Microsoft is offering 12 different configurations for both Windows 365 Business and Enterprise, and businesses will be able to scale processing power so there will be lots of options to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IMkrCI"&gt;Technically, Microsoft offering Windows in the cloud isn’t much different to the myriad of choices that businesses could already opt for with virtualization right now. Microsoft has already offered similar technology with Azure Virtual Desktop, and Citrix has been offering cloud-hosted desktop PCs for years. Where Microsoft is trying to differentiate is in both ease of use and management. “Windows 365 is really going to make a huge difference for organizations that wanted to try virtualization for various reasons but could not — maybe it was too costly, too complex or they didn’t have the expertise in house to do it,” says McKelvey.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xcFKhsU9JB2OYIXt1AggC8Q1quQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22716703/windows365management.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Businesses can create Cloud PCs within minutes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ry7L6v"&gt;Businesses will be able to create Cloud PCs within minutes and assign them to employees, avoiding the need for dedicated physical hardware. That could be appealing for many businesses hiring remote workers or even temporary contract staff that need to securely access a corporate network. As your entire Windows PC is in the cloud, employees don’t need to navigate VPNs or worry about security on personal devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aVdIBQ"&gt;While Windows 365 seems perfectly timed for businesses looking to tackle the complexities of remote work, Microsoft has been working on the service for years. The operating systems group at Microsoft had been working on a project codenamed “Arcadia,” a service to stream video games from the cloud. Arcadia dates all the way back to Microsoft demonstrating &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/26/4774418/microsoft-demonstrates-halo-4-streaming-from-the-cloud-to-windows-and"&gt;Halo running on a Windows Phone in 2013&lt;/a&gt;. This early virtualization work eventually led to Windows 365 and a focus on making it consumer-friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kZhYlv"&gt;“When we built this team, we brought in a couple of leaders who had experience with virtualization, but for the most part we brought in people who had experience with Windows and experience with consumer experiences because that was the bar we wanted to set,” says Scott Manchester, director of program management for Windows 365.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zTONjxrY9lwV6QOCTXbe8ts1amQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22716695/windows365ui.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 365 is designed to be easy to use for businesses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="I2lboO"&gt;The pandemic accelerated work on Windows 365, and Microsoft’s broader focus on hybrid work. Microsoft has been steadily improving Microsoft Teams over the past year and laying out its vision for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447048/microsoft-teams-future-meetings-features"&gt;future of meetings&lt;/a&gt;, remote work, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K6idKl"&gt;While Windows 365 is only for businesses right now, it’s easy to imagine a future where Microsoft could offer more powerful PC computing to consumers directly in a browser. A startup called Mighty is offering a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22408818/mighty-browser-chrome-cloud-streaming-web"&gt;$30-a-month web browser that lives in the cloud&lt;/a&gt;, designed to offer a better web experience on older laptops and PCs. Windows 365 might just be the first significant step toward a future where you don’t need a dedicated Windows PC to use Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook says FTC chair shouldn’t help decide the future of its antitrust case</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Senate Commerce Committee Considers Nominees For NASA Administrator And Federal Trade Commissioner" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z635KtxZuFfo9VbGWOF2PeuFzCA=/0x0:5324x3549/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69580701/1232438844.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Saul Loeb-Pool/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PjAfPL"&gt;Facebook has asked recently confirmed Federal Trade Commission chair Lina Khan to recuse herself from the agency’s antitrust fight against Facebook, claiming her previous criticism of the company disqualifies her from fairly judging its conduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GqS4Fv"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-seeks-recusal-of-ftc-chairwoman-in-antitrust-case-11626267605?mod=djemalertNEWS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; first reported&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Facebook-Inc.s-Petition-to-Recuse-Chair-Khan.pdf"&gt;Facebook’s petition&lt;/a&gt;, which was filed with the FTC today. In the petition, Facebook attorneys write that “Chair Khan has consistently and very publicly concluded that Facebook is guilty of violating the antitrust laws. She has built her career, in large part, by singling out Facebook as a professed antitrust violator.” Facebook cites Khan’s previous anti-monopoly work at the nonprofit Open Markets Institute, her contribution to a congressional antitrust investigation, and her popular and academic writings about tech industry monopolies, as well as her tweets, which include praise for FTC antitrust enforcement against Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="coly0P"&gt;The petition claims that Khan has “prejudged Facebook’s alleged antitrust liability” by supporting the FTC’s earlier enforcement actions and by conducting academic and congressional investigations where she concluded Facebook had monopoly power. Khan’s opinions have been unusually high-profile, but it is not unusual for government officials to have worked in advocacy positions or expressed opinions on their subjects of expertise, and it’s rare for a confirmed appointee to be disqualified on that basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4z6QlZ"&gt;Facebook is following a playbook set by Amazon, which also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557456/amazon-lina-khan-recusal-petition-federal-trade-commission-antitrust"&gt;asked Khan to recuse herself&lt;/a&gt; from potential Amazon proceedings. (“Facebook agrees with Amazon’s arguments concerning the circumstances where a commissioner’s prior statements require recusal and incorporates those legal arguments,” the petition notes.) But Facebook facing an even more immediate risk: last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554476/ftc-facebook-instagram-antitrust-case-whatsapp-federal-court"&gt;a judge threw out&lt;/a&gt; a federal antitrust lawsuit against Facebook and gave the FTC until July 29th to amend and refile it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oCwJBB"&gt;Khan &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22527709/lina-khan-ftc-commissioner-competition-facebook-amazon-google-apple"&gt;joined the FTC shortly&lt;/a&gt; before the Facebook case was dismissed, and, as chair, she could play a pivotal role in deciding its future. Facebook wants Khan to refrain from “participating in any decisions concerning whether and how to continue the FTC’s antitrust case against the company.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g5HnCH"&gt;Recusal petitions against FTC commissioners are not commonly granted, and Khan was confirmed largely because of bipartisan support for her sharp and public criticism of tech companies. She has not indicated plans to recuse herself from cases involving Amazon — and it seems unlikely that she’ll do so with Facebook either.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Taking NYC’s temperature with a thermal camera  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jQyS8F_dSgLXIhBkJ1gYFE3GDFc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69580521/Container.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The urban heat island effect can be deadly&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="kFe2DF"&gt;Cities around the world are running a fever. City-dwellers suffer through more sweltering temperatures in the summertime than people who live in greener areas nearby. It’s a dangerous consequence of living in what scientists call an “urban heat island.” What’s worse is that the urban heat island effect makes some neighborhoods within a city, usually those with more low-income residents and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22452777/hot-summer-weather-race-urban-heat-island-us-cities"&gt;people of color&lt;/a&gt;, even hotter than others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q5dp5X"&gt;The problem is that cities were built in a way that traps heat. Satellites can see this phenomenon from space. Scientists working with NASA have used satellite data to &lt;a href="https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/?v=-79.55102734375,37.83409079743424,-68.34497265625,43.78350920256575&amp;amp;l=MODIS_Terra_Land_Surface_Temp_Day,Reference_Labels_15m(hidden),Reference_Features_15m(hidden),Coastlines_15m,VIIRS_NOAA20_CorrectedReflectance_TrueColor(hidden),VIIRS_SNPP_CorrectedReflectance_TrueColor(hidden),MODIS_Aqua_CorrectedReflectance_TrueColor(hidden)&amp;amp;lg=true&amp;amp;s=-73.948,40.8088&amp;amp;t=2021-06-17-T22%3A37%3A24Z"&gt;map changes in surface temperatures&lt;/a&gt; from suburbs to cities, and from affluent neighborhoods to communities that have received less investment over time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="unJDlj"&gt;Taking cities’ temperatures and finding ways to cool them down is a matter of life and death. Extreme heat has killed &lt;a href="https://www.weather.gov/hazstat/"&gt;more people on average each year&lt;/a&gt; in the US than any other weather-related event over the past 30 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9A79Lm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; hit the streets of New York City with thermal cameras to see if we could find our own evidence of the urban heat island effect. We were pretty shocked to see just how bad it was in the Big Apple. To see for yourself, check out our video above. You can also see our data in the map below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="R4DpKZ"&gt;&lt;div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/6535514"&gt;&lt;script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yIuwtC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The map above shows which neighborhoods in New York City are considered the most “&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/HeatHub/hvi.html#jumpto"&gt;&lt;em&gt;heat-vulnerable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.” In heat-vulnerable East Harlem, The Verge documented average land surface temperatures reaching as high as 110 degrees Fahrenheit. That was more than 20 degrees hotter than readings we took in the affluent Upper East Side. The Verge took these readings with a thermal camera on June 24, 2021, when air temperatures at the nearest NOAA weather station in Central Park only reached a high of 77 degrees.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TVA TemPad review: who needs TikTok when you can control time and space?</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Loki’s signature gadget, reviewed&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="Jz0XaO"&gt;As time goes on, mobile devices have grown ever more powerful in their function: what were once simple communication devices or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/11/21/18105423/ipod-click-wheel-button-music-control-hardware-design"&gt;multimedia players&lt;/a&gt; have turned into tiny &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;pocket-sized supercomputers&lt;/a&gt; that are jam-packed with features. And nothing exemplifies this trend more than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22574400/loki-retro-hardware-tempad-kasra-farahani-interview-marvel-disney-plus"&gt;TVA TemPad&lt;/a&gt;, which packs in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523186/loki-review-episode-1-2-disney-plus"&gt;temporal tracking and manipulation abilities&lt;/a&gt; that give the most ordinary of owners powers that surpass &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18513309/avengers-endgame-spoiler-free-review-marvel-cinematic-universe-iron-man-thor-captain-america-phase-4"&gt;even the mightiest of heroes&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside id="g2U87g"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How Loki built a different reality with retro hardware","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22574400/loki-retro-hardware-tempad-kasra-farahani-interview-marvel-disney-plus"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="gzkGC9"&gt;Unlike most modern devices, the TemPad aims for an almost retro-futuristic design. Despite featuring dual displays on both the exterior and interior of the device, the TemPad itself is clad in a warm wood and brass finish that’s reminiscent of a simpler time. Broadly speaking, the TemPad harkens back to a pre-iPhone era: the external touchscreen, matched with an internal display and physical keys, brings to mind older devices like 2007’s LG Voyager and a time before blank, featureless touchscreen slates dominated the market. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C0EaK3YQWXR5tgKLyFZLyeaLXC8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22716031/Screen_Shot_2021_07_13_at_4.25.53_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qEdagF"&gt;Instead of a full QWERTY keyboard, though, the TemPad only offers a doubled numpad, along with an oddly shaped D-pad and a dedicated Miss Minutes button. But the TemPad is primarily controlled through the spherical black control surface, which works as a tappable button with additional gestures. A cutout in the top display also cleverly allows it to be used when the device is closed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="npnaIm"&gt;The TemPad puts that external display to good use, both for showing its standard suite of apps (like those used to track branching nexus events and the shattering of time and space) as well as a Galaxy Note-esque memo feature that allows for quick doodling on the external touchscreen. Notably, the TemPad also offers the ability to automatically animate and then project those drawings as 3D holograms, a decidedly unique feature compared to most other mobile hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SAKhgnYQfTYVjp_VlXEyd4NVqFw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22716032/Screen_Shot_2021_07_13_at_4.01.07_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F8MSEGBX-UpwlvMgcgGx9N5inXQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22716034/Screen_Shot_2021_07_13_at_4.01.46_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WkclY0"&gt;The TemPad hardware also offers you a wide variety of storage options: the device can be simply pocketed, of course, but the TVA also offers both a belt-mounted and a clever wrist-mounted case option for keeping your pad close at all times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Q6ujm"&gt;The flagship feature on the TemPad is its ability to create Timedoors, glowing orange doors that let you traverse the boundless realm of space and time, hopping between timelines and alternate realities more or less at will. It’s an incredibly useful feature, one that helps make up for the TemPad’s limited application support, lack of an App Store, and poor hardware design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;
&lt;aside id="AHS1eM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Battery life on the TemPad leaves much to be desired&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MGYeUDELsCfkwQRhdDRasiN5KzY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22716038/Screen_Shot_2021_07_13_at_4.14.40_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EPexDi"&gt;Battery life on the TemPad also leaves much to be desired. Timedoors, in particular, use up a lot of power, leaving one at risk of getting stranded in all manner of unfortunate locations. Exacerbating this is the fact that recharging a pad is also extremely difficult — requiring something akin to “the power source to a civilization’s only hope” to power it back up again, a markedly more difficult task than finding a USB-C brick with high enough wattage to support fast-charging on most devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WKbJeB"&gt;Like many mobile devices, the TemPad features a smart digital assistant, Miss Minutes, which works across a variety of TVA technologies and devices. Unlike Siri or Bixby, though, Miss Minutes is a semi-sentient artificial intelligence, capable of responding intelligently to queries. Miss Minutes is used to help compensate for some of the TemPad’s limitations, offering a way to look up older records without resorting to tedious text inputs. Tasks occasionally take longer than usual, however, as the assistant has been known to have her own plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1F6rFd"&gt;Perhaps the biggest flaw in the TemPad is its decidedly low-resolution display technology. While most phones and laptops opt for colorful LCDs or vibrant OLED panels, the TemPad features a rather uninspired two-tone orange-on-black display. Text is chunky, images are rendered at a frustratingly low resolution, and maps for tracking variants are vague 2D outlines. Video playback, while possible, leaves much to be desired, requiring that you zoom in on portions of a video just to be able to discern identifiable features in some cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G7XkDdlhX3QOtHqtcGkeIgQEGLY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22716039/Screen_Shot_2021_07_13_at_4.08.32_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CrZjc91NTuIc8oZw64Hm9hawIrM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22716037/Screen_Shot_2021_07_13_at_4.05.26_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QUw3ts"&gt;The TemPad is also unfortunately fragile for a mobile device, with at least one device shattering into a spark- and smoke-spewing pile after a rough fall. Given the active intended audience for the TemPad, a little more rugged durability would be nice to see on future models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QodA15"&gt;Continuing its throwback design, the TemPad’s UI resembles that of an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_1000"&gt;early Palm OS&lt;/a&gt; (a similarity that’s only exacerbated by the low-resolution, two-tone display). The home screen only displays four apps at once; the default offerings include the flagship Timedoor application, Settings, Directory, and the Miss Minutes assistant. The UI is occasionally difficult to manage, though, making it easy for you to accidentally open Timedoors to undesired locations when not taking the proper care to select a destination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nzexfl"&gt;Another misstep with the TemPad is the heavy reliance on enterprise-level software. While the ability to track timeline variants and analyze the impact of branching nexus events is no doubt useful to TVA agents and judges, the average consumer isn’t going to get much use out of those features. More conventional contact and mapping applications would go a long way toward making the TemPad a more useful day-to-day device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qgAIgv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10650974"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="PeL0Rx"&gt;Another issue with the TemPad is availability: right now, the device is only accessible by TVA agents who have been kidnapped by a nefarious organization and brainwashed to enforce a single instance of reality, mercilessly pruning anyone or anything that stands in the way of that goal. It’s a decidedly steep price to have to pay for the hardware, especially given that it still can’t play TikTok videos. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon is crowdfunding these Diane von Furstenberg Echo Dots</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The ‘Midnight Kiss’ Diane von Furstenberg Echo Dot." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QgVuo9_-wsDdvjnGTgIxm_u9lJU=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69580196/Midnight_Kiss_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wJRL0u"&gt;Amazon is launching the next line of products for its Build It crowdfunding platform. The company has collaborated with fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg on a range of Echo Dot smart speakers that’ll only go on sale if enough people pre-order them within 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nerclG"&gt;That’s by no means a given. Amazon launched the Build It program earlier this year with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22286662/amazon-alexa-cuckoo-clock-build-it-program-preorder"&gt;three Alexa-powered devices&lt;/a&gt; — a nutrition scale, a cuckoo clock, and a sticky note printer — and only the last of those reached its goal in time. Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08SPBLN1C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently estimates&lt;/a&gt; that the Smart Sticky Note Printer will ship between July and September, but if you didn’t get in on the Build It campaign, you can’t pre-order it right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dn1I2F"&gt;The Echo Dot x Diane von Furstenberg range comes in three variations: &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/EchoDotMidnightKiss"&gt;Midnight Kiss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/EchoDotIkat"&gt;Ikat&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/EchoDotTwigs"&gt;Twigs&lt;/a&gt;. They all have a “special promo price” of $59.99 each, which is $10 more than a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;regular fourth-gen Dot&lt;/a&gt; or the same price as the cute panda and tiger Kids Edition model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Hgjri"&gt;Here’s the full collection:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fTsPvwTusOGLTvVxnHiy8QRbj_0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22714278/Echo_Dot_x_Diane_von_Furstenberg_Logos.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;From left to right: Twigs, Ikat, and Midnight Kiss.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pGGyp2"&gt;Amazon isn’t saying exactly how many people will need to order each model for it to actually get built, but the deadline is August 13th. You’ll only be charged if and when the products ship out. &lt;/p&gt;
