    <title>Netflix is turning viral Thanksgiving Mom tweet into a movie</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7XsBiG"&gt;Five years after Jamal Hinton secured himself a seat at Wanda Dench’s thanksgiving dinner thanks to a wrong number, their story is being turned into a Netflix feature film, the &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-to-develop-a-feature-film-based-on-the-true-story-of-the-viral"&gt;streaming giant has announced&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;The Thanksgiving Text&lt;/em&gt; will be written by Abdul Williams (&lt;em&gt;The New Edition Story&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Bobby Brown Story&lt;/em&gt;), but&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/thanksgiving-grandma-wrong-text-netflix-movie-1235124198/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that a cast or director are yet to be announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V7FgGO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Thanksgiving Text&lt;/em&gt; is the latest example of a film drawing inspiration from viral online content. Perhaps most notably, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/28/21082396/zola-thestory-viral-twitter-thread-film-review-sundance-2020"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zola&lt;/em&gt; turned viral Twitter thread #TheStory&lt;/a&gt; into a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/28/21082396/zola-thestory-viral-twitter-thread-film-review-sundance-2020"&gt;surprisingly good&lt;/a&gt; feature-length movie. This &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/9-movies-that-were-greenlit-because-something-went-vira-1719922611"&gt;2015 article from &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has plenty of other examples, including &lt;em&gt;Bad Ass&lt;/em&gt;, a film loosely based on the viral video “&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_Transit_Bus_fight"&gt;AC Transit Bus Fight&lt;/a&gt;,” and the fact that the original &lt;em&gt;Deadpool&lt;/em&gt; may never have been greenlit if its leaked test footage hadn’t gone viral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vWDMuz"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Somebody grandma is coming in clutch this year!! Ayee!!! &lt;a href="https://t.co/QGrx83nHLl"&gt;pic.twitter.com/QGrx83nHLl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jamal Hinton (@Jamalhinton12) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Jamalhinton12/status/798646484438687744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 15, 2016&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B3H39c"&gt;As ever, &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/thanksgiving-grandma"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Know Your Meme&lt;/em&gt; has the definitive rundown&lt;/a&gt; of Hinton and Dench’s viral story. But the short version is that in 2016, Jamal Hinton posted screenshots of a series of text messages in which Wanda Dench mistakenly invited him to thanksgiving dinner, thinking he was her grandson. “Can I still get a plate tho?” Hinton asked after revealing himself, only for Dench to respond, “Of course you can. That’s what grandma’s do... feed everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="druL3l"&gt;Hinton and Dench have since struck up a friendship and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Jamalhinton12/status/1459982391108202498"&gt;continued to spend Thanksgiving together&lt;/a&gt; in the years since, with Dench now inviting Hinton’s girlfriend and family to the festivities. &lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;notes that the pair have become minor internet celebrities, with over 150,000 followers on Twitter between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNsXSB"&gt;The two welcomed the news of Netflix’s adaptation. “We are excited to share our story with the world,” Dench and Hinton said in a joint statement. “We hope it inspires more people to reach out and make connections that they wouldn’t ordinarily make.  We are so blessed to find a genuine friendship brought together by God from a mistaken text message.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PJd0EB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt; is currently producing a series with Netflix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pokémon Go now runs much smoother on iPhones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pokemon Go" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HxmZAAvywDy4fcTyRFgHsKMdl5c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70222795/jbareham_160711_1134_0119_02.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9BSXK3"&gt;A new update to &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; for iOS lets you run the game at higher frame rates. With version 1.191.0, the “advanced settings” section of the app now includes an option that reads “Unlock your device’s native refresh rate for higher FPS.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OBvPcj"&gt;I tried it out on my iPhone 13 Pro and it makes a huge difference. &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; isn’t the most visually complicated game, of course, but there’s a lot of scrolling and camera movement, and the smoother touch response feels a lot better when you’re lining up a pokéball throw with your finger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PEVyUa"&gt;Here’s how the feature appears in the game’s menu:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8nHW_89zKBQfybEMNL-btA64PvM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23060153/IMG_1041.PNG"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LAgIfC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; was previously locked to 30fps on iOS devices. Many Android phones are already capable of running the game at a higher frame rate, though in my experience testing across several devices the support can be hit and miss. Still, &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; generally ran better on Android until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tlPgzi"&gt;The new iOS feature isn’t limited to the 13 Pro and Pro Max, which are the only iPhones with 120Hz “ProMotion” displays. I also tried it on my old 8 Plus and it’s possible to unlock the frame rate there, too, though the aging A11 processor doesn’t always keep up a steady 60fps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3P1tC"&gt;Niantic isn’t making a big deal out of the feature; it’s switched off by default and it isn’t mentioned in version 1.191.0’s release notes, beyond a vague mention of “various quality-of-life improvements.” It’s possible that enabling it for all users would cause complaints about battery life, considering that &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; is already a pretty heavy app in that regard. But if that’s not a concern for you, it’s worth giving the option a try.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The next N64 game for Nintendo Switch Online is Paper Mario</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hkudsv4xUNAMOZLg8Ji5hKs4wXs=/38x0:443x270/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70222637/Switch_NSO_Classics_DecUpdate_2021_PM_SCRN_02.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="J5kujB"&gt;Nintendo launched its “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728113/nintendo-switch-online-plus-expansion-pack-price-n64-genesis-animal-crossing"&gt;Expansion Pack&lt;/a&gt;” for the Switch Online service back in October, which brought Sega Genesis and Nintendo 64 games to the library of playable retro titles. The first new addition has now been announced, and it’s just one game: &lt;em&gt;Paper Mario&lt;/em&gt;. It’ll be available on December 10th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XLNGiM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paper Mario&lt;/em&gt; was released for the N64 in 2000 and was the first entry in what became a popular spin-off series featuring Mario characters and RPG-style turn-based combat. The most recent game, &lt;em&gt;Paper Mario: The Origami King&lt;/em&gt;, came out on the Switch last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="P0YUOI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Paper Mario: The Origami King is a laugh-out-loud funny RPG on the Switch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21324614/paper-mario-the-origami-king-review-nintendo-switch"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="u17UoS"&gt;The launch of Nintendo’s Expansion Pack was somewhat contentious. The $49.99 annual fee does also include a big &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; expansion, but it’s still a big hike over the regular $29.99 service that includes NES and SNES games, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746897/nintendo-switch-online-n64-emulation-quality-bad"&gt;quality of the N64 emulation&lt;/a&gt; has also come under scrutiny. While &lt;em&gt;Paper Mario&lt;/em&gt; is a popular game, adding just one release at a time isn’t likely to change many people’s opinion of the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AwqIAV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paper Mario &lt;/em&gt;is one of a list of upcoming N64 games that Nintendo has already confirmed to be on the way. Others include &lt;em&gt;Banjo-Kazooie&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Snap&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google will wait until the new year to make more return to office plans</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IwFkWeZXQOiE_X-82ZXA096OIJE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70221858/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e2KSsa"&gt;Google is reconsidering its return-to-office plans again, saying that its US employees won’t have to adopt a hybrid work model come January 10th, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650639/google-mandatory-return-january-2022-remote-work"&gt;as was previously indicated&lt;/a&gt;. A Google spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company’s current plan is to hold off on coming up with new plans until next year, with decisions regarding timelines still being left up to local offices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cQSa35"&gt;The company has changed its return to work plans several times as the pandemic evolved. In August, when the delta variant was a growing concern, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650639/google-mandatory-return-january-2022-remote-work"&gt;we learned&lt;/a&gt; that the company intended to keep in-office work voluntary until at least January 10th, 2022. That plan itself was a change from a previous one that was revealed in December 2020, which would have had employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22175150/google-return-office-september-flexible-work-week-coronavirus-pandemic-sundar-pichai"&gt;returning in September&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zsZbxO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As COVID has changed, so have company’s plans to bring employees back&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hBBe19"&gt;According to an email from Google VP Chris Rackow, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/02/google-workers-in-us-wont-return-to-office-as-expected-on-jan-10.html"&gt;obtained by CNBC&lt;/a&gt;, the company reiterated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650639/google-mandatory-return-january-2022-remote-work"&gt;a promise from August&lt;/a&gt; that full-time employees will be given a 30-day period to transition from working remotely to working in the office when the company does start to bring them back in. Google says it’s still intending to go with the hybrid workweek model that &lt;a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/life-at-google/hybrid-approach-work/"&gt;CEO Sundar Pichai outlined in May&lt;/a&gt;, where “most Googlers” will work three days in the office and two days remote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZsIPhY"&gt;The spokesperson also told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company has opened 90 percent of its US offices open for employees to come in on a voluntary basis. CNBC says Google is encouraging employees to come in “to reconnect with colleagues in person and start regaining the muscle memory of being in the office more regularly.” Whether this will continue to be possible remains to be seen and will likely be dictated by the US’s response as more cases of &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/coronavirus-covid19/22813896/omicron-covid-variant-cases-hospitalizations-vaccines"&gt;the omicron variant&lt;/a&gt; of the coronavirus continue to pop up. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Someone stole $120 million in crypto by hacking a DeFi website</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b98pZzeFq76X39-nlsKa2cyqTYY=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70222064/acastro_170726_1777_0007_v4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BBShhQ"&gt;On Wednesday night, someone drained funds from multiple cryptocurrency wallets connected to the decentralized finance platform BadgerDAO. According to the blockchain security and data analytics Peckshield, which is working with Badger to investigate the heist, the various tokens stolen in the attack are worth about $120 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="nzpUIF"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here is the current whereabouts as well as the total loss: $120.3M (with ~2.1k BTC + 151 ETH)  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BadgerDAO?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@BadgerDAO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/fJ4hJcMWTq"&gt;pic.twitter.com/fJ4hJcMWTq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— PeckShield Inc. (@peckshield) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/peckshield/status/1466356911842856967?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="622ou8"&gt;While the investigation is still ongoing, members of the Badger team have told users that they believe the issue came from someone inserting a malicious script in the UI of their website. For any users who interacted with the site when the script was active, it would intercept Web3 transactions and insert a request to transfer the victim’s tokens to the attacker’s chosen address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eF88vq"&gt;Because of the transparent nature of the transactions, we can see what happened once the attackers pounced. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/peckshield/status/1466294179676372992"&gt;PeckShield&lt;/a&gt; points out &lt;a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x951babdddbfbbba81bbbb7991a959d9815e80cc5d9418d10e692f41541029869"&gt;one transfer&lt;/a&gt; that yanked 896 Bitcoin into the attacker’s coffers, worth more than $50 million. According to the team, the malicious code appeared as early as November 10th, as the attackers ran it at seemingly random intervals to avoid detection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vrW03F"&gt;Decentralized finance (or DeFi) systems rely on blockchain technology to let crypto owners perform more typical finance operations like earning interest via lending. BadgerDAO promises users they can “rest easy knowing you never have to give up the private keys for your crypto, you can withdraw anytime you like, and our strategists are working day and night to put your assets to work.” Its protocol allows people who have Bitcoin to “bridge” their cryptocurrency over to the Ethereum platform via its token and take advantage of DeFi opportunities they otherwise might not have access to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;div id="ZfGr7Z"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;For now, the pause on smart contracts continues in order to prevent further withdrawals. Badger will share further updates as soon as they are available.&lt;/p&gt;— ₿adgerDAO   (@BadgerDAO) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BadgerDAO/status/1466535161709817857?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QHo3st"&gt;Once Badger became aware of the unauthorized transfers, it paused all smart contracts, essentially freezing its platform, and advised users to decline all transactions to the attacker’s addresses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="634tWo"&gt;Thursday night, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BadgerDAO/status/1466535158606086144"&gt;the company said&lt;/a&gt; it has “retained data forensics experts Chainalysis to explore the full scale of the incident &amp;amp; authorities in both the US &amp;amp; Canada have been informed &amp;amp; Badger is cooperating fully with external investigations as well as proceeding with its own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kjGoNH"&gt;One of the things Badger is investigating is how the attacker apparently accessed Cloudflare via an API key that should’ve been protected by two-factor authentication. While the attack didn’t reveal specific flaws within Blockchain tech itself, it managed to exploit the older “web 2.0” technology that most users need to use to perform transactions. Multi-factor authentication systems protect our accounts against many phishing schemes or bulk credential stuffing attacks. Still, experts have &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/10/hacker-kevin-mitnick-shows-how-to-bypass-2fa/"&gt;repeatedly warned about targeted phishing attacks&lt;/a&gt; that can bypass it, while toolkits to automate the process have been available for years. An &lt;a href="https://www.sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/law/centers/cybersecurity/_docs/fbi_cyber_pin/2019/fbi_pin-20190917_multi-factor_authentication.pdf"&gt;FBI notice in 2019&lt;/a&gt; (pdf) called out criminals’ growing capabilities to bypass MFA and suggested changes or training that could make such attacks harder to pull off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="6cIasl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;‘one of the most security minded teams in DeFi’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qFQNsD"&gt;Getting two-factor authentication right can be tricky even within typical financial applications — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/5/5971989/the-internet-doesn-t-care-about-security"&gt;just ask PayPal&lt;/a&gt;. But incidents like this one, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22619272/poly-network-attack-600-million-cryptocurrency-theft-doge-ethereum-binance-return-defi"&gt;the stolen-and-returned $600 million hijack that Poly Network suffered in August&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/2016/6/17/11965192/ethereum-theft-dao-cryptocurrency-million-stolen-bitcoin"&gt;the $53 million heist that hit the first DAO ever&lt;/a&gt; in 2016, are hopefully enough to expand awareness of security beyond protocols and encryption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lg0US5"&gt;One commenter within Badger’s Discord summed up the situation by saying, “All [the] blockchain / smart contract audits in the world, and people lose 120m to a Cloudflare API leak by a sloppy team where a dude passes a new approval to his contract in the site header - GG - we still have a long way to go.” A member of the team said, “I’m sure we will have some mitigation procedures proposed after this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3K1jNo"&gt;What funds can be recovered and how those affected will be made whole is still unknown. But for anyone living in the world of crypto, blockchain, and Web3 apps, it may ultimately be on them to learn how approvals, signing, and transactions really work and keep an eye on them. Particularly when millions of dollars in holdings can disappear in an instant even while managed by “one of the most security minded teams in DeFi,” as Badger refers to itself.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>All 53,000 attendees of Anime NYC urged to get tested after one got Omicron</title>

  &lt;p id="psfhUZ"&gt;Were you one of the 53,000 attendees of the Anime NYC 2021 convention in New York City, or know someone who did? &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nycgov/status/1466473589180403714"&gt;New York City authorities&lt;/a&gt; and Anime NYC organizers &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/animenyc/status/1466549890947895300"&gt;are urging&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;every single attendee&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;exhibitor, artist, and staff member&lt;/em&gt; to get tested for COVID-19 — because one of the United States’ first confirmed cases of the new omicron variant was a man who attended the convention and likely caught it there (via &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/one-of-the-usas-first-omicron-cases-attended-big-anime-1848152747"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YYpdrz"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;If you attended the Anime NYC 2021 Convention at the Javits Center from November 18-22, get tested for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#COVID19&lt;/a&gt; as soon as possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;➡️ &lt;a href="https://t.co/fESkqpcKQo"&gt;https://t.co/fESkqpcKQo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/niI8ENg3ez"&gt;pic.twitter.com/niI8ENg3ez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— City of New York (@nycgov) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nycgov/status/1466473589180403714?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="GMRcBO"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The Anime NYC team was notified today that one of this year’s attendees tested positive for the Omicron variant of COVID-19. According to the Minnesota Department of Health, the attendee developed mild symptoms on November 22, was tested on November 24, and their &amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/AqpJuLIjTQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/AqpJuLIjTQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Anime NYC (@animenyc) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/animenyc/status/1466549890947895300?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FW6jCv"&gt;Omicron is the new coronavirus variant whose first known US case made the news &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-reports-first-case-omicron-variant-2021-12-01/"&gt;only yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, but is now &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/minnesota-omicron-variant-case-rcna6909"&gt;also identified in&lt;/a&gt; California, Minnesota, Colorado and New York State as well, less than a week after &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1201-omicron-variant.html"&gt;being classified by the World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;. Several fully vaccinated people have tested positive. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NYCMayor/status/1466545026587111427"&gt;In a press conference today&lt;/a&gt;, New York governor Kathy Hochul said her state alone now has five confirmed omicron cases, and NYC mayor Bill de Blasio warned New Yorkers that they should assume there’s community spread. Hochul suggested that so far, all the US cases of the omicron variant have been minor, with very light symptoms; the man who attended Anime NYC has reportedly already recovered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QON8gO"&gt;The man is from Minnesota; &lt;a href="https://www.health.state.mn.us/news/pressrel/2021/covid120221.html"&gt;the Minnesota Department of Health says&lt;/a&gt; he had already been vaccinated, and developed mild symptoms the day after the convention. He hadn’t been outside the United States recently, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/02/us/minnesota-omicron-case.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting he may have gotten it at the convention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="um2Shu"&gt;“Anyone who attended the AnimeNYC conference, especially anyone experiencing symptoms, should get tested immediately and take additional precautions including social distancing,” reads part of a statement from de Blasio. “I urge all New Yorkers to get vaccinated, wear a face mask while indoors and in public, and help our city beat this virus once and for all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QfpLyf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Signal launches in-app sustainer program to accept donations from users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/39vzEF8J-SgTiy-5WXQKzeHXAoM=/18x0:2216x1465/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70221818/signal_sustainer.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Signal users can make donations to the company within the app | Signal&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AyMfoF"&gt;Secure messaging app Signal has launched a new feature that allows users to make donations within the app, the company announced. As a nonprofit, Signal doesn’t receive financial support from any advertisers or shareholders, a new &lt;a href="https://signal.org/blog/become-a-signal-sustainer/"&gt;blog post notes&lt;/a&gt;, and relies on users for donations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EK4IPg"&gt;Users can choose to make monthly donations, or one-off contributions within the app using Apple Pay or Google Pay, and their payment information won’t be associated with a user’s Signal account, according to the blog post, as the company will use the same anonymous credential &lt;a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1416.pdf"&gt;scheme&lt;/a&gt; it uses for private Signal groups:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="WKq6HB"&gt;Clients make payments and then associate a badge to their profile such that the server can authenticate the client is in the set of people who made a payment, but doesn’t know specifically which payment it corresponds to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="PFsklb"&gt;Long a popular messaging app for people who want to secure their text messages, earlier this year, Signal began adding some of the more consumer-friendly features that other messaging apps have had for a while, like stickers and wallpapers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fED2bE"&gt;To donate to Signal, users can choose from three different sustainer levels, at $5, $10, or $20, each with its own badge. Sustainer subscriptions will only renew if a customer uses Signal during the course of a month; if you uninstall or stop using the app, the payments will be canceled before the next cycle to “eliminate the ‘dark pattern’ of subscriptions you’ve forgotten about,” the company said. Signal plans to add support for additional payment methods in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This is the Steam Deck’s box</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W48YACM1q0d8ahLg2l6Sxj-PNKA=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70221728/7e80e144f730c0cb160c03beb2a6dfe8ffcd503b.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Steam Deck in its box.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Valve&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="amDoam"&gt;Valve has shared a preview of the Steam Deck’s &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675180/view/3122680206583792325"&gt;final package design&lt;/a&gt; ahead of the handheld gaming PC’s recently delayed launch date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aiyh8J"&gt;Each Steam Deck comes with the console and a carrying case, and Valve revealed in these photos that each device also comes with its own USB-C power supply, meaning you won’t have to source your own like you have to with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514480/apple-iphone-charging-brick-charger-earbuds-box-environmental-impact-carbon-emissions"&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/1/14/22231102/samsung-apple-kill-charging-brick-obituary-eulogy"&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628702/google-pixel-6-charger-not-included"&gt;smartphones&lt;/a&gt;. The box also has a handful of fun Easter eggs for Valve superfans — I’ve spotted a few &lt;em&gt;Portal&lt;/em&gt; references myself. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u-d_J_oaiEapoNRlhZI8KNtFt1E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23059318/5ef112bba136d6c5bcb26f2cc785822b2cb35563.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Steam Deck’s box, closed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hGFstA"&gt;Valve says it’s testing the packaging design, so there could be some changes from what you see in the pictures when the Steam Deck ships next year. The company also says it has completed its design validation manufacturing build of the Steam Deck and that there will be “additional minor changes in the final product.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gPG5e1"&gt;In November, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774888/steam-deck-delayed-two-months-february-2022-launch-shipping"&gt;Valve delayed the Steam Deck’s launch&lt;/a&gt; by two months, from December 2021 to February 2022, due to global supply chain issues. The company revealed a lot of details about the device at a developer summit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22779252/steam-deck-things-we-learned-from-valve-developer-summit"&gt;just a couple days later&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="NH8hVK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Steam Deck: Five big things we learned from Valve’s developer summit","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22779252/steam-deck-things-we-learned-from-valve-developer-summit"},{"title":"Steam Deck launch delayed by two months","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774888/steam-deck-delayed-two-months-february-2022-launch-shipping"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="0LdPwz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction, December 2nd, 6:54PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Valve delayed the Steam Deck’s launch date last month, not this month as we originally stated. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zoom might pay you $25 as part of a class-action settlement</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VVAjQiHR5CBtzU6QiH6AEpSaOds=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70221525/acastro_200331_1777_zoom_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U3ULLP"&gt;Zoom has reached &lt;a href="https://www.zoommeetingsclassaction.com/Content/Documents/Notice.pdf"&gt;a settlement (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; in a class-action lawsuit over alleged privacy and security issues, and if you used the videoconferencing app before July, then you could be eligible to receive money as a result. The company has agreed to pay $85 million while continuing to deny the allegations and any liability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x8TgGt"&gt;There are two groups eligible to file a claim. If you paid for a Zoom Meetings App subscription between March 30th, 2016, and July 30th, 2021, you can file a claim for $25 or 15 percent of what you paid for that subscription (excluding optional add-ons). You’re entitled to whichever is greater. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WIS7YK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The plaintiffs allege Zoom failed to prevent Zoombombing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d5grfY"&gt;The second bucket is much broader. If you aren’t eligible for the first group but you “registered, used, opened, or downloaded the Zoom Meeting App” between March 30th, 2016, and July 30th, 2021, you can file a claim for $15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ImKzq"&gt;However, if you have only used Zoom with an “Enterprise-Level Account” or a government account, you’re excluded from the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V5TDxH"&gt;Claims must be submitted by March 5th, 2022. You can file a claim online &lt;a href="https://www.zoommeetingsclassaction.com/Home/SubmitClaim"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or by mailing a &lt;a href="https://www.zoommeetingsclassaction.com/Content/Documents/Claim%20Form.pdf"&gt;completed claim form&lt;/a&gt;. However, payment amounts “may increase or decrease” depending on how many people submit claims, according to the settlement’s website. The settlement has been preliminarily approved by the court, and a final approval hearing is scheduled for April 7th, 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kSCWf5"&gt;The plaintiffs in the lawsuit allege Zoom shared users’ information with third parties in an unauthorized manner through SDKs and marketplace apps, that it failed to prevent “unwanted meeting disruptions by third parties” (aka “Zoombombing”), and that Zoom misrepresented its end-to-end encryption (which the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21535818/zoom-end-to-end-encryption-e2ee-security-privacy-video-conferencing"&gt;has since fixed&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLjcArAq4sGebo8JT2J9VP6QFsQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Product Red edition of the Series 6 has often recieved the biggest discounts.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ozqXgk"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It might be tempting to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features"&gt;order one of the new Series 7 models&lt;/a&gt;, but new Apple hardware always comes at a premium. The latest version of the Apple wearable offers a slightly larger display and some improvements to durability but is largely the same Apple Watch we’re familiar with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxsAXI"&gt;Thankfully, each Apple Watch model offers ample functionality and has seen its fair share of discounts over the last year. So which ones should you consider if you’re in the market for Apple’s popular smartwatch while trying to shop smarter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently four Apple Watch models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;watchOS 8&lt;/a&gt;. The highest-end is the Apple Watch Series 7, which starts at $399. Last year's model, the Series 6, has received a modest discount at some retailers since its release but is still usually found starting at $399. If either of those models is a little too rich for your blood, however, you can save about $120 by opting for an Apple Watch SE, which will set you back $279.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="44jktU"&gt;Finally, there’s the four-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt;, the most affordable Apple Watch to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. However, if you want something more future-proof, you may want to consider Apple’s newer watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will issue software updates to the Series 3 beyond watchOS 8 and the current update process for the Series 3 has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419569/apple-watch-series-3-software-update-reset-bad-experience"&gt;become a bit of a pain point&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of which model you prefer, we’ve rounded up the best Apple Watch deals below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Yen8lP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="hdRa4b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10741666"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199. It’s a good entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and excellent build quality, especially if the SE, Series 6, and Series 7 seem out of your price range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4nwEyX"&gt;Right now, &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-38mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F706203065" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and Best Buy are both discounting the 38mm, GPS-enabled Series 3 by $30, bringing the price down to $169. If you prefer the bigger, 42mm configuration with GPS, it’s also on sale at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-42mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F742230355%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfYU8dEI5wH" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $199 instead of $229. Both models are also available at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1187777/2092?subId1=VergeBestAppleWatchDeals111121&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-series-3-gps-42mm-space-gray-aluminum-case-with-sport-band-black%2F-%2FA-54101062" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, though, not at a discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N8sVLO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514914"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="zc5j8W"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10741240"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3G29qi"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable that shares some features found on the like-minded Series 6 and Series 7, including a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. However, it doesn’t have the always-on display found on Apple’s latest flagships, nor does it feature blood oxygen monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="title"&gt;Right now, you can pick up the 40mm, GPS-equipped version with a silver aluminum case and an abyss blue sport band for $239 instead of $279 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B09G93BDQP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F305879066&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. Other configurations — as well as the larger, 44mm model with GPS — are currently only available at full price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="k7Seuv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xtEsXh"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-44mm-Gold-Aluminum-Case-with-Pink-Sand-Sport-Band-Regular%2F804932402%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; Watch Series 6&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oTrUCf"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/8/22716438/apple-watch-series-6-removes-lineup" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s no longer officially a part of Apple’s wearable lineup&lt;/a&gt;, you can still buy the Apple Watch Series 6 at several retailers. The Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, which start at $399 and $429, respectively. The Series 6 features built-in sleep tracking, a great ecosystem of third-party complications, and more sensors than previous models, including one that allows the device to detect your body's blood oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PfLoQg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="60XJAV"&gt;Deals often come and go quickly on the Series 6. If you don’t mind a bit of vibrancy on your wrist, however, the 40mm, GPS-enabled blue configuration usually sees the biggest discounts with the most frequency. Right now, for instance, you can pick up the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf7KQg2qO7Z" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;blue variant at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; right now for $299, one of the better prices we’ve seen on the Series 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v8KuZ3"&gt;If the larger, 44mm model with GPS is your fancy, it’s available in white, pink, red, and black at &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-44mm-PRODUCT-RED-Aluminum-Case-with-PRODUCT-RED-Sport-Band-Regular%2F847051571%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; for $329, its best-ever price. This discontinued model currently only has limited availability other retailers for full price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Rn8JJi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10598305"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hZHCRf"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="iK520N"&gt;With a slightly altered design and larger display, the new Series 7 comes in either a 41mm configuration starting at $399 or a 45mm configuration starting at $429. There are very few deals to speak of right now, however, you can pick up the 41mm, GPS-equipped model with a green Sport Band and green aluminum casing for $380 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Midnight-Aluminum-Sport/dp/B09HF1DC1J/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, a $20 discount, this same deal also applies to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Midnight-Aluminum-Sport/dp/B09HDYWTPV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the red variant, also available for $380&lt;/a&gt;. The 45mm model with GPS is also available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Midnight-Aluminum-Sport/dp/B09HFGSRJ7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; in red for $410.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4m59DD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10860351"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="rwvKCC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10860357"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="J2hTVr"&gt;A note on the more premium models&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7aHrsm"&gt;While all of the Apple Watch models and colorways covered here are encased in aluminum, Apple does make a more premium range built out of stainless steel and titanium. These offerings have similar designs to their aluminum counterparts, with slightly refined colors and finishings — polished for the stainless steel, brushed for the titanium. However, they start at much steeper prices of $749 and above, and they are functionally the same, save for some exclusive digital watch faces Apple reserves for these premium models. Overall, the upmarket stainless, titanium, and Hermès edition Apple Watches don’t usually get the discounts and sales as the aluminum models, where the deals are often to be had.&lt;/p&gt;
