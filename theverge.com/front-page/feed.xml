    <title>Apple finally supports Windows Precision Touchpad gestures in new Boot Camp update</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wOOYiW"&gt;Apple is finally adding support for Windows Precision Touchpad drivers in its latest Boot Camp update. The new 6.1.15 update includes support for Windows Precision Touchpad, including single tap to click, lower-right corner to right-click, down motion to scroll up, and three or four finger gestures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fo8U2R"&gt;Various &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/nx558h/apple_finally_adds_support_for_windows_precision/"&gt;Reddit users noticed&lt;/a&gt; the surprise update went live yesterday, and it apparently works better than third-party solutions like Trackpad++ and mac-precision-touchpad that people have had to use for years. “Works way better than both of them with better palm and thumb detection too,” &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bootcamp/comments/nwva18/boot_camp_6115_released_adds_support_for_windows/"&gt;says one Reddit user&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3nRyEZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft started supporting Precision Touchpads more than seven years ago&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YbbGDR"&gt;Microsoft first started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/3/4489692/windows-8-1-precision-touchpad-support-intel-synaptics"&gt;introducing Windows Precision Touchpad&lt;/a&gt; with Intel in 2013, in an effort to fix what were notorious PC trackpad issues at the time. It has taken Apple a long time to enable Windows Precision Touchpad in Boot Camp, but not every MacBook is supported. An &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/bootcamp-control-panel/bcmpa82153f3/mac"&gt;Apple support document&lt;/a&gt; notes that only Mac computers with a T2 chip will be able to access Windows Precision Touchpad, which is most MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models from 2018 onward (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208862"&gt;full list here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eeo71j"&gt;The timing of such a significant update to Boot Camp is also surprising and could hint that Intel-based Macs will coexist with Apple’s M1-based Macs for a while yet. Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21559003/apple-mac-macbook-air-pro-mini-m1-intel-processor-cpu"&gt;discontinued Intel-based MacBook Airs&lt;/a&gt; last year, but you can still buy a 13-inch MacBook Pro with an Intel CPU for now. Apple has said that its “transition to Apple silicon will take about two years to complete.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>When does sharing become oversharing?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of a phone with the Tiktok logo, the Instagram logo, and heart and speech bubble icons floating out of it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pufh1MfkrR_aKhAIcblBmSuGncA=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69439390/VRG_4614_10_Oversharing.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Maria Chimishkyan&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yqvnLX"&gt;I’m a chronic oversharer on social media — and usually an intentional one. Mostly, I write about my severe mental health struggles and things that deeply enrage me, but that constant oversharing can be hard to maintain. As much as I post, I delete a lot too, either because posts are too vulnerable, too hurtful, or too likely to spark conflict. It’s hard to know if the defiant overshares are really helping, or if I’m just worried about how a judgmental world will respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0JEgXB"&gt;The intimacy of social media can lead us to share a lot, and being vulnerable in those spaces can give us a rare sense of power. The #MeToo movement brought on a flood of women disclosing their experiences with sexual violence and other issues, leading to increased accountability for perpetrators, a deeper sense of community for survivors, and greater education around consent. Yet at other times, sharing can have unexpected negative consequences, like shaming, security issues, or professional and personal conflict. But if the whole point is to share &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;, how should we think about the choice of what to share and what not to share?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="y4I5ys"&gt;&lt;q&gt;How should we think about the choice of what to share?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s72Haa"&gt;Christopher Hand, a lecturer at Glasgow Caledonian University who studies online harassment, says the benefits are hard to peel apart from the risks.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“We live in a world that seems to be riddled with double-edged swords,” Hand told me, “things that have clear positives and clear constructive applications, but that are also vulnerable to manipulation and exploitation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OspUZi"&gt;I’ve seen that two-sided dynamic play out with my own sharing. People have told me that my own disclosures about mental health helped them with their shame or their healing trajectory. But the cost to my own mental health is significant. Knowing that my most traumatic moments are being judged and gossiped about — often in malicious ways — makes me anxious and even angry. Some appreciate the oversharing; others demonize it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="joAZdw"&gt;Of course, it depends on who is doing the sharing. Hand points out some research that indicates that various factors, including the perceived attractiveness of the poster, can affect how we judge the “appropriateness” of information shared on social media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oKuOeP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;When Nicole shares vulnerable thoughts online, she sees it as sharing with her friends, not the whole world&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vt8YZm"&gt;Lindsay McGlone, an activist and public speaker who goes by The Fierce Fat Feminist online, says that she feels a lot of judgment coming from “the idea of ‘craving’ attention,” a gendered characterization that can paint women or other marginalized groups as dramatic or unstable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvnBBC"&gt;That risk is worth it for many of the marginalized users who go to social media to find community. Nicole Froio, a Brazilian freelance journalist and researcher on gendered violence, says sharing on social media has helped manage her feelings of isolation. “When I was doing my PhD, I was one of the few Latin American students in my department, so oversharing was important to process the xenophobia and racialization I was experiencing.” She told me that, as a bisexual woman, finding community among others who share that identity is also validating, and that when she shares vulnerable thoughts online, she sees it as sharing with her friends, not the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7mv4hY"&gt;McGlone, too, says that stigma doesn’t matter. “[Social media] has always been an online diary for me, a place to document my daily life, my wins and successes, and of course my downfalls, especially living in a marginalized body.” Her social media is focused on creating a platform to highlight the discrimination that fat people face every day, and this is an overwhelmingly positive thing for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YuKntK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I am a big fan of the block button.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oFrTns"&gt;For users focused on a broader mission, the biggest issue becomes managing the trolls. “I am a big fan of the block button,” Ysabel Gerrard, lecturer in digital media and society at University of Sheffield, told me in an email. “Too many of my friends are targeted for their identities, particularly the trans community, and blocking people is an important method of protection (though sad that it’s necessary).” Posting anonymously is also an option, Gerrard says. Kids often use apps like YOLO to share without concerns about revealing their identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EW0vjP"&gt;“I’d also encourage people to make use of having multiple accounts on social media and embracing pseudonymity,” Gerrard writes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vaqLAh"&gt;Another person, Kelsey*, told me she decided to use social media completely anonymously to discuss mental health, while also protecting her identity and that of her husband, who has a high-profile career. “I needed a space where I could anonymously spill my guts without burdening my loved ones,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="239o1d"&gt;The possible harms are real: embarrassment, stalking, and conflict with loved ones. Often, people don’t realize they have shared too much until it’s too late. Froio said venting online led to a fight with her parents. Another person, Noa*, told me she was required to see a school counselor she did not want to see due to one of her posts. “My boundaries were overstepped,” Noa said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3bhdFQ"&gt;More and more, I’ve found oversharing on large platforms unpleasant and unfulfilling. I know that I can help people through sharing and community, but I reject the idea that I have to expose my own struggles and traumas in the process, that I have to bleed out over a pixelated screen to be of worth to society. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H6pXUa"&gt;That seems to be the takeaway for most people. “Oversharing” isn’t really defined by what you share. It’s defined by how well you’re honoring your own boundaries and prioritizing your own health when you share — keeping in mind that you can’t control others’ reactions.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s Kiyo webcam is 25 percent off at multiple retailers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rlat2j3lt3I6dml6ggoShxPvTlQ=/0x0:1090x727/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69439170/razer_kiyo_lede.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0Arv0X"&gt;Finding a webcam during the early stages of the pandemic was borderline impossible. That’s not the case anymore. Most models are in stock, and sometimes, they’re even cheaper than their original prices, like Razer’s unique Kiyo webcam that has a ring light built in to make you look a little more lively during video calls. Normally $100, it’s $75 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Kiyo-Streaming-Webcam-Built/dp/B075N1BYWB/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743127958055029996#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fproduct%2F874650107%2Fsellers&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. This webcam supports 1080p at 30 frames per second, or 720p resolution at 60 frames per second. Those aren’t cutting-edge specs, but there’s a good chance that it’s better than your laptop’s webcam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5dH60Q"&gt;The $200 Kiyo Pro &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295235/razer-kiyo-pro-webcam-review-adjustable-field-of-view-streaming-zoom-video-calls-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;released in early 2021&lt;/a&gt; with support for 1080p resolution at 60 frames per second, but it doesn’t have the built-in ring light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jbzRhL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10602056" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6mEMuK"&gt;There was a $30 off deal on the Apple AirPods Max over-ear headphones earlier this week, but we wanted to let you know that another $20 has been knocked off the original $549 price on the silver and blue colorways. You can get either at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Silver/dp/B08PZD76NP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; right now for $499 —in case a $20 difference was make-or-break for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XzuWIa"&gt;It’s possible that we’ll see even more price cuts with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22459166/amazon-prime-day-dates-2021-june-21-22" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Prime Day 2021&lt;/a&gt; coming up soon, though I personally expect the best deals happening for less costly (but still brilliant) headphones, like Sony’s WH-1000XM4 and the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9VWBjH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="creCoA"&gt;At Best Buy, you’ll get a free $10 gift card to the store &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743129009092845332" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;if you purchase a $100 Apple gift card&lt;/a&gt;. That Apple gift can be used on apps and games in the App Store, as well as on hardware like iPads, AirPods, and anything else you can buy on Apple’s site.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n2dFLy5O2Yifdz2zfO2V133Qs9c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22652449/basiliskv2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fGOJl3"&gt;Razer’s excellent Basilisk V2 wired gaming mouse is $30 off at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743129071294433514#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082G5BDNC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, taking the price down to $50. For that price, you’ll get one of the more ergonomically built and customizable mice for gaming. Its scroll wheel can tilt to the side for extra inputs, and the scroll wheel’s tension can be adjusted on the fly to be more tactile or smooth. Additionally, it has thumb buttons and a DPI clutch that’s useful as a dedicated sniper button to slow down your movement speed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The race is on for quantum-safe cryptography</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of three computer chips stacked with the letters NIST and a lock imprinted on them." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9WCPogLz9vDOFpV2247-JuQAHgc=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69438987/VRG_4614_7_NIST.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Maria Chimishkyan&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qbjSxF"&gt;In 2016, Lily Chen started a competition to rewrite the building blocks of encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aGurag"&gt;With her team of mathematicians at the US National Institute of Standards and Technology, Chen reached out to academic and industry cryptographers around the world to find algorithms that could resist new threats posed by quantum computers. Five years later, the project is almost complete. After three rounds of elimination, Chen and her team have now narrowed the 69 submissions down to a final seven algorithms, with several winners to be named at the end of the year. If things go according to plan, the result will be a new set of NIST-certified algorithms — and a new measure of protection against the chaos of a fully operational quantum computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uRrBsT"&gt;“Cryptosystems in devices and communication systems will not be secure anymore” when those computers reach their potential, Chen says. “It’s time to prepare for quantum threats.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IVlh9t"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s time to prepare for quantum threats.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iQuDa5"&gt;Chen has technical reasons to be concerned. Existing encryption systems rely on specific mathematical equations that classical computers aren’t very good at solving — but quantum computers may breeze through them. As a security researcher, Chen is particularly interested in quantum computing’s ability to solve two types of math problems: factoring large numbers and solving discrete logarithms (essentially solving the problem &lt;em&gt;bx&lt;/em&gt; = &lt;em&gt;a &lt;/em&gt;for &lt;em&gt;x)&lt;/em&gt;. Pretty much all internet security relies on this math to encrypt information or authenticate users in protocols such as Transport Layer Security. These math problems are simple to perform in one direction, but difficult in reverse, and thus ideal for a cryptographic scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GQpXa6"&gt;“From a classical computer’s point of view, these are hard problems,” says Chen. “However, they are not too hard for quantum computers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bOw2M7"&gt;In 1994, the mathematician Peter Shor outlined in a paper how a future quantum computer could solve both the factoring and discrete logarithm problems, but engineers are still struggling to make quantum systems work in practice. While several companies like Google and IBM, along with startups such as IonQ and Xanadu, have built small prototypes, these devices cannot perform consistently, and they have not conclusively completed any useful task beyond what the best conventional computers can achieve. In 2019, Google reported that its quantum computer had solved a problem faster than the best existing supercomputers, but it was a contrived task with no practical application. And in 2020, academic researchers in China also reported their quantum computer had beat conventional computing in performing an algorithm that could offer utility for specialized optimization tasks. But so far, quantum computers have only managed to factor tiny numbers like 15 and 21 — a useful proof of principle, but far from a practical threat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zwdd2x"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A geometric puzzle in a grid of points, arranged across hundreds or even thousands of dimensions”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UIRLa9"&gt;That hasn’t stopped researchers from trying to stay one step ahead of the quantum challenge. Peter Schwabe, a mathematician at the Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy, has devised several cryptography schemes with colleagues that have beat the third round of NIST’s competition. One of his submissions qualifies as a lattice-based protocol, a class of quantum-resistant algorithms that involve a geometric puzzle in a grid of points, arranged across hundreds or even thousands of dimensions. To crack the code, the computer must use given line segments to solve the puzzle, such as finding the most compact way to connect the lines end to end in the grid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aQwOi1"&gt;“Lattice-based cryptography is, at the moment, considered the most realistic drop-in replacement for the protocols we have today,” says Schwabe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xpfnh7"&gt;It’s important to establish cryptographic standards now because once NIST standardizes a new cryptographic protocol, it will take years for some users to buy and set up the necessary technology. Another worry is that hackers today could intercept and store encrypted information, and then decrypt the messages a decade later with a quantum computer. This is a particular concern for government agencies that create documents intended to remain classified for years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wjpkuZ"&gt;“We have to try and get these cryptosystems ready well in advance of quantum computers,” says NIST mathematician Dustin Moody, a member of Chen’s team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="imsnMf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A head start in testing and implementing quantum-safe cryptography&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z23oAZ"&gt;In advance of NIST’s standards, some companies have already begun experimenting with these new cryptography schemes. In 2019, Google and the security company Cloudflare began &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-tls-post-quantum-experiment/"&gt;testing the speed and security&lt;/a&gt; of two quantum computing-resistant protocols. “We hope that this experiment helps choose an algorithm with the best characteristics for the future of the internet,” wrote cryptographer Kris Kwiatkowski of Cloudflare in a blog post after the tests were performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OPxg7m"&gt;When the winning algorithms are chosen, the hope is that NIST’s federal certification will spur more companies to follow suit, and give them a head start in testing and implementing quantum-safe cryptography. Ultimately, NIST researchers see this work as public service. They aim to make these cryptographic standards freely available. The agency doesn’t pay cryptographers to participate in the competition, and winners will not receive any money. “You just get fame in the cryptographic world, which carries its own weight,” says Moody. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKNuLj"&gt;And the winners get the satisfaction of knowing they’ve completely redesigned swaths of internet infrastructure. The new protocols will alter fundamental interactions on the internet, like how your computer confirms you’ve actually accessed the right website and not a hacker’s server — not to mention how companies encrypt your credit card number when you make an online purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="blO9Nz"&gt;But the revolution will be quiet. “The average user is not really going to see or notice this,” says Moody. “Hopefully, it’ll all be done behind the scenes by the cryptographers and the people who put this into their products.” Like the best security products, you can tell it’s working when nobody notices the change.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A great travel coffee kit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A thousand times better than whatever’s in the room&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="s18Klx"&gt;Here is my philosophy on great coffee: drink it if you can get it, and don’t be a snob if you can only get something basic. But I have my limits on what I’ll accept, and those limits are well above what’s usually available in the little basket in your typical American hotel room. I am currently sitting in my first hotel room in over a year and figure a few of you might be doing the same soon, so here’s my guide for how to make the best coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T70JiH"&gt;The obvious option is to locate the nearest coffee shop where you’re traveling, but that would necessitate leaving your hotel room, and the whole point of coffee is to build up the wherewithal to face the world in the first place. Instead, I prefer to make the coffee myself in the most convenient way given the limitations and options usually available in a hotel room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Aeropress Go makes it very simple to make good coffee in all conditions" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oS0ra8qNxa34EeVhD6xR5C4UsC8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22601956/dbohn_20210528_4612_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AeroPress Go makes it very simple to make good coffee in all conditions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yE0yQA"&gt;The best portable coffee brewer: &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/AeroPress-Portable-Travel-Coffee-Press/dp/B07YVL8SF3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AeroPress Go&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="RLDAXb"&gt;Of all the coffee makers in all the travel bags in all the world, the AeroPress Go is the best for travel. It comes with a bunch of pieces of equipment that you’ll want on hand. There’s the basic system itself, which consists of a tube and plunger, of course. But it also packs itself into its own plastic cup and comes with a little container for filters, a scoop, and a stir stick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yIjw4L"&gt;There are a few reasons the AeroPress Go is so great for travel. First, it’s indestructible. Everything is plastic and can be knocked around. It’s also light, self-contained, and easy to clean. Most importantly for me, it’s an incredibly forgiving coffee maker. Conditions in a hotel room are going to vary from your home setup: unless you’re willing to devote space to a proper kettle and scale, you will be using smaller and simpler methods for getting hot water and measuring your ratios. Given that you can’t do everything exactly as you might like, the AeroPress has the best Good Coffee To No Fuss Ratio I’ve found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="teQSX2"&gt;It comes with a coffee scoop and stir stick, if you like using those when you brew your coffee. (I don’t bother with either.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1csFi3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10599315" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A simple immersion boiler is super portable — but never use it unattended" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tv1gQ2r-C2x-E5N_xsShG1V5M3s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22601968/dbohn_20210528_4612_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A simple immersion boiler is super portable — but never use it unattended.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TZUzp7"&gt;The simplest way to boil water in a hotel room: &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Norpro-Instant-Electric-Immersion-Heater/dp/B01M0Q84BR/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;immersion heater&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7H6k4H"&gt;This little coil is &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; thing that unlocked my entire travel coffee setup. The thing about making coffee is you need very hot water, and the thing about hotel rooms is your options for making very hot water range from bad to none. An immersion heater neatly solves that problem without taking up too much space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YHKLy5"&gt;You may be tempted, as I have, to buy a portable water kettle — the kind that collapses down. I have tried two or three, and they’re all bad: too fussy, hard to clean, and too big. This little coil is really all you need to boil water, provided you have a vessel you can drop it in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yef3j8"&gt;A couple words of warning. 1. I don’t think it’s a great idea to use this in the cup that comes with your AeroPress. I’ve done it in a pinch, but I think you should use something else. I use my own thermos, but you can also get by with whatever mugs are provided to you in the hotel room. 2. This coil is a blunt instrument: it’s a coil of metal literally hooked directly into the outlet. &lt;em&gt;Never&lt;/em&gt; leave it unattended when plugged in, and &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; plug it in without first ensuring it’s submerged in water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0DLkxQ"&gt;One thing you’ll miss out on is directly controlling the exact temperature of your water with this boiler. That’s fine because you’re already using the AeroPress, which is very forgiving about things like water temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oiX2xY"&gt;When packing, I stuff this coil and its cord inside my travel mug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ab4eSi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10599326" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="I always try to buy local beans at my destination" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/feuoyayc8J7SuTuxm_d-Jr4c3rw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22601947/dbohn_20210528_4612_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I always try to buy local beans at my destination.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="c9XHJD"&gt;Get good coffee beans or grounds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jrhzWU"&gt;You’re going to need good coffee to make good coffee, so get some good coffee. How you handle this is entirely up to you. My setup includes a hand coffee grinder (see below), but pre-ground beans are perfectly fine for hotel room coffee if you ask me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5o1a8G"&gt;My preferred way of handling the Bean Question is to not bring my own from home. Instead, I do a tiny bit of research before I leave and then buy them from a local shop when I arrive in town. I aim to try coffee that’s local and / or new to me. If you choose not to bring a grinder, the move is to go to the shop and ask them to grind the beans for you — that way, they’ll be just a little fresher than if you buy a pre-ground bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WqgHNy"&gt;The last couple items below are totally optional. An AeroPress Go, a water boiler, and coffee are really all you need. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="This Zojirushi travel mug keeps your coffee hot" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kwgw4WRCBxQ64pCYFfJVtetL7dg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22601970/dbohn_20210528_4612_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This Zojirushi travel mug keeps your coffee hot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jaa8Wx"&gt;My favorite travel mug: &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zojirushi-SM-KHE48AG-Stainless-Steel-16-Ounce/dp/B00HR0WZP4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zojirushi stainless steel travel mug&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="lvQjBt"&gt;I won’t deign to tell you what kind of travel mug you should use, but this one is my favorite. It’s compact, utterly spillproof, and doesn’t slosh coffee into my face when I’m walking and sipping. It’s a lovely coffee mug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7iTsEd"&gt;There are two downsides. You have to take some pieces apart to properly clean it; the lid is made up of plastic and gaskets. It’s not difficult to do and easy to put back together, but it is a little bit of work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xtBL0D"&gt;The second is a weird one, but here we go: for some people, it’s &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; good at keeping coffee hot. It sounds strange to complain about a coffee thermos being too good at its job, but sometimes you will use it at a coffee shop where you don’t have complete control over the temperature. For me, I’d rather have something that I know will keep my drink hot for hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mHFCJW"&gt;I also use this as my travel water bottle when the coffee runs out. I recognize the irony of putting all this work into making great coffee only to use the same mug to drink water that will taste vaguely coffee-esque if I can’t clean it properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Myl1bm"&gt;
&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10599328" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Hand-grinding your beans in a hotel room is next-level coffee-nerd, but you feel like you earn your cup." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JuaQcXI0SCG620DGac7R0XOk-dY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22601990/dbohn_20210528_4612_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hand-grinding your beans in a hotel room is next-level coffee nerd, but you feel like you earn your cup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="C01pP3"&gt;My favorite portable coffee grinder: &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B085C8L78K/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Timemore Chestnut C2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Yg02EU"&gt;Okay, this is where I’ve gone off the deep end, I admit it. Hand-grinding your beans, one cup at a time, is obviously and inherently ridiculous when you’re sitting in a hotel room. But I bought this Timemore grinder on a lark a couple years ago, and it’s such a good little machine that I pack it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p6Wwv8"&gt;There are lots of different hand grinders, but I love this one because it’s relatively small and has a satisfying heft. It has a ton of different grind size options. I’ve used it enough that I can eyeball how much to fill it with beans to get the right amount of coffee ground to use in the AeroPress Go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0fWU5T"&gt;It’s over the top, I know. But fresh, burr-ground coffee really does taste better — which is to say you have to work for it with manual labor, and therefore you will convince yourself you can taste the difference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7VMATt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10599334"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;My coffee gear takes up a little more than the space of a folded pair of bluejeans. Worth it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UE7zcC"&gt;Bonus: A simple AeroPress Go recipe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WLzUtY"&gt;There are a kajillion AeroPress recipes on the internet. I am here to tell you that the best one is the one you land on yourself after some trial and error. In a hotel room, I do not bother with a scale. (I’m not a maniac, I swear.) Here’s my recipe:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="iPMbtu"&gt;Put a (dry) filter in the AeroPress, and set it on top of the included cup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DG0s55"&gt;Grind the coffee as fine as I feel like. (The finer it’s set, the more work it is to hand-grind.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aK9muW"&gt;Eyeball the amount of coffee I put into the AeroPress. I fill just over the base of the filter cap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3Spe83"&gt;Fill it up with just-off-the-boil water just over the number 3 on the side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ARtM9b"&gt;Set the plunger on and pull up slightly to make a vacuum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TPT8Ci"&gt;After two minutes, swirl the whole thing to agitate, then press for 30 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YG03k5"&gt;Taste. Add a little water if necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="JlYKaq"&gt;Here’s a slightly more detailed recipe from James Hoffman:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IfrakO"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j6VlT_jUVPc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>How to stop your emails from being tracked</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of a letter envelope with a target over it with pixels floating around both." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6Pi8r0uc4i8-kswTyRNU-H0pTaQ=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68841883/VRG_4614_3_EmailTracking.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Maria Chimishkyan&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wmDbQw"&gt;All of those obnoxious marketing emails that crowd your inbox aren’t just pushing a product. They’re also tracking whether you’ve opened the email, when you opened it, and where you were at the time by using software like Mailchimp to embed tracking software into the message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1f75NZ"&gt;How does it work? A single tracking pixel is embedded in the email, usually (but not always) hidden within an image or a link. When the email is opened, code within the pixel sends the info back to the company’s server. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yYBZIp"&gt;There have been some attempts to restrict the amount of information that can be transmitted this way. For example, since 2014, &lt;a href="https://gmail.googleblog.com/2013/12/images-now-showing.html"&gt;Google has served all images in Gmail through its own proxy servers&lt;/a&gt;, which could hide your location from at least some tracking applications. And extensions such as &lt;a href="https://uglyemail.com/"&gt;Ugly Email&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pixelblock/jmpmfcjnflbcoidlgapblgpgbilinlem"&gt;PixelBlock&lt;/a&gt; have been developed to block trackers on Chrome and Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y6EFgJ"&gt;There is also a simple, basic step you can take to avoid trackers: stop your email from automatically loading images, since images are where the majority of these pixels hide. You won’t be able to avoid all of the trackers that can hide in your email this way, but you will stop many of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qjXsAd"&gt;Here’s how to disable image autoloading in the major desktop and mobile email apps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="91Fgwl"&gt;Gmail on the web&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="zbqpz9"&gt;Click on the gear icon in the upper-right corner to access your settings, and then click on “See all settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZEfys0"&gt;In the “General” tab (the first one), scroll down to “Images.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="z0QTtq"&gt;Select “Ask before displaying external images.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VeQHzw"&gt;Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on “Save Changes.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="yRek5v"&gt;Note that this will also turn off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/26/18282636/amp-gmail-shopping-rsvp-forms-inbox-google-beta"&gt;Gmail’s dynamic email feature&lt;/a&gt;, which makes emails more interactive. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="In the “General” tab, scroll down to “Images” and select “Ask before displaying external images.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OyvGIew6m_cCzL7vC_d31z8230c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22544004/gmail_pixel.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the “General” tab, scroll down to “Images” and select “Ask before displaying external images.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="XrhZKY"&gt;Microsoft Outlook.com&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="xDoAal"&gt;While the browser-based version of Outlook doesn’t let you stop loading images, you can make it load images through its own service. To enable that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="CurYRn"&gt;Click on “Settings” (the gear symbol in the upper-right corner). In the column that opens, click on “View all Outlook settings” at the bottom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="exNksS"&gt;Select “General” &amp;gt; “Privacy and data.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oQoFLs"&gt;Scroll down to “External images” and select “Always use the Outlook service to load images.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Outlook.com can route incoming images through its own service." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1JWz2g79d9AWZqgrg2XZ_vorNPs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22544343/outlook_online__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Outlook.com can route incoming images through its own service.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GlQKBG"&gt;Microsoft Outlook (Office 365) for Windows 10&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="MIRvx9"&gt;Click on “File” &amp;gt; “Options.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="132JwF"&gt;In the “Outlook Options” window, select “Trust Center.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bgp9g6"&gt;Click on the “Trust Center Settings” button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8dvLox"&gt;Check the boxes labeled “Don’t download pictures automatically in standard HTML email messages or RSS items” and “Don’t download pictures in encrypted or signed HTML email messages.” You can make a number of exceptions to the first item, if you like, by reviewing the boxes underneath it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="To stop automatic downloads, go to the Trust Center." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qvp5woUtECVNQ68MfnG_uWpguBk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22545835/outlook_screenshot.png"&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="qY4VZ5"&gt;Go to “File” &amp;gt; “Preferences” &amp;gt; “Reading.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HromHN"&gt;You can choose to automatically download images only from trusted contacts, or to disable all automatic downloads of images.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>iOS 15 gives you better tools to fight the firehose of notifications — with a catch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EuCoVA7ssG0Z3TCAXxJ7Soj_i0o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69438771/vpavic_4243_20201018_0144.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NfUox1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22456874/apple-ios-15-features-notifications-facetime-wwdc-2021"&gt;Apple’s iOS 15 preview&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week gave us a look at an important new feature coming to your iPhone’s notifications: help. A few new tools may act as a life preserver for those of us up to our eyeballs in a sea of notifications every day, regulating which apps and people are allowed to bug us, and when. But on the flip side, app developers get some additional tools for getting your attention, too, and could very well start sending you even &lt;em&gt;more &lt;/em&gt;notifications — albeit in a less disruptive way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="LI7bZA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10601863"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SwzC2c"&gt;First, the good news: the new notification features in iOS 15 look genuinely good and useful. There’s a new feature called Focus that allows you to choose which people and apps you’d like to see notifications from at a given time. It’s like Do Not Disturb but with much more customization than simply turning off every possible disruption. You can set up modes for work, sleep, personal time, and other scenarios like workouts. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i13_lA5OsvFV8CNunF44yImFsvI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22651209/Screen_Shot_2021_06_10_at_12.53.38_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;People who message you in third-party apps can be associated with their profile in your contacts list.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zZv4cm"&gt;When setting up a new Focus mode, Siri can scan your outgoing messages and calls and automatically suggest allowing notifications from the people you talk to most. There’s a neat trick here too: communications from the people you approve can come from other apps, like Facebook Messenger, not just from iMessage or texts. When you get that Facebook Messenger message in iOS 15, you may see prompts to associate that person in that app with a matching person in your contacts list, too. Once you’ve done this, communications from that person in a third-party app will be allowed to interrupt your Focus mode, provided that you approved them to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lSS4Kr"&gt;You’ll also have the option to set &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22524031/apple-focus-away-message-aim-wwdc-aol"&gt;a kind of away message&lt;/a&gt; when you’re using a Focus mode that will let others know you’re temporarily unavailable when they send you an iMessage. When your friend doesn’t hear back from you for hours, they won’t have to guess whether you hate them or you’re just really busy with work, and that’s nice for everyone. iOS 15 also adds notification summaries, which will batch lower priority notifications into digests you’ll receive at certain times of day.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3PgZKCDdDimtOWb1gdIt3zWT6AA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22652212/notification_summary_ios_15.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notification summaries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Rl0sTv"&gt;All of this gives you more control over interruptions, which is great! But what about app developers who want you to ~engage~ with their platform? They have new options too. They can now use one of four notification interruption types, two of which are new in iOS 15. First are passive interruptions, a new, less obtrusive kind of notification available to developers that doesn’t wake your screen or cause your phone to vibrate — they go straight to your notification center. Previous versions of iOS allowed the user to designate notifications from certain apps to be delivered silently, but this new framework lets the app developer choose to deliver them this way. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0u0PzzhdQyA4vW8XJnDCG7vf8Dg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22651200/passive_int.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Notifications classified as “passive” appear in your notification center silently, without buzzing your phone or breaking through a Focus mode.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Yv5hsy"&gt;These are the types of notifications likely to end up in summaries if you’ve enabled that feature. They don’t just appear in chronological order in the summary digest either — machine learning helps sort them by priority. They’ll likely include images and other visuals too, since Apple encourages developers to include media as part of the notification to increase its chances of showing up at the top of the summary list. And since the risk of annoying you is lower, developers have some incentive to send more frequent, more engaging notifications. They’ll be less disruptive, but these are the kinds of notifications we’re likely to see more of in iOS 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aWF6uI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;since the risk of annoying you is lower, developers have some incentive to send more frequent, more engaging notifications&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RzQfNX"&gt;The other new interruption type is “time sensitive,” which is kind of a Notification Plus. It behaves like a standard notification, lighting up your screen and playing a sound or vibrating, but with an important difference: it’s allowed to break through your focus mode settings and notify you even if they aren’t from an “approved” app. The option to see time sensitive notifications can be turned on and off by the user, so if you really don’t want to see them, you don’t have to. In theory though, they should be for truly time sensitive events, like a package being delivered or your credit card company making sure it was you who bought two round-trip tickets to Maui. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bwITss"&gt;In theory. Apple lets developers decide which notifications deserve time sensitive designation, so it’s more or less on the honor system. The company urges them to maintain trust and keep in mind that users can turn off notifications for their app if they feel they’re being bothered unnecessarily. And lest we forget, Apple itself has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21165087/ios-apple-push-notification-advertising-marketing-now-allowed-app-store"&gt;bent the rules before&lt;/a&gt; on what’s considered too intrusive for a notification. Could developers end up overusing time sensitive notifications? Possibly, but they likely won’t gain much from doing so, since users can opt out of them and may decide to silence the app entirely.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OgEnYi"&gt;There are a few other things worth noting about notifications in iOS 15:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="gzZDTh"&gt;With compatible audio devices like AirPods, Siri will be able to read any incoming notification to you. Previously, this function was limited to things like incoming messages. By default, Siri will read the contents of messages and time sensitive notifications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mSzX54"&gt;Notifications with a “critical” interruption type basically remain unchanged: these are things like Amber Alerts, which bypass your ringer settings to play a sound and get your attention. App developers still need special permission for these notifications, so we shouldn’t suddenly start seeing more of them in iOS 15.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2XzQyl"&gt;Notifications will look a little different, with bigger app icons and images of contacts included in messages. The actions you can take on a notification (liking an image, etc.) will get graphical icons, too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>iOS 15 and macOS 12 take a small but significant step towards a password-less future</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y1tUEPfMED8zmnB8NwlCuHcLUaY=/0x0:2159x1439/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69438671/chrome_IJmX1jx9w5.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the future you’ll be able to sign up for a service without needing to create a password at all.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JXCi8q"&gt;Apple’s upcoming iOS 15 and macOS Monterey will preview a new feature called “Passkeys in iCloud Keychain,” which is an attempt to help replace passwords with a more secure login process. Instead of logging into an app or website using string of text, &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10106/?time=1141"&gt;a WWDC presentation&lt;/a&gt; showed how you could instead use Face ID, Touch ID, or a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22458935/two-factor-security-key-how-to-yubico"&gt;security key&lt;/a&gt;, to gain access. The Passkeys are then synced across your Apple devices using iCloud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JC7rbm"&gt;Although passwords are currently the most popular way to secure accounts, they’re &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/24/18514225/passwords-fido2-authentication-webauthn-security-key-cybersecurity-online-browser-web"&gt;plagued with a host of problems&lt;/a&gt;. Passwords can be phished, forgotten, and they’re insecure if not used properly (think about the number of times you’ve been tempted to re-use one across multiple accounts). But Apple thinks its new Passkeys solution can solve these problems, as shown by the comparison table below.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rEhmlHS1ivntfPCHP9_ImpPUD1w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22652327/XiXVXmKMSV.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple argues its new system is more secure than regular passwords, and more convenient than security keys.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VW56PC"&gt;In a demonstration, Apple showed how the new feature could remove the need to ever create a password to sign in to an app or website in the first place. Instead of creating a username and password during the sign-up process like normal, Apple authentication experience engineer Garrett Davidson just enters a username and allowed the app to register his Face ID as a Passkey. Then he showed how he could use Face ID to log into the app in future, or even log into his account via the service’s website. It works on Macs with Touch ID, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bMpgb5"&gt;The functionality rests on the WebAuthn standard, which Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others have been slowly adding support for over time. Last year Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21301509/apple-safari-14-browser-face-touch-id-logins-webauthn-fido2"&gt;added support for it to offer password-less logins&lt;/a&gt; in Safari in iOS and macOS. But the new approach goes deeper, integrating WebAuthn into an app’s sign-up process, and syncing your credentials across Apple devices via iCloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JtSDu3"&gt;Behind the scenes, WebAuthn uses public key cryptography to let you log in without your private credentials ever having to actually leave your device. Instead, your phone or computer is only sending a “signature,” which proves your identity without having to share your secret private key.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vN020YCX-omYkcMK4E0cDg7yC3g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22652336/2ayp0HbOiQ.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;WebAuthn’s process means your most sensitive information never leaves your device when you log in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LAkaoG"&gt;Apple admits that the feature is in its early stages. It’s only releasing in preview this year, and will be turned off by default in iOS 15 and macOS Monterey. Developers can enable it, but it’s not meant for widespread use. There’s also the obvious limitation that the feature relies on iCloud to function, so you’re out of luck if you need to log in to the same service on a Windows or Android device. Apple admits this is a problem, however, suggesting it’s  working towards improving cross-platform support in future. Apps and websites will also need to enable support for the new process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMhC9S"&gt;But the move is another sign of the growing momentum behind ditching passwords. Microsoft has announced plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/11/20690359/microsoft-windows-10-passwordless-password-option-update"&gt;make Windows 10 password-less&lt;/a&gt;, and Google has been working to make it possible to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/12/20801954/google-passwords-chrome-fido2-webauthn-fingerprint-biometrics-screen-lock"&gt;sign into its services without passwords&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="82SeVg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The podcasting hype house from hell</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YbVdIT9n3sGWquLW9vpIyQUvpqE=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69438535/VRG_ILLO_4414_Podcast_HypeHouse_s.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;How China’s biggest audio platform funded one man’s frat boy dreams&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="jlN3r9"&gt;Imagine you’re a podcaster who’s been recording your show at CBS Radio, a venerable, if not unglamorous spot. One day, you’re instead offered the chance to start recording in a Beverly Hills home. The house has a pool, free food for the talent — that means you! — and the space to host blowout events. You know what you’d choose, and you know what podcaster Norm Steele chose: the Hollywood life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qf25Yz"&gt;When Steele walked into the HiStudios hype house for the first time, he found an oasis, one you wouldn’t expect to come with the territory of being a podcaster. Even the biggest podcaster in the world, Joe Rogan, records in a studio resembling an underground bunker. But here, alongside two studios equipped with hardware and support staff, was a vast view of Los Angeles and the cachet that comes with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dmX1gI"&gt;“It was the professional element,” Steele says when asked why he chose to work with HiStudios, a company spun out of the buzzy podcasting startup Himalaya. “Basically, me having shows that are on the verge of being something great, they had a purpose there. It was a nice place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Zgt4uM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You’re the star at the podcasting hype house&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WoIgg0"&gt;Peter Vincer, the man behind the hype house and the CEO of HiStudios, gave me a lofty spiel ahead of the company’s launch in August 2019. He envisioned a global podcast network with influencers and athletes and shows that would become international hits. He name-dropped Mike Tyson, Penny Hardaway, and Zane and Heath, and he said the company had a deal with Studio71, which works with top YouTubers like Marques Brownlee. Vincer and his team would help launch their shows not just in the US, but in China, too, thanks to HiStudios’ ties to Himalaya, a US podcasting startup funded by the massive Chinese audio company Ximalaya. (Yes, it’s just a one letter difference and very confusing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQN9fM"&gt;It was a bold ambition, but everyone in the podcast space pitches &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;. So after writing about HiStudios that summer, I didn’t hear or think much about them again. That is, until things started falling apart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IUlRSv"&gt;“I don’t want to have nothing to do with this dude no more,” Steele says about Vincer now. “It’s real easy to get caught up in the allure of that house. He may have it clean one day, and next thing you know, you sign the bullshit contract with some dude, and you get took.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KsNqdY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CdfYJxLKopMVAGs3O-xvkpCCVAM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22650616/acastro_210609_4414_0006.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="I5Rz8y"&gt;The story of the hype house starts, as many do, with the promise of money. Specifically, the chance to cash in on the burgeoning podcast industry. Podcasting has been thrust into the limelight over the past few years. Nearly every big tech company — from Apple and Google to Spotify and Facebook — is now involved in the space, and radio companies like iHeartMedia, Cumulus, Audacy, and SiriusXM have incorporated podcasting into their radio businesses. And these would-be podcast hitmakers have signed huge names, like Kim Kardashian, the Clinton family, and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, to their networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="crhVkW"&gt;Collectively, these companies have spent billions of dollars on acquisitions in an attempt to become the dominant names in audio. The industry is expected to exceed $1 billion in revenue this year, according to &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/us-podcast-ad-revenues-grew-19-yoy-in-2020-set-to-exceed-1b-this-year-and-2b-by-2023-301289260.html"&gt;a recent study&lt;/a&gt;. But these companies are playing the long game, believing they can bring billions more dollars into the space through their own investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TxM2Nl"&gt;Audio content is already huge in some countries, and in China, Ximalaya dominates. The company says 250 million people use its app every month; users spent more than 1.5 billion minutes listening in 2020. It &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1847738/000119312521143867/d118108df1.htm"&gt;filed to go public&lt;/a&gt; in the US in April this year and was &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinese-podcast-startup-ximalaya-files-us-ipo-2021-04-30/"&gt;reportedly valued&lt;/a&gt; at over $3 billion in 2018. So, of course, the company decided to try to replicate its success stateside through an offshoot called Himalaya. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eCSDP7"&gt;Himalaya announced its arrival in February 2019 with a podcast player and list of exclusive shows, including a partnership with the Dallas Mavericks. In a debut &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/podcast-platform-himalaya-raises-100-million-launches-apps-with-tipping-function-1203130068/"&gt;Variety piece&lt;/a&gt;, the company boasted about a $100 million investment led by Ximalaya, as well as from General Atlantic and SIG. It really seemed like the company could find a place in the industry, if for no other reason than having cash in the bank. (Disclosure: General Atlantic is an investor in Vox Media, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s parent company.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tmVL2W"&gt;But with Vincer and the hype house, Himalaya got more than it bargained for. In less than a year, what was intended to be a schmoozy haven for creators turned into a perplexing world of cocaine, dog poo, and unpaid bills, according to more than a dozen people who spoke with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. All the stories centered on one man: Vincer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R20Lcr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WMUdUJPUGLc0uPI2aITQz1zISPw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22650239/acastro_210506_4554_0002.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="vDiA7y"&gt;Vincer had already made a name for himself when he was brought on at Himalaya, and not always for the best reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n1qDY4"&gt;One person remembers him as disrespectful and hard to work with at Castbox, a separate China-based podcasting company. Another alleges that he would get drunk and discuss sexual escapades at business dinners. Nick Quah, of the podcasting newsletter &lt;em&gt;Hot Pod&lt;/em&gt;, says he banned Vincer from his invite-only conference after he started drinking before noon and made attendees uncomfortable. (“He seems like a jackass,” Quah told me.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vziwLY"&gt;In another story recounted by two sources, Vincer allegedly walked up to a group of people at Podcast Movement, another industry conference, in 2018 while wearing a fanny pack. He then asked if anyone wanted drugs, which these people believed were in the bag strapped to his waist. “The thing that stuck with me was, ‘Okay so you’ve got [drug] options,’” says one person who asked to remain anonymous because of their continuing work in the industry. Vincer denies that all of this happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ffhPn1"&gt;Still, Vincer was brought on as Himalaya’s VP of global marketing and partnerships in August 2018. He spent his time wooing potential collaborators and doing his best to promote Himalaya as the next big thing in the podcasting business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="55qh0p"&gt;Himalaya pitched podcasters on a simple idea: we’ll sell your ads, market your show, and take a cut of revenue from whatever sales are made. This differs in a crucial way from other companies. Other networks will sell ads for a podcast, but often aren’t willing to risk their own cash to promote a program and help it grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="66vvtx"&gt;This marketing budget mostly meant swag. Charlie Worroll, the host and creator of &lt;em&gt;Crimelines&lt;/em&gt;, says Himalaya sent listeners who signed up for her premium Himalaya feed a merch box with &lt;em&gt;Crimelines&lt;/em&gt;-branded water bottles and enamel pins. The company also offered to run a banner ad for her show at the top of its app and highlighted it in a booklet handed out at Podcast Movement. Another podcaster, Jack Luna of true crime show &lt;em&gt;Dark Topic&lt;/em&gt;, says he was told he’d be paid for every person that followed him on the Himalaya app, and other creators say they were offered the same incentive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="sipdq8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Himalaya saw potential in backing independent creators&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TK3MBq"&gt;“A lot of these quote unquote podcast networks are literally just ad sales ... and so Himalaya was really trying to set themselves out as a network where they’re promoting their independent shows,” Worroll says. Himalaya took a vested interest in her show’s success and wanted to see it grow by fronting these marketing costs. “I think Himalaya’s vision was great. It didn’t happen, but if it did, it would have been amazing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hh6xJ6"&gt;It soon became clear that Himalaya might not have as much money as it let on. At least one of the investments Himalaya announced at launch turned out to be exaggerated, according to &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/podcast-startup-himalaya-may-have-never-had-100-million-in-vc-funding-c5fb6b86-799a-45f3-bf9e-c0bf67ad1156.html"&gt;an &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; from September 2019. General Atlantic never invested directly in Himalaya Media, per the report, and had actually only invested in its parent company, Ximalaya. Another supposed investor, SIG, never confirmed its funding of Himalaya. It didn’t respond to &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;’ request for comment in 2019, and it also didn’t respond to multiple recent requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RUTpuI"&gt;That confusion might have stemmed from Vincer, according to Richard Selah, a former Himalaya contractor and eventual CRO at HiStudios. Selah tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Vincer made the $100 million figure up as a way to get more investment out of Ximalaya and build hype for the company. Selah says he and Vincer were in an Uber, and Vincer asked what was a “better number” for a PR piece: $50 million or $100 million. Selah suggested the higher figure, and he says Vincer went with it. “That’s where the $100 million came from,” Selah says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OPeZhm"&gt;The inaccurate figure was later repeated by Himalaya’s CEO, Yu Wang, to at least one prominent journalist in the space, James Cridland from &lt;em&gt;Podnews&lt;/em&gt;, which Selah witnessed during a podcast festival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QiEsK6"&gt;Vincer spoke with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; for this story and offered multiple explanations for the following reporting and allegations made against him. Most of which comes down to none of what follows happened, or, if it did to some degree, it wasn’t his fault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o8kKXk"&gt;“There were, of course, a lot of stressful moments,” Vincer says. “It was not easy, but our team banded together, and then it’s been growing and flourishing since.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ECK6fC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;A party at the house involved women carrying around snakes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ymbhKW"&gt;It’s simultaneously easy and incomprehensible to understand how Vincer has lasted in the industry for years. He’s charismatic, funny, and has conviction on whatever he’s selling you. Plus, he’s fun — if you’re the type of person who likes partying with your boss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxKw54"&gt;Selah, the former CRO at HiStudios, for example, alleges that Vincer would do coke and drink to excess on every work trip they took together. Which, yes, is a major red flag for any corporate executive. But on the flip side, there might be free coke in it for you. Selah also alleges Vincer used an app to arrange meetups with sex workers during work trips. (Selah didn’t report any of this to Himalaya’s CEO, and Vincer denies everything.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8NS9Gx"&gt;“His personal lifestyle I felt was a runaway train waiting to leave the tracks, and it was just a matter of time before, you know, he would basically either take the company down or take himself down,” Selah says. “He’s just a bad guy, and unfortunately, he’s a bad guy wrapped up into this magnificent personality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YXBYQL"&gt;Still, Vincer succeeded at Himalaya and ended up with a promotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SrSwsj"&gt;Himalaya spun out a new company called HiStudios to produce podcasts, court creators, make shows, and sell ads — pretty standard podcast network stuff. The company launched publicly in August 2019 with a focus on inking deals with influencers and athletes, and Himalaya gave the team a monthly budget in addition to whatever sales they made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NamnjB"&gt;Vincer, an American who also speaks Mandarin, was put in charge as CEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HcqEOw"&gt;In his telling of events, Vincer says HiStudios’ creation gave him — an entrepreneurial spirit — a place to run free. He “didn’t see eye to eye” with Himalaya’s COO, he says, and this gave Himalaya a separate business to fall back on if the app didn’t work out. Selah, however, says it was more like Himalaya wanted some distance from Vincer’s behavior, particularly after he allegedly lashed out at a subordinate employee, which Selah says he witnessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Z65XzA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“His personal lifestyle I felt was a runaway train waiting to leave the tracks”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Pg3Vux"&gt;HiStudios’ main office was based in Austin, Texas, out of a WeWork and states away from Vincer, who lives in California. Vincer, however, also wanted to run branded studios out of Los Angeles to draw talent. He envisioned impressive places where influencers and athletes could record. What he ended up with was a hype house — a rental home in Beverly Hills that he rented for between $16,000 and $17,000 per month, depending on the lease year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CHMBXU"&gt;The house is tucked into the Los Angeles hills, surrounded by well-to-do neighbors, including a  bookstore owner and dermatologist. It’s in Beverly Hills and has the famous zip code — 90210 — for prestige. The home epitomizes 1960s California modern style with a gated driveway leading up to the front entrance, which includes two Greek-style pillars framing the door. It also features floor-to-ceiling windows and sliding doors, showcasing the backyard pool, and because the house is in the shape of an L, people in one room can see what’s happening on the other side of the house. It looks like a place designed to hang and live, not so much to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z6lqzc"&gt;Instead of building a traditional studio, HiStudios turned the rental home into a space where people could work and stay for extended periods of time. Someone who’d been to the home  says the LA house served as a real workplace where people could sleep if they were in town for business. Vincer says there was always one room for people to stay in, which helped the company avoid hotel fees. Vincer himself had a room that he occasionally stayed in while in town, he says, and another room was given to his assistant. The HiStudios team occasionally hosted clients for drinks at the Beverly Hills home, but never let it get out of hand, the source who visited the home says. People could work from the living room or by the pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z0HKXQ"&gt;“Everything was perfect at first,” says Steele, who leads the Digital Soapbox podcast and multimedia network and hosts a show called &lt;em&gt;The Gangster Chronicles&lt;/em&gt;. “We said, ‘Okay, we’re going to be recording in this cool mansion.” The house had two studios decked out with production equipment, which Himalaya funded, and a producer and studio manager would be on hand to help with production.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Attendees arrived at the HiStudios home for the launch of Leaves of Legend, Krayzie Bone’s cannabis line.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0ZkJ64"&gt;Podcasters could host events at the house, too. One night, in March 2020, the home turned into a venue for a cannabis launch party for Krayzie Bone, of Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, who regularly recorded a show at the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZmA9d"&gt;The event sounds like a stoner’s dream. Also a frat boy’s: naked women with body paint in the cannabis line’s colors danced and mingled with the crowd; a red carpet was rolled out for photo-ops; rappers performed; party guests smoked weed out of an ice sculpture that doubled as a bong; people passed around 24-karat gold and rose petal hand-rolled cigars; and women danced with fire and albino snakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UfGymc"&gt;“It was a beautiful spot — a great view, nice pool, perfect for throwing a party,” says Crystal Bauer Feldman, who owns the marketing agency Arcane Media and was hired to run the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6wkF02"&gt;On the outside, the house and party looked incredible and suggested the company was thriving. But behind the scenes, HiStudios was off to a more troubling start, as shows struggled to get off the ground and employees alleged that the party-like atmosphere had turned toxic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qqj4RS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="yR5il1"&gt;Multiple shows Vincer highlighted to build hype either never panned out or didn’t last long. Vincer says HiStudios and Studio71 created some shows that he “isn’t proud of,” and that Studio71 sent him “shitty shows” to work with. The Zane and Heath show he told me about at launch ended up being a “real bummer deal” for him with the hosts eventually switching networks, and Penny Hardaway’s show fell apart after he ran into trouble with the NCAA and a suspension of a player. “I can tell you that he was not into making a podcast after all that went down with his team,” Vincer says. Studio71 declined to comment, as did Zane and Heath’s talent agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dZkuJt"&gt;Vincer’s behavior was allegedly hurting the company’s deals, too, prior to HiStudios’ public launch. Selah alleges Vincer slept through meetings or nearly missed them because of late nights spent partying or with sex workers. In one case, he alleges he and the team repeatedly called Vincer to wake up for a meeting with Nelson Mandela’s family foundation. He says the meeting was at 9AM, and Vincer came down to the hotel lobby that morning at 9:15 with a woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yIpI2g"&gt;Vincer denies this happening and says he’s close partners with Mandela Media now, although multiple requests to the team for confirmation went unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rBqYuL"&gt;“Peter Vincer should never manage people ever again in his lifetime, let alone even own a dog,” Selah says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mksixC"&gt;HiStudios employees also allege they were on the receiving end of harassment throughout their time at the Los Angeles house, according to a lawsuit filed in fall 2020. Four former HiStudios employees, including the company’s former VP of marketing, studio manager, creative director, and assistant to the CEO, allege the company facilitated and encouraged open drug use and other inappropriate workplace behavior, including inviting sex workers to events, over the course of nearly a year. These former employees describe events in which they say they were subjected to ridicule, abuse, and sexual questions that ultimately led to their alleged wrongful terminations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="1PBqfh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Four former employees filed a lawsuit against HiStudios and Himalaya last year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xABahp"&gt;Two women who worked at HiStudios say in the lawsuit that Vincer constantly brought up sex around them. Alexa Passer, who worked as the vice president of marketing for HiStudios, alleges that Vincer would routinely ask her questions about her sex life, including the size of her boyfriend’s penis. Passer says he once introduced her boyfriend to a group of colleagues as the guy “who Lexy is fucking,” according to the lawsuit. On another occasion, Vincer allegedly attempted to get Passer to arrange a fivesome between him, her, her boyfriend, and two women she met at a bar after a work dinner. When the women eventually walked away from the group, Vincer allegedly said to Passer, “Of course you couldn’t get it done, like everything else.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWuOo2"&gt;Vincer says that all the plaintiffs’ employment contracts were terminated for just cause, and all the defendants have since responded to the lawsuit, denying the allegations and, in one filing, requesting the case be thrown out. The lawsuit is still pending and a trial date is set for April 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nZs0KO"&gt;The lawsuit also alleges that when looking to hire a studio manager for the company’s hype house, Vincer gathered team members around a computer and clicked through LinkedIn profiles of women, asking aloud how big their breasts were and whether they were attractive. He passed on any person of color, the lawsuit claims, because that “wasn’t the look he was going for.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W1rz8n"&gt;“I don’t do that,” Vincer says&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in response. “A lot of people compare me to Michael Scott, and I’m obsessed with &lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt;, and I always have been. I make very Michael Scott-y jokes, but no, that’s not the type of character I am. Everyone that knows me knows I’m not like that. That’s not me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qioTuw"&gt;Another plaintiff, Misti Taylor, was eventually hired for this studio manager role, which involved her sleeping and living at the house for prolonged periods of time, according to the lawsuit. Taylor alleges that drug use was common, and that Vincer’s children were present while people smoked marijuana and drank excessively. Vincer is also said to have repeatedly made inappropriate sexual comments to Taylor, including asking whether she had “wild sex parties” or “orgies” in the house while she lived in it over the holiday season. The lawsuit claims she was eventually fired because Vincer said she gave off “bad vibes” and placed the Christmas tree in the wrong spot in the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qKzf3n"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;The house sits in the hills of Los Angeles with a view of the city.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Qm2KyC"&gt;Vincer says the above incidents didn’t happen and that he fired Taylor because she deleted security footage from the home during her stay, and when he let her go, he alleges that she took control of the house’s connected thermostats and turned the heat up to “like 90 [degrees]” and started playing death metal music over speakers. “It really was like a horror movie,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pACkBf"&gt;One of Taylor’s lawyers, Nick Rosenthal, says he “doesn’t know anything” about the smart house allegations, but “even if everything that Mr. Vincer just said was true, none of that excuses sexually harassing your employees.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y4hKTt"&gt;One male employee also claims to have been the subject of abuse. Dylan Fussman, Vincer’s former assistant and a plaintiff, alleges that he was told to hire sex workers and purchase drugs, so Vincer wouldn’t carry the risk of doing it himself. Fussman would sleep at the house and allegedly was woken up one morning around 3 or 4AM and told to prepare lines of cocaine for clients. Vincer denies this happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JYxMyh"&gt;Another HiStudios employee, Mike Botticello, HiStudios’ head of content, allegedly physically abused Fussman and would “nut slap” him in front of other people. Botticello hasn’t replied to multiple &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;requests to comment, but his lawyers responded to the complaint saying he denies “each and every allegation asserted in the complaint.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FZClVI"&gt;Strangely, Vincer corroborates this part of the lawsuit and says Fussman reported the “nut slapping” to him, causing Vincer to have to sit the two men down and talk about the situation and put a stop to it. Botticello’s lawyer declined to comment for this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7lwulH"&gt;One of Fussman’s lawyers says this situation speaks to the “kind of environment” the plaintiffs worked in daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GAfH9o"&gt;“Imagine at a normal company if an executive went up to an employee and slapped him in the genitals, and the CEO’s response was, ‘Let’s sit down and talk about it,’” the lawyer says. “Would that ever happen? No, he’d be fired immediately.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HFy7xI"&gt;Drennon Davis, another male employee, alleges Vincer offered to introduce him to a sex worker, but Davis turned the offer down, though he believed doing so could provoke retaliation. Vincer denies this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iMRQ1U"&gt;Meanwhile, Selah was fired prior to HiStudios’ public launch and the renting of the house. Selah says he began recording every conversation he had with Vincer and Himalaya CEO Wang before he was let go. About a year later, he says he took his old work laptop with all the recordings out during hunting season and “shot holes” in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yGylrd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FY_XaPRV3l_pOYPdSBczynJHuhw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22650240/acastro_210609_4414_0003.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="umfsbt"&gt;When employees informed Himalaya of their experiences at the hype house, the company told Vincer to open an investigation with HiStudios’ own budget, Vincer says. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; attempted to reach the lawyer who conducted this investigation but received no response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N9e4OG"&gt;Vincer says he never saw the findings himself, as they were sent to Himalaya, but heard secondhand from two employees that the lawyer confirmed drug use in the house. Himalaya did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the lawsuit or investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OKnVhe"&gt;The whole situation ostensibly spooked Himalaya. In a rapid effort to get away from the mess that was HiStudios, Himalaya publicly &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/himalaya-media-announces-separation-from-spinoff-histudios-301018605.html"&gt;separated itself&lt;/a&gt; from the studio on March 5th, 2020, with seemingly no plan in place for what that might mean. Himalaya portrayed the split as a strategic move to “allow both businesses to grow,” in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aJYtgP"&gt;Vincer also decided to give HiStudios a new name: Notorious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gTfMoB"&gt;Himalaya’s intended clean break didn’t go as planned, however. The company wanted to keep HiStudios’ clients — it owned HiStudios, after all — but Vincer seemingly had other ideas. Once the companies separated, Vincer set Notorious up to essentially take over HiStudios’ roster of shows and creators, according to an email sent to creators by Wang and obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Per the email, Vincer allegedly locked the Himalaya and former HiStudios production team out of their emails, shared drive system, and Megaphone account, which hosted every podcast the team created and published. That gave Notorious nearly full control over the network. “This is not only illegal, but creates lots of difficulties to release new episodes for many shows,” the email from the CEO states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CrYtLH"&gt;The Notorious team also locked Himalaya’s accountant out of the shared drive that included documents she needed to pay creators, according to the email. At that point, Himalaya’s board began preparing a lawsuit to try to regain access to the emails and shared drive. (It seemingly never filed that lawsuit.) Both sides began reaching out to creators, per emails viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, to win them over. Notorious emailed creators and declared its “full independence” from Himalaya, with a name that reflects the company’s “innovative spirit, culture, and dedication to delivering bold content.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JsNIvM"&gt;“The conversations I had were surreal, like, this is a bunch of suits and they’re talking to me like they’re arguing parents,” says one creator, who asked to remain anonymous because of their ongoing work with Notorious. “It really did feel like a divorce or something.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KMo8JJ"&gt;Vincer denies locking Himalaya’s team out of any accounts, although a source familiar with the situation, who has asked to remain anonymous over fears of retaliation, says Vincer instructed the HiStudios / Notorious team to change all the passwords. Because Vincer’s name was on the lease for the home, he stayed in the hype house and made it Notorious’ office, as well as his actual home. That’s when things got even messier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NnL02P"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ihSD27HbuXMZTcyuwsVWnnObgLk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22650241/acastro_210609_4414_0004.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Wt3m8p"&gt;Following the Notorious transition, Steele says the house fell into disrepair. He and another member of his team say furniture was destroyed; dog poop sat on the floor inside the house; trash, including baby diapers, would linger in the driveway for weeks. Vincer, he says, would occasionally be passed out in the living room when podcast guests were coming over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mbX4oy"&gt;“[It went] from being a really pristine place to create that could have been something amazing, but it just got mismanaged to the point where it turned into a dump,” Steele says. “It turned into a personal haven for this middle-aged man to relive his childhood.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T9Jp7C"&gt;The source familiar with the split backs up these claims and says the state of the house got in the way of work. This person recalls a time when ice cream was smeared all over a screen the team used to give presentations, and Vincer, this person says, laughed when the team pointed it out instead of offering to get it cleaned up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xm05kz"&gt;At the same time, this person also says men in the house, including Vincer, would hang out without their shirts on, adding to the frat-like environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6NHr8f"&gt;“I had to walk up to a guy [Vincer] that I worked for to talk about something business-related, and he’s got no shirt on, and he’s got his gut hanging out, and he’s got a beer in his hand,” they say, adding that food also sat out for days, attracting flies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JqdWkl"&gt;This person also alleges the studio manager once had to hang up the phone after stepping in dog poop that sat in the studio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zsf79A"&gt;At this point, Vincer, his wife, three kids, four cats, and two dogs had moved into the home making it exactly that: a home. But the people who had been using the space as a workplace didn’t get the memo that this was now a place where a family lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="l5FdAu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The hype house turned into a family home&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dlllzv"&gt;As Steele started spending more time with his team at the LA house during the spring and summer of 2020, he says things got less and less professional. For one, he says people in the house started out just smoking marijuana, which is legal in California, but later some moved on to doing lines of cocaine in the studios.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;He also says members of his team would get blamed for things in the house they didn’t do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mWetiK"&gt;“It was always assumed, like, let’s say all the liquor at the bar was drunk up, they assumed my guys were doing it,” he says. “I was just like, ‘My guys didn’t do that.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="byWN3p"&gt;He says his podcasters brought in their own drinks. “We got guys [on our podcasts] that are coming in with bottles of Clicquot and high-end stuff — Ace of Spades — they don’t even drink that crap that [the people at the house] drink.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ijtjG6"&gt;Vincer denies that the team would have been blamed for drinking all the booze. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NyDMGB"&gt;Bauer Feldman, who planned the cannabis event, started working on a podcast under an agreement with Steele, letting her record at the house. She says she enjoyed her time at the home until it started to unravel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X7JyDt"&gt;“I feel like I was in a smaller version of Studio 54,” she says, describing the vibe of the home. “It was exciting. It was creative. It was a whirlwind. But it was fake, none of it was real.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2EBdM"&gt;Other people lived or crashed at the home last summer, including mostly young Instagram-famous people who seemingly have a lot of followers for no reason. These guests, Bauer Feldman says, would take over the house and leave drugs, like cocaine, lying around. She says Vincer attempted to keep the two worlds separate: one in which professionals used the house’s podcasting studios and another where twenty-somethings partied late into the night.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gyisHp6kQuOuigxv0vTCqOmZkCg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22650131/pcheung_210216_4414_0026.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Norm Steele alleges that Notorious still owes him and his team money.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KuqSak"&gt;The source close to the situation also says that someone associated with an in-network podcaster moved into one of the studios and would leave dirty clothes out, particularly dirty socks, making the room smell terrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rbywSd"&gt;Vincer confirms that other people lived in the home and stayed there, but he says there was no cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vjWFgj"&gt;Still, a record request filed in Beverly Hills by &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;lists more than 40 calls to police about the home since Notorious took over, most of which relate to “disturbing the peace.” Nearly all of them came in during the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GjSlNR"&gt;“[There were] young girls coming over and doing cocaine and drinking at this mansion in 90210 with what they thought were all these stars and famous people and Peter,” Bauer Feldman says. “And Peter’s like running the whole thing, and Peter tells everyone, ‘Oh, it’s my house.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8dwRXZ"&gt;Bauer Feldman also says women she believed to be sex workers would come over to the house and take men into one of the bedrooms. Steele corroborates this, too, saying women “pushed up on” a few of his team members. Vincer says there were “absolutely not” sex workers in the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U0EiD8"&gt;Coupled with the “creep vibes” Bauer Feldman got from Vincer, she decided to step away from the home. “As a woman, that bothered me, and then also being a mother myself, and watching him with his wife there and his kids, and just get completely trashed in front of them and black out and act like an idiot. It was heartbreaking,” she says. Bauer Feldman cut ties with Notorious in July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BkdBC2"&gt;Even the creators who didn’t work with Vincer in LA, and in most cases haven’t even met him, say the company became a mess following the split with Himalaya. These collaborators say the company fell behind on payments or didn’t pay out at all. Five creators, including Steele, tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; they were owed money for their Notorious work. One podcaster says they were owed as much as $74,000 and that Notorious ended up paying them out once they got a lawyer involved. Notorious told this podcaster its ad buying company was to blame for the four-month delay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="HjEMFb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Multiple creators say the Notorious team was late to pay or didn’t at all&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E0NqIq"&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;em&gt;Crimelines &lt;/em&gt;host Worroll says she sent her bill to collections and hasn’t received any money. Steele says his team is owed $25,000 in back pay for advertisements they read for brands like Manscaped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q76D5M"&gt;The anonymous source says Vincer also reduced each Notorious team member’s annual pay and was sometimes late issuing the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3bQ38Y"&gt;Vincer says Notorious struggled financially. “So yeah, I took a little longer to pay early partners than I probably should have or wanted to,” he says. But he isn’t aware of any current or former partners to whom he owes money, other than Steele who won’t “get a dime” from him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zL3Ij"&gt;One of the final straws for Steele, and what pushed him to leave Notorious, was seeing what he believed to be a large amount of marijuanna delivered to the house, which he viewed as an indication that Vincer and Notorious were bringing in cash but weren’t paying him or his team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cvDrQ6"&gt;“The dude [Vincer] was trying to give me weed, and it’s like, ‘Dude, I don’t give a fuck about weed,’” Steele says. “I don’t even smoke weed, what am I gonna do with that?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sILXyW"&gt;Eventually, Steele says he had to cut ties surreptitiously. “It’s almost like an abusive relationship, you kind of sneak out the house when your spouse is gone,” he says. “I went in and I made sure I took every last show that we had off the hosting platform. I snuck everybody off of there and snuck them back onto another platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w9QeXW"&gt;The team then stopped going to the house, and Steele changed his phone number, hoping to never hear from Vincer again. His podcast network ultimately &lt;a href="https://westcoaststyles.com/news/2020/09/charlamagne-the-god-the-gangster-chronicles-sign-huge-iheart-media-deal/"&gt;signed a deal&lt;/a&gt; with iHeartMedia and Charlamagne Tha God’s Black Effect Podcast Network, where the show is now produced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lKGExz"&gt;Vincer denies ever bringing in a large amount of weed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SomPbr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5exERu9SaVcuGweVMXRjWL-ZBVo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22650242/acastro_210609_4414_0005.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="xkP1ou"&gt;Since this entire saga began last year, Himalaya has mostly exited the podcasting business, apart from one show. It now focuses on subscription-based “audio courses,” or educational audio content offered by reputable names, similar to MasterClass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uus4UM"&gt;Meanwhile, Vincer’s hype house continued to host parties throughout the summer and fall of 2020, and the Notorious Instagram account makes it look like a party place for TikTokers and hype beasts, with partygoers playing beer pong, people getting pushed into the backyard pool, and weed being smoked in the studios. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UQCLZG"&gt;Vincer tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; the company makes “a handful” of shows now but is mostly focused on marketing and making content for brands. It’s hard to tell how much content or money the company is making, although Vincer says it’s “self-sustaining.” Some shows on the brand’s various Apple Podcasts pages haven’t published a new episode in over a year, while a few do appear to be in active production. One of the network’s biggest releases, &lt;em&gt;Dumpster Fyre&lt;/em&gt;, which Fyre Festival founder Billy McFarland hosted from prison, ended after McFarland was put in solitary confinement for hosting it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gtLnlP"&gt;Vincer says his current 30-person team, most of whom are 20-something-year-olds, are more interested in video and broad creative work than solely looking to podcasts as a business. He says they make music videos and have a five-person sales team that helps sell various things for brands. Notorious is the exclusive sales partner of the Summer Smash music festival in Chicago this summer, for example, and he says podcast ads represent 40 to 50 percent of the company’s revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ufRkaM"&gt;The team has also listed a variety of jobs, mostly for junior positions or interns. A junior sales agent listing asks applicants to send in a video saying why they’re a good fit for the role and answering the question, “If you were an item in a gas station, what would you be?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RwZUgX"&gt;The post also advertises four benefits: “Only non-store in the US equipped with a fully-stocked Yerba Mate fridge; relaxed environment; pool on-site; and lunch provided.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="F3a8kR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If you were an item in a gas station, what would you be?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1DE0u3"&gt;One big thing has changed in the months since the split-up. In February this year, the Notorious team moved into a new hype house, one that’s more like a compound than the Beverly Hills home. The home, according to its online listing, sits on 10 acres of land and features seven bedrooms. Vincer says it has a living room with “big TVs,” a dartboard, an editing room, and hiking trails that “go over an hour.” “It’s more of an events space,” he says, and they’ve hosted parties, like one for rapper 24kGoldn, and shot music videos for people like Tom Hanks’ son Chet Hanks. The Instagram account calls the house the “Notorious estate,” and Vincer says “three or four” of his “most consistent contributors” stay at the home full time with a woman, referred to as the “house mom,” on hand to clean and cook during the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PSFwIA"&gt;The beer pong and partying also continues, except this time with a bigger backyard that’s adorned with Greek statues and an interior that looks like an attempt at a French chateau vibe with sconces and ornate tapestries. Influencers post photos from the house, and drone footage shows off tanned guys with six packs hanging by the pool. Nothing seems different, apart from a bigger place to hang and make content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h76bgd"&gt;“We don’t turn up that much because we don’t really have that much time to do that, but I couldn’t tell you how pleased I’ve been since I founded Notorious with how well my team, and especially the team that I have now, has been able to manage a unique work environment,” Vincer says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wcPvR9"&gt;But on March 23rd, March 27th, and April 1st of this year, police visited the property because of a “disturbance,” according to an eviction notice filed in a Los Angeles court. And Vincer’s new neighbors continue to complain about “loud noise and traffic in the middle of the night,” the document says. Vincer’s new landlord gave him and the other people living in the house three days to vacate the premises, but because they haven’t, the landlord has since filed a civil case against Vincer asking for him to leave the property for good and pay damages of over $1,900 per day while he and his team continue living in the home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="mYLt6G"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Vincer’s newest house faces its own problems&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A8TxQX"&gt;Vincer says he moved into the house thinking that he could host events there, not knowing the landlord and neighbors had a “longstanding feud,” which he says prompted the “aggressive actions.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ItEy50"&gt;At the same time, Vincer’s old landlord, from the HiStudios hype house, also filed a lawsuit against him for owed money, alleging he failed to pay for rent and damages to the property. The landlord alleges Vincer owes $71,967 in rent from May 2020 until he left the property in March 2021 and that damages to the home total up to $83,741.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8uc60L"&gt;Vincer says this is “being negotiated right now,” but that he only didn’t pay the last month’s rent because he wanted “negotiating leverage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OIdqEB"&gt;For Steele and everyone else who’s been left in Notorious’ wake, they can’t help but simultaneously marvel and speculate about this new place that, from social media, looks like a hopping spot that’s carefree and fun. Multiple people have called or texted me to point it out, seemingly suggesting that for all that’s gone down between Vincer, HiStudios, Notorious, and Himalaya, the party still goes on. At least, per what they see on Instagram. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gq7CxZ"&gt;But behind the doors, Vincer faces three separate lawsuits and collaborators demanding to get paid. He might have changed venues, but business — however he defines it in his universe — goes on as usual. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="8OryXw"&gt;“I have nothing bad to say about Himalaya,” Steele says. “But that Notorious stuff, that’s the right name for it: Notorious.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk demos Cyberpunk 2077 on new Tesla infotainment system with ‘PS5-level performance’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/csMQtv3bmEp0pLecqSiFsaA5H7w=/47x0:554x338/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69438425/ezgif.com_gif_maker__1_.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9fuyjF"&gt;Elon Musk teased that Tesla’s new Model S Plaid would be capable of running &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253258/tesla-model-s-ps5-xbox-series-x-next-gen-10-teraflop"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, and he’s now demonstrated the car’s “PS5-level performance.” The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22528963/tesla-model-s-plaid-ev-price-specs-range-speed"&gt;refreshed Model S&lt;/a&gt; includes a new Tesla infotainment system, powered by AMD’s Ryzen processor and a discrete AMD RDNA 2 GPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dp6EmB"&gt;“There’s never been a car that has state of the art computing technology, state of the art infotainment where this is literally at the level of a PlayStation 5,” said Tesla CEO Elon Musk during a demo event last night. “This is actual PlayStation 5-level performance… yes it can run Cyberpunk. It’s high frame rate, it will do 60fps with state of the art games.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="69lohi"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kUmkbzQ-BS0?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=1402&amp;amp;start=1402" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sge1cB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22462660/amd-tesla-model-x-s-plaid-ryzen-radeon-rdna-2"&gt;AMD revealed last week&lt;/a&gt; that it’s powering this new infotainment system in both the new Model S and Model X, with 10 teraflops of compute power. That in itself is nearly identical to the 10.28 teraflops found on Sony’s PlayStation 5, although Tesla’s total compute includes both the integrated and discrete GPUs so it won’t be a full 10 teraflops for gaming alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mQIlk8"&gt;We only saw a brief demo of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; running at high frame rates on the $130,000 Model S Plaid during Tesla’s event, alongside a closer look at the updated UI on the infotainment system. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Tesla-branded controller.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UlEpZm"&gt;In separate demonstrations after the event, some Tesla fans were able to get pictures of what appears to be a Tesla-branded game controller. It’s not clear if the controller, which mimics the shape of the car’s steering wheel, is a dummy unit or not. It appears alongside an Xbox controller in a photo published by &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/nx7ccw/cyberpunk_2077_running_on_the_model_s_plaid/"&gt;Reddit users&lt;/a&gt; (above), and videos seem to show the Xbox controller being used to play Cyberpunk 2077.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ORNRf5"&gt;You might be wondering why you’d need PS5-level gaming performance in your car, which the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331315/elon-musk-tesla-technoking-title-ceo"&gt;Technoking&lt;/a&gt; is happy to answer. “If you think about the future of where the car is often in autopilot or full self-driving mode, then entertainment is going to become increasing important,” said Musk. Until that’s a reality, we’re hoping to see the folks at &lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry&lt;/em&gt; benchmark a car running the latest AAA games against powerful PCs, the PS5, and the Xbox Series X.&lt;/p&gt;
