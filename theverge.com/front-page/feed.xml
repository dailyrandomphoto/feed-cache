    <title>Sony admits it made ‘wrong decision’ and will keep PS3, Vita stores open</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2y8tri"&gt;Sony has announced that it’ll be keeping its PS3 and PlayStation Vita digital storefront open “for the foreseeable future.” The PSP’s store will still be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356791/sony-playstation-store-close-ps3-vita-psp-game-downloads"&gt;shut down on July 2nd, 2021&lt;/a&gt;, as originally planned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ar3s3A"&gt;“Upon further reflection, however, it’s clear that we made the wrong decision here. So today I’m happy to say that we will be keeping the PlayStation Store operational for PS3 and PS Vita devices. PSP commerce functionality will retire on July 2, 2021 as planned,” Sony Interactive Entertainment president and CEO Jim Ryan &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/04/19/playstation-store-on-ps3-and-ps-vita-will-continue-operations/"&gt;announced in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wNCcRU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The PS3 and PS Vita stores will stay open “for the foreseeable future”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EkRNMm"&gt;Sony had originally announced that the digital storefronts for its legacy consoles would be shut down at the end of March, making it impossible for customers to purchase digital copies of games for those systems. Sony says that the move to discontinue to the storefronts was “born out of a number of factors, including commerce support challenges for older devices” along with a desire to focus more on newer products (like the PlayStation 5). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JP7jZE"&gt;Following the announcement, though — and the backlash from PS3 and PS Vita owners upset that they would no longer be able to buy new games — it seems that Sony has relented and will be keeping those stores open indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fitbit’s Luxe is a fashion-focused fitness band that costs $149.95</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Fitbit luxe" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1-iYQD2H-C8Pr97fzDQIQ8ivJSs=/0x0:5407x3605/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69150525/fitbitluxehero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fitbit’s Luxe comes in a few different finishes&lt;/em&gt; | Fitbit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LVjvfb"&gt;Fitbit has announced its new Luxe fitness tracker that looks like a more fashion-focused take on the Inspire 2. It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387591/fitbit-luxe-fitness-tracker-photo-leak-news"&gt;leaked last week&lt;/a&gt;, but Fitbit is making it official with the news that the Luxe is available for &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/vergeFitbit'sLuxeFashion04192021/https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products/trackers/luxe" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;preorder starting today&lt;/a&gt;, April 19th, for $149.95. This cost includes six months of the Fitbit Premium service, which usually costs $9.99 per month. The service recently launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22295768/fitbit-premium-mindful-method-deepak-chopra-wellness-series"&gt;the new Mindful Method program&lt;/a&gt; created by Deepak Chopra that packs in over 30 audio and video sessions on mindfulness and wellness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hKjKT1"&gt;A specific release date for the Luxe hasn’t been shared, but the company is aiming for a spring launch, so it shouldn’t be too long of a wait. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q0pKt9"&gt;The Luxe was designed for “a diverse range of wrist sizes and skin tones for 24/7 wear.” Fitbit says the Luxe is its thinnest touchscreen tracker yet, and the company thinks most people should be able to sleep comfortably with it on. To that end, you won’t need to charge it every night, as Fitbit claims it’ll last up to five days per charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vvbA7Y"&gt;The Luxe includes an interchangeable silicone strap with several size adjustments. Other straps will be available at launch, including silicone bands in a few colors for $29.95 each, woven fabric bands for $34.95, leather bands for $49.95, stainless steel mesh bands for $79.95, going all the way up to $99.95 for stainless steel link bracelets from luxury jewelry brand Gorjana. If you just want the Luxe with the Gorjana band, a limited-edition version of the tracker costing $199.95 will include one starting in June.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Fitbit Luxe" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XSNf92cLA0R9A_5x4C-GUN7K1f8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22454675/luxecopy.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fitbit Luxe in black.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wxtBvo"&gt;The Luxe is angled toward people who want their fitness tracker to be taken for jewelry. The company even went as far as using a metal injection molding process to craft the Luxe’s stainless steel case, which is apparently a traditional technique for jewelry-making. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OH6QH0"&gt;The Luxe is a buttonless tracker, and inputs are delegated to its color OLED touchscreen. Like its previous smartwatches and trackers, Fitbit’s Luxe will be supported for iOS and Android devices. It’ll also support Google Fast Pair to pair more quickly to Android devices. The Luxe supports connected GPS while paired to your phone, so you’ll need to bring your phone along if you want to track runs or walks. If having built-in GPS is important to you, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21199567/fitbit-charge-4-tracker-gps-nfc-spotify-sp02-announcement-price"&gt;Fitbit’s Charge 4&lt;/a&gt; includes that and other features like Fitbit Pay and Spotify controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8zyRLE"&gt;Fitbit is using this launch to announce that the Luxe, along with the company’s other heart rate-enabled trackers and watches, support the companion app’s Stress Management Score that assesses your activity level, sleep schedule, and heart rate to help you manage stress. Through the app, the Luxe can track a host of other metrics, like your breathing pattern, your resting and variable heart rate, skin temperature, mood, sleep, and menstrual cycles. Sometime after launch, it’ll be able to record your blood oxygen levels (Sp02).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="3nqSPo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to use your Fitbit to monitor your blood oxygen levels","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21113434/fitbit-blood-oxygen-levels-monitor-sleep-data-how-to"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Apex Legends Mobile is going into beta this month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vdP7Ua-8TNUEr3-Ie9EQQut0tqw=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69150509/ss_33caf1a7c20297bbca8bb434976a709d39e104af.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apex Legends.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OPYwtS"&gt;It’s been a long time since we’ve heard about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/7/18536028/apex-legends-iphone-android-mobile-ea-respawn"&gt;the mobile version of &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but we’ll be seeing more of it very soon: EA announced that a regional beta for the game will kick off later this month. Initially, the publisher says the game will only be available to “a few thousand players in India and the Philippines,” but the plan is to roll it out to more countries over the course of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5scQ7X"&gt;The company also provided some of the first details of the game. Most importantly, it won’t be a port of &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;, but instead a new version built for smartphones. “&lt;em&gt;Apex Legends Mobile&lt;/em&gt; is specially designed for touchscreens, with streamlined controls, and thoughtful optimizations that result in the most advanced battle royale combat available on a phone,” &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt; game director Chad Grenier wrote in a blog post. This also means it won’t feature any kind of crossplay or cross-progression. And like the PC and console version of the game, &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends &lt;/em&gt;will be free on mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="phTPJE"&gt;These kinds of mobile-exclusive spinoffs are becoming increasingly popular for big multiplayer games. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358213/league-of-legends-wild-rift-iphone-android-preview"&gt;Riot recently launched &lt;em&gt;Wild Rift&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a smartphone take on &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22345184/rocket-league-sideswipe-android-ios-announced"&gt;Psyonix is doing something similar with &lt;em&gt;Rocket League Sideswipe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt;, meanwhile, remains one of the most popular games in the world, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350782/pubg-mobile-one-billion-downloads-tencent"&gt;recently surpassing 1 billion downloads&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kvhqvw"&gt;The main version of &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22382560/apex-legends-100-million-players-respawn-ea"&gt;just hit a new milestone of 100 million players&lt;/a&gt;, and last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323591/apex-legends-switch-port-cross-progression-purchases-fortnite"&gt;the game expanded to the Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Toyota finally gets off its ass and announces a real electric vehicle strategy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JDc33gbW9ZK1SWrJgToPR3JaRZQ=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69150480/20210419_01_15.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0N7qsD"&gt;Toyota, an early pioneer in electrification that has since fallen far behind its competitors, finally announced an electric vehicle strategy that will result in 15 new battery-electric vehicles released by 2025. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VcbWev"&gt;The company, which helped pave the way for companies like Tesla and others by proving that vehicles with alternative powertrains could be immensely popular, also unveiled a new concept EV at the Shanghai Motor show called the BZ4X. The electric SUV concept will serve as a starting point for other models with the BZ (which stands for “Beyond Zero”) branding in the future. Toyota did not reveal any details or specifications for the BZ4X, but it did say the vehicle would be released in China and Japan later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RASDOu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Toyota said it would release 70 new models by 2025&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZU3koD"&gt;In total, Toyota said it would release 70 new models by 2025, including battery-electric, hydrogen fuel cell, and gas-electric hybrids, for a range of “diverse choices” for its customers. The company, which is the largest automaker in the world, will build these vehicles using the flexible platform that it developed in partnership with fellow Japanese automaker Subaru. (Toyota currently owns a small stake in Subaru.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MCZ45F"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10454306"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5PiWAs"&gt;The BZ4X will be built on this e-TNGA platform, which will enable several characteristics, including a steer-by-wire system, all-wheel drive, improved visibility, and a regenerative braking system that is common among electric vehicles. Toyota said the BZ4X would be released globally by the middle of 2022. Subaru is rumored to be designing its own electric vehicles built on the e-TNGA platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qHOmMl"&gt;Though it’s just a concept, the BZ4X looks to be close to completion. The interior of the car features a unique instrument cluster, with the screen set back from the steering wheel in a way that Toyota says will improve driver visibility. The central infotainment screen appears to be floating above the dash as opposed to embedded within it. And there are a number of physical buttons in the center console and on the steering wheel, proof that Toyota is not fully embracing the digital user experience like companies like Tesla. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rtby7U"&gt;Up until this point, Toyota has resisted fully embracing electric vehicles as the future of the auto industry, despite its status as an early adopter of battery-powered transportation. In its announcement, Toyota touted its success in the hybrid market, noting that it has sold 17 million “electrified vehicles” since the Prius’ release in 1997. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5NtLCf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Toyota has been content to rest on its laurels with the Prius&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WDyBfR"&gt;But while Toyota has been content to rest on its laurels with the Prius, the rest of the industry has lapped it several times. Companies like Nissan, General Motors, and Volkswagen have been selling pure battery-electric vehicles for years, while also revealing their plans to phase out gas cars completely. Toyota’s failure to embrace EVs is not a new concept; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/20/business/energy-environment/20electric.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; noted as much in this article from 2009&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mBKhh0"&gt;Meanwhile, Toyota’s top executives, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/12/17/toyota-ceo-lack-of-vision-spreads-ev-misinformation-spells-the-end/"&gt;including billionaire CEO Akio Toyoda&lt;/a&gt;, have been on the record calling the trend toward electric vehicles “overhyped” in part because of emissions associated with power plants — which is a favorite talking point used by the oil and gas industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TPrT5G"&gt;Of course, we’ll know more about how serious Toyota is in embracing electric vehicles when the company has more to say about powertrain details and range, as well as the types of vehicles it will be making. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Union says Amazon threatened layoffs in formal objection to election results</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WFfQx3kgMASGCVLEFGliBXjbLLo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69150299/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EPkFFp"&gt;The Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Union (RWDSU) has filed a formal objection to the results of a union election at an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama, alleging the e-commerce company threatened to lay off workers. The employees voted against unionizing in an April 9th vote, but the RWDSU is arguing that the results should be set aside because Amazon “created an atmosphere of confusion, coercion and/or fear of reprisals and thus interfered with the employees’ freedom of choice,” the union said in a news release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DGzL0t"&gt;“Amazon has left no stone unturned in its efforts to gaslight its own employees,” RWDSU president Stuart Appelbaum said in a statement Monday. “We won’t let Amazon’s lies, deception and illegal activities go unchallenged, which is why we are formally filing charges against all of the egregious and blatantly illegal actions taken by Amazon during the union vote today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uE4MSx"&gt;Amazon said in a statement that it was looking forward to the next steps in the legal process. “The fact is that less than 16% of employees at BHM1 voted to join a union,” the statement reads. “Rather than accepting these employees’ choice, the union seems determined to continue misrepresenting the facts in order to drive its own agenda.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="APYwV1"&gt;Workers voted by mail in February and March whether they wanted to join the RWDSU. Of the roughly 5,800 workers at the Bessemer warehouse, 3,041 voted in the election, with 1,798 workers voting against and 738 voting in favor, according to the NLRB. Known as BHM1, Bessmer is only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272213/amazon-union-bhm1-alabama-rwdsu-vote-begins"&gt;the second US Amazon facility&lt;/a&gt; to hold a union vote. If it had been approved, BHM1’s union would have been the biggest group to gain representation in a single NLRB election since 1991.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IMzyg"&gt;The RWSDU has a list of 23 objections it has filed with the NLRB. Among other things, the union claims Amazon threatened employees that the Bessemer warehouse would close if they joined a union, and that the company sent an email warning it would lay off workers if the union was voted in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KWS91a"&gt;It also alleges that Amazon installed a ballot collection box in the warehouse parking lot, creating the appearance that the company — rather than the NLRB — controlled the election, and it monitored the collection box via security cameras. An Amazon spokesperson said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the RWDSU allegations about the collection box are not accurate. “We said from the beginning that we wanted all employees to vote and proposed many different options to try and make it easy. The RWDSU fought those at every turn and pushed for a mail-only election, which the NLRB’s own data showed would reduce turnout,” the spokesperson said. “This mailbox—which only the USPS had access to—was a simple, secure, and completely optional way to make it easy for employees to vote, no more and no less.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qHv881"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/28/22352987/amazon-bessemer-alabama-union-vote-rwdsu"&gt;The mailbox was a major source of contention&lt;/a&gt; during the vote. According to the RWDSU, Amazon pressured workers to bring their ballots to work and put them in the collection box rather than sending ballots by mail and removed workers who supported the union from mandatory captive-audience training sessions. &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3anw9k/amazon-sends-vote-no-instructions-to-unionizing-employees-tells-them-to-use-new-mailbox"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; also reported&lt;/a&gt; that Amazon sent instructions to employees to vote “no” and told them to use the controversial mailbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hXbNX1"&gt;The union is seeking an investigation into what it says is behavior by Amazon that corrupted the election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MPoGNB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PQfTSa"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nFuIYq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NCUQEi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="IFONuk"&gt;Faraday Future was investigated by the Department of Labor in 2020, though the electric vehicle startup says the matter was “resolved,” according to a previously unreported passage in &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1805521/000121390021020004/fs42021_propertysolutions.htm"&gt;a recent regulatory filing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="emRwYP"&gt;The startup didn’t say what the investigation was about or how much it paid to resolve the legal matter. Faraday Future’s former chief lawyer has &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.793916/gov.uscourts.cacd.793916.1.0.pdf"&gt;claimed in a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; that the company was previously inspected by the Department of Homeland Security’s United States Citizenship and Immigration Services division in 2018, though the startup denied this in court filings. A spokesperson for Faraday Future declined to comment on the investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rRRJAk"&gt;The regulatory filing, known as the S-4 “registration statement,” was published as part of Faraday Future’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22247942/faraday-future-spac-merger-public-psac-property-solutions-nasdaq"&gt;merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC)&lt;/a&gt; called Property Solutions Acquisition Corp. When that merger is done, Faraday Future will be a publicly traded company and will have around $1 billion in fresh cash — capping a remarkable turnaround from the brink of bankruptcy and giving it the money it needs to finally try to put its high-performance, ultra-luxury electric SUV into production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PFXBhX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The filing offers the best X-ray of Faraday Future’s business to date&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="99J3KK"&gt;One of the trade-offs of going public is that you have to disclose far more information than you do as a private company. So this dense document not only offers the best X-ray of Faraday Future’s business to date, but it also sheds light on a number of other previously dark corners of the history of the troubled startup and its founder, Chinese tech tycoon Jia Yueting. Here are a few other things that stood out: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="YMcWqW"&gt;Jia Yueting is a risk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="b2aAT5"&gt;Jia has spent the last few years living in California after self-exiling himself from China, where he was named to a debtor blacklist following the collapse of his tech conglomerate LeEco. His habit of borrowing too much money &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/8/18130543/faraday-future-jia-yueting-leeco-leshi-debt-china"&gt;has left a trail of “debt bombs” that continues to haunt him to this day&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, the weight of that debt is what drove him to file for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2020/7/24/21310034/faraday-future-jia-yueting-bankruptcy-details-sovereign-wealth-fund"&gt;personal bankruptcy in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and now those companies he owed money to have small equity stakes in Faraday Future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="exOCIt"&gt;The way Jia &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2019/10/30/20879811/faraday-future-ceo-founder-jia-yueting-carsten-breitfeld-bankruptcy"&gt;tightened his grip&lt;/a&gt; on Faraday Future over the years is also what &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2017/12/12/16651026/faraday-future-investigation-money-debt-finances-yueting"&gt;led to many of the startup’s problems&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has previously reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TtUm1E"&gt;While Jia has been replaced as CEO, all of this baggage presents a risk to the company going forward — literally. Public companies have to list out all of the imaginable problems that investors should know about, and Jia has his own dedicated “risk factor.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="4bSWyo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Faraday Future’s founder has a lot of baggage&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hahefn"&gt;As that section reads, Jia’s “image will be closely associated with [Faraday Future’s] brand,” according to the filing, and the “media’s focus on negative coverage could materially and adversely affect FF’s valuation and investors’ confidence. Such negative publicity could also solicit inquiries from securities regulatory bodies in the relevant jurisdictions where FF does business.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l5UrOF"&gt;Jia is now Faraday Future’s “Chief Product and User Ecosystem Officer,” and he remains on the startup’s executive management committee. And repercussions from his actions continue to pop up, too, as just last week he was &lt;a href="https://www.caixinglobal.com/2021-04-14/jia-yueting-other-leshi-former-executives-banned-from-securities-market-for-life-101690802.html"&gt;banned for life from the securities market in China&lt;/a&gt; for “fraud” committed at LeEco. Faraday Future also says in the S-4 that its subsidiaries in China — many of them LeEco-related — are involved in around 90 legal disputes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="owq3zs"&gt;Faraday Future had just $1 million in the bank at the end of 2020 and suffered steep losses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LANhLK"&gt;Faraday Future has spent the last few years treading financial waters, and this new filing shows how close it was to going under. Previously, the best idea of how much cash the startup had on hand came from Jia’s bankruptcy filings, which showed that Faraday Future had around $6 million in the bank by July 2019. Now, we can see that Faraday Future finished 2019 with just $2.2 million in cash and 2020 with just $1.1 million in cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uXWTGi"&gt;Those are measly figures when compared to the annual losses Faraday Future has recently posted: $142 million in 2019 and $147 million in 2020. In its near seven-year history, Faraday Future has spent some $2 billion total without generating any revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="iCwmvM"&gt;Working with a restructuring firm in 2019 likely saved Faraday Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="025ArV"&gt;How did this startup survive for years with only that much cash in the bank and around $800 million in current liabilities? It took on more debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EMNlTu"&gt;Faraday Future is very possibly only still around because of a deal it struck in April 2019 with Birch Lake Associates, a Chicago-based merchant bank that advises restructurings and is run by what one expert &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18524108/faraday-future-bankruptcy-expert-birch-lake-loan"&gt;described to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; at the time&lt;/a&gt; as a “bankruptcy legend.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EdKxoK"&gt;Throughout the S-4, Birch Lake’s fingerprints are all over the last two years of Faraday Future. Birch Lake arranged to have tens of millions of dollars loaned to Faraday Future in 2019, shortly after the startup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/31/18162827/faraday-future-evergrande-settlement-restructuring-china-ev-investor"&gt;broke up with its biggest outside investor, Chinese conglomerate Evergrande&lt;/a&gt;. Birch Lake has also helped consolidate and refinance some of Faraday Future’s old debt that was either coming due or in default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="B3Pp9E"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The startup’s been working with a “bankruptcy legend” for two years to turn things around&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aKlGlH"&gt;One of the key things Birch Lake was involved in, though, was creating a so-called “vendor trust.” At the time that Birch Lake started working with Faraday Future, the startup owed more than $100 million to the suppliers of components for its electric SUV. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/28/18243015/faraday-future-money-lawsuits-employees"&gt;many of those suppliers weren’t getting paid&lt;/a&gt;. Since Faraday Future didn’t have much money, Birch Lake helped solve this by setting up a trust that let suppliers essentially exchange their debt claims for what became small ownership stakes in the startup, which could pay out if and when Faraday Future went public or got bought — a deal that probably looks much better now than when those companies took it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="b5ZXQv"&gt;A 2019 deal with a Chinese gaming company never went anywhere&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5cH00H"&gt;After it announced the deal with Birch Lake, Faraday Future also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/24/18279785/faraday-future-the9-china-car-investment-deal"&gt;announced a potential investment from Chinese gaming company The9&lt;/a&gt;. The two companies were supposed to start up a joint venture in China that would see The9 contribute up to $600 million and Faraday Future develop an electric minivan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SUsCjs"&gt;But neither side ever really spoke about that effort again following the announcement, and based on The9’s own financial filings, it’s been &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sokane1/status/1290746176350887942"&gt;clear since last August&lt;/a&gt; that the deal was dead. Faraday Future basically confirms this in its S-4, saying the deal is “dormant.” The9 &lt;em&gt;did &lt;/em&gt;make an initial deposit of $5 million when the companies agreed to the deal in 2019 as a commitment, but that’s since been converted to stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8OPKpU"&gt;(Another partnership with commercial powertrain company US Hybrid, &lt;a href="https://www.ff.com/us/press-room/ff-collaboration-with-US-hybrid/"&gt;announced in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, is mentioned nowhere in the S-4.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UFa9kC"&gt;Faraday Future and LeEco’s separate electric car efforts weren’t so separate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="uUL3L7"&gt;This likely won’t surprise anyone who has followed Faraday Future or Jia closely, but at one point, both of his companies were working on electric cars, seemingly at odds. As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/19/16334780/faraday-future-leeco-lesee-electric-car-patents"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/leecos-car-was-designed-by-faraday-future-employees-who-1790163868"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jalopnik&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/priya/turmoil-at-faraday-future#.ysKaOl7Ye"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;have reported, the two projects actually had a lot of overlap, despite the companies maintaining at the time that they were distinct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iJdSfH"&gt;But there’s a stark admission in the S-4 that finally drops the veil: LeSee, which was the brand for LeEco’s EV project, was treated as a subsidiary of Faraday Future and was considered the startup’s “primary Chinese operating entity.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="A77ZgN"&gt;Neither were their finances&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="TZAYiD"&gt;Another thing that has been previously reported, but now there are concrete details in the filing that partially describe some of the many loans Jia Yueting used to move money throughout his empire. Leview Mobile, a LeEco-related company, loaned $67 million to Faraday Future in 2018. LeSee, meanwhile, borrowed nearly $30 million from a Chinese entity controlled by Jia that also was the beneficial owner of Faraday Future’s Hong Kong subsidiary. In 2017, Faraday Future borrowed nearly $9 million from a small bank that Jia owned in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2CPdF5"&gt;Faraday Future also borrowed multiple times from unnamed employees starting in 2017 and running through 2020, ranging from as low as $700,000 and as high as multiple millions. In one case, Faraday Future says it borrowed $16 million from a company owned by an employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nNqjim"&gt;Jia’s bankruptcy filings also shed light on some of these loans in 2020, including the $16 million one, which was actually &lt;em&gt;originally &lt;/em&gt;funded by the company’s “&lt;a href="https://www.ff.com/us/press-room/a-letter-to-creditors/"&gt;global partners&lt;/a&gt;” committee but was first passed through a Delaware LLC whose president is Faraday Future’s head of investor relations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B9Urrj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nrlIRc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8uWOpU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will allow Parler to return to the App Store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ulNwuE"&gt;Apple will allow Parler to return to its App Store, according to a letter first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/19/tech/apple-parler-app-store/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNN &lt;/em&gt;on Monday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4TiBRO"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RepKenBuck/status/1384159186209054721?s=20"&gt;the letter&lt;/a&gt; addressed to Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO), Apple said “Parler has proposed updates to its app and the app’s content moderation practices” that would bring the app into compliance with the App Store’s rules. Now, Parler is allowed to return once it reintroduces the app to the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="59NFOy"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;On March 31, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SenMikeLee?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@SenMikeLee&lt;/a&gt; and I sent a letter demanding answers about why Apple removed Parler from the App Store.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Today, we received a response: Parler will be reinstated on the App Store. Huge win for free speech. &lt;a href="https://t.co/FQBDSSSFGk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/FQBDSSSFGk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Congressman Ken Buck (@RepKenBuck) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RepKenBuck/status/1384159186209054721?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JKLUfI"&gt;In January, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22221730/apple-removes-suspends-bans-parler-app-store"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221648/google-suspends-bans-parler-play-store"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; removed Parler, a conservative-favored social media app, following accusations that users of the app promoted violence ahead of and after a pro-Trump mob attacked the US Capitol. Before its ban, Apple demanded that Parler remove hateful and violent content from the app within 24 hours in order to remain on the App Store. Parler did not propose any changes, and so it was removed on January 9th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BLzN3z"&gt;Days later, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228675/amazon-parler-takedown-violent-threats-moderation-content-free-speech"&gt;Amazon dropped Parler, too&lt;/a&gt;, citing similar threats of violence. In doing so, Amazon effectively took Parler entirely offline until the site could find a replacement web host. Following Parler’s shutdown, the company’s CEO John Matze &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/03/02/973083119/former-parler-ceo-matze-stripped-of-all-company-shares-upon-firing-sources-say"&gt;was fired&lt;/a&gt; from the company and later stripped of all his shares. Parler found a new web host and went &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/15/22284036/parler-social-network-relaunch-new-hosting"&gt;back online&lt;/a&gt; in February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pAOjEP"&gt;Apple’s decision to bring back Parler comes just days &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22376127/apple-senate-judiciary-hearing-klobuchar-app-store-google-play-antitrust"&gt;before the company&lt;/a&gt; is set to testify before Congress regarding its App Store practices. Google will also be sending a witness to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/11/22378697/apple-witness-senate-judiciary-hearing-antitrust-app-stores"&gt;testify at the hearing&lt;/a&gt; scheduled for Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reddit Talk is a Clubhouse competitor for subreddits</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r3cBS3FdxJbJ7FqKds7OPsaqZ1o=/11x0:2008x1331/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69150177/e2shqcw2h5u61__1_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Reddit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rolG65"&gt;Reddit unveiled its take on a Clubhouse-like social audio product on Monday, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/mu3f0x/lets_talk_get_a_sneak_preview_of_reddit_talk_and/"&gt;called Reddit Talk&lt;/a&gt;. The company is billing Monday’s announcement as a “sneak preview,” since the feature isn’t widely available yet. Moderators that want to try the feature out in their subreddit can add themselves to a waitlist for access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hsZnvM"&gt;Based on Reddit’s description and images shared by the company, Reddit Talk appears to look a lot like Clubhouse, Twitter Spaces, and other social audio products. Talks will “live” within subreddits, according to Reddit. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rcZgVtGaF0lMi6xgEs1s91JJBoY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22454636/bcykx1isg5u61__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Reddit&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reddit’s new Talk feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pkMkCT"&gt;During the initial tests, only subreddit moderators will be able to initiate a Talk, and Talk hosts will have the ability to invite, mute, and remove speakers. While only mods can kick off Talks in the beginning, anyone on iOS and Android can listen to one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4CbLWJ"&gt;Moderation has been an issue for Clubhouse, so it’s notable that Reddit is starting small and giving access only to moderators first. At some point in the future, mods will be able to bring on trusted community members as co-hosts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DfUEHti2CyHQE-JcdFvqVLqumdI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22454638/91jj01hxg5u61.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Reddit&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reddit Talk mod tools.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k5Widi"&gt;The company says it is “testing ways” for hosts to customize how Talks look with emojis and different background colors, and users will be able to change their avatar, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YjyrQU"&gt;Reddit joins &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22363221/twitter-spaces-desktop-web-browsers-clubhouse"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/slack-wants-to-be-more-than-a-text-based-messaging-platform/"&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22356682/discord-stage-channels-clubhouse-like-feature-voice"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22359332/linkedin-clubhouse-clone-social-audio-networking-room"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356993/spotify-locker-room-clubhouse-launch-acquisition"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt; in announcing a social audio feature. &lt;em&gt;Mashable&lt;/em&gt; first broke word that Reddit was working on a social audio feature &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/article/reddit-clubhouse-voice-chat/"&gt;on April 9th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bJDjD9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 19th, 12:33PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Reddit clarified after publishing that the waitlist is intended only for moderators. Also added that mods will be able to bring on community members as co-hosts in the future.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon buys nine ULA rocket launches for its space internet satellites</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An Atlas V rocket with NASA’s Perseverance Mars rover..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BlA1b6PU6YCF76Z46WQRJpPO9MM=/0x0:4071x2714/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69150092/1227844386.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Paul Hennessy / SOPA Images / LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5iTDtw"&gt;Amazon bought nine launches from the Boeing-Lockheed joint venture United Launch Alliance to send its internet-beaming Kuiper satellites into space, the companies announced. It is Amazon’s first launch agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mZ3jpC"&gt;The deal is for ULA’s workhorse Atlas 5 rocket. An Amazon spokesman declined to say how many satellites each launch will carry or how often they will launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZCuDqz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon pledged to invest $10 billion into the Kuiper program last year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1o1vLZ"&gt;Amazon is planning to build a so-called constellation of 3,236 satellites in space to bring internet to rural parts of the world that have little to no connectivity. It’ll also serve as a major infrastructure boost to its mammoth cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services. But details on the network have been scant since the Federal Communications Commission &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348768/fcc-amazon-kuiper-satellite-constellation-approval"&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; the company’s network for launch in July 2020. The competition is stiff, too: both OneWeb and Elon Musk’s SpaceX are also deploying broadband internet networks in low-Earth orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LjRRYF"&gt;The FCC requires Amazon to launch at least half of its Kuiper network — roughly 1,618 satellites — by July 2026. The Atlas 5 missions will help Amazon meet that goal, but the company could use other rockets as well. SpaceX, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22388378/elon-musk-starlink-satellite-internet-service-moving-vehicles-trucks-2021"&gt;far ahead&lt;/a&gt; of Amazon with its own internet constellation, has been using its Falcon 9 rocket to ferry 1,355 of 12,000 satellites for its Starlink network so far. OneWeb has launched 146 of its roughly 650 satellites planned for its network. And another company, Telesat, plans to launch 300 satellites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bx8OOX"&gt;Amazon’s Kuiper satellites are designed to fit atop different types of rockets, but the ULA deal provides Amazon with a “capable, reliable rocket” for its first Kuiper launches, Amazon’s VP of technology for Project Kuiper, Rajeev Badyal, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="amONQj"&gt;Kuiper satellites will orbit Earth at an altitude range of 590 to 630 kilometers (or 366 to 391 miles). Amazon says Kuiper prototypes have proved speeds of up to 400Mbps, “and performance will continue to improve in future iterations.” Last year, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178235/amazon-project-kuiper-user-terminal-antenna-internet-satellite-constellation"&gt;unveiled&lt;/a&gt; designs for the antennas customers will use to tap into Kuiper internet. Those antennas can also connect to other satellites in geostationary orbits, or deeper orbits at least 22,000 miles away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IeDsaV"&gt;Amazon pledged to invest $10 billion into the program last year — roughly the same investment SpaceX has said it’s making for Starlink. In its statement on Monday, the company said it has over 500 people working on Kuiper and that its “team is heavily focused on inventing new technology to make broadband more affordable and more accessible for customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KsRUBO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A win for ULA&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xISZw8"&gt;Blue Origin, Jeff Bezos’ space company, is in the late stages of developing a heavy-lift rocket dubbed New Glenn. Though Amazon could still pick New Glenn in the future, the rocket isn’t ready yet. Instead, Amazon is working with ULA, a company with ties to Blue Origin: its upcoming Vulcan rocket is powered by the same Blue Origin-made engines in New Glenn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I2l0mB"&gt;The deal is a win for ULA, an industry heavyweight that has fallen behind SpaceX for commercial launches. While SpaceX has launched at least two commercial missions this year, ULA hasn’t launched anything. SpaceX’s reusable rockets are cheaper than ULA’s — even though ULA has slashed its Atlas 5 prices to as low as $100 million from as much as $187 million. But SpaceX is, of course, Amazon’s satellite competition, which may have made a SpaceX rocket less palatable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LwmZ1E"&gt;Low-Earth orbit, a shallow orbital layer where all these companies’ internet satellites will operate, is already getting crowded as SpaceX speeds ahead with Starlink deployment. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22374262/oneweb-spacex-satellites-dodged-potential-collision-orbit-space-force"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; this month that OneWeb recently made SpaceX disable its automated collision avoidance system when two of their satellites were projected to collide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PPhUxy"&gt;Industry competitors, including Amazon, have criticized SpaceX’s collision avoidance system for not sharing with other operators how it will move a Starlink satellite in the event of a potential collision. Analysts say rules requiring cooperation in orbit are a must, especially as Amazon aims to launch thousands of satellites in the same orbital neighborhood as SpaceX.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Let’s talk to Sen. Ed Markey about fixing the internet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NKsu6OdbfC4WoHuApq9dlivw8mE=/0x0:1820x1213/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69150086/VER_VergeLive_Article.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xu6vIF"&gt;In January, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22216843/georgia-runoff-net-neutrality-fcc-jon-ossoff-raphael-warnock-democrats-senate"&gt;the future looked bright for net neutrality&lt;/a&gt;. After a surprise victory in the Georgia special elections, Democrats gained a majority in the Senate, opening the door for aggressive new Federal Communications Commission leadership that could reinstate net neutrality by regulatory order. There was even talk of passing a bill that would enshrine net neutrality in law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="3Eq4SG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10454209"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VDZaaI"&gt;In the three months since then, not much has happened. Preoccupied with the pandemic, the Biden White House has focused on shepherding through its relief and rebuilding efforts, a pair of massive spending bills that require every bit of political capital Democrats can spare. As a result, even basic measures like appointing a new FCC chair have taken a back seat to more urgent matters. But that may finally be changing, with rumblings from the FCC and Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/1/18206984/net-neutrality-bill-congress-new-fcc-markey"&gt;poised to introduce a net neutrality bill in Congress in the months to come&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JOPafK"&gt;In a new &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; Live event on May 12th, we’ll dive into the net neutrality fight and the broader progressive effort to upgrade America’s internet. With so much of Washington focused on infrastructure, there’s never been a better time to take stock of the broadband gap and the various ways the government can make sure America stays online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zeG3qG"&gt;After a few opening words from &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; editor-in-chief Nilay Patel, we’ll have a conversation with Markey, talking through the path forward for net neutrality in this Congress. Just like our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22287443/section-230-amy-klobuchar-internet-regulation-panel-event-sign-up"&gt;March event&lt;/a&gt;, the whole thing will be virtual, but you’ll be able to drop questions in a chat room if there’s anything you want to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yUiusy"&gt;We won’t be posting the full video publicly, so the only way to see it is to &lt;a href="https://www.voxmediaevents.com/thevergeliveinfrastructure/article"&gt;sign up here&lt;/a&gt;. We hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
