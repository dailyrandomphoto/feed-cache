    <title>Facebook and Instagram ban Trump for 24 hours</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YfK6fi"&gt;Facebook has blocked President Trump from posting on the site for 24 hours, the company said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fbnewsroom/status/1346994037786619905"&gt;Wednesday evening&lt;/a&gt;. The decision comes after the company already removed posts he made in support of the pro-Trump mob that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217411/capitol-building-lockdown-protesters-trump-supporters"&gt;attacked the US Capitol&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jP7qdn"&gt;“We’ve assessed two policy violations against President Trump’s Page which will result in a 24-hour feature block, meaning he will lose the ability to post on the platform during that time,” the statement reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nwvDbu"&gt;Trump’s account on Facebook-owned Instagram will also be locked for 24 hours, Instagram head Adam Mosseri &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1346999536447795202"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SZs23P"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We've assessed two policy violations against President Trump's Page which will result in a 24-hour feature block, meaning he will lose the ability to post on the platform during that time.&lt;/p&gt;— Facebook Newsroom (@fbnewsroom) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fbnewsroom/status/1346994037786619905?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OlSeXy"&gt;Earlier on Wednesday, Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217788/facebook-remove-trump-video-emergency-situation-mob-violence"&gt;removed a video&lt;/a&gt; posted hours after the attack began where Trump called on protestors to “go home” and stated falsely that “we had an election that was stolen from us.” The company also removed a text post asking his supporters to “remember this day forever!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2P7IMq"&gt;Twitter has also restricted Trump on its platform, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217686/trump-twitter-account-locked-capitol-hill-riot-tweets-policy-violations"&gt;locking his account&lt;/a&gt; for 12 hours after removing three tweets that the company said were “severe violations” of its policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ElwHtg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, Jan 7th, 9:05PM:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added confirmation of the lock on Trump’s Instagram account.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s 2021 Gram laptops feature Intel’s 11th-Gen processors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZYP8bR75WX8_UONA02dG-LcaHok=/73x0:928x570/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68630631/2021_LG_gram_Lineup.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3xGBJN"&gt;LG has announced its 2021 lineup of Gram laptops, which feature a new design as well as some internal upgrades. There are five models. They include three clamshells (the Gram 17, the Gram 16, and the Gram 14) as well as two convertible models (the Gram 2-in-1 16 and the Gram 2-in-1 14). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kU5l3X"&gt;LG hasn’t changed the Gram lineup’s signature features. LG Gram laptops are known for being astonishingly light (hence the name “Gram”). The Gram 17 is just 2.98 pounds, the same weight as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21310392/lg-gram-17-review-display-weight-specs-price-features"&gt;its predecessor.&lt;/a&gt; It’s highly unusual to see a 17-inch laptop under three pounds, and using one really messes with your mind — I always felt like I was carrying nothing when holding the 2020 model, because I expected it to feel so much heavier. The Gram 16 is just 2.62 pounds, while the 14 is 2.2 pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UlydKh5vHtwyS99hN3AjtWRfhCE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22218831/2021_LG_gram_17Z90P_Silver.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The LG Gram 17 in white.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="P2vKUI"&gt;Another great feature of the 2020 Gram 17, which has carried over to the 2021 model, was the 16:10 display. It offers more vertical space than a traditional 16:9 panel. In addition, LG says the new clamshell models have a new “four-sided slim bezel design” which achieves a screen-to-body ratio of 90 percent. As is evident from the photos LG provided, the bezels look pretty small, which gives the whole thing a nice modern vibe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f7uqkq"&gt; LG also says the keyboard and touchpad have been enlarged “for comfort and efficiency.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RI0F4QwlFlcutPRv05DaT6ouUlQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22218827/2021_LG_gram_17Z90P_Black.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The LG Gram 17 in black.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uCTOXN"&gt;The most significant upgrades are inside. All of the new Gram laptops have Intel’s 11th-Gen Core processors and can come with Iris Xe graphics or UHD graphics. All of the models are also certified through Intel’s Evo program, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21408718/intel-11th-gen-tiger-lake-cpu-processor-announcement-laptops-fall"&gt;which is an Intel badge&lt;/a&gt; meant to certify the laptop can get at least nine hours of battery life, wake from sleep quickly, and other features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XC1Kn8"&gt;LG claims you could see up to 19.5 hours from the Gram 17, Gram 16, and 16 2-in-1. That’s a claim I’d usually be skeptical of, but I will say the 2020 Gram 17 had some of the longest battery life I saw from a laptop last year. It lasted around 10 hours of my daily workload (which is fairly intense). So LG knows what it’s doing when it comes to efficiency, and there’s reason for optimism.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DwLs_363qy7biMPV0IOMniJ7shQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22218833/2021_LG_gram_17Z90P_White.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MYMraU"&gt;“Synonymous with unprecedented portability and first-class performance, the LG gram brand continues to raise the bar for the ultra-lightweight and slim laptop market,” said Jang Ik-hwan, LG senior vice president and head of the company’s IT business unit, in a statement. “With sleeker, more refined designs and 16:10 aspect ratio displays while maintaining their light weight, our latest LG gram lineup gives consumers the ability to enjoy better productivity and more immersive viewing experiences wherever they go.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVRapV"&gt;Pricing and availability are still to be announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YzUcbj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony is going to start selling its Mandalorian-like virtual set displays</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Image of an actress standing in front of a display wall being used as a virtual set" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KaUVl9wFwpWFRvMfjCETLJ49N0k=/99x0:1194x730/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68630572/4_application_virtual_sets_H_2021_1609869131_compressed.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sony Electronics&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gbcWIc"&gt;Sony &lt;a href="https://pro.sony/ue_US/press/crystal-led-c-and-b-series-launch"&gt;has announced that it’s going to start selling&lt;/a&gt; a series of modular displays that can be used to create digital movie sets (&lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/sony-unveils-crystal-led-displays-for-virtual-production"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;. If this kind of technology seems familiar, it may be because Industrial Light &amp;amp; Magic and Epic Games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21145671/mandalorian-sets-stagecraft-epic-games-ilm-fortnite-baby-yoda-digital"&gt;built similar sets to help create &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RBl9Ah"&gt;They displays are part of Sony’s Crystal LED line, which are modular panels that use MicroLEDs, and were previously marketed as being used for signage. The screen tech and modularity means that you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/6/18168793/samsungs-75-inch-microled-4k-tv-pitcure-quality-ces-2019"&gt;make enormous displays using a bunch of panels connected to a controller&lt;/a&gt;. That’s useful if you’re trying to create a virtual set out of displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1XJGDS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;They get quite bright&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wGnrih"&gt;The ones announced today are part of the new B-series, and are marketed as being useful for movie production: they’ve got an anti-reflective coating, and they’re bright. Sony says they can operate at 1,800 nits. Apple’s Pro Display XDR tops out at 1,600 nits, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161487/apple-mac-pro-display-xdr-review-6k-lcd-screen-price-features"&gt;it’s an incredibly bright screen&lt;/a&gt;. (The “XDR” in Apple’s Pro Display XDR actually stands for “extended dynamic range,” a function of how bright it can get.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z6DPOH"&gt;One benefit to building your backdrop out of displays is that the light they emit makes it easier to convince the audience that your actors are actually &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;. With traditional green screen sets, the background is a flat, solid color, and you have to light your actors as if the background actually exists. When you’re using screens, however, the background is already there, and providing light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6sZsqF"&gt;As a totally made-up example, let’s imagine a character sitting in a desert at sunset. If you &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yNkBic7GfI"&gt;were shooting this on a green screen&lt;/a&gt;, you’d have to have a bunch of lights set up to simulate how the actor would look if they were actually outside. However, if you’re using screens, you could mostly rely on those to generate that light for you, making it easier to get a realistic-looking shot (you can see it happening in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUnxzVOs3rk"&gt;this behind-the scenes video&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="K6MOS9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How The Mandalorian teamed up with Fortnite creator Epic Games to create its digital sets","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21145671/mandalorian-sets-stagecraft-epic-games-ilm-fortnite-baby-yoda-digital"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="OdmyPB"&gt;Using displays can also mean more realistic reflections. If our hypothetical character in the example was wearing, say, a slightly reflective helmet, and we were shooting on a green screen, it would reflect that green color. Visual effects artists would have to go back in later and make it look like the helmet was actually reflecting the desert. With the screens, however, the helmet can reflect the images being displayed around it, no post-work required. When I was making short films in school, we’d use regular old TVs to get reflections and avoid doing post-work, but you can imagine these panels would produce slightly better results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tFSMGk"&gt;Sony says these displays are capable of high frame rates and 3D, so the there’s a lot of flexibility in what kind of signal you can feed them. It’s planning to make them available “in the summer,” but hasn’t released a price yet. Given that these are professional-grade products (the B-series was “developed in collaboration with Sony Pictures Entertainment,” Sony’s movie production arm), it’s probably an “if you have to ask, you can’t afford it” situation. But even if you won’t be buying one yourself, you might soon be watching movies and shows produced using them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A7qvTv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It’s time to deplatform Trump</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Trump Supporters Hold “Stop The Steal” Rally In DC Amid Ratification Of Presidential Election" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0A9Su1SU1NxPmib4jVCOJqVesF0=/0x1:4500x3001/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68630545/1230454607.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Samuel Corum / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;He incited a riot against Congress — Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube should remove him&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Mcj0P7"&gt;As you no doubt already know, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/01/06/us/electoral-vote#protesters-capitol-hill"&gt;today, President Trump incited his followers to storm the US Capitol&lt;/a&gt;, where they disrupted the constitutionally mandated certification of the Electoral College ballots, affirming Joe Biden’s victory against him. Odds that his ongoing attempted coup will succeed remain low, but not impossible. And a bedrock belief that many of us have carried all our lives — that American democracy will long outlast us — has never been so shaken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7EDyGN"&gt;Yesterday, &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/the-next-phase-of-the-misinformation"&gt;I wrote about the sense that the fracture in our shared sense of reality seems to be accelerating&lt;/a&gt;. I asked whether platforms ought to take it as a moral responsibility to reverse that divide — and, if so, how. Today, I advocate for one smaller but still difficult and essential step in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s3tJyo"&gt;It’s time for Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube to remove Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MCdUHm"&gt;Calls for platforms to remove Trump have been coming for years. The president’s use and abuse of Twitter to threaten nuclear war, attack average citizens, and undermine elections have been a defining feature of the media landscape since his 2016 campaign. Twitter has aided and abetted the president for years, putting him on its suggested user list even as he promoted the birtherism conspiracy and spread other racist lies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="V5Miq0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The only question is how much damage he will do in the meantime&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RCxcJS"&gt;In February 2017, a year into Trump’s presidency, &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; executive editor TC Sottek called on Twitter to pull the plug. “Twitter is not an internet service provider or anything resembling a utility,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/24/14561306/ban-donald-trump-twitter"&gt;he wrote&lt;/a&gt;. “It has no obligation to behave like a neutral party; in fact, given its unique position to influence Trump’s behavior, it arguably has a moral obligation to take action.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nVFl2"&gt;What Sottek wrote is true. But for years, I opposed Twitter and others deplatforming the president. My reasons were largely practical ones. Surely, the president would decamp to a smaller site if banned; surely, a Twitter bot would scrape and instantly tweet anything he posted elsewhere, largely defeating the point of a ban. As irritating as the move surely would have been to Trump, I thought, the gesture would largely have been symbolic. And at the end of the day, the man was the duly elected president.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nffMkl"&gt;No longer. Americans voted Trump out of office, but instead of accepting that result, he has sought to overturn it. By inciting the violent occupation of the US Capitol, Trump has given up any legitimate claim to power. In 14 days, barring catastrophe, he will be out of office. The only question is how much damage he will do in the meantime — and we know, based on long experience, that his Twitter and Facebook accounts will be among his primary weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nu8sSu"&gt;“There have been good arguments for private companies to not silence elected officials, but all those arguments are predicated on the protection of constitutional governance,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexstamos/status/1346932573235077121"&gt;said Alex Stamos&lt;/a&gt;, former chief security officer at Facebook. “Twitter and Facebook have to cut him off. There are no legitimate equities left and labeling won’t do it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyjpGe"&gt;The platforms did take some steps today to limit the president’s reach. In a less than half-hearted effort to encourage his mob to abandon the Capitol, Trump posted a chaotic, lie-filled address to Twitter and Facebook. “We love you,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ddale8/status/1346937267785494534?s=21"&gt;he told the mob&lt;/a&gt;. “You’re very special.” Twitter initially labeled the video as disputed and prevented it from being liked or retweeted, though quote-tweets still allowed it to spread far and wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="kXR7NR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Enough is enough&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="09jjY2"&gt;Facebook took it down. “We removed it because on balance we believe it contributes to rather than diminishes the risk of ongoing violence,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/guyro/status/1346950532372393985"&gt;said Guy Rosen&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s head of integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rEg0AG"&gt;Then Twitter took it down, too. (And ultimately &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/twittersafety/status/1346970431039934464?s=21"&gt;suspended the president’s account&lt;/a&gt; for at least 12 hours.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hwf4Nq"&gt;Later in the day, Trump celebrated the attack on his own government. “Remember this day forever!” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1346954970910707712?s=21"&gt;he tweeted&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gBMmzi"&gt;That appalling message could alone be grounds for removal from the platform. But the problem goes far beyond any one post. We know by now that there will always be more and worse posts to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5rkS2t"&gt;And the rot runs deep. In a Facebook &lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/burn-the-chambers-stop-the-steal-facebook-groups-erupt-amidst-capitol-building-siege-3844992f71f"&gt;“Stop the Steal” group, a user called for the mob to “Burn the chambers!”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7ankz/neo-nazi-accelerationists-celebrating-attack-on-congress-as-start-of-civil-war"&gt; On Telegram, neo-Nazi accelerationists heralded the arrival of a second Civil War&lt;/a&gt;. And inside the Capitol, the terrorists stopped for selfies and broadcast themselves live on the platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="67SNNX"&gt;It was a coup that was designed for, and helped made possible by, social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mFjJcF"&gt;The violence should not only or even primarily be attributed to the big platforms. As Jane Lytvynenko and Molly Hensley-Clancy reported at &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/janelytvynenko/trump-rioters-planned-online"&gt;today’s violence has been planned in the open on niche web forums and conservative alt-network Parler&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zaSBsk"&gt;But the big platforms also played a role, they wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="zuqmfE"&gt;Even on mainstream social media channels like Twitter and TikTok, calls for violence were easy to find. According to Advanced Democracy, more than half QAnon-related accounts on Twitter — about 20,800 — mentioned Jan. 6, although the majority of the posts didn’t explicitly call for violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="6DFbQX"&gt;Enough is enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pFWM6i"&gt;Trump ought to be removed from office. He ought to be prosecuted for his crimes. And so should the insurrectionists who stormed the Capitol and sought to end our democracy. (Instead, most of them appear to have walked away without so much as being arrested.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="YhTbJc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Losing the ability to tweet is not nearly the punishment Trump and his enablers deserve for putting our entire democracy at risk&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CnQCBH"&gt;Given the stakes here, whether the president has access to his social media accounts is and at most a secondary concern. But I cover the intersection of tech platforms and democracy, and what platforms can and should do for our democracy today is to finally pull the most powerful lever they have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Az2TP"&gt;They will have elected officials of both parties on their side. Republican Sen. Mitt Romney called today’s events “an insurrection, incited by the President of the United States.” William Cohen, a former Republican senator, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kevin_stank/status/1346940527141412864?s=21"&gt;called for the Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment&lt;/a&gt;. So did the anarchist liberal firebrands over at, uh, &lt;a href="https://www.nam.org/manufacturers-call-on-armed-thugs-to-cease-violence-at-capitol-11628/?stream=series-press-releases"&gt;the National Association of Manufacturers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZwBBm6"&gt;Across the aisle, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) announced she would draw up articles of impeachment. “It’s a matter of preserving our Republic,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ilhanmn/status/1346934098384793606?s=21"&gt;she said&lt;/a&gt;, “and we need to fulfill our oath.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="xZ6SP9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;millions of people have been deplatformed for far less than what Trump has done&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YWX5QA"&gt;Indeed, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adamdavidson/status/1346959200660893696?s=21"&gt;advocating for the overthrow of the government is a crime&lt;/a&gt;, even and especially when it is the president advocating the overthrow. Losing the ability to tweet is not nearly the punishment Trump and his enablers deserve for putting our entire democracy at risk. But today’s events have made it clearer than ever before that doing so is not just possible, but necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="huowXR"&gt;No one should be under the illusion that deplatforming Trump will end the erosion of our democracy. But we saw today that Trump’s continued presence will accelerate it. And should he leave office with his platform intact, he can immediately declare his candidacy for president in 2024 and use it to further escalate his attacks on the republic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WrEhfe"&gt;If there is to be any silver lining in today’s awful events in Silicon Valley today, it should be that they give the people running our platforms a new moral clarity about their role in world events. Deplatforming is a step not to be taken lightly. But millions of people have been deplatformed for far less than what Trump has done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dIrEH8"&gt;The time has come for Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube to act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="KUddlK"&gt;Ban Trump now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="SIhocG"&gt;
&lt;p id="qN76Nj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This column was co-published with &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Platformer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a daily newsletter about Big Tech and democracy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter says Trump’s account is locked, and he’s facing a ban</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="74gQVf"&gt;Twitter is locking President Donald Trump’s account for 12 hours after removing three tweets that contained “repeated and severe violations” of its civic integrity policy. It says the account will be permanently suspended if violations continue, and it will not be unlocked unless Trump entirely deletes the three offending tweets. The decision comes after Trump &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217697/twitter-trump-facebook-restrict-violence-tweet-video-capitol-riot-maga"&gt;tweeted a video&lt;/a&gt; that Twitter said posed a “risk of violence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KMShP0"&gt;“As a result of the unprecedented and ongoing violent situation in Washington, DC, we have required the removal of three @realDonaldTrump tweets that were posted earlier today for repeated and severe violations of our Civic Integrity policy,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1346970431039934464"&gt;the Twitter Safety account tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. “This means that the account of @realDonaldTrump will be locked for 12 hours following the removal of these Tweets. If the Tweets are not removed, the account will remain locked. Future violations of the Twitter Rules, including our Civic Integrity or Violent Threats policies, will result in permanent suspension of the @realDonaldTrump account.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5rFgcf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Future violations of the Twitter Rules, including our Civic Integrity or Violent Threats policies, will result in permanent suspension of the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@realDonaldTrump&lt;/a&gt; account.&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1346970432017031178?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="b1E3NI"&gt;Trump has repeatedly tested the policies of social media networks, but his messages have at times received special treatment because of his status. Twitter restricted, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/29/21274323/trump-twitter-glorifying-violence-minneapolis-shooting-looting-notice-restriction"&gt;did not remove&lt;/a&gt;, a proclamation that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts” under its rules against glorifying violence. It cited a rule that treats statements from world leaders as particularly noteworthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HJFWiw"&gt;Now, however, Twitter said that the policy was no longer its top priority. “Our public interest policy — which has guided our enforcement action in this area for years — ends where we believe the risk of harm is higher and/or more severe,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1346970433049022471"&gt;Twitter said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CBeBvr"&gt;Since Trump’s election loss, the possibility of a ban has loomed online. Twitter confirmed that it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/7/21552606/trump-twitter-world-leader-public-interest-exception-ends-january-loss"&gt;no longer grant&lt;/a&gt; his account special status after January 20th at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gQJoT0"&gt;Resentment of social media moderation has driven Trump’s policy agenda, even as his popularity on social media has contributed to his success as a politician. Last year he signed an order &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/29/21273191/trump-twitter-social-media-censorship-executive-order-analysis-bias"&gt;undercutting legal protections&lt;/a&gt; for apps and websites to punish Facebook, Twitter, and Google for perceived bias against his accounts. He later attempted to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197796/trump-ndaa-veto-section-230-defense-bill-facebook-twitter"&gt;block a multibillion-dollar defense spending bill&lt;/a&gt; because it did not include a repeal of the aforementioned protections.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>In photos: the pro-Trump mob’s invasion of Congress</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LHPdmkI4qUtO2dtO67CNHYdHtMw=/0x13:2020x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68630266/GettyImages_1230453975.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Supporters of US President Donald Trump protest inside the US Capitol on January 6th, 2021, in Washington, DC. Demonstrators breached security and entered the Capitol as Congress debated the 2020 presidential Electoral Vote Certification. &lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Saul Loeb / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;As seen from inside the Capitol building&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="zudOLi"&gt;On Wednesday afternoon, a mob of pro-Trump protesters stormed the US Capitol, resulting in chambers being vandalized and at least one death. The attack came in the middle of an ongoing vote to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election, and it sent both lawmakers and members of the press scrambling for safety. Some found discreet paths out of the building, while others took shelter in the tunnels beneath the Capitol. But some photojournalists wandered the halls of the Capitol alongside the intruders, capturing stunning images of the mob at work. With police struggling to bring the nation’s capital under control, those images gave us a first-hand look at the chaos and disgrace of today’s events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>Facebook declares ‘emergency situation’ and removes Trump video</title>

  &lt;p id="7Zq9fM"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217411/capitol-building-lockdown-protesters-trump-supporters"&gt;As rioters attacked the US Capitol&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, Facebook removed a video from President Donald Trump responding to the violence. The decision came around an hour after the video was posted on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qKxwZE"&gt;“This is an emergency situation and we are taking appropriate emergency measures, including removing President Trump’s video,” said Guy Rosen, Facebook vice president of integrity, in a tweet Wednesday. “We removed it because on balance we believe it contributes to rather than diminishes the risk of ongoing violence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UaLv6j"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is an emergency situation and we are taking appropriate emergency measures, including removing President Trump's video. We removed it because on balance we believe it contributes to rather than diminishes the risk of ongoing violence.&lt;/p&gt;— Guy Rosen (@guyro) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/guyro/status/1346950532372393985?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6RKGut"&gt;In Trump’s video, he responded to the mob violence descending on the US Capitol as lawmakers were set to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election. In the minute-long clip, Trump called on rioters to peacefully “go home” hours after the initial invasion began. He also made false claims that the most recent US election results were fraudulent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o4gmSh"&gt;“We had an election that was stolen from us,” Trump stated falsely in the video. “It was a landslide election and everyone knows it, especially the other side. But you have to go home now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JnyGq8"&gt;Less than an hour later, Facebook also removed a text post from Trump, which sought to justify the attack, telling supporters to “remember this day forever!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="FdcDUK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Twitter pulls Trump video that it said posed a ‘risk of violence’ ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217697/twitter-trump-facebook-restrict-violence-tweet-video-capitol-riot-maga"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside id="7aSiE7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"YouTube removes Trump video addressing Capitol attack ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217743/trump-capitol-attack-youtube-video-removed-twitter-facebook-moderation"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="li1aEt"&gt;Facebook placed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217697/twitter-trump-facebook-restrict-violence-tweet-video-capitol-riot-maga"&gt;a handful of labels&lt;/a&gt; on Trump’s video before finally deciding to remove it altogether. These previous labels focused on debunking Trump’s claims that the 2020 presidential election was fraudulent. YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217743/trump-capitol-attack-youtube-video-removed-twitter-facebook-moderation"&gt;also removed&lt;/a&gt; the video, saying in a tweet, “Like other companies, we’re allowing these videos because discussion of election results &amp;amp; the process of counting votes is allowed on YT. These videos are not being surfaced or recommended in any prominent way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gvLubB"&gt;In a blog &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/01/responding-to-the-violence-in-washington-dc/"&gt;posted Wednesday evening&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook also said that it is searching for and removing content that includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4HInwK"&gt;Praise and support of the storming of the US Capitol&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jvGAOa"&gt;Calls to bring weapons to locations across the US — not just in Washington but anywhere in the US — including protests &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eMApWV"&gt;Incitement or encouragement of the events at the Capitol, including videos and photos from the protestors. At this point they represent promotion of criminal activity which violates our policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dWARrK"&gt;Calls for protests — even peaceful ones — if they violate the curfew in DC &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8pyl9R"&gt;Attempts to restage violence tomorrow or in the coming days&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="s67CI5"&gt;The company says it is also implementing new emergency measures, including using AI to demote content that “likely violates our policies” and automatically shutting off comments on posts in groups that “start to have a high rate of hate speech or content that incites violence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e7T6VR"&gt;CEO Mark Zuckerberg also reportedly &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MikeIsaac/status/1346974086967173120"&gt;sent a memo&lt;/a&gt; to employees, calling Wednesday’s events “a dark moment in our nation’s history.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1K7Ze7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Zuckerberg just sent out an internal post/memo to employees. here's the Text below: &lt;a href="https://t.co/TYvgvvaJIg"&gt;pic.twitter.com/TYvgvvaJIg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— rat king (@MikeIsaac) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MikeIsaac/status/1346974086967173120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dc21wg"&gt;Twitter first restricted and then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217697/twitter-trump-facebook-restrict-violence-tweet-video-capitol-riot-maga"&gt;removed Trump’s video&lt;/a&gt;, citing a “risk of violence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R9ZS0H"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 6th, 7:26 PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added context from Facebook.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube removes Trump video addressing Capitol attack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pFxMofaXSlSA_kPoXhAwV1xBcCk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68630050/acastro_180322_1777_youtube_0001.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Cvaxy5"&gt;YouTube has removed a video from President Donald Trump addressing a mob attack on the Capitol today because the president repeats false information about the outcome of the 2020 election, &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has learned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lfsjzd"&gt;The company will allow Trump’s message to appear in other creators’ videos if there is &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/look-how-we-treat-educational-documentary-scientific-and-artistic-content-youtube/"&gt;proper educational or news context&lt;/a&gt;; basically, if people are talking about Trump’s message as part of a greater point, YouTube will allow it to remain up. The removal comes after YouTube instituted a new policy update in December 2020 that forbids any type of content that alleges widespread voter fraud impacted the results of the 2020 presidential election. In Trump’s new video, which was also posted to Twitter and Facebook, he continued to spread misinformation about the 2020 election, calling the results fraudulent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVcayh"&gt;“We had an election that was stolen from us,” Trump stated falsely. “It was a landslide election and everyone knows it, especially the other side.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZ9FRq"&gt;He also used the video to call on rioters to “go home” following hours of the attack. Trump did not denounce any violence that occurred today. Twitter initially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217697/twitter-trump-facebook-restrict-violence-tweet-video-capitol-riot-maga"&gt;placed restrictions on his video&lt;/a&gt;, preventing people from liking, retweeting, or replying to Trump’s original post. Twitter cited “risks of violence” as the reason. Some time later, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217697/twitter-trump-facebook-restrict-violence-tweet-video-capitol-riot-maga"&gt;Twitter fully removed the video and two other tweets&lt;/a&gt;, saying they violated its rules. Trump’s post on Facebook initially received a label saying, “The US has laws, procedures, and established institutions to ensure the integrity of our elections,” but it has since removed it completely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ajAMsJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Trump has continued to spread misinformation about the 2020 election, calling the results fraudulent&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CfUBcb"&gt;YouTube’s move comes after the company faced criticism over the way it handled misinformation appearing on its platform the day of the election. At the time, YouTube defended leaving up a number of videos from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21550180/youtube-oann-video-election-trump-misinformation-voting-final-results-facebook-twitter"&gt;outlets like OANN and individual creators&lt;/a&gt; that  flocked to the site to spread misinformation about fraudulent results. Videos with titles like “Trump Won. MSM hopes you don’t believe your eyes” were allowed to remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Zx5nHG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Twitter pulls Trump video that it said posed a ‘risk of violence’","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217697/twitter-trump-facebook-restrict-violence-tweet-video-capitol-riot-maga"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside id="bNUZcS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Facebook declares ‘emergency situation’ and removes Trump video ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217788/facebook-remove-trump-video-emergency-situation-mob-violence"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="mJUZpC"&gt;“Like other companies, we’re allowing these videos because discussion of election results &amp;amp; the process of counting votes is allowed on YT. These videos are not being surfaced or recommended in any prominent way,” YouTube wrote on Twitter at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PKCxjJ"&gt;Since then, YouTube has reevaluated its policies. Today, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217421/capitol-building-trump-mob-protest-live-stream-youtube-twitch-facebook"&gt;people live-streamed the attack on Capitol and posted videos&lt;/a&gt;, the moderation teams are “working to quickly remove livestreams and other content that violates our policies, including those against incitement to violence or regarding footage of graphic violence,” a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. That didn’t stop a few channels from using the attack to monetize their own live streams. YouTube has not said if it will revoke those payments if the streams are found to violate the company’s guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oRh3FF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 6th, 6:45PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to note that &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217697/twitter-trump-facebook-restrict-violence-tweet-video-capitol-riot-maga"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter also eventually pulled the video&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter pulls Trump video that it said posed a ‘risk of violence’</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pc6qmW"&gt;In the wake of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217411/capitol-building-lockdown-protesters-trump-supporters"&gt;an unprecedented mob attack on the Capitol building&lt;/a&gt;, Twitter restricted and then removed a tweet from President Donald Trump, including its attached video. Users initially could no longer reply to, like, or retweet the post due to what Twitter referred to as a “risk of violence.” The tweet containing the video was then deleted entirely with a nonspecific link to &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/notices-on-twitter"&gt;Twitter’s policy guidelines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="170CDU"&gt;In Trump’s Wednesday Twitter video, he responded &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217411/capitol-building-lockdown-protesters-trump-supporters"&gt;to mob violence&lt;/a&gt; at the US Capitol calling on rioters to peacefully “go home” hours after the chaos began. But he also repeated false claims that the 2020 presidential election was fraudulent and did not denounce the violence, leading some to find the calls for order unconvincing. “We had an election that was stolen from us,” Trump said in the video. “It was a landslide election and everyone knows it, especially the other side. But you have to go home now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="weXkGS"&gt;Twitter said in a tweet thread later Wednesday evening that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1346970432017031178"&gt;it removed three of Trump’s tweets&lt;/a&gt; “for repeated and severe violations” of its rules. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217686/trump-twitter-account-locked-capitol-hill-riot-tweets-policy-violations"&gt;If Trump continues to violate Twitter’s rules&lt;/a&gt;, the platform said it would “result in a permanent suspension” of the president’s account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iH4L1O"&gt;Twitter has previously labeled content posted by the president over the last year. Throughout the 2020 presidential election, the platform placed labels on dozens of Trump’s tweets that made false or misleading claims about voter fraud. It has also removed Trump content that was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/10/18303841/trump-twitter-the-dark-knight-rises-copyright-infringement-video-removed-hans-zimmer"&gt;subject to a copyright claim&lt;/a&gt;. However, this appears to be the first time Twitter flagged a tweet as posing “a risk of violence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fEayqn"&gt;Twitter did not immediately respond to multiple requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, but it pointed to an earlier statement made Wednesday in a tweet thread. “In regard to the ongoing situation in Washington, D.C., we are working proactively to protect the health of the public conversation occurring on the service and will take action on any content that violates the Twitter rules.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Fugumj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"YouTube removes Trump video addressing Capitol attack ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217743/trump-capitol-attack-youtube-video-removed-twitter-facebook-moderation"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside id="dAFAkX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Facebook declares ‘emergency situation’ and removes Trump video ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217788/facebook-remove-trump-video-emergency-situation-mob-violence"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="bXNcIH"&gt;Twitter’s statement continued, “We are also exploring other escalated enforcement actions and will keep the public updated with any significant developments.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2eAu5p"&gt;Trump’s video was also posted to Facebook. Shortly after it was published, Facebook labeled the post directing users to factual information on 2020 election results. Later, Facebook imposed a stricter label that reads, “Joe Biden has been elected President in results that were certified by all 50 states. The US has laws, procedures, and established institutions to ensure the peaceful transfer of power after an election.” It then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217788/facebook-remove-trump-video-emergency-situation-mob-violence"&gt;deleted the video&lt;/a&gt;, declaring an “emergency situation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7T7OMO"&gt;“The violent protests in the Capitol today are a disgrace,” Facebook said in a statement Wednesday. “We prohibit incitement and calls for violence on our platform. We are actively reviewing and removing any content that breaks these rules.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jIg2Oy"&gt;Police are still regaining control of the Capitol in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217411/capitol-building-lockdown-protesters-trump-supporters"&gt;wake of the mob attack&lt;/a&gt;, although lawmakers have vowed to finish certification of the results of the 2020 presidential election as soon as they regain control of the building. At least one person has been shot, and a number of Capitol Police officers were injured. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bJ89vr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated at 5:23PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Included new label language from Facebook on Trump video.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gGwLe1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated at 6:40PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated after the tweet’s deletion and video’s removal by Facebook.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bc3FAQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated at 7:15PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Included new statement from Twitter claiming that it would ban Trump if he continues to violate the platform’s rules. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump supporters breach Capitol in worst display of ‘petro-masculinity’ yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-POLITICS-ELECTION-PROTEST" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bQwK4SqSPACUAdkJPoupVE8pGjw=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68629576/1230452869.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Ringo Chiu / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AXz9eJ"&gt;The concept of “petro-masculinity” was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jburroughsa/status/1346874918454104064"&gt;on full display Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; as Trump supporters and extremists like the Proud Boys haphazardly parked vehicles on the National Mall in Washington, DC before breaking into the Capitol, causing an evacuation. The astounding images depict a collective act that is simultaneously wholly un-American and yet completely in line with the psychology of this country as it relates to car ownership, personal freedom, and tendencies toward authoritarianism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fIPvIT"&gt;Petro-masculinity has lingered as a concept for years (&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/05/business/energy-environment/rolling-coal-in-diesel-trucks-to-rebel-and-provoke.html"&gt;think of the discourse around the “rolling coal”&lt;/a&gt; phenomenon), but it was codified in a 2018 paper by political scientist Cara Daggett called “&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0305829818775817"&gt;Petro-masculinity: Fossil Fuels and Authoritarian Desire&lt;/a&gt;.” In it, Daggett explains how “[a]ppreciating the historic relationship between fossil fuels and white patriarchal rule is helpful in terms of understanding the authoritarian desires and anxieties aroused by the Anthropocene.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="thMx4n"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;⁦&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NationalMallNPS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@NationalMallNPS&lt;/a&gt; ⁦&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PoPville?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@PoPville&lt;/a&gt;⁩ this is a disgrace &lt;a href="https://t.co/MQ8S6FwBQx"&gt;pic.twitter.com/MQ8S6FwBQx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— John Anthony (@jburroughsa) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jburroughsa/status/1346874918454104064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y9J94v"&gt;“Petro-masculinity draws upon aspects of a traditionally hegemonic masculinity, but at the same time, its appearance in the American far-right today is better understood as a kind of hypermasculinity, which is a more ‘reactionary stance,’” Daggett writes. “It arises when agents of hegemonic masculinity feel threatened or undermined, thereby needing to inflate, exaggerate, or otherwise distort their traditional masculinity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TfjxtB"&gt;Daggett’s paper is hard to shake when viewing the images taken Wednesday of the Jeeps, Broncos, Hummers, oversized SUVs, and other vehicles that were abandoned on the National Mall lawn by Trump supporters looking to disrupt the confirmation of Joe Biden’s Electoral College victory. Petro-masculinity has manifested many ways during the Trump presidency, like when his supporters participated in “&lt;a href="https://earther.gizmodo.com/the-petro-masculinity-of-this-weekends-trump-highway-ra-1845550339"&gt;highway rallies&lt;/a&gt;” and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/05/us/Texas-boat-parade-trump.html"&gt;boat parades&lt;/a&gt;. But it has also often turned violent, like when &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/31/biden-harris-bus-texas-trump-supporters-highway"&gt;Trump supporters tried to run a Biden campaign bus off the road&lt;/a&gt; or how people keep &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/01/heather-heyers-mother-on-hate-in-the-us-were-not-going-to-hug-it-out-but-we-can-listen-to-each-other"&gt;driving vehicles into crowds of protesters&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ESKP0w"&gt;Wednesday’s display, however, feels like petro-masculinity taken to an entirely different level since the end goal of those who trampled the mall with their vehicles was to subvert democracy. Their behavior was so brazen that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1346898825491968000"&gt;even Donald Trump Jr. spoke out in protest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7sbp3g"&gt;The scariest part about what happened on Wednesday is that more than one lawmaker is trying to further bolster the ability of Americans to wield their vehicles however they see fit. Proposals have been raised &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/gop-lawmakers-missouri-propose-bills-making-it-legal-hit-protesters-cars-1554280"&gt;in both Missouri&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/florida/os-ne-desantis-protest-bill-opposition-20200923-ihsipkhwdncorouj4whycypss4-story.html"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; to make it legal to drive into protesters, in what could be seen as a celebration of sorts of petro-masculinity over the fundamental American rights of free speech and assembly.  &lt;/p&gt;
