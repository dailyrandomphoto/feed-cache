    <title>Bitwarden adds secure text and file transfer to its arsenal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Bitwarden’s new Send feature lets you securely send files and text messages." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EWTMLEMzfUS84DQs9tj2wS1MOb0=/78x0:2235x1438/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68958019/Screen_Shot_2021_03_12_at_2.23.19_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gUaTCq"&gt;Many current password managers allow you to share your passwords with family members or other individuals or groups. (You do use a password manager, don’t you?) Managers such as Bitwarden and 1Password have specific methods by which you can share passwords or groups of passwords, making it easier for a family to, say, access a shared streaming service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MRoOzJ"&gt;Now &lt;a href="https://bitwarden.com/"&gt;Bitwarden&lt;/a&gt; has upped the ante by adding a feature it calls Send, which allows you to send files or text (including, if you wish, passwords) securely via end-to-end AES-256 bit encryption, using a link on its site. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Bitwarden Send generates a link and includes a number of security options" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8ImjzQK1DzlFzxetqn4wQUn0t6g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22366356/Screen_Shot_2021_03_12_at_2.25.14_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bitwarden Send generates a link and includes a number of security options&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZrZ4PX"&gt;Here’s how it works: If you wish to send a file (it can be up to 100 MB), you go to Bitwarden’s website and click on the Send button. After you upload the file, or create a text message, Send will generate a link that you can send out via email, text, or any other method you choose. When the person you send it to clicks on the link (and they don’t have to be a registered Bitwarden user), they are sent to a page where they can either view the text message or download the file.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FWSVWNcqeRtpmmr7LdLJvp1g2II=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22366302/Screen_Shot_2021_03_12_at_3.20.45_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cKBlpx"&gt;But before you send out the link, there are a number of security features you can add. You can set a date and time for the file to automatically be deleted from the linked page (in other words, if you click on the link after that, you’ll be informed it’s no longer available) or for the link to expire. You can limit the number of times the file can be accessed and you can see how many times it’s been accessed so far. And finally, you can set a password for the link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VnNWQN"&gt;If you’re using Send to create a text message, you can also have it be hidden by default when it is accessed (so the text is not immediately readable). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="eEpNB0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best free password manager","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22311182/best-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="dhI1qI"&gt;The new Send feature will be only partially available to Bitwarden’s free users. Members with free accounts will be able to use it to send text, but not files, while those with Premium and other paid memberships will be able to send both text and files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GFcjWZ"&gt;Bitwarden is obviously taking full advantage of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295354/lastpass-export-delete-bitwarden-1password-zoho"&gt;recent reported exodus from LastPass&lt;/a&gt; because of the latter’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285531/lastpass-free-tier-mobile-computer-device-premium-family"&gt;new limitations on its free accounts&lt;/a&gt;. Since there are already a number of free services for sending encrypted files, such as &lt;a href="https://wetransfer.com/"&gt;WeTransfer&lt;/a&gt;, and since having a secure way to send information such as passwords, personal information, and account numbers can be very handy, it looks like Bitwarden has given people another good reason to switch from LastPass. The new Send feature should be available Monday, March 15th at 7 AM.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="kFBmGr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 12th, 2021 3:55PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22328023/ps5-sony-playstation-5-best-buy-restock"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Best Buy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; currently has both the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734053780700716864#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS5 Digital Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734053639217049019#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; consoles in stock and available for purchase. But you can only request a pickup at your local store and cannot have the console shipped to your home address. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="J7uq4A"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sony’s PlayStation 5 is restocked at Best Buy ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22328023/ps5-sony-playstation-5-best-buy-restock"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="KMrzmx"&gt;The PlayStation 5 has been quite challenging to find ever since its launch in November. And when it is available, sales have been, for the most part, limited to online-only, with stock selling out almost instantly. Despite this, we here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; are dedicated to helping you keep track of when and where the PS5 is available in the hopes you can get another shot at buying Sony’s next-gen console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qD3Drq"&gt;We’re keeping a lookout across the web to find where, when, and how you can buy either the PS5 (with a disc drive) or the PS5 Digital Edition, as well as any bundles that are not price surged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dAoRYi"&gt;Keep in mind that due to the high demand of this console, supply will not last long, with inventory selling out typically less than an hour after being made available. Nevertheless, we’ll do our best to keep this article updated with the latest in-stock alerts and tell you when the most recent restock was available at the retailers selling the console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Ca5R3n"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"PlayStation 5 review: a big, confident step into next gen","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"},{"title":"How the PS5’s DualSense controller makes games like Fortnite and NBA 2K21 better","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21562206/ps5-dualsense-controller-review-games-features-vibrations"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="Spcnqk"&gt;Where can I buy a PS5 right now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JG5DCV"&gt;Due to the pandemic, most retailers, including &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734517183541536443#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-5-digital-edition-console%2F-%2FA-81114596&amp;amp;subid1=VergePS5Restocks03102021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, will only sell the console online until further notice. We see restocks happening multiple times in the week from various retailers; most notably, we have seen frequent restocks recently appear at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734053639217049019#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fplaystation-5%2F11108140.html%3Fcondition%3DNew" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-5-console%2F-%2FA-81114595&amp;amp;subid1=VergePS5Restocks03102021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPlayStation-5-Console%2F363472942&amp;amp;subid1=VergePS5Restocks03102021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; in particular. If you are looking for a bundle, retailers like Antonline and Newegg are likely to sell PS5 bundles instead of the actual console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FjSIu6"&gt;We have noticed that restocks for the console are more likely to happen later in the week as opposed to earlier in the week. Additionally, places like Newegg are combatting the demand for this console by doing a &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fproduct-shuffle%3Fnm_mc%3DAFC-RAN-COM%26cm_mmc%3DAFC-RAN-COM%26utm_medium%3Daffiliates%26utm_source%3Dafc-Vox%2BMedia%26AFFID%3D3430747%26AFFNAME%3DVox%2BMedia%26ACRID%3D1%26ASUBID%3Dverge%26ASID%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.theverge.com%252F%26ranMID%3D44583%26ranEAID%3D3430747%26ranSiteID%3DnOD_rLJHOac-XXgkPukHSHvtb9QuMXSZWQ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg Shuffle&lt;/a&gt;, which randomly selects winners interested in buying sought-after products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="V99T63"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9563999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="7oDuAk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10384391"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yaigG6Zpq6Ebg4PHlmyTd-pJL2A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21990376/vpavic_4261_20201023_0104.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Every PS5 comes with one DualSense controller, but you can use the DualShock 4 controller, but it is only limited to when you’re playing PS4 games on the next-gen console. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="o3N05Q"&gt;What accessories do I need to buy for the PS5?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="i98dsO"&gt;The PS5 includes all the basic things you need to get started (minus the games, of course). However, you might want to consider picking up additional accessories to ensure you get the most out of your brand-new console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6UsvWd"&gt;First, there’s the controller. Every new PS5 includes one &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/DualSense-Wireless-Controller-PlayStation-5/dp/B08FC6C75Y?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DualSense&lt;/a&gt; controller. But there are a few benefits to owning at least one additional controller, such as if you plan to play local co-op games with a friend or family member. Or, if you are like me and want to keep playing your game but don’t want to be tethered to the charging cable, a second control lets you continue playing while the other one charges. Normally, $70, we have &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/sony-sony-ps5-dual-sense-white-sony-dual-sense-wireless" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;seen the controller go down as low as $60&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MF1y0f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562878"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PwJaY2"&gt;The PS5 HD Camera is a neat accessory for people interested in using their PS5 to live-stream video games or broadcast their gameplay with friends.  It includes dual 1080p lenses and allows you to remove the background of your camera’s feed and replace it with something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XqsPQY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562900"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YyqMlw"&gt;I strongly recommend subscribing to &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergePlayStationDeal020121&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation Plus&lt;/a&gt; if you have not already done so; outside of taking advantage of some online gaming functionalities, PlayStation Plus provides a ton of additional incentives, most notably PS5 owners have access to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538383/sony-playstation-plus-collection-available-games-november-free-bugsnax"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, a digital library of some of the most impactful titles to release on the PS4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SPQIiW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vVuP0t"&gt;The PS5 comes with a 825GB of available storage right now and unfortunately, there’s no way to expand the fast internal storage currently. Sony is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302646/sony-ps5-ssd-expansion-coming-summer-report"&gt;reportedly expanding the options for more SSD storage&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to store some older PS4 titles on your console so you don’t use your limited SSD storage, I strongly advise &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Playstation-Portable-External-STGD4000400/dp/B076826S5R?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buying an external hard drive&lt;/a&gt; to store those titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8ULn9w"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562978"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Amazon Prime Video will soon let you shuffle all the shows you’ve been meaning to binge</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8WKjl8z86Ui7kSTbRMVda1MDDCk=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68957807/acastro_180329_1777_amazon_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bR2GID"&gt;Amazon is updating its Prime Video app to include a new feature: the ability to play episodes of a show on shuffle (&lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-prime-video-getting-shuffle-button-too"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). This feature could make it easier for people who just want to watch a sitcom without having to actually &lt;em&gt;pick&lt;/em&gt; an episode. Clicking the button should just start playing episodes in a random order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iZA1nv"&gt;The feature seems to initially be somewhat limited though — &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/03/11/amazon-prime-video-app-gets-a-shuffle-button-for-tv-episodes/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it doesn’t let you shuffle through the entire show, only one particular season. At the moment, it’s only been spotted on Android. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="87ZiOt"&gt;Amazon may be trying to race Netflix to rolling out a shuffle function: according to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/netflix-shuffle-play-feature-official-launch-1234888490/"&gt;Netflix has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it will be rolling out a a shuffle button to users sometime in the first half of 2021. Finally, I’ll be able to be &lt;em&gt;even more confused&lt;/em&gt; trying to watch &lt;em&gt;JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2EpJR"&gt;It’s unclear whether (or if) this feature will be coming to the iOS or web versions of the app — Amazon did not immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s PlayStation 5 is restocked at Best Buy </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RSnjJZxFfPXIwiMIsDuSRqZe4nI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68957792/vpavic_4278_20201030_0073.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lYCYSU"&gt;If you missed Target’s PS5 restocks Thursday, you may be in luck. Best Buy has the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734053780700716864#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5 Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734053639217049019#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt; models up for purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fJwFGh"&gt;According to the product listing, Best Buy will only allow you to pick up your newly purchased PS5 at a local Best Buy store. No home delivery is available for either model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YgwrHO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226833"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7Rd70W"&gt;Once you get your hands on a PS5, there are a few items you’re going to want to pick up for your console. Some of the most popular PS5 exclusives right now include &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Demons-Souls-PlayStation-5/dp/B08FC5TTBF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls Remake&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Bluepoint Games and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Marvels-Spider-Man-Miles-Morales-Launch-PlayStation/dp/B08FC66ZV4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Miles Morales&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Yh2iyW"&gt;If you plan to play local co-op with family or friends, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723570939328512577" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an extra DualSense controller&lt;/a&gt; might also be a good item to pick up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QXm507"&gt;One thing I also recommend buying is &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergePlayStationDeal020121&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a one-year membership to PlayStation Plus&lt;/a&gt;, as the perks of having a subscription are great for PS5 users. Most notably, it nets you access to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440388/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-games-titles"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, an exclusive perk for PS5 owners, that provides access to “generation-defining” titles that released on the console’s predecessor, like &lt;em&gt;Persona 5&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s Edge browser will match Chrome’s upcoming four-week release cycle</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OfIpda01DHxzc4FRKNmc_pJDDb4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68957246/acastro_200207_3900_Edge_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f7MEst"&gt;Microsoft is going to &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2021/03/12/new-release-cycles-microsoft-edge-extended-stable/"&gt;adjust its release cycles&lt;/a&gt; for Microsoft Edge to match the every-four-weeks release cadence for Chrome that Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22314992/google-chrome-release-cycle-four-weeks-update"&gt;announced last week&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mXExBF"&gt;“As contributors to the Chromium project, we look forward to the new 4-week major release cycle cadence that Google announced to help deliver that innovation to our customers even faster,” Microsoft said in a blog post on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FgLynt"&gt;The change will go into effect with Edge 94, which is &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/microsoft-edge-release-schedule"&gt;targeted for a September release&lt;/a&gt;. Google has committed to making the switch with Chrome in Q3 with Chrome 94, but hasn’t given a specific month like Microsoft has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XLLSHu"&gt;Like Google, Microsoft is also offering enterprises the option of a longer release cycle enterprise customers. On that Extended Stable schedule, there will be a new release every eight weeks. However, a four-week cadence will be the default, Microsoft says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AXxLRK"&gt;Edge isn’t the only Chromium-based browser making the switch to a four-week release cycle; Brave told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on March 5th that it plans to match the new schedule as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="pnJv4G"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google is speeding up Chrome’s release cycle to every four weeks","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22314992/google-chrome-release-cycle-four-weeks-update"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Pocket’s sort by time to read feature seems designed for the return of commutes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HPYtvq3Yi4YITDbBlyq2Vl6nNrg=/70x70:1036x714/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68957097/Screen_Shot_2021_03_12_at_10.19.39_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Pocket&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2AtnIX"&gt;Pocket, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/27/14752590/mozilla-acquires-pocket-read-it-later"&gt;an app for saving articles to read later&lt;/a&gt;, is rolling out a sorting option to Android users over the next few weeks that could solve my paralysis when choosing something to read. The new sort by time-to-read feature, spotted by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dcseifert/status/1370081315719110658/photo/1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge’&lt;/em&gt;s Dan Seifert&lt;/a&gt;, means articles can be organized where they fit best, whether it’s the five minutes it takes to microwave lunch, or a 20-minute wait for the late bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DkGs37"&gt;The feature appears in both the search section of the app, and as a sorting feature in your main list. A reader can sort their saved article search by length, choosing from Quick (less than five minutes), Medium (six to ten minutes), Long (eleven to twelve minutes), and Very Long (over twenty-one minutes). Your list of saved articles can also be organized by newest saved, oldest saved, longest to read, and shortest read, according to Pocket’s VP and General Manager Matt Koidin. If the feature proves popular, after Pocket “modernizes its iOS codebase,” Koidin says the company will bring these sorting options to iOS and the web as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kphJhj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I have wanted this feature in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Pocket?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Pocket&lt;/a&gt; for YEARS, thrilled it's finally a thing &lt;a href="https://t.co/Xpaxkz4awm"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Xpaxkz4awm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— dan seifert (@dcseifert) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dcseifert/status/1370081315719110658?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kSDPor"&gt;In my pre-pandemic life, when I used to ride the bus to work almost every day, I’d constantly misjudge what I was getting myself into when deciding what to read. Pocket’s pre-existing time-to-read stamps for articles help, but when you have a dragon’s hoard of writing you wanted to read at some point, things get complicated. Finding an article that can fit into a typical commute time might help people actually finish reading what they care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oEhl81"&gt;I assumed reading time was personalized, but Koidin says that Pocket actually bases its estimates on an average 220 words-per-minute reading speed. Now the hair on the back of my neck goes up when I think about great writing as a reading length first, rather than a holistic work of creative effort, but I think it’s easy to see how useful this could be (if I wasn’t shackled to an iPhone currently).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="15NbXJ"&gt;Commutes might not be in the equation for everyone just yet, but for those who still travel to work regularly, the feature might help. It at least has me missing my reading time on the bus.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A secretive metaverse creator bought the $69 million Beeple NFT</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A square collage of 5,000 works from Beeple, start with the oldest in the top left corner and continuing to recent works in the bottom right corner." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pFWY8bu9Kn_TXJzXeFc6sdsPjl8=/0x500:3000x2500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68956798/2021_NYR_20447_0001_001_beeple_everydays_the_first_5000_days034733_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Beeple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CF2LZf"&gt;MetaKovan, the pseudonymous founder of &lt;a href="https://metapurse.fund/"&gt;MetaPurse&lt;/a&gt;, is the buyer behind &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;the $69 million winning bid for a Beeple NFT&lt;/a&gt; at Christie’s yesterday. It was the third-highest sale price ever for a work from a living artist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IktBH8"&gt;“When you think of high-valued NFTs, this one is going to be pretty hard to beat,” MetaKovan said in a statement published by Christie’s. “And here’s why — it represents 13 years of everyday work. Techniques are replicable and skill is surpassable, but the only thing you can’t hack digitally is time. This is the crown jewel, the most valuable piece of art for this generation. It is worth $1 billion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="TporG9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kjtxVk"&gt;The $69 million NFT represented &lt;a href="https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/beeple-first-5000-days/beeple-b-1981-1/112924"&gt;a collage&lt;/a&gt; containing 5,000 mostly digital illustrations from Mike Winkelmann, better known as Beeple, that were created for his &lt;em&gt;Everydays&lt;/em&gt; series, in which he creates a new artwork every day. Winkelmann’s popularity online and his prolific output surely contributed to the sky-high price, but a key driver was also the growing hype around NFTs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XIkVQp"&gt;MetaKovan previously spent more than $2.2 million to acquire 20 single-edition Beeple works in December. Though the works were purchased under an assortment of names, there was apparently just this single entity&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;behind the acquisitions. The organization, MetaPurse, describes itself as a “crypto-exclusive” fund. Its &lt;a href="https://b20.metapurse.fund/"&gt;first project&lt;/a&gt; involved building those 20 original Beeple works into a digital museum, then effectively selling shares of that museum as digital tokens so that a multitude of buyers can have a stake in these works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="208OEE"&gt;NFTs are digital files that live on a blockchain and validate ownership of a related good — in this case, the collage. Some artists and collectors see them as the future of digital art by finally offering a way for buyers to acquire works that lack a physical component. Prices of NFTs from major artists have exploded in recent weeks, with Grimes selling $6 million worth of NFTs and Steve Aoki selling a single video for $888,888.88.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ziGaD9"&gt;Winkelmann told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on Monday that he expects to work with the buyer to find ways to physically display the collage. “Do you want it on a TV in your house? We can do that ... want to do it at Art Basel? Let’s project it on the side of a fucking building,” Winkelmann said. “It doesn’t have to be one way. It can be a bunch of different ways over time.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft and newspapers join forces to fight Google</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="House Judiciary Subcommittee Holds Hearing On Saving A Free And Diverse Press" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jz2sKl2Q_qZpSLP_FHijVcOLz5o=/0x0:5277x3518/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68956684/1231667961.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gbnRvq"&gt;Over the last decade, hundreds of newspapers have disappeared largely due to Big Tech’s disruption of the ad market. Republicans and Democrats can’t agree on much when it comes to tech reform, whether it be content moderation or spinning off acquisitions, but they do seem to agree that local journalism needs saving.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W9sRsI"&gt;On Friday, a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing focused on the way Google and Facebook distribute news, and a new bill introduced earlier this week has already found Republican support. It’s one of the biggest legislative threats to tech that’s come out of the years-long antitrust debate, and much of its political force comes from the precarious state of local journalism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eVZ44O"&gt;“The crisis in American journalism has become a real crisis in our democracy and civic life,” Cicilline said in his opening remarks Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DBaIBv"&gt;Ciciline’s bill, the “Journalism Competition and Preservation Act of 2021,” would allow news organizations to collectively negotiate with platforms like Facebook and Google the terms in which their content is distributed online. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), who leads the Senate’s antitrust panel, also sponsored the legislation in the Senate and  Republicans, like Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) and Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO), have already signed on in support of the bill as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z9iZrd"&gt;“This bill is a step in the right direction to dethroning those digital kings,” Buck said in his opening remarks Friday. “It is not a subsidy for outlets, but rather a leveling of the playing field in favor of democracy and free expression.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mC6Hjy"&gt;But while there was growing bipartisan support for the measure on Capitol Hill Friday, the real drama happened beyond the dais. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FzOEsx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT IT MEANS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="bUSDmF"&gt;There’s more pressure now than ever for Congress to act. In January, Google threatened to remove its search engine from Australia, responding to a new law that would force the tech giant to pay news publishers for their content. That law &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22283777/australia-new-media-bargaining-code-facebook-google-paying-news"&gt;was approved in February&lt;/a&gt;, and Google quickly backed off to cut a deal with News Corp. and other publishers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CTtZzz"&gt;While this all was happening, Microsoft put out a statement in support of Australia’s efforts to protect publishers. “One thing is clear: while other tech companies may sometimes threaten to leave Australia, Microsoft will never make such a threat,” Microsoft President Brad Smith said &lt;a href="https://news.microsoft.com/en-au/2021/02/03/microsoft-supports-australian-government-proposal-addressing-news-media-and-digital-platforms/"&gt;in the statement&lt;/a&gt; last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jlnqMV"&gt;Smith was brought in as a witness for Friday’s hearing, announcing his support for Cicilline’s media negotiation bill. Moments before the hearing was set to begin, Google put out its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22327306/google-microsoft-attack-open-web-online-news-australia-laws"&gt;own scathing statement&lt;/a&gt; against Microsoft, suggesting that the company was “making self-serving claims” that could “break the way the open web works in an effort to undercut a rival.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnJxSa"&gt;Google has good reason to be afraid of this bill, especially in light of its Australia bluff. The Cicilline bill has bipartisan support, and its only the subcommittee’s first swing at Big Tech before they wrestle with more sweeping reforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="r6vfyx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE HIGHLIGHT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="avpYEk"&gt;Glenn Greenwald, former &lt;em&gt;Intercept &lt;/em&gt;editor turned Substack newsletter writer, also testified at Friday’s hearing. Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) focused his line of questioning at Greenwald, asking if he feared a bill like the one proposed would only cement the power of larger media firms while leaving local journalism in the dust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hVT7nq"&gt;“The concern I have is that the discussion in the legislation seems grounded in a premise that the only or the primary problem, to both local and national journalism, is that Google and Facebook are vacuuming up advertising revenue and that you simply fix that problem the problem of media failure will be rectified as well,” Greenwald said. “I think that until the problem that this subcommittee identified in its report is addressed head on, which is breaking up the monopoly powers of this industry, none of these problems will really be fixed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Awy7fJ"&gt;Cicilline went back at Greenwald, saying that his bill is just a first step. “The bill that, at least Mr. Buck and I have put forth… provides a temporary fix for a 48-month period. And in fact, anything these larger media companies would negotiate would be available to the smallest role newspaper in any city in town in America.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gSp3sr"&gt;He continued, “We’re not going to do either or. We’re going to do both.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BvXcyp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT DIDN’T THEY ASK?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PfVqQt"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Politico’s &lt;/em&gt;Cristiano Lima noted on Twitter, the committee hardly asked any questions about Facebook! &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296778/facebook-ends-australian-news-ban-bargaining-code-google"&gt;Facebook had its own beef&lt;/a&gt; with Australia last month, removing the ability for some users and publishers to share news content in the country. In February, the Australian government agreed to several changes that would allow users to continue to publish news, so a thorough conversation on those concessions and how they could affect American users would have been beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pbO7hX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Microsoft president Brad Smith's written testimony before House Judiciary today mentions Google 7⃣5⃣ times ‼️ &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By contrast, it mentions Facebook 3⃣ times&lt;/p&gt;— Cristiano Lima (@viaCristiano) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/viaCristiano/status/1370399851494699013?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="efv1z0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT’S NEXT? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R8AENj"&gt;The House Judiciary Committee’s subcommittee on antitrust still has another hearing before it starts introducing legislation. Those bills are expected to land this spring. Klobuchar &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/b_fung/status/1369828793087631368?s=20"&gt;also told &lt;em&gt;CNN &lt;/em&gt;this week&lt;/a&gt; that the Senate’s competition committee will also start holding its own hearings on tech’s dominance, looking into app store fees and news publishing. Those hearings have yet to be scheduled. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM-backed startup Lordstown Motors accused of faking preorders</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7QgCTIAXaFFrr7LOQAMdGSbPj04=/0x0:4671x3114/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68956485/EnduranceDetail10.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Lordstown Motors&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="x2bgf5"&gt;General Motors-backed EV startup Lordstown Motors has been accused of fabricating some of the 100,000 preorders for its forthcoming Endurance electric pickup and misleading investors, the public, and government regulators about how much progress it’s made in developing the truck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="weub2Y"&gt;The accusations come in &lt;a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/lordstown/"&gt;a new report from short-selling firm Hindenburg Research&lt;/a&gt; — the same firm that published a report about hydrogen trucking startup Nikola that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21454738/nikola-cult-founder-worship-trevor-milton-general-motors"&gt;led to the founder resigning his position&lt;/a&gt; and a major restructuring of that company’s business. Hindenburg says in the report, published Friday, that it has taken an unspecified short position in Lordstown Motors, meaning it stands to make money from the startup’s stock price falling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c6GGlB"&gt;The accusations from Hindenburg could also raise questions about General Motors and the due diligence it does on the startups it backs. GM, the biggest automaker in the US, had previously planned to take &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726594/gm-nikola-deal-equity-badger-truck-hydrogen"&gt;a big stake in Nikola before Hindenburg’s report came out last year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zyxCRg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Lordstown Motors got big support from the Trump administration&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s4hRFz"&gt;GM has backed Lordstown Motors since its inception and has a seat on the startup’s board. It loaned Lordstown Motors $40 million so the startup could buy a plant that GM shuttered in Lordstown, Ohio — a deal praised by then-president Donald Trump that eventually led to a White House photo-op and then-Vice President Mike Pence appearing at the Endurance unveiling event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8J0U5c"&gt;GM &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352433/gm-lordstown-motors-electric-truck-startup-public-merger-spac"&gt;also invested more money and made other contributions (for a total value of $75 million) to Lordstown Motors&lt;/a&gt; as part of its merger with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, which turned the startup into a publicly listed company on the Nasdaq stock exchange and helped it raise nearly $700 million total. (The startup has since said &lt;a href="https://www.tribtoday.com/news/local-news/2021/01/lmc-moves-forward-in-loan-program/"&gt;it’s in the “due diligence” phase of obtaining a loan&lt;/a&gt; from the Department of Energy (DOE), too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5gnD4"&gt;“The $75 million investment from General Motors in LMC included certain in kind contributions that have already been provided to Lordstown. These include the plant itself. We have nothing to say about the report,” GM’s director of finance and sales communications James Cain said in an email. Representatives for Lordstown Motors and the DOE did not immediately respond to requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="74ULps"&gt;Lordstown Motors has claimed to have presold 100,000 pickup trucks to date. But Hindenburg accuses Lordstown Motors founder and CEO Steve Burns of paying consultants to preorder the startup’s electric pickup truck — something Burns confirmed to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ev-startup-lordstown-motors-is-targeted-by-short-seller-hindenburg-research-shares-fall-16-11615569913"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VYDU62"&gt;The firm claims multiple big-batch orders for the truck were from companies that either exist mostly on paper or don’t operate vehicle fleets to begin with. One order for 14,000 trucks — which would cost more than $700 million — was placed by a Texas company with just two employees on LinkedIn. Another order for 1,000 Endurances was from a similarly small company, the CEO of which allegedly told Hindenburg he had no plans to buy the trucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Z5jzr"&gt;Hindenburg also includes claims in its report that some preorders are nonbinding and require no money upfront, though this is a practice that has been common among startups in the space that try to book orders before getting a vehicle to production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="gTmnYy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some big orders came from companies that basically only exist on paper&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YNf9Pk"&gt;While Burns has stuck to a September 2021 date for getting the startup’s pickup into production, Hindenburg says it spoke to former employees who believe the truck is at least three years away from being ready, including one who allegedly claimed that the startup has not completed cold weather and other testing required by the government. The report also cites &lt;a href="https://www.wfmj.com/story/43303425/lordstown-motors-comments-on-endurance-prototype-fire"&gt;a local news report of one of the startup’s prototype trucks catching fire in February as further evidence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZmbDDA"&gt;What’s more, Hindenburg discovered a previously unreported lawsuit filed against Lordstown Motors by EV startup Karma Automotive. In it, Karma accuses Lordstown Motors of trying to steal its infotainment system technology after initially trying to buy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rnLCIg"&gt;Lordstown Motors’ relationship to Burns’ previous company, fellow Ohio EV startup Workhorse, is also called into question in the report. Burns founded Lordstown Motors shortly after leaving Workhorse in 2019, thought Hindenburg claims he was fired. Workhorse did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBZumf"&gt;As it entered into the deal with GM to buy the Lordstown factory, Burns’ new startup struck an agreement with Workhorse to license IP for a pickup truck that his former company was never able to get off the ground. Hindenburg claims that Workhorse was more than happy to unload the pickup truck. This deal has paid off handsomely so far for Workhorse, too, as Lordstown Motors paid $15.8 million for the IP, plus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307333/workhorse-usps-mail-truck-contract-oshkosh"&gt;another $4.8 million when the new startup went public&lt;/a&gt;. Lordstown Motors also handed Workhorse a 10 percent stake that is now worth some $300 million based on the new startup’s stock price as of the end of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VV4fZj"&gt;Hindenburg obviously stands to benefit from any hit to Lordstown Motors’ stock price. The firm’s research into Nikola did lead to that startup performing an internal investigation, which &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1ed9c9ec-de9e-44c3-b1f9-36a8da34b788"&gt;turned up evidence that founder Trevor Milton did in fact make “inaccurate” statements about his company&lt;/a&gt; before he ultimately resigned. But Nikola claims the results of the investigation do not line up with Hindenburg’s accusation that that the startup is an “intricate fraud.” Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission investigations into Nikola are currently ongoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1zf3AT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 12th, 4:00PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added details about the Lordstown factory being included in the $75 million investment made by GM. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Let this robot Twitter composer serenade you with randomly generated music</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B1hHEmsOFGocrl2FkoS9nqH7cVo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68956396/acastro_181016_1777_music_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ViaTzJ"&gt;I have been listening to robot-made music all week. No, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295222/daft-punk-breakup-split-28-years"&gt;not Daft Punk&lt;/a&gt;, but randomly generated music posted every hour by a Twitter bot, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MelodyBot3456"&gt;@MelodyBot3456&lt;/a&gt;. As you’d expect from auto-generated music, the short songs (if you can call them that) are often bizarre and regularly veer in unexpected and hilarious directions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dH8zTR"&gt;Each song applies a random instrument, tempo, time signature, and key to melodies that, most of the time, make absolutely no sense. Take &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MelodyBot3456/status/1369472009332133889"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, for example, made with an instrument called “Mario Paint” that only vaguely sounds like something from &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gc-1Dq3uQQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mario Paint&lt;/em&gt;’s famous music composer&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="t4XQHC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Instrument: Mario Paint &lt;br&gt;Tempo: 60.0&lt;br&gt;Played in the key of B. &lt;a href="https://t.co/C1bfzqczaF"&gt;pic.twitter.com/C1bfzqczaF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— MelodyBot3456 (@MelodyBot3456) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MelodyBot3456/status/1369472009332133889?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pSBDBK"&gt;Or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MelodyBot3456/status/1370075987749171200?s=20"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, which a friend described as like a computer trying to make a Black Keys song in a weird time signature:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="A2nBh6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Instrument: Mini Saw &lt;br&gt;Tempo: 90.0&lt;br&gt;Played in the key of E. &lt;a href="https://t.co/YxTw6bhBle"&gt;pic.twitter.com/YxTw6bhBle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— MelodyBot3456 (@MelodyBot3456) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MelodyBot3456/status/1370075987749171200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="abHJc5"&gt;Or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MelodyBot3456/status/1368596253857042433"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, which brings me to tears of joy every time I hear it, played by an instrument called “1812 Cannons” (which are surely inspired by the glorious cannons at the end of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbxgYlcNxE8&amp;amp;t=844s"&gt;Tchaikovsky’s “1812 Overture”&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="erGVR0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Instrument: 1812 Cannons &lt;br&gt;Tempo: 90.0&lt;br&gt;Played in the key of F. &lt;a href="https://t.co/qOBv2BE8PF"&gt;pic.twitter.com/qOBv2BE8PF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— MelodyBot3456 (@MelodyBot3456) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MelodyBot3456/status/1368596253857042433?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Yq0ShI"&gt;Sometimes, however, the bot inexplicably churns out something that’s kind of good. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MelodyBot3456/status/1369185067721887747"&gt;This song&lt;/a&gt; wouldn’t feel out of place in the right video game: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="09UiQ0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Instrument: Sine Wave &lt;br&gt;Tempo: 120.0&lt;br&gt;Played in the key of A. &lt;a href="https://t.co/i2ZF8vDIZJ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/i2ZF8vDIZJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— MelodyBot3456 (@MelodyBot3456) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MelodyBot3456/status/1369185067721887747?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZHrbR1"&gt;And &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MelodyBot3456/status/1370393022613970947"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; just slaps: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="67whgB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Instrument: Bass Hits 1 &lt;br&gt;Tempo: 150.0&lt;br&gt;Played in the key of Gb. &lt;a href="https://t.co/CawyJnZxmE"&gt;pic.twitter.com/CawyJnZxmE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— MelodyBot3456 (@MelodyBot3456) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MelodyBot3456/status/1370393022613970947?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WODUIK"&gt;I strongly recommend just &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MelodyBot3456"&gt;scrolling through the bot’s tweets yourself&lt;/a&gt; and listening to anything that sounds vaguely interesting. Most of them will probably make you laugh, and every once in a while you’ll find a gem. The account has been around since July 2019, so there’s a lot to listen to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q948Bd"&gt;I will leave you with my absolute favorite melody from the week, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MelodyBot3456/status/1369713589418749952"&gt;performed by robot claves&lt;/a&gt;. It’s absurd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="myYKcJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Instrument: Claves &lt;br&gt;Tempo: 150.0&lt;br&gt;Played in the key of G. &lt;a href="https://t.co/2rnU87ayOZ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/2rnU87ayOZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— MelodyBot3456 (@MelodyBot3456) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MelodyBot3456/status/1369713589418749952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="idaTTF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PeWzgo"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lUmVl4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
