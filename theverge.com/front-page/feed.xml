    <title>Nikon is bringing back its free online photography classes for the holidays</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TGVfKp_rWWP4lCQ8gA7YgZUskOU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67845644/cwelch190917_3726_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MyCj4K"&gt;Nikon is bringing back its promotion that allows you to stream its entire online curriculum of photography classes at no cost, just in time for the holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kefeq1"&gt;Now through December 31st, you can stream &lt;a href="https://www.nikonevents.com/us/live/nikon-school-online/"&gt;all classes featured at the Nikon School Online&lt;/a&gt;. Normally, these classes cost between $15 and $50 each. Each course is taught by a professional photographer and features in-depth lessons to improve your photo-taking skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jDv9h5"&gt;However, it is important to note that although it is called the “Nikon School Online,” you do not need to own a Nikon camera to take advantage of these free courses. A few classes focus on Nikon-specific gear, but most of the classes available focus on photography as a skill set and how to improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6Krqut"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nikon previously offered this promotion in April&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RubFDz"&gt;I streamed the classes earlier this year when they were free, and I really enjoyed the course that focuses on photographing children and pets because I picked up a few helpful tips on how to take better photos of my twin brother’s Pomeranian puppy with my Nikon D3100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PAbhS6"&gt;Nikon previously offered this promotion in April before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21204243/nikon-free-photography-classes-april"&gt;extending the offer until May 31st&lt;/a&gt;. With the holiday season quickly approaching, if you plan to buy a camera for yourself or a loved one, it’s not a bad idea to watch these online courses to ensure you get the most out of your gift. Or if you were planning to take some photography classes to improve your skills, save some money; you may want to give these videos a look first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tj2hec"&gt;You can stream &lt;a href="https://www.nikonevents.com/us/live/nikon-school-online/"&gt;all the online classes right now on Nikon’s website&lt;/a&gt;. You will need to sign up and provide your name and an email address before you can watch. But don’t worry; you can opt-out of receiving marketing emails after signing up. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat officially launches in-app TikTok competitor called Spotlight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9StGrKZjSSt5hDjEETydj7YeJbM=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67845641/snapchatspotlight.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Snap&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6LhvBV"&gt;Snap is finally ready to compete with TikTok and will pay creators to post on the platform. The company is officially announcing a new section of Snapchat today called Spotlight that’ll surface vertical video content from users that’s more meme-like and jokey instead of the day-in-the-life content Snap previously encouraged. Imagine, basically, TikTok but in Snapchat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5EFiyj"&gt;To entice people to post snaps regularly, the company says it’ll divvy up $1 million between the most popular creators on the app per day through the end of 2020. This means if someone has a particularly viral video, they might earn a large chunk of the $1 million pot. It doesn’t matter whether that person has a massive number of subscribers; the amount people receive is primarily based on unique views compared to other snaps that day. Users can continue to earn from their video if it’s popular for multiple days at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SfETfI"&gt;Spotlight, which will have its own dedicated tab in the app, is launching in 11 countries, including the US, UK, France, Germany, and Australia. The videos you’ll see in the section can be up to 60 seconds long and, as of right now, cannot be watermarked. That means people can’t just download their (or others’) viral TikToks and upload them to Snapchat. Once you tap into Spotlight, you’ll see snaps programmed to what Snapchat’s algorithm thinks you might enjoy. It bases this decision mostly on what you’ve viewed in the past and how long you’ve watched. Anyone can submit a snap, they’ll just have to tap “Spotlight” when posting to ensure it populates the section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="azySAt"&gt;Although the format will be familiar to anyone who’s ever watched TikTok, Snap says it’s made specific decisions based on its user base. For one, Spotlight snaps won’t feature a public comments section, and profiles themselves are private by default, so Snapchatters can keep their accounts locked down while still posting content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BAhMr5"&gt;The Spotlight section has been hinted at for months, given that Snapchat announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352680/snapchat-music-embed-tiktok-competitor"&gt;music in snaps&lt;/a&gt; back in August. The app lacked a feed for these snaps up until now, however. The company already allows users to submit their snaps as part of a location that anyone can drop into and watch to get a feel of what’s happening in a given place at any moment. They appear in &lt;a href="https://map.snapchat.com/"&gt;Snap Map&lt;/a&gt;. But unlike that feature, which is more documentary in nature, Spotlight is specifically designed for viral video formats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iAEQAK"&gt;With Spotlight, Snap is clearly acknowledging the success of TikTok’s short-form viral videos, similar to Instagram’s admission with its launch of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21354117/instagram-reels-tiktok-vine-short-videos-stories-explore-music-effects-filters"&gt;Reels&lt;/a&gt; in August. In Instagram’s case, however, it plainly allows people to bring their TikTok content over to the platform. Snap is instead trying to encourage people to use its own creation tools and prevent monetization fraud by keeping people in its app. Stories used to be the format everyone wanted to copy, thanks to its success on Snapchat. Now, it’s the TikTok video. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2020: great deals and money-saving strategies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1lyrp7edcQyIsQ7WtnVzdwsAVhM=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67845658/cfaulkner_201023_4258_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We’ve got all of the best deals for this year&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="T7zvHb"&gt;It may be difficult to celebrate the holidays in person with family and friends this year, but if you’re planning to send some special gifts to your loved ones, there are two annual events that you can still look forward to: Black Friday and Cyber Monday. This year, of course, it will take place primarily online, but that doesn’t mean you won’t find a wide range of deals from big-box stores like Target, Best Buy, and Walmart and online retailers like Amazon, Newegg, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GarvM0"&gt;We’re going to monitor all of your favorite retailers this holiday weekend for deals and last-minute price drops on a wide range of tech products, including phones, gaming gear, streaming services, laptops, headphones, and a lot more. We’ll also let you know when a retailer has sold out of a product so you won’t waste any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ANgQcb"&gt;Expect to find excellent prices on in-demand tech products, ranging from big 4K TVs and capable laptops to gaming consoles, smartphones, headphones, games, and much more. You’ll be able to find each development below as well as tips on the best products to buy and how to save money when shopping.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A different Super Mario Bros. game now holds the title for most expensive ever sold</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YyR6FYMKdWK8iIbQ1_cpaYbmKAY=/126x83:1074x715/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67845550/super_mario_bros_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The game featured a rare box layout and was in excellent condition.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://comics.ha.com/itm/video-games/nintendo/super-mario-bros-3-wata-92-a-sealed-bros-left-first-production-nes-nintendo-1990-usa/a/7236-93032.s" target="_blank"&gt;Heritage Auctions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mVB3am"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros. 3&lt;/em&gt; now holds the title of the most expensive game ever, after a sealed copy from 1990 &lt;a href="https://www.ha.com/heritage-auctions-press-releases-and-news/rare-sealed-super-mario-bros.-3-variant-breaks-record-for-world-s-most-expensive-video-game.s?releaseId=4032"&gt;sold for $156,000&lt;/a&gt; at an auction last Friday. Bidding started at $62,500, and 20 bidders were involved in the auction. The NES game handily beat out the previous record-holder, &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/10/21320274/super-mario-bros-sealed-copy-auction-record-most-expensive-game-ever"&gt;sold for $114,000 in July&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fhjv9m"&gt;According to Heritage Auctions, which sold the game, the game’s record-breaking price came down to a couple of factors. The first was its relatively rare box design, which has the word “Bros.” formatted to the left on its front, where it slightly obscures Mario’s hand. Later versions moved the word to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros._3#/media/File:Super_Mario_Bros._3_coverart.png"&gt;center-right&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vJj578"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The game had a rare box design and was in excellent condition&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AQAqo4"&gt;However, this rarer design only explains part of the price, since one of these variants sold at the auction house in July for just $38,400. What accounts for the rest of the value appears to be the condition in which it was sold. The game was given a Wata 9.2 A+ rating for its condition, which rates both the &lt;a href="https://www.watagames.com/what-we-do/wata-scale"&gt;quality of the box and the quality of its original seal&lt;/a&gt;. The previous version, meanwhile, had a slightly lower rating of Wata 9.0 A.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aRilbh"&gt;Alongside &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros. 3&lt;/em&gt;, a sealed copy of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Red&lt;/em&gt; became the most expensive &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; game sold when it was purchased for $84,000 during Friday’s auction. Heritage Auctions doesn’t mention whether there was anything unique about this particular version, but it appears to have been sold in a remarkably good condition, with a rating of Wata 9.8 A++.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robotaxis get the green light for paid rides in California</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Mission District Self Driving Car" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1B5KcN0OR-OsvA0UFB8q5FnHI_o=/0x209:5000x3542/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67845510/1202337495.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h2RBVI"&gt;California has long been ground zero for autonomous vehicle testing in the US, but the state has never allowed companies to use those vehicles to make money from a commercial ride-hailing service. That changed last week when the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) approved two new programs that allow autonomous vehicle operators to launch their own robotaxis in the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FH8c90"&gt;The CPUC, which is in charge of creating regulations for AVs in fleet services (e.g., taxis and ride-hailing), has been working on the new rules for several years now. The two new programs — the Drivered Autonomous Vehicle Deployment Program and the Driverless Autonomous Vehicle Deployment Program — “allow participants to offer passenger service, shared rides, and accept monetary compensation for rides in autonomous vehicles,” CPUC said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SBbAP8"&gt;CPUC Commissioner Genevieve Shiroma called the programs “important steps to support our study of how autonomous vehicle fleets can be leveraged to support the grid as a demand side management resource, dovetailing on our efforts to incorporate transportation into the electric sector.” California has indicated it intends to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452825/california-ban-combustion-gas-vehicles-cars-2035"&gt;ban the sale of new combustion-engine vehicles&lt;/a&gt; starting in 2035. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wbM8I4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;But don’t expect to see a bunch of AVs accepting passengers any time soon&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="paxack"&gt;Companies interested in participating in the two new programs will need to obtain either a charter-party carrier Class P permit or a Class A charter-party certificate in the Drivered AV Passenger Service pilot program issued by the CPUC, as well as an AV testing permit from the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles. But don’t expect to see a bunch of AVs accepting passengers any time soon: the process to apply for either CPUC program is expected to take several months at least.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VbSWuj"&gt;California has the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/26/21142685/california-dmv-self-driving-car-disengagement-report-data"&gt;most stringent rules&lt;/a&gt; in the country for AV operators, requiring companies to obtain a license for different types of testing, disclose vehicle crashes, list the number of miles driven, and the frequency at which human safety drivers were forced to take control of their autonomous vehicles (also known as a “disengagement”). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iKwF5Q"&gt;Unsurprisingly, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/26/21142685/california-dmv-self-driving-car-disengagement-report-data"&gt;AV companies mostly hate California’s requirements&lt;/a&gt;, but considering the state is home to the vast majority of the engineers and programmers who work on autonomous vehicles, they have little choice but to participate. Currently, 60 companies have an active permit to test autonomous vehicles with a safety driver in California. Five companies — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21517833/cruise-driverless-cars-test-permit-california-dmv"&gt;Cruise&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/30/18044670/waymo-fully-driverless-car-permit-california-dmv"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/7/21212719/nuro-driverless-car-test-california-dmv-delivery"&gt;Nuro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/zoox-becomes-fourth-company-to-land-driverless-testing-permit-in-california/"&gt;Zoox&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/17/autonomous-vehicle-startup-autox-lands-driverless-testing-permit-in-california/"&gt;AutoX&lt;/a&gt; — have an additional permit that allows them to test fully driverless vehicles without human safety drivers behind the wheel on public roads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jrbXn4"&gt;Companies who want to launch robotaxi services will be required to submit quarterly reports to the CPUC that contain “aggregated and anonymized information about the pick-up and drop-off locations for individual trips; the availability and volume of wheelchair accessible rides; the service levels to disadvantaged communities; the fuel type used by the vehicles and electric charging; the vehicle miles traveled and passenger miles traveled; and engagement with advocates for accessibility and disadvantaged communities,” the commission said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vdLJPx"&gt;There are only a handful of paid self-driving taxis services in the US right now. Waymo, the self-driving division of Alphabet, operates Waymo One outside Phoenix, Arizona, which provides around 1,000-2,000 rides a week. Three other companies, Lyft, Aptiv, and Motional, have completed around 100,000 trips in Las Vegas over the last several years. Other than that, the vast majority of AVs on the road are either performing deliveries or operating in a testing-only capacity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YA7Wtx"&gt;Annabel Chang, head of state policy at Waymo, hailed the decision as a crucial step to get more autonomous vehicles on the road. “This long-awaited agency action will allow Waymo to bring our fully autonomous Waymo One ride-hailing service to our home state over time,” Chang said in a statement. “The CPUC’s decision comes at a key time as we bring more of our latest technology to San Francisco and look forward to putting our Waymo Driver to use in service to Californians.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9PWn1R"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8inRc2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sonos Move, Beam, and Sub are $100 off for Black Friday week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/74BNRb-VdjulfXFbN9Siay4QQCM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67845470/bfarsace_190826_3621_0077.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Sonos Move wireless speaker | Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cFY5CE"&gt;Sonos has discounted several of its speakers for the week leading up to Black Friday, including the portable Move, Beam soundbar, and Sub add-on. All three models are $100 off, a significant discount from their regular prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lDNf8U"&gt;Sales on Sonos speakers are rare — we typically only see meaningful discounts on them during the holiday shopping season. The company discounted the Move &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2020/11/14/21563848/sonos-move-wifi-bluetooth-speaker-alexa-google-assistant-sale-deal-best-buy-amazon-bh-photo"&gt;for the first time just a week ago&lt;/a&gt;; this week’s sale matches that price should you have missed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Vmx1qK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20871409/sonos-move-wireless-bluetooth-speaker-review-alexa-google-assistant-wifi-price-specs-sound-quality"&gt;Sonos Move&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="DBFDtg"&gt;The Sonos Move is the company’s first portable speaker with a built-in 11-hour battery that lets you easily move it from room to room, outside, or even take it to an entirely different location. It has similar sound quality to the smaller Sonos One and includes always-on microphones with support for both Google Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa. It normally retails for $400, but this sale brings it down to $300.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KmrUb7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9575913"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Cm1PC5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/27/17507796/sonos-beam-speaker-soundbar-alexa-review"&gt;Sonos Beam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="RSIE9i"&gt;The Beam is the company’s entry-level soundbar. It makes it easy to improve the audio quality of movies, TV shows, and video games with just a simple HDMI cable connecting it to your TV. It can also be used for music and grouped with other Sonos speakers for surround sound or multiroom music. It also has always-listening mics with support for the Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa voice assistants. Like the Move, the Beam is usually $400, but is down to $300 for this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pKktzg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603369"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Nekhh5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sonos-Sub-Gen-Wireless-Subwoofer/dp/B087CCZH4Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sonos Sub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c9MXAo"&gt;Lastly, the Sub is an add-on piece that adds a low-end oomph to any Sonos speaker. It can be used with the Beam or Arc soundbars for more powerful sound when watching movies, or with other Sonos speakers for more floor-thumping music.  The Sub is typically an expensive add-on, at $700. This sale brings it down to a slightly more manageable $600.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Vpjvi3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603379"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Chpe8s"&gt;All three models are available in either black or white, though some retailers only carry the black version of the Sub. If you’ve been eying a new Sonos speaker and one of these fits your needs, you’re not likely to find a much better price than now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Steam adds PS5 controller support</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TEUwqmFcqpXNhB84fwSL4C7-Ztg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67845133/vpavic_4278_20201030_0234.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7uOAPp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/2924487488167580236"&gt;Valve has officially announced&lt;/a&gt; that the PS5’s DualSense controller is now supported in Steam. Games using the Steam Input API can now recognize the controller and display the correct button prompts. They’ll also be able to access the DualSense’s LED, trackpad, rumble, and gyro features, though there’s no mention of support for its adaptive triggers. The functionality is currently available in Steam’s public beta client, with plans for a full release “after further testing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vrr1G7"&gt;Steam has been gradually rolling out support for the DualSense &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/2912101955046945213"&gt;over the past couple of weeks&lt;/a&gt;. It started by&lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/2912101955046945213"&gt; adding support for the controller itself&lt;/a&gt;, before &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/2896339990496271925"&gt;adding&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/2896339990500367097"&gt;refining&lt;/a&gt; compatibility with advanced features like its trackpad, rumble, and gyro. Notably absent from Valve’s official announcement is any mention of the DualSense’s adaptive triggers, which allow it to offer a variable amount of trigger resistance with some truly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21562206/ps5-dualsense-controller-review-games-features-vibrations"&gt;excellent results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SJkkOf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A full release is planned “after further testing”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oSsYy8"&gt;Thanks to the update, games that use the Steam Input API should now work with the PS5 controller with no work required from individual game developers. The DualSense is among over 200 controllers that are supported by the API, which also includes race wheels and dance pads in addition to more traditional controllers like the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller and the PS4’s DualShock 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yef5ka"&gt;According to Valve, the amount of players who use controllers to play PC games rather than a mouse and keyboard has more than doubled in the past two years, with bigger increases coming from those using PlayStation controllers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="50NiX0"&gt;For now, if you want to try out the functionality for yourself, you’ll have to opt into the &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7021-eiah-8669"&gt;Steam client beta&lt;/a&gt;. The controller can be connected via Bluetooth or with a USB-C cable. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oxford University and AstraZeneca vaccine trial shows up to 90 percent effectiveness</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OL--vjUOZ2IrsPTFEMLS6XffnlA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67844950/acastro_200428_1777_coronavirus_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="x5CKux"&gt;A COVID-19 vaccine developed by the UK’s Oxford University and AstraZeneca has an average efficacy of 70.4 percent, according to &lt;a href="https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2020/azd1222hlr.html"&gt;interim analysis announced today&lt;/a&gt;. In trials, the vaccine’s effectiveness varied depending on the dose amounts given. When two full doses were given a month apart the effectiveness stood at 62 percent, but this &lt;a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2020-11-23-oxford-university-breakthrough-global-covid-19-vaccine"&gt;rose to 90 percent&lt;/a&gt; when the vaccine was given first as a half dose, and then as a full dose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6eaTC"&gt;The announcement follows promising early results from vaccines developed by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573072/pfizer-vaccine-effective-authorization-fda-safe"&gt;Pfizer and BioNTech&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21569345/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-coronavirus-efficacy-announcement"&gt;Moderna&lt;/a&gt;, which both appear to have slightly higher 95 percent efficacy rates. However, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-55040635"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;BBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Oxford vaccine has the advantage of being cheaper and easy to store, since it can be transported and handled at normal refrigerated temperatures. The Pfizer vaccine needs to be stored at &lt;a href="https://time.com/5911543/pfizer-vaccine-cold-storage/"&gt;-70 degrees Celsius&lt;/a&gt; (-94 degrees Fahrenheit). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) previously said vaccines would be required to be &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/06/30/coronavirus-vaccine-approval-fda/"&gt;at least 50 percent effective&lt;/a&gt; to gain its approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="o7AgWd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Today marks an important milestone in the fight against &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#COVID19&lt;/a&gt;. Interim data show the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OxfordVaccine?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#OxfordVaccine&lt;/a&gt; is 70.4% effective, &amp;amp; tests on two dose regimens show that it could be 90%, moving us one step closer to supplying it at low cost around the world&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/fnHnKSqftT"&gt;https://t.co/fnHnKSqftT&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/2KYXPxFNz1"&gt;pic.twitter.com/2KYXPxFNz1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— University of Oxford (@UniofOxford) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UniofOxford/status/1330769567409385474?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 23, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5hlArL"&gt;The Oxford vaccine trial involved over 23,000 participants in the UK and Brazil. Of the participants who received the vaccine, 30 developed COVID-19, compared to 101 participants who received the placebo, &lt;em&gt;BBC News &lt;/em&gt;reports. There were no hospitalizations or severe COVID-19 cases among participants who received the vaccine, &lt;a href="https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2020/azd1222hlr.html"&gt;AstraZeneca says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m47d0C"&gt;“We’re really pleased with these results,” the trial’s lead investigator Professor Andrew Pollard told the &lt;em&gt;BBC&lt;/em&gt;. He added that the higher effectiveness rate for the initial half dose potentially means that there’ll be “a lot more doses to distribute.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eloCAY"&gt;With this latest round of trials complete, the team are preparing to submit the vaccine for regulatory approval. If approved, AstraZeneca hopes to to manufacture three billion doses of the vaccine to distribute worldwide. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/nov/23/astrazeneca-says-its-coronavirus-vaccine-has-70-per-cent-efficacy-covid-oxford-university"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; a rollout could begin in weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: One Night in Miami, Chaos Walking, Justice League, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SE67KzR3OHkxyjnaU3tvlJgSUmA=/194x0:1387x795/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67842615/one_night_in_miami.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One Night in Miami&lt;/em&gt; | Amazon Prime Video&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DbJbWW"&gt;I am currently suffering from &lt;em&gt;The Crown&lt;/em&gt; withdrawal after finishing Season 4, and (like pretty much everyone) predicting we’ll see Emmy nominations for Gillian Anderson (Margaret Thatcher) and Josh O’Connor (Prince Charles). Also I’m very on board with this suggestion that &lt;a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a34706701/erin-doherty-the-crown-season-4-interview/"&gt;Erin Doherty deserves her own Princess Anne spinoff&lt;/a&gt; series (please get on this asap, Netflix). She’s spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7xQgk6"&gt;I’m not quite ready to commit to a new streaming series yet so went to the backlog of movies I have queued up; I tried to get into &lt;em&gt;Queen’s Gambit&lt;/em&gt; but honestly, I don’t get the hype about that movie, the dialogue is so clunky.  I even went so far as to open an actual physical book yesterday (lol) before restarting Season 1 of &lt;em&gt;The Crown &lt;/em&gt;(hi Claire Foy and John Lithgow!). At least we still have &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; to look forward to every Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pWJ9aw"&gt;Some great new trailers this week and a couple of second trailers/teasers for highly anticipated movies whose theatrical debuts were derailed by the coronavirus pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QIhZjO"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZprXMxKg--w?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="m6EV1k"&gt;One Night in Miami &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="wZ88pY"&gt;Oscar/Emmy/Golden Globe winner Regina King makes her feature film directorial debut with &lt;em&gt;One Night in Miami&lt;/em&gt;, an adaptation of Kemp Powers’ 2013 play of the same name. It tells the fictional story of a meeting of Muhammed Ali (then still known as Cassius Clay), Jim Brown, Sam Cooke, and Malcolm X, as they get together following Ali’s 1964 fight against Sonny Liston. Powers also wrote the script. The movie is generating &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/film/awards/one-night-in-miami-oscars-campaign-decision-1234819507/"&gt;huge Academy Awards buzz&lt;/a&gt; (obviously, with a powerhouse like King at the helm) and has already received praise from critics at the Toronto and Venice film festivals. Leslie Odom Jr., Kingsley Ben-Adir, Eli Goree, and Aldis Hodge star. &lt;em&gt;One Night in Miami &lt;/em&gt;will hit theaters on Christmas Day and debut on Amazon Prime Video January 15th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RcMZi5"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nRf4ZgzHoVw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="OQzHYT"&gt;Chaos Walking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="2huPAV"&gt;In a future dystopia, Viola (Daisy Ridley) crash lands on a planet of men who are affected by something called “The Noise” that makes all their thoughts visible. All the other women are dead, or so we are told (I mean I have watched more than one future dystopia sci-fi flick in my life). Based on the trilogy of books by Patrick Ness, &lt;em&gt;Chaos Walking&lt;/em&gt; also stars Tom Holland, Mads Mikkelsen, Nick Jonas, and David Oyelowo. It’s due in theaters January 22nd.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PGdNNw"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/psFf4KXJZoQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="7J3iG5"&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="vSIwk7"&gt;Warner Bros. announced last week that &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt; would be released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21504152/wonder-woman-1984-release-delay-new-date-warner-bros-disney-black-widow-dune-tenet"&gt;in theaters and on HBO Max December 25th&lt;/a&gt;, and we got a new “main” trailer to tide us over, with new glimpses of Diana, Steve, and Kristen Wiig’s Cheetah (“I want to be an apex predator” right on, girl). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bRhvx1"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XN6JawOGvpM?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="fhc2KV"&gt;Superintelligence &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="giuI0h"&gt;Not every movie is about a future dystopia or superheroes, you guys! Melissa McCarthy stars in this very goofy-looking comedy about a woman who has to prove to an AI (voiced by James Corden) who’s thinking of destroying the Earth that humanity is worth saving. Girrrrl, good luck. Bobby Cannavale and Bryan Tyree Henry also star (and I was especially happy to see Sam Richardson, the funniest person from the &lt;em&gt;Veep&lt;/em&gt; cast not named Julia Louis-Dreyfus). &lt;em&gt;Superintelligence&lt;/em&gt; comes to HBO Max November 26th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SpwCQX"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KYWzEqX-J-4?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="qT5XrI"&gt;Godmothered &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="BSEH44"&gt;Look, I can’t stop the tide of Christmas movies, so just settle in and accept them for the next couple of weeks. This one looks pretty cute, with Jillian Bell as fairy godmother in training Eleanor. She tries to help a 40-year-old single mom who made a wish as a child that didn’t come true. Isla Fisher and Jane Curtin (yessss) also star in &lt;em&gt;Godmothered&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to Disney Plus on December 4th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qwB3Xc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3JOOv2"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XIOU_k4mwDw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="e1VUap"&gt;Justice League: Director’s Cut&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3dy866"&gt;The first full-length teaser of the Zack Snyder cut of &lt;em&gt;Justice League&lt;/em&gt; shows us Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Superman, Cyborg, and The Flash with Leonard Cohen’s version of “Hallelujah” playing— which feels a little too slow for an action movie? I watched the trailer at 1.5 speed and with all due respect to the late, great Mr. Cohen, it seemed a better fit. You know the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295712/justice-league-snyder-cut-teaser-hbo-max-darkseid-gal-gadot-wonder-woman-lex-luthor"&gt;backstory about the Snyder Cut&lt;/a&gt;; it will hit  HBO Max in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fleets are still visible on Twitter after 24 hours thanks to a bug</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4fWqUL-RQzoH1vFjocSyQ8E23zY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67841877/acastro_180827_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NlAT92"&gt;Twitter’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570368/twitter-fleets-disapeating-tweets-stories-launch-available-now"&gt;ephemeral tweets, known as fleets&lt;/a&gt;, are supposed to last for only 24 hours. But a bug is causing fleets to not totally disappear, remaining accessible well past their expiration dates. &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/21/twitter-fleets-bug/"&gt;First reported by &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the bug allows fleets to be viewed and downloaded by other users, but without notifying the fleet’s author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RIp2qA"&gt;“We’re aware of a bug accessible through a technical workaround where some Fleets media URLs may be accessible after 24 hours,” a Twitter spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We are working on a fix that should be rolled out shortly.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYfJoX"&gt; The “workaround” referenced appears to be a developer app that could &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/donk_enby/status/1330078983350837248?s=20"&gt;scrape fleets from public accounts&lt;/a&gt; via Twitter’s API. The Twitter API doesn’t return URLs for fleets that are older than 24 hours, according to the company, and once the fix is rolled out, even if someone has a URL for active fleet, it won’t work after the expiration point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sibqi3"&gt;And while fleets are only visible on users’ timelines for 24 hours, Twitter stores fleets on its back end for up to 30 days, longer for fleets that violate its rules and may require enforcement action, the company says. During that 30 day period, a fleet is available in a user’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/settings/your_twitter_data"&gt;Twitter Data&lt;/a&gt; downloads as long as Twitter is retaining a copy.  The “seen by” action is typically only available when someone views a fleet via the Twitter app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1PUakx"&gt;Twitter is a bit late to the disappearing content party— fleets are essentially its version of Instagram or Snapchat stories, They allow mobile Twitter users to briefly share text, videos, images, or other tweets. They’re not meant to be retweetable and you can’t directly “like” a fleet, but you can reply to one by tapping on it, which sends a direct message to the fleet’s creator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sofyJD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uEeBYq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 22nd, 10:56 AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added comment from Twitter and additional details&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
