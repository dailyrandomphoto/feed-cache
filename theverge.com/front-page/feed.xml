    <title>Japanese billionaire is looking for eight people to join him for a Moon voyage on SpaceX rocket</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="SpaceX CEO Elon Musk Announces Details Of Commercial Space Program" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6obmQENUjQMA-tN-6kuQxWa2C4k=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68900268/1035243908.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yusaku Maezawa announcing his plan to fly on SpaceX’s Starship rocket in September 2018.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qfqdy6"&gt;Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa invited the public on Tuesday to apply for a spot on SpaceX’s Starship in his private mission around the Moon, reaching out to a “wider, more diverse audience” two years after announcing he’d only ride with a select group of artists. The trip is currently slated for 2023, but that date might not hold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JsalJ1"&gt;“I want people from all kinds of backgrounds to join,” Maezawa said in a video posted Tuesday afternoon, when the contest’s &lt;a href="https://dearmoon.earth/pre-reg.html"&gt;application&lt;/a&gt; went live. “It will be 10 to 12 people in all, but I will be inviting 8 people to come along on the ride.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XSyZ5b"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h_L3wLmrMuA?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rvZIp7"&gt;Maezawa, the founder of Japan’s largest online fashion retailer, is worth about $2 billion. He &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/17/17869990/elon-musk-spacex-lunar-mission-ticket-moon-passenger-bfr-falcon-yusaku-maezawa"&gt;was revealed as Starship’s first signed passenger back in 2018&lt;/a&gt; during an event with CEO Elon Musk at SpaceX’s California headquarters. At the event, Maezawa, an avid art collector, announced his Dear Moon Project, which aimed to bring “six to eight artists from around the world” to join him in a roughly six-day lunar flyby mission sometime in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UfMIF4"&gt;“These artists will be asked to create something after they return to Earth, and these masterpieces will inspire the dreamer within all of us,” Maezawa said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TcfGgf"&gt;In a YouTube video posted on Tuesday, Maezawa said that plan “has since evolved,” adding that “maybe every single person is doing something creative could be called an artist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WrmBvr"&gt;Now, anyone who meets two criteria could get picked for the ride: those who “can push its envelope to help other people and greater society in some way” and are “willing to support other crew members who share similar aspirations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZVBNpS"&gt;Project updates have been scant over the past two years. In January 2020, Maezawa launched a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/12/21062584/spacex-yusaku-maezawa-japan-billionaire-starship-girlfriend-contest-moon"&gt;bizarre campaign&lt;/a&gt; to search for a “female partner” who would accompany him on his trip around the Moon. A website for the contest received 27,722 applications, and Japanese streaming service AbemaTV was set to document the mission in a reality TV show called &lt;em&gt;Full Moon Lovers&lt;/em&gt;. Weeks later, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21114712/yusaku-maezawa-space-girlfriend-not-happening"&gt;the show was canceled&lt;/a&gt;, and Maezawa called off his search due to “personal reasons,” he &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/yousuck2020/status/1222716360888729600?s=20"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, apologizing to the AbemaTV crew and all of the applicants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="muBLOP"&gt;Starship is SpaceX’s next-generation, fully reusable Mars rocket system designed to ferry humans and up to 100 tons of cargo on future missions into deep space. Only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262937/spacex-sn9-starship-test-flight-successful-explode-landing"&gt;early iterations&lt;/a&gt; of the rocket have flown so far, with one of two recent high-altitude tests flying as high as 7.8 miles over SpaceX’s Starship facilities in Boca Chica, Texas. Both of those tests ended in fiery explosions during their landing attempts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9wP94H"&gt;Maezawa’s announcement on Tuesday lacked any details on how the selected astronauts would train for the mission, but he made clear the undisclosed ticket price is on him: “I will pay for the entire journey. I have bought all the seats, so it will be a private ride.” He said it will take three days to get to the Moon, where Starship will loop behind it and begin its three-day journey back to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XUUkjj"&gt;Under a rigorous and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256657/spacex-launch-violation-explosive-starship-faa-investigation-elon-musk"&gt;sometimes bumpy&lt;/a&gt; development timeline, Musk and SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell have said Starship’s first orbital flight could come at the end of 2021. Last year, Musk said Starship needs to “do hundreds of missions with satellites before we put people on board,” a feat that calls the 2023 moonshot date into question. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JzrR2E"&gt;SpaceX’s other crew vehicle, Crew Dragon, is already in its operational phase and is racking up future flights with private astronauts and tourists. The acorn-shaped capsule flew its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/15/21565237/spacex-crew-1-dragon-launch-success-falcon-9-nasa"&gt;first two crews of astronauts&lt;/a&gt; to the International Space Station last year under NASA’s Commercial Crew Program. The private astronaut missions lined up include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250327/space-tourists-axiom-private-crew-iss-price"&gt;a flight to the space station&lt;/a&gt; planned for early next year carrying real estate investors and philanthropists, and an “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22261038/spacex-announces-first-all-civilian-mission-to-space"&gt;all-civilian&lt;/a&gt;” charity-focused mission announced last month that’s slated for launch by year’s end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UpoTWz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A jury says Intel owes $2.18 billion for infringing a zombie chip company’s patents</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7xYHUV3aRy8s0gwIhQt-_aoNbD8=/137x0:1063x617/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68900038/Eg7I_l_XYAY3OBJ.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9v4IFd"&gt;Intel may owe quite a bit of cash to a semiconductor company that hasn’t existed for 20 years. A Texas jury has asked Intel to pay $2.18 billion for infringing two patents owned by VLSI Technology, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-02/intel-told-to-pay-2-18-billion-after-losing-texas-patent-trial"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldtHov"&gt;VLSI seemingly rose from the dead in 2019 specifically to sue. The last time it was an independent company was in 1999, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/04/business/company-news-philips-in-1-billion-deal-for-vlsi-technology.html"&gt;when Philips purchased the semiconductor design firm for $1 billion&lt;/a&gt;. Its assets later traveled to Philips spinoff NXP (which you may know from its tap-to-pay NFC chips, among other things). NXP will reportedly get some of Intel’s money, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4pA2WX"&gt;One of VLSI’s claims to fame was being part of the original project with Apple and Acorn to produce the first ARM processors — &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-11-28-fi-4993-story.html"&gt;and the ARM company&lt;/a&gt; — responsible for the underpinnings of the chips that now appear in every smartphone, most tablets, and a growing number of laptops and servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mzxA3v"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;how it started:               how it’s going: &lt;a href="https://t.co/R5bPcH1aOQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/R5bPcH1aOQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ken Shirriff (@kenshirriff) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kenshirriff/status/1327021630636212224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 12, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uXFirB"&gt;Technically, the patents are newer than&lt;em&gt; all &lt;/em&gt;of that VLSI history. They were originally issued to Freescale Semiconductor, and Sigmatel in 2009, 2010, and 2012, respectively, and the earliest of them was filed in 2005. But &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports they were all assigned to the new VLSI in 2019, an LLC that’s attached to a Fortress Investment Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0rTuzH"&gt;Calling out VLSI as a zombie brand was part of Intel’s argument, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="9CIL9K"&gt;VLSI “took two patents off the shelf that hadn’t been used for 10 years and said, ‘We’d like $2 billion,”’ Lee told the jury. The “outrageous” demand by VLSI “would tax the true innovators.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="t0k4Si"&gt;But that didn’t keep jurors from awarding roughly a tenth of Intel’s yearly profits — $2.18 billion — for infringing two of the three patents. (They’re about “managing clockspeed in an electronic device,” a “minimum memory operating voltage technique,” and “voltage-based memory size scaling,” in case you’re curious.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z3klKc"&gt;Intel tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that it’s not done fighting yet: “Intel strongly disagrees with today’s jury verdict. We intend to appeal and are confident that we will prevail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PCI92S"&gt;Fortress and VLSI Technology have other lawsuits pending against Intel, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hulu reenables picture-in-picture mode for iOS 14</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uNtJSzqC9AgW8pyvNnmoR0Mb2Hw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68899685/acastro_200320_1777_huluStock_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xR9ZDv"&gt;Hulu has fully reenabled picture-in-picture support (PiP) on iOS, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/02/hulu-ios-14-picture-in-picture/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, which means half-watching network TV is once again possible for Hulu subscribers on iPhone and iPad devices. Hulu joins a collection of major streaming services that support the feature on iOS, leaving YouTube as the major exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ja70VW"&gt;PiP for iPhones was enabled for Hulu around iOS 14’s original release, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hulu_support/status/1364725362610045012?s=20"&gt;but it was later disabled&lt;/a&gt; to “work on a few updates to provide the best experience for our viewers,” Hulu said. Now that the feature is back, users can enable PiP mode by starting a show or movie and touching the PiP button to pop the video into a resizable, floating player.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TPLyeL_eZoStuGcFUipTJnmfLS8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22340593/B10DEEF4_5290_42FD_ACC5_EF5B41A0FC22_1_201_a.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The picture-in-picture button inside Hulu’s app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tExGZC"&gt;Hulu joins services like Disney Plus, Apple TV Plus, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and HBO Max in supporting PiP. All of those services now either feature a dedicated PiP button like Hulu or default to picture-in-picture if you swipe to the home screen while a video is playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lYDk5g"&gt;YouTube remains the odd one out. Picture-in-picture is not allowed in Google’s official YouTube app for iOS. Paying for &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/premium"&gt;YouTube Premium&lt;/a&gt; enables background play, but that only extends to audio on iOS. Google has also periodically &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/21445912/youtube-videos-website-picture-in-picture-ios-14-google-apple-premium"&gt;disabled&lt;/a&gt; and reenabled PiP support for the web version of YouTube on iOS. As of October 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498327/youtube-picture-in-picture-web-safari-ios-14-chrome-background-playback"&gt;PiP was possible again&lt;/a&gt;, though it doesn’t appear to work as of today. Right now, only iPhones running the iOS 14.5 beta can do PiP on the web version of YouTube, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/10/youtube-site-picture-in-picture-ios-14-5-beta/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="llzwKo"&gt;If you’re curious how to get PiP set up on your own device, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451195/apple-iphone-ipad-pip-picture-in-picture-how-to-use-youtube"&gt;check out &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s &lt;/em&gt;guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA’s latest Mars rover has the same processor as an iMac from 1998</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WdyzQxGIpNdTBf-vhuyJR0P52e0=/0x0:800x533/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68899353/25_feb_peserverance4.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9hdibO"&gt;NASA’s brand-new Perseverance rover is the most advanced machine that’s ever landed on Mars. But when it comes to rovers, “state of the art” is a subjective term. Perseverance is running on none other than a PowerPC 750, a single-core, 233MHz processor with just 6 million transistors that’s most famous for powering the original “Bondi blue” iMac from 1998. It’s the same type of processor that NASA already uses in its Curiosity rover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RDaHYt"&gt;That may seem like a waste to some. After all, even with the difficulty of buying computer parts these days, surely NASA&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;could have found the budget for something like Intel’s $500 &lt;a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/processors/core/i9-processors/i9-10900k.html"&gt;Core i9-10900K&lt;/a&gt; CPU (with 10 cores and a max clock speed of 5.3GHz) somewhere in the $2.7 billion cost of Perseverance. But &lt;a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2269403-the-perseverance-rover-runs-on-processors-used-in-imacs-in-the-1990s/"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;New Scientist&lt;/em&gt; explains&lt;/a&gt;, such an advanced chip is actually a detriment to the unique operating conditions of Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xquwjpUh81lOY2W3EQ4rOpBiC3s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7009607/angled_original_imac_large_2x.0.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bOIjEu"&gt;That’s largely because Mars’ atmosphere offers far less protection from harmful radiation and charged particles than Earth’s atmosphere. A bad burst of radiation can badly wreck the sensitive electronics of a modern processor — and the more complex the chip, the more can go wrong. Plus, at 138 million miles away, it’s not like NASA can just swap out the processor if things go sideways. Because of those conditions, Perseverance actually features two computing modules: one is a backup just in case something goes wrong. (A third copy of the module is also on board for image analysis.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8EBVbb"&gt;To make the system even more durable, the PowerPC 750 chip in Perseverance is a little different than the one in the old iMacs. It’s technically &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAD750"&gt;a RAD750 chip&lt;/a&gt;, a special variant that’s hardened against radiation and costs upwards of $200,000. The chip is popular for spacecraft, too: in addition to Perseverance and Curiosity, it also powers the Fermi Space Telescope, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/20/4752114/deep-impact-mission-ends-NASA"&gt;Deep Impact&lt;/a&gt; comet-hunting spacecraft, and the Kepler telescope, among others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gkHqH5"&gt;While the processor may be weak compared to a modern smartphone or gaming PC, &lt;a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/rover/brains/"&gt;NASA’s spec sheet&lt;/a&gt; for Perseverance notes that it’s far more powerful than earlier rovers like Spirit or Opportunity: its 200MHz clock speed is 10 times faster than those older rovers, and with 2GB of flash memory, it offers eight times the storage. (Rounding things out, Perseverance also has 256MB of RAM in case you were looking to build your own rover.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="4laQzH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Linux has made it to Mars","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291324/linux-perseverance-mars-curiosity-ingenuity"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="HSQ57a"&gt;But while the chip itself has been to Mars before, Perseverance features some new computer technology that’s debuting on the planet for the first time: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291324/linux-perseverance-mars-curiosity-ingenuity"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt;, which powers the Ingenuity helicopter that will attempt to fly autonomously on Mars as part of Perseverance’s mission. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter users on Android can now join the platform’s Clubhouse-like Spaces</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R-4nJ62ElLFYscatQzAsvGwX3tg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68899179/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8YR8uC"&gt;Twitter has opened its audio chat room, Spaces, to Android users, the company tweeted Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GETEtc"&gt;Twitter introduced a limited version of the Clubhouse competitor on iOS in January. While any users of Twitter’s iOS app can join and listen to Spaces, only a few can host them at the moment. Twitter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1339639767089238019?s=20"&gt;said it was giving Spaces&lt;/a&gt; to “a very small feedback group” to start, with women and people from other marginalized groups given priority. Now, users of Twitter’s Android app can join and listen to Spaces as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LRcpHM"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Android folks, our beta is growing! starting today you will be able to join and talk in any Space. SOON you’ll be able to create your own but we’re still working out some things. keep your    out for live Spaces above your home tl&lt;/p&gt;— Spaces (@TwitterSpaces) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1366767412117458946?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z9Nmps"&gt;The announcement tweet doesn’t mention when Android users will be able to host Spaces; it looks like Android users can speak and listen to conversations in Spaces but not host their own chats just yet. A Twitter spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that both Android and iOS users will be able to start and listen to Spaces “soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Efns3O"&gt;Twitter has ramped up its forays into voice-based features over the past several months. In addition to launching Spaces in beta, it introduced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21294481/twitter-audio-tweets-now-available-iphone-ios"&gt;audio tweets last June on iOS&lt;/a&gt; for a limited number of people, allowing users to record and send audio messages up to 140 seconds long — a nod to the original tweet length of 140 characters. It also introduced support for voice-based direct messages &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287091/twitter-voice-dm-test-india-brazil-japan"&gt;in India last month&lt;/a&gt; for both iOS and Android apps.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cUin8N"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296032/twitter-audio-tweets-accessibility-volunteers"&gt;Twitter faced some criticism&lt;/a&gt; for failing to include captions on its audio messages for its users who are deaf and hard of hearing, but it said it would be adding automated captions to audio and video in tweets sometime this year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Samsung Galaxy A52 5G will get monthly security updates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6ZV7tgWoE7QEsRsnDV09hg0DKmo=/319x0:3765x2297/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68898786/a52_5g_blass.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The upcoming Galaxy A52 5G is shaping up to be a competitive midranger indeed. | Photo by Evan Blass&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lZC4ko"&gt;Samsung’s upcoming midrange device, the Galaxy A52 5G, appears to be in line to receive monthly security updates. First &lt;a href="https://www.galaxyclub.nl/nieuws/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-krijgt-maandelijks-beveiligingsupdates/"&gt;spotted by Galaxy Club&lt;/a&gt;, the yet-to-be formally announced A52 5G &lt;a href="https://security.samsungmobile.com/workScope.smsb"&gt;appears on Samsung’s security update page&lt;/a&gt; for its monthly update cycle. Along with earlier &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278488/samsung-galaxy-a52-a72-leak-90hz-refresh-rate-screen"&gt;rumors of high refresh rate screens&lt;/a&gt; — and &lt;a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-camera-specs-update-schedule-leaks_id130451"&gt;a new leak that suggests&lt;/a&gt; the main camera will offer optical image stabilization — this looks like Samsung is taking the A51’s successor very seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wrnslb"&gt;Samsung generally reserves spots on the monthly update schedule for flagship and higher-end devices. While this isn’t the first time a midrange A-series device has been scheduled for monthly updates, last year’s Galaxy A51 and A51 5G are on the quarterly update schedule. Putting the A52 5G on the monthly schedule makes it more competitive with the likes of the Pixel 4A 5G, which receives frequent updates directly from Google. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iH7h35S0hyqg02Ev01y8ovYBIWo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22340151/a52_updates.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung has listed the unreleased Galaxy A52 5G on a support page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nXJ5sP"&gt;As far as leaks and rumors go, update schedules aren’t as exciting as hardware specs like screen refresh rates and megapixel counts. But they’re just as important; regular updates ensure that bugs and issues can be fixed in a timely manner. Samsung has committed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates"&gt;offering a minimum of four years&lt;/a&gt; of regular security updates for many of its Galaxy devices, including the A-series. The A52 5G will probably drop down to quarterly and then occasional frequency toward the end of those four years, but this still goes a long way to making the device usable for many years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="r3GGJp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung’s Galaxy A51 has two good things going for it: the screen and the price","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21251569/samsung-galaxy-a51-review-price-screen-camera-battery-life"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ZH1fE0"&gt;There’s still no word on an official release date for the Galaxy A52 5G and A52, but it seems likely that a launch is imminent. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can buy Razer’s tiny Tomahawk gaming PC starting today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/17bk917NBIkg4mZK8ONkldQEGUw=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68898689/https___hybrismediaprod.blob.core.windows.net_sys_master_phoenix_images_container_hc7_h73_9122164572190_Tomahawk_Gaming_Desktop_1500x1000_20201204_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ItCVik"&gt;Razer’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21054602/razer-tomahawk-desktop-gaming-pc-intel-nuc-element-design-specs-ces-2020"&gt;small form factor Tomahawk gaming desktop&lt;/a&gt; is finally &lt;a href="http://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-desktops-and-cases%2Frazer-tomahawk-gaming-desktop%2FRZ80-03650200-B3U1&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for sale&lt;/a&gt; — mostly. The PC’s main appeal, apart from its size, is that you only need to worry about two parts: the NUC and the graphics card. Razer has a listing for a version that comes with just the NUC, which would allow users to slot in a graphics card they already own, but it seems to be marked as out of stock. The version that’s available for sale today comes with an otherwise extremely hard-to-get &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21435926/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-review"&gt;RTX 3080 Founder’s Edition&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TNAVB3"&gt;If you have the $3,199.99 to spend on the version with the 3080, today’s launch seems like the real deal — you can add it to your cart, and Razer’s site says it will ship the next business day. As for the NUC-only version, it’s still listed as out of stock, just like both versions were when they (kind of, sort of, maybe not actually) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/4/22151862/razer-tomahawk-modular-desktop-gaming-pc-available-price-specs"&gt;became available for preorder in December&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve reached out to Razer about the availability of the NUC-only version but haven’t received a response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EUnhI9"&gt;The computer uses Intel’s NUC, or Next Unit of Computing, as its brain, meaning the actual PC part is just a card that slots in next to the GPU. It seems like there’s only one version of the Tomahawk so far, and it’s got some decent specs: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Us3odU"&gt;An Intel Core i9-9980HK eight-core CPU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5V9y0t"&gt;A 512GB NVME SSD and 2.5-inch 2TB HDD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="E74vMg"&gt;16GB DDR4 SO-DIMM RAM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Rv7ZNu"&gt;RGB, of course&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="lqZwHi"&gt;At the price point, though, a CPU that is two generations out of date is a bit rough, but that can probably be blamed on Intel. So far, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22231244/intel-nuc-11-pc-announcement-includes-mini-gaming-computer"&gt;Intel hasn’t released a NUC Extreme Compute Element&lt;/a&gt;, like the Tomahawk uses, with its new 11th Gen processors. And because of the design, you can’t upgrade the CPU yourself, though it is worth noting that the RAM and storage can be swapped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PsiR2F"&gt;Still, it’s important to emphasize how small this PC is and how packed it is with features — it fits Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5, two Thunderbolt 3 ports, and four USB-A ports inside a 10-liter case. But if you’re thinking of buying it, you should just be sure you’re happy with how it is today: the graphics card can be upgraded, but the NUC is going to stay the same, unless Intel releases a new one. If you’re put off by the NUC element, though, Razer does sell a similar &lt;a href="http://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-desktops-and-cases%2FRazer-Tomahawk%2FRC21-01400100-R3M1&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Tomahawk-branded Mini-ITX case&lt;/a&gt; that fits standard PC hardware for $229.99 — but it’ll probably be hard to find a CPU and GPU to put in it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic Games is buying Fall Guys creator Mediatonic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MbcIelCfLnn3HkxCA2KkKcKrEPE=/205x0:1555x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68898663/50433041022_749f19633d_h.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Devolver Digital&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="USAxxY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;creator Epic Games is acquiring video game studio Mediatonic, the maker of smash hit &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt;, for an undisclosed sum, the &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/tonic-games-group-makers-of-fall-guys-joins-epic-games"&gt;companies announced on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. The deal marks one of Epic’s higher-profile acquisitions of late, following its 2019 purchases of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/12/18662708/epic-games-houseparty-acquisition-fortnite-video-chat"&gt;social video app Houseparty&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525842/epic-games-psyonix-acquisition-rocket-league-fortnite-unreal-deal"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rocket League &lt;/em&gt;developer Psyonix&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aGHF8E"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.mediatonicgames.com/blog/mediatonic-joins-the-epic-games-family"&gt;blog posts and FAQs detailing the announcement&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys &lt;/em&gt;will remain available on Steam for the time being, and the developer is still bringing the game to both the Xbox and Nintendo Switch platforms. Epic and Mediatonic say there are no plans right now to make the game (which currently costs $19.99) free-to-play, as Epic did with &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;. Epic &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ethangach/status/1366844352727777287"&gt;later confirmed&lt;/a&gt; it plans to make the PC version of &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys &lt;/em&gt;available on the Epic Game Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XEqMlS"&gt;Interestingly, &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt; is built using the Unity game engine, a rival to Epic’s Unreal platform. Despite that, the companies say they hope to bring &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;-style features like crossplay to &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt; in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pc5nKh"&gt;The acquisition includes Mediatonic and Fortitude Games, both of which are owned by parent company Tonic Games Group, which announced the deal with Epic today. “It’s no secret that Epic is invested in building the Metaverse and Tonic Games shares this goal. As Epic works to build this virtual future, we need great creative talent who know how to build powerful games, content and experiences,” said Epic CEO Tim Sweeney in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="v4XQ9u"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;HUGE NEWS!&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Mediatonic?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Mediatonic&lt;/a&gt; are pleased to announce that we've joined the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EpicGames?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@EpicGames&lt;/a&gt; family!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What does this mean? I'm glad you asked!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;FAQ:&lt;a href="https://t.co/QpiEHemUca"&gt;https://t.co/QpiEHemUca&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/ZcGaoooljz"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ZcGaoooljz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Fall Guys 4041   SOON (@FallGuysGame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FallGuysGame/status/1366811607213481985?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bfExq6"&gt;“At Tonic Games Group we often say that ‘everyone deserves a game that feels like it was made for them.’ With Epic, we feel like we have found a home that was made for us. They share our mission to build and support games that have a positive impact, empower others and stand the test of time and we couldn’t be more excited to be joining forces with their team,” said Dave Bailey, CEO and co-founder of Tonic Games Group, in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b4WCV5"&gt;Officially called&lt;em&gt; Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout&lt;/em&gt;, the platformer battle royale game released last August as a timed console exclusive for the PlayStation 4 and also on PC. It became a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355586/fall-guys-ultimate-knockout-pc-ps4-game"&gt;fast hit&lt;/a&gt; and, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221075/among-us-2020-most-downloaded-mobile-game"&gt;indie sensation &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an instant part of the gaming zeitgeist for the ways it let friends craving social experiences during the pandemic team up and compete against both one another and lobbies full of strangers while they were stuck at home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PBILkV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt; draws inspiration from game shows like &lt;em&gt;Takeshi’s Castle &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Wipeout &lt;/em&gt;by making players compete in ludicrous mini-games that often result in slapstick failure for large swaths of the participants until only one player is left standing. Since the game’s release, Mediatonic has followed closely in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s footsteps by releasing seasonal themed battle passes and also cutting deals with brands to bring trademarked designs and characters into the game as optional character skins, a business model Epic is quite familiar with and likely plans to continue. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tenet is coming to theaters in New York City, at last</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bR71OCOXadcO3nL74EKWrHhQsuU=/160x0:1888x1152/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68898582/tenet_poster.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IMKRrG"&gt;Christopher Nolan’s &lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt;, the time-traveling epic that hasn’t quite been a hit at the box office, will come to movie theaters in New York City on Friday, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/03/tenet-finally-arriving-in-new-york-city-this-friday-1234704793/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. It gives NYC theaters — which can reopen at limited capacity starting Friday — a marquee film for theatergoers who want to see &lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt; on the big screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4ujJb"&gt;The movie’s release was pushed back several times because of the coronavirus pandemic and resulting movie theater closures, making it a litmus test of sorts for summer movies during a rampant pandemic. Warner Bros. released the movie in international markets including Australia, Canada, France, and the UK in August, and some US theaters on Labor Day weekend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g0zHhS"&gt;But most US moviegoers didn’t seem to think venturing into a theater was worth the risk; &lt;em&gt;Tenet &lt;/em&gt;has only grossed about $360 million worldwide, a disappointing showing so far for the $200 million flick. It’s also already available on DVD, but it’s still &lt;a href="https://variety.com/feature/2021-oscars-best-visual-effects-predictions-1234773086/"&gt;considered an Oscar contender&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tXnrj4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt; will play at AMC Lincoln Square, AMC Empire, AMC Kips Bay, Village East by Angelika, and Showcase Cinemas Jamaica, according to &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="sMz63N"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Tenet is a complete misfire ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22187467/tenet-review-christopher-nolan-inversion-box-office"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Microsoft and Niantic demo a HoloLens version of Pokémon Go</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3zXsJ86kK5o7xDo7lG80zsyuqCI=/95x0:1082x658/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68898521/pokemongo.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A prototype version of Pokémon Go on HoloLens.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Niantic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TBHOXK"&gt;Microsoft is launching its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22308883/microsoft-mesh-virtual-reality-augmented-reality-hololens-vr-headsets-features"&gt;Microsoft Mesh mixed reality platform today&lt;/a&gt;, and part of the announcement includes a brief demonstration of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; running on the HoloLens 2 headset. Niantic has partnered with Microsoft to create this proof-of-concept version of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;demonstrating what might be possible for the game in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vRzzUH"&gt;The demo shows how HoloLens users could spot a &lt;em&gt;Pokémon &lt;/em&gt;in the wild and feed it berries ahead of a typical gym battle with another player. There’s a menu that HoloLens users tap to access different parts of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;but Niantic stresses it’s not a dedicated app or ready for consumers yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F5KYhc"&gt;“While this demo is not intended for consumer use, it offers an early glimpse into the future evolutions in both software and hardware,” &lt;a href="https://nianticlabs.com/blog/microsoft-ignite-2021/?hl=en"&gt;says John Hanke&lt;/a&gt;, CEO and founder of Niantic. “We’ve only scratched the surface. We know the years ahead to be filled with important achievements which will serve as waypoints in AR’s journey to become a life-changing computing platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3wAzfc"&gt;Hanke appeared on Microsoft’s virtual Ignite stage today as part of the company’s Mesh launch. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22308883/microsoft-mesh-virtual-reality-augmented-reality-hololens-vr-headsets-features"&gt;Microsoft Mesh&lt;/a&gt; is the software maker’s new mixed reality platform for developers, powered by Azure. It’s a collaborative platform that allows anyone to have shared virtual experiences on a variety of devices, and Microsoft is hoping it will encourage developers to create more mixed reality apps.&lt;/p&gt;
