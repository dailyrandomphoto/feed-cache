    <title>Workhorse says Postal Service broke its own rules in new mail truck contest</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aQRfzHx3Y5LpQnL56utBjCZ9hOI=/0x22:2560x1729/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69530892/suburb2_9_scaled.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R5XNGX"&gt;EV startup Workhorse has accused the United States Postal Service of bias in choosing defense contractor Oshkosh to build the next-generation mail truck, and claims the agency committed “countless errors” during the selection process. Workhorse also alleges that the new mail truck that Oshkosh and the USPS debuted in February is entirely different from the one the defense contractor tested during the yearslong competition, and that it doesn’t have a working prototype, something the startup says is blatant evidence of unfair treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fwT77I"&gt;These new allegations are at the &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22694043/gov.uscourts.uscfc.43940.28.0__1_.pdf"&gt;heart of the complaint&lt;/a&gt; that Workhorse filed in the US Court of Federal Claims &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536793/workhorse-federal-bid-protest-usps-contract-oshkosh-ngdv"&gt;on June 16th&lt;/a&gt;, which was unsealed this week. (The court had allowed time for Workhorse, the government, and Oshkosh to agree on certain redactions before making the complaint public.) If Workhorse can prove to the court that the USPS didn’t follow its own rules in giving the award to Oshkosh, there’s a chance that the judge could overturn the award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bYXA1Z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Claims of bias and unfair treatment&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SD28qK"&gt;While the court fight has only just begun, the outcome could have an impact on how quickly the USPS moves to electrify its fleet, something that President Biden has said is a priority for his administration. Oshkosh and the USPS have claimed that the new truck can be powered by either an internal combustion engine or an electric drivetrain, though neither has actually showed how. Oshkosh is supposed to make anywhere between 50,000 and 165,000 of them over the next 10 years, though Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said earlier this year that only 10 percent of the new fleet will be electric to start, and that shifting more of it to electric power would cost billions of dollars.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AdliJC"&gt;“While bid protests are a normal part of the government contracting process, we do not comment on such proceedings,” Oshkosh Defense said in a statement. The USPS said it does not comment on active litigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mccd09"&gt;A new mail truck is something that is desperately needed, as most of the current vehicles (which were designed by defense contractor Grumman) have been on the road for decades and have blown past their expected retirement date. They lack modern safety features, air conditioning systems, and are costing the USPS hundreds of millions of dollars in maintenance. &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3ezx4/post-office-delivery-trucks-keep-catching-on-fire"&gt;Some have even caught fire&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2DeaNb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"USPS unveils next-generation mail truck with electric drivetrain option","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297823/usps-postal-service-mail-truck-electric-oshkosh-workhorse"},{"title":"Just 10 percent of the new Postal Service fleet will be electric","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300281/usps-new-mail-truck-ev-electric-workhorse-biden-dejoy"},{"title":"How the USPS mail trucks could still go fully electric","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22423179/usps-mail-trucks-electric-oshkosh"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="jloLJG"&gt;This is why, in 2015, the USPS kicked off a contest to develop a new mail truck, or “Next Generation Delivery Vehicle” (NGDV). But that competition has almost entirely played out in secret over the last half-decade. The 60-page complaint that was made public this week, while written from Workhorse’s perspective, offers one of the most detailed looks at how the contest played out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="11fN9v"&gt;The Ohio startup would have received a much-needed boost from the USPS contract, which could ultimately be worth up to $6 billion. Workhorse says in the complaint that it spent “over $6 million designing, prototyping and refining a proposed NGDV.” It also paid $7 million to &lt;a href="https://www.trucks.com/2019/12/12/workhorse-hackney-mail-truck-bidding-team-breaks-up/"&gt;buy out manufacturing partner VT Hackney in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, which decided to drop out of the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8ejJe"&gt;Workhorse built six prototypes of a delivery vehicle that it says was designed from the ground up, as opposed to Oshkosh’s original entrant, which was based on a Ford Transit. The startup says it completed the design in just one year and built these prototypes in “a mere eighteen weeks.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="Kk6iar"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Workhorse says the vehicle USPS chose didn’t go through official testing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="b2AR1w"&gt;“[Our] prototypes successfully completed the USPS test requirements of 24,000-mile durability testing and the 120 simulated delivery routes without any safety-critical incidents,” the company writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rpA63n"&gt;But when the prototype phase wrapped up, the startup argues that the USPS unfairly evaluated Workhorse’s prototypes and its ability to produce large quantities of the new mail truck. The USPS “failed to meaningfully notify Workhorse of perceived deficiencies in its proposal and that misled Workhorse as to the areas Workhorse needed to address in its updated proposal,” the company says, and ultimately the agency judged “Workhorse far more harshly and [held] it to far stricter standards” than Oshkosh or other competitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WK7Fso"&gt;Specifically, Workhorse believes the USPS wrongly scored the startup on the various categories that the agency said it would evaluate in picking a winner — things like total cost of ownership, prototype performance, quality of the design and technical approach, and supplier capability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FnF277"&gt;Workhorse says that it told the USPS in its proposal that its electric vehicles, which have fewer moving parts, could “reduce long-term vehicle maintenance expenses by approximately 60 percent as compared to fossil-fueled trucks” despite similar up-front costs. This was something the USPS said it valued highly. In its solicitation for prototypes, the agency said it would pick the design that “offers the best value to the Postal Service,” with “value” defined as “weighing total cost of ownership, technical evaluation results, and risk.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E90Jj7"&gt;Workhorse says the USPS whiffed on how it calculated total cost of ownership, as it still gave Oshkosh the top score. It also claims the USPS wrongfully blamed Workhorse for an incident during testing where one of its prototypes rolled away into a ditch. The test driver — supplied by the USPS — was at fault in that crash, Workhorse claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="asORVV"&gt;While Workhorse has inked some small deals with big companies like UPS over the last few years, the company has struggled to make money, instead turning to loans from hedge funds and selling parts of its business to survive. The startup says the USPS “afforded undue weight to Workhorse’s prior experience” but doesn’t go into further detail in the complaint about how its history may have impacted the agency’s decision. Oshkosh, on the other hand, has a long history of bidding for and winning government contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NFXehj"&gt;Still, Workhorse argues, the USPS “put its thumb on the scale against Workhorse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MWEZAi"&gt;“No rational analysis could conclude that the best value for the USPS’s fleet for the next twenty years is a vehicle that has yet to be built (much less prototyped), uses an internal combustion engine rather than an emissions-free electric motor, and that almost certainly will be more expensive to own and operate than Workhorse’s existing and tested vehicle,” the startup writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Q6TZww"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The USPS authored a “lengthy screed aggressively attacking Workhorse” in March&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XqOpNc"&gt;According to the complaint, Workhorse initially tried to plead its case with the USPS outside of federal court. It filed a “good faith disagreement” with the USPS in March in an attempt to make the agency withdraw its award based on these complaints. But the company claims it was completely ignored by the USPS during nearly the entire 10-day response period. And at the end of that 10-day stretch, the USPS denied the attempt with what Workhorse describes as a particularly nasty letter that raised issues with the startup’s proposal that the agency hadn’t previously mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A7X6Oi"&gt;“[T]he USPS spent the resolution period authoring a lengthy screed aggressively attacking Workhorse and its years-long effort to assist the USPS in developing a first-rate NGDV,” Workhorse writes in the complaint. “The USPS delivered its scorched-earth ‘resolution’ decision to Workhorse on the evening of the tenth day, March 22, 2021.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="21q0oF"&gt;“Aside from its remarkably hostile tone, the USPS’s Response Letter is full of misleading statements, mischaracterizations, distortions, and strawman arguments. There can be little doubt that it was written for an audience other than Workhorse,” the startup writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zNfDPc"&gt;In that letter, though, Workhorse says the USPS admitted that Oshkosh submitted two separate vehicle designs — one combustion engine and one electric — in the final phase of the contest that were different from the Ford-based van it had put through testing. It was the USPS that decided to combine these two proposals from Oshkosh, according to Workhorse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="irVm2Q"&gt;Another thing Workhorse takes issue with is that Oshkosh does not have a history of developing electric vehicles. In late 2020, Oshkosh itself even warned investors in &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000775158/000156459020054491/osk-10k_20200930.htm"&gt;a filing with the SEC&lt;/a&gt; that it “may not have the expertise or resources” to compete as the market shifts to electric vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="AHy3Qc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Workhorse says “The USPS is gambling” on Oshkosh&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p713mC"&gt;This is not just an ideological argument; Workhorse lays out the case in its complaint that Oshkosh’s inexperience with developing zero-emissions vehicles could cause trouble, as the USPS says it wants the new fleet to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act, which is supposed to make sure that the federal government “gives proper consideration to the environment prior to undertaking any major federal action that could significantly impact the environment.” There’s a chance, Workhorse argues, that the USPS may need to change the timeline or scope of the NGDV order — or terminate the contract entirely — if the fleet isn’t compliant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fFTXZd"&gt;“The USPS is gambling that not only will Oshkosh’s maiden foray into electric vehicle manufacturing be successful, but also that Oshkosh will succeed while at the same time producing hundreds of thousands of a gas-burning version,” Workhorse writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MrYD6G"&gt;What’s more, Workhorse argues that Oshkosh improperly lobbied the House of Representatives, the White House, the USPS, and the Postal Regulatory Commission during the bidding process, as did Ford. Workhorse says this violated the NDA that the USPS made competitors sign as well as the ground rules for the contest. But Oshkosh wasn’t punished, while the USPS hammered Workhorse for making public statements about its prospects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="EsU4PJ"&gt;“In contrast to its complete disinterest in the Oshkosh team’s NGDV lobbying campaign aimed at every entity involved in the award decision and funding of the procurement, in violation of the NDA and the Ground Rules, the USPS castigated Workhorse for making innocuous and good-faith public statements confirming its participation,” the startup writes. “The double standard on display here is as troubling as it is obvious.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to restore your Mac from the macOS Monterey beta to Big Sur</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QsFRv8tXEAOtBo2Aq053anr3AdU=/102x0:1790x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69530607/lcimg_71a6f738_86b9_4aed_a194_067e8224a6d4.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZoFr15"&gt;If you downloaded and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22323032"&gt;installed the macOS Monterey public beta&lt;/a&gt;, there’s a chance that you may want to return to Big Sur, which is currently the stable macOS version. There are a couple of different ways to restore your Mac’s original software; which one you should follow depends on how you installed the beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Y2Oq8"&gt;The path to restoring is easiest if you made a Time Machine backup before updating the operating system, or if you installed the beta on a separate partition via Disk Utility. If you installed the beta on your main partition without a backup, you can still restore your system to the older OS, but you’ll need to start fresh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="GY1Bse"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple launches public beta of macOS Monterey, bringing updates to FaceTime and Safari","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22557880/apple-macos-public-beta-facetime-safari-updates"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="JshbJD"&gt;Whichever path you chose, we’ll walk you through how to find your way back to a more reliable OS. Pick the method that suits you best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6OQPMd"&gt;Note: some of these steps may differ, depending on whether your Mac has an Intel processor or Apple silicon, like the M1 processor. If you’re not sure which you have, click on the Apple logo in your system’s upper left corner, and choose “About This Mac.” In the Overview, you’ll be able to see which processor you have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2rnonW"&gt;Wait for the next stable update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jtcoqt"&gt;If you aren’t in a rush to go back your previous OS, you can simply unenroll your Mac from the beta program and wait for the next stable update, which will revert you to that OS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="0lqDG7"&gt;Go to “System Preferences” &amp;gt; “Software Update.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wstzaD"&gt;Select “Details...” in the bottom-left corner of the window, underneath the message “This Mac is enrolled in the Apple Beta Software Program.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RfLtFP"&gt;Select “Restore Defaults” to unenroll your Mac from the beta.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TPgSlk"&gt;Restore to a previous Time Machine backup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZxsIOR"&gt;If you made a Time Machine backup just before you installed the beta, then reverting to your previous stable OS is relatively simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="YnLOhK"&gt;Make sure you back up any files that you created while working with the beta (unless, of course, you don’t care whether you lose them). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="loGbwO"&gt;Connect the external hard drive that you used for Time Machine backups to your system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HL6r1r"&gt;If you have an Intel-based Mac, restart your Mac and hold both the Command and R keys through the startup chime until the Apple logo shows. You should then see the macOS Recovery window. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LrJR4a"&gt;If your Mac is equipped with Apple silicon, power down your Mac, then press and hold the power button until you see the “Startup Options” window. Click the gear icon, then click “Continue.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NP3ztg"&gt;Within the macOS Recovery window, select the drive, then find “Restore From Time Machine Backup.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="In the Recovery window, find “Restore From Time Machine Backup.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BC-2dGFha7YDFLuk8mgpACs6cqE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22693975/macos_big_sur_recovery_reinstall_macos.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the Recovery window, find “Restore From Time Machine Backup.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="P1oWcS"&gt;Select the backup that you want to revert to. Note that the window will show the macOS version. Look for the last one that shows version 11 instead of 12.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KmCA0Q"&gt;Once the reversion process is finished, things should be as you left them before installing the beta.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="i3RLDe"&gt;Erase a separate partition that contains the Monterey beta&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="8H4pN6"&gt;If you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22323032"&gt;installed the Monterey beta to a separate partition&lt;/a&gt; (as opposed to overwriting your main partition), you can simply eliminate that one to reclaim some SSD space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="K0Hlog"&gt;If you have an Intel-based Mac, restart your Mac and hold both the Command and R keys through the startup chime until the Apple logo shows. You should then see the macOS Recovery window. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aTowmg"&gt;If your Mac is equipped with Apple silicon, power down your Mac, then press and hold the power button until you see the “Startup Options” window. Click the gear icon, then click “Continue.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EKWrUQ"&gt;Once you see the macOS Recovery window, find the partition that you created and named. Then click “Disk Utility.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VLmv92"&gt;After the Disk Utility window opens, click the partition that you want to delete.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VqkWc4"&gt;You can ensure that it’s the correct partition (the one using macOS 12) by looking for the macOS version, which is listed under the partition’s name near the middle of the window. Do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; delete the partition for macOS 11, or else you’ll need to follow the steps in the next section to fully restore your machine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aldzr1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; delete the partition for macOS 11, or you’ll need to fully restore your machine&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="j077hY"&gt;When you’re ready to erase the partition, click “Erase” near the top-right section of the Disk Utility app, then click “Erase.” Do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; click “Erase Volume Group” because that may delete your main partition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IX6tFd"&gt;Erasing the partition won’t completely eliminate it. To do that, click the partition once again, and near the “Erase” button along the top-right corner, find “Volume” and click the minus symbol to fully remove it from your SSD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="N6SxtE"&gt;After that, you can click the Apple logo at the top-left of the screen and restart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="q0yuRr"&gt;Restore to a fresh install of macOS Big Sur&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zFe2Z8"&gt;If you don’t have a Time Machine backup, or you’d prefer to restore your Mac for a clean start, here’s how to proceed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="E6Nmp0"&gt;If you have an Intel-based Mac, restart your Mac, holding both the Command and R keys through the startup chime until the Apple logo shows. You should then see the macOS Recovery window. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uV8gdJ"&gt;If your Mac is equipped with Apple silicon, power down your Mac, then press and hold the power button until you see the “Startup Options” window. Click the gear icon, then click “Continue.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wkaoUn"&gt;Once you see the macOS Recovery window, click on your intended install drive, then click “Reinstall macOS.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1RwZQq"&gt;This process will restore your Mac to factory settings, so you’ll need to reinstall all of your apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="MkV43L"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9AkotG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="LAmh9M"&gt;When you can be in the right place at the right time, you can really make some things happen for yourself. Take, for instance, Volodymyr Kvashuk, who moved from Ukraine to the US for a career in computer science and wound up working as an engineer for Microsoft. According to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2021-microsoft-xbox-gift-card-fraud/?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_content=businessweek&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-businessweek&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;a new must-read feature from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; that was exactly the right time to turn a loophole in Microsoft’s payment testing apparatus into a multimillion-dollar Bitcoin scheme — and a sick lake house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NKeWmu"&gt;Kvashuk’s job was to look for flaws in how Microsoft processed payments by buying things like physical hardware using a company card and a fake login. Microsoft knew enough to not send him a Dell PC every time he ordered one, but Xbox gift cards bought online and sent to an email inbox weren’t accounted for, which was an opening Kvashuk couldn’t ignore. It was also just the thing he needed to earn a few quick millions. As Austin Carr writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="VMyY4e"&gt;Kvashuk started small, generating Xbox cards in increments from $10 to $100. But his haul quickly escalated. By the time federal agents caught up with him almost two years later, he had stolen more than 152,000 Xbox gift cards, worth $10.1 million, and was living off the proceeds in a seven-figure lakefront home with plans to buy a ski chalet, yacht, and seaplane. This past November, a judge sentenced him to nine years in prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="r5WSYv"&gt;All Kvashuk needed was a way to get a bunch of codes at once (his co-workers’ accounts would do), hide where the purchases were being made (rerouting those requests through foreign servers works), and resell the cards for cryptocurrency (a website called Paxful.com fit the bill) to get a delicious Xbox gift card crime soup going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Wqcz0"&gt;I’d be remiss to share more because Carr’s reporting on this story really is a fun ride. Kvashuk deploys some wonderful logic to justify his gift card operation — basically, gift card money isn’t real — which, in a way, reflects the way Microsoft and plenty of other companies have treated gift cards in the past. They obscured the actual value with point systems and hoped customers would treat the cards they bought like funny money. Kvashuk actually did — just in a way no one expected. You can read how Kvashuk did it &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2021-microsoft-xbox-gift-card-fraud/?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_content=businessweek&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-businessweek&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;on &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;right now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood’s IPO filing reveals Dogecoin helped its revenue skyrocket in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oGtv-QQ3hAyqeWQ2TGueZWtx3R8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69530339/acastro_210129_1777_robinhood_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustrations by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OtBmN3"&gt;The moment &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373990/robinhood-ipo-form-regulators-finance"&gt;that some of you have been waiting for&lt;/a&gt; is here — Robinhood’s &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1783879/000162828021013318/robinhoods-1.htm"&gt;S-1 filing to go public has been revealed&lt;/a&gt;, laying bare the kind of secrets you only learn when a company is legally obligated to reveal them. Only one day ago, the company agreed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557419/robinhood-finra-fine-70-million"&gt;pay a record-breaking $70 million fine&lt;/a&gt; “for systemic supervisory failures and significant harm suffered by millions of customers,” and now its paperwork touts a commitment to “maintaining strong relationships with our loyal customer base and earning our customers’ trust when they choose our platform on their financial journeys.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XuwHNi"&gt;So what does the much-anticipated document include? There’s a note that the United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California has executed a search warrant for co-founder and CEO Vladimir Tenev’s phone as well as information about a recent Securities and Exchange Commission Enforcement Division inquiry into Robinhood’s “For You” feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nCtSpo"&gt;According to Robinhood, some 1,600 jointly represented customers “may pursue arbitration of individual claims against us arising out of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/9/21171584/robinhood-outage-week-us-stocks-third-market"&gt;the March 2020 Outages&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to other alleged system outages.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Cr86mt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“34 percent of our cryptocurrency transaction-based revenue was attributable to transactions in Dogecoin.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZEeLDj"&gt;GameStop is mentioned five times in the document (usually along with AMC and other popular Reddit stonks), mostly in describing Robinhood’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256419/robinhood-limits-wall-street-bets-stock-buys"&gt;decision to limit trading this spring&lt;/a&gt;. There have been about 50 class action lawsuits filed over the incident as well as investigations or inquiries from the USAO, DOJ, SEC, FINRA, and any other combination of letters you can imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ioLHIV"&gt;Memes are inextricably a part of Robinhood’s business, as it notes that in the first three months of 2021, “34 percent of our cryptocurrency transaction-based revenue was attributable to transactions in Dogecoin.” At the same time, revenue from cryptocurrency transactions went from 4 percent for the last three months of 2020 to 12 percent of its total revenue in the first three months of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TrJ1pB"&gt;Robinhood (HOOD) says it has about 17.7 million monthly active users, about $80 billion in assets under management and despite the spike in activity, it lost nearly $1.5 billion in the first three months of 2021. Its S-1 filing also addressed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360639/robinhood-confetti-ipo-removed-app-stock-market"&gt;recent removal of a confetti celebration effect in the app&lt;/a&gt;, saying, “This practice drew scrutiny from certain regulators and the media and, in 2021, we introduced new unique visual experiences to mark milestones in our customers’ financial journeys.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s camera-centric Xperia 1 III to ship on August 19th for $1,299</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/51YwlW54zMbn6cAuknjyqSuLwAk=/547x0:6454x3938/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69530326/Xperia_1_IIIcameraZeiss_frostedBlack.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Xperia 1 III puts an emphasis on advanced camera features and high-end display specs.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8Go4M5"&gt;Sony’s next flagship phone, the Xperia 1 III, will ship on August 19th in the US — for a whopping $1,299.99. It’s available to preorder today, the company announced. The new photography-focused phone is designed as a complement to Sony’s Alpha camera range, and it introduces a variable periscope-style telephoto lens. It’s also equipped with just about everything you’d expect from a flagship Android phone in 2021, including a Snapdragon 888 processor, 5G, and a 6.5-inch display with 120Hz refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PQSJmb"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/24/21268097/sonys-xperia-1-ii-ships-july-24th-1199-us-united-states"&gt;Xperia 1 II launched at $1,200&lt;/a&gt; — pricey even for a top-of-the-line device — and Sony isn’t backing off by pricing this one at an extra $100. In this case at least, users in the US will be able to utilize its 5G connectivity; last year’s model had the right hardware but couldn’t use US 5G networks. The 6.5-inch 4K display has also been upgraded to a faster 120Hz refresh rate compared to last year’s model (which had a standard 60Hz rate), and you’ll get a bigger 4,500mAh battery, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="j6bena"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sony Xperia 1 II review: it’s a stretch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21322518/sony-xperia-1-ii-review-smartphone-new-camera-photo-pro"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="fDWEEb"&gt;If the Xperia 1 III sounds appealing but paying $1,300 does not, the Xperia 5 III is a smaller-screen variant that will likely cost a bit less, though US price and shipping are still unannounced. In the meantime, if you are willing to shell out top dollar for the 1 III, Sony’s offering a healthy preorder incentive by throwing in a pair of WF-1000XM3 noise-canceling earbuds for free on orders placed by September 26th. The Xperia 1 III will be sold &lt;a href="https://electronics.sony.com/"&gt;directly from Sony&lt;/a&gt; and other third-party retailers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Want to be an Amazon supplier? It could cost a piece of your company</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Media tour at Miami International Airport" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b0YaQ3s4wQHvLudD0vgaDtQE398=/0x0:5680x3787/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69530300/1233493336.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Marco Bello / Anadolu Agency via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YPxT1O"&gt;Amazon demands that suppliers let it buy up to 30 percent of their company at a fixed rate often below market valuation, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-demands-one-more-thing-from-some-vendors-a-piece-of-their-company-11624968099"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qp4SeY"&gt;Amazon has added these kinds of stipulations to contracts with companies that supply it with aircraft, Amazon Fresh groceries, and call center services more than 75 times over the last 10 years, according to the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;. Its potential equity in other firms is valued at nearly $3 billion, according to Amazon’s latest quarterly financial filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fYZrTD"&gt;These kinds of deals are called warrants, and they function similarly to stock options granted to employees of a company. Amazon gets the option to buy its supplier’s stock at a certain price, set before the deal is announced. When that stock shoots through the roof, Amazon can hold the warrants over the long-term or sell it off to make a tidy profit. Many of these deals are contingent on Amazon giving its suppliers a certain amount of business in a set time limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pBhrUR"&gt;Here’s an example: as Amazon was trying to build out its logistics fleet with cargo planes, it was negotiating with Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc for a 10-year lease. Part of the agreement Amazon proposed was the ability to buy 20 percent of the company over five years, with a potential 10 percent more equity later, according to the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pzweVj"&gt;Atlas agreed, with Amazon’s fixed price for the stock set at $37.50. When the deal was announced, the stock rose 27 percent. Amazon later sold 9 percent of its stake in the company, able to pocket the difference between its initial $37.50 price and the inflated price after the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hwVoXw"&gt;The deals could be considered a good thing for both sides of the agreement, as &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-06-30/amazon-got-some-warrants"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s&lt;/em&gt; Matt Levine has argued&lt;/a&gt;. Levine refers to one of the deals discussed in the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; article, where Amazon secured warrants for a potential 15 percent of grocery supplier SpartanNash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3lOEpW"&gt;He notes that SpartanNash’s stock jumped 26.3 percent the day the Amazon deal was announced, while Amazon only would be able to buy 15 percent of that equity market value. “26 is more than 15,” Levine shrewdly &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-06-30/amazon-got-some-warrants"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S2pkiB"&gt;But Amazon reportedly strong-arms these companies into agreeing to otherwise unheard-of terms, relying on its enormous buying capacity and clout among investors. Former Amazon executives told the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; that companies offered deals including warrants couldn’t refuse that part of the contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sdHujw"&gt;“There was definitely a sense that if it wasn’t agreed to there wouldn’t be a deal,” one source involved in the Atlas deal told the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple launches public beta of macOS Monterey, bringing updates to FaceTime and Safari</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A MacBook Pro running macOS Monterey sits on a table in front of a window. The screen displays the Quick note app on top of a pink and purple background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CNYGStZnZP-kSXROO5wLnd6PJpY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69530097/mchin_210701_4658_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Need a quick note? There’s an app for that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="juxc3a"&gt;The public beta of macOS 12 Monterey, Apple’s next big macOS release, is now available for download. The operating system has the same general look and feel as its predecessor, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21564490/macos-big-sur-review-apple-macbook-pro-air-mac-ipad-m1"&gt;macOS 11 Big Sur&lt;/a&gt;, but it brings some new features and a number of tweaks to Apple’s most popular services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nxcR1j"&gt;Before we get into this, friendly reminder that Monterey is, for now, a beta. It may not be the best idea to install on a primary device, as you might encounter bugs, unfinished features, and incompatibility with third-party apps. If you will be installing the program on your daily driver, make sure you’ve backed up anything you can’t afford to mess with first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2tJJv"&gt;For those who take the leap and install the public beta, the component Apple seems most excited about is its updates to FaceTime. My favorite of these is Portrait Mode, which blurs the background behind you while you’re speaking on a call (similarly to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"&gt;the iPhone’s feature with the same name&lt;/a&gt;). Portrait Mode didn’t always get everything — sometimes when there were multiple different surfaces behind me, it seemed to get a bit confused and leave some parts un-blurred. But it wasn’t difficult to find areas where the feature worked just fine. Apple says Portrait Mode will be available for adoption in third-party apps as well, but we’ll have to wait for them to issue updates to support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="xI6srY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 preview: a first look at Apple’s latest software","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"},{"title":"How to install the macOS Monterey public beta","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22558991/macos-monterey-how-to-install-public-beta"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of a MacBook screen where a user is on a FaceTime call with a blurred bright bedroom background. A FaceTime drop-down menu is open in the top right with Portrait selected." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2NsKif8IbPqAUClq3MVExUI7Bcg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22692197/IMG_9643.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;macOS Monterey’s new FaceTime Portrait Mode did a decent job of blurring out my background.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RPSdWc"&gt;Even though it’s had the ability to make group calls for a few years, I’ve always viewed FaceTime as a tool for calling one person at a time. But Monterey introduces a few other features that are clearly meant to make the tool a stronger Zoom competitor, conducive to meetings and larger calls. It now supports a grid view and Spatial Audio (which makes other people’s voices sound like they’re coming from the area on the screen where their face is positioned). You can generate a link to a FaceTime call ahead of time (the same way you generate a Zoom link), and users of Android and Windows can join from their browsers. And a new Voice Isolation feature uses machine learning to mitigate background noise while you’re speaking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5DK3OV"&gt;There’s a new feature called SharePlay, which is like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21191503/netflix-party-stream-movies-tv-chat-watch-friends-social-distance"&gt;Netflix Party&lt;/a&gt; or Scener but for FaceTime. Like Netflix Party, it allows you and other people on your FaceTime call to watch content from certain streaming services together by syncing everyone’s video playback and controls. (So we’re both watching the video on our own devices, with our own accounts. But when I pause or start, you pause or start as well.) SharePlay isn’t a new idea, but it’ll certainly be convenient to have on FaceTime. While the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522904/apple-shareplay-facetime-music-hulu-videos-tiktok-wwdc"&gt;list of supported services&lt;/a&gt; includes some big players (such as Disney Plus, Hulu, HBO Max, Paramount Plus, Twitch, Pluto TV, and — hilariously — TikTok), it doesn’t appear to include Netflix, which is the one streaming service I and all of my friends and family reliably have in common. Until that’s added to the roster, I don’t see myself using this that often. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bvui2D"&gt;A new feature that I do think I’ll be using a lot is Quick Note. Quick Note gives you an easy way to take notes on an article you’re reading (or items you’re viewing in Maps, Photos, or other apps). You can right-click highlighted text to add it to a Quick Note, and it’ll appear there along with a link to the source. (You can press Fn+Q to pull up a blank one as well.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="On9s5f"&gt;Quick Notes sync across devices and are available in a specific “Quick Notes” folder in the Notes app. The handiest thing, I think, is that if you’ve got an app open where you’ve previously created a Quick Note, you can hover your cursor in the bottom-right corner of the screen and a thumbnail of the note will pop up. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of a MacBook Pro screen. The Verge’s review of the Razer Blade 14 is open in Safari. A paragraph is higlighted with “Add to Quick Note” in an adjacent drop-down menu selected. A Quick Note is open on the left side of the screen with more text and a link to the article." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/09b_x2tfr-du0C0QCPK7kHPH8mI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22692276/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_4.25.44_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I took some notes on my recent review of the Razer Blade 14. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dIYFeJ"&gt;Apple has introduced a few “continuity” features that are meant to make it easier to use Macs alongside other Apple devices. Arguably the most exciting one, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523613/macos-monterey-wwdc-apple-ipad"&gt;Universal Control&lt;/a&gt;, won’t be ready until a future beta. What you can try now is AirPlay, which has made its way to macOS for the first time. AirPlay makes it easier to cast content to a Mac computer: it can mirror or extend your iPhone’s screen, for example, or can function as an AirPlay 2 speaker. I was able to set this up easily (you just need to wait until the devices detect each other and then enter a code on your phone), and it worked well. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of a macOS notification that reads “Airplay: Look What You Made Me Do would like to AirPlay to this Mac.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f31vkR0ekMZegf2SG1Ow2M2dQw0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22692357/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_4.48.05_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, that is the name of my iPhone. Long story.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="o4V6EO"&gt;Safari has some tweaks, mainly concerning tabs. The URL bar now lives next to your tabs, which gives you more browsing space. Tabs have a rounder appearance now, and you can click one to reveal its page’s full address. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TdaBeU"&gt;The new feature that I think is quite useful is tab groups. The way this works is that if you have, say, five tabs open, you can click a little icon in the top-left corner to make them into a “tab group”. Later on, if you open the sidebar on the left, you’ll see the group listed in the “Tab Groups” section; click on it, and Safari will reopen those five tabs. Also in that sidebar lives a bookmarks list, a reading list, and a list of links that have been shared with you in Messages. You can test-drive the new Safari browser in older versions of macOS without having to update to the Monterey beta by installing the &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/"&gt;Safari Technology Preview&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tab groups are almost instant to click in and out of.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7Key8M"&gt;There are a number of other odds and ends built into macOS Monterey. Shortcuts is available on macOS, Focus allows you to filter notifications based on the task you’re doing, it’s gotten easier to save photos that you receive in Messages, etc. I look forward to digging more into these features for our full review, but the things I’ve highlighted here are the ones I see being the most immediately impactful to daily use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PtT8tL"&gt;The phrase “odds and ends” really sums up my impressions after using macOS Monterey for a few days. macOS Big Sur completely overhauled the Mac experience. That’s not the case here (which is fine — not every update needs to be a revolution). Apple seems to have made some tweaks here and some tweaks there. My reactions have largely been: “Alright, that could be handy.” Which is fair. I’ll take handy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LjiYcv"&gt;Here’s the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523116/apple-ios-ipados-15-watchos-8-macos-monterey-wwdc-2021"&gt;list of devices&lt;/a&gt; that will support macOS Monterey: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="i7zV7I"&gt;iMac (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201634"&gt;late 2015 and later&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DT8GDM"&gt;iMac Pro (2017 and later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TDG4DT"&gt;Mac Pro (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT202888"&gt;late 2013 and later&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cZc8bq"&gt;Mac Mini (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201894"&gt;late 2014 and later&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SkWfhc"&gt;MacBook Pro (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201300"&gt;early 2015 and later&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FavKjr"&gt;MacBook Air (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201862"&gt;early 2015 and later&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SncFxN"&gt;MacBook (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201608"&gt;early 2016 and later&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="0hkh24"&gt;Notably, this doesn’t include a few models that did get Big Sur last year, including the 2013 MacBook Air, the late-2013 MacBook Pro, and the 2014 iMac. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Federal Trade Commission expands antitrust powers in Chair Lina Khan’s first open proceeding</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N8tKEklo9uNmXFyeiIGqLHhi-_g=/127x0:1507x920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69530049/image__11_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Chair Khan, appearing at the hearing via Zoom&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aFe8yj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/07/ftc-holds-open-commission-meeting-today"&gt;In an open meeting on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;, the Federal Trade Commission passed a pair of pivotal measures expanding its power to regulate anti-competitive business practices, setting the stage for a more aggressive enforcement approach from the embattled agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J7cACE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/06/ftc-announces-agenda-july-1-open-commission-meeting"&gt;Announced last week&lt;/a&gt;, Thursday’s proceeding is the first open business meeting of the commission in more than 20 years, as commission proceedings have traditionally been closed to the public. Chair Lina Khan plans to hold public meetings on a monthly basis going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tgVpbH"&gt;The meeting paved the way for an aggressive antitrust approach from the agency, with three separate measures expanding the commission’s power to prosecute anti-competitive business practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9sLpf7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We want to send a signal that today’s FTC is ready to take on the challenge of the modern economy”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6dVHHq"&gt;In the most aggressive effort, the commission voted to rescind a 2015 “Statement of Enforcement Principles” that restricted the FTC Act’s prescriptions on “unfair methods of competition” to explicit violations of existing antitrust law (specifically the Sherman and Clayton Acts). The vote proceeded along party lines, passing 3-2 with Democrats in the majority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BlbQZV"&gt;“In practice, the 2015 statement has doubled down on the agency’s longstanding failure to investigate and pursue unfair methods of competition,” said Khan, introducing the motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YL6prU"&gt;Without that restriction, the FTC will be free to pursue lawsuits against misconduct that might not violate classical antitrust law. The commission is still considering whether to replace the statement with blanket guidelines or an array of more specific rulemaking against particular practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xJNumY"&gt;Rescinding the 2015 order remains controversial among pro-business groups and is likely to face a legal challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o9xYDb"&gt;“A clear majority of the Supreme Court has expressed their intention to revive the non-delegation doctrine, which holds that only Congress may make laws,” said the pro-business think tank TechFreedom &lt;a href="https://techfreedom.org/ftc-to-rescind-competition-policy-statement-streamline-consumer-protection-rulemakings-competition-investigations/"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt; in advance of the vote. “The FTC might well wind up as the first test case for that long-dormant doctrine if it departs from the clear principles developed by the courts under antitrust law.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V3W8Dk"&gt;In another 3-2 vote, the FTC moved to simplify the rulemaking process for “prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices.” Introduced by Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, the changes are broadly procedural, lifting a number of self-imposed bureaucratic restrictions on the commission, allowing it to respond more efficiently to perceived misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rs72V2"&gt;“We want to send a signal that today’s FTC is ready to take on the challenge of the modern economy,” said Slaughter at the hearing. “I hope that with these streamlined procedures, we can tackle cutting-edge issues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UfRokn"&gt;A third 3-2 vote passed a series of resolutions to streamline FTC investigations, including enabling individual commissioners to launch staff investigations into specific industries and conduct. Introducing the measure, Khan said she believed there were a number of industries where such an investigation would be appropriate, “including technology platforms, healthcare, and pharmaceuticals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X5THoN"&gt;Expanding FTC powers has long been a goal of antitrust activists and has been the subject of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338763/facebook-google-antitrust-cicilline-ftc-slaughter-monopoly"&gt;several proposals from Congressional Democrats&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s been met with intense pushback, including from tech companies themselves. An FTC complaint against Facebook was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554476/ftc-facebook-instagram-antitrust-case-whatsapp-federal-court"&gt;dismissed in court earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, and it remains unclear how well Khan’s agenda will fare against judicial challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to install the macOS Monterey public beta</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oICKh8FKrnULXwm4qBHN2qU3CHg=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69530037/Apple_macos_monterey_shortcuts_gallery_06072021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V6zJVU"&gt;Apple has launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22321921"&gt;the public beta for macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt;. This is the next big update coming to Mac computers (the final version is expected later in 2021) and it brings several big changes. In this article, we’re going to walk you through how to get the beta onto your computer, should you want it. Once you install the beta, it will likely receive several updates between now and the final release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G0YsSM"&gt;(Looking for steps to install the iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 public betas? &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22557308/ios-ipados-15-public-beta-apple-install"&gt;We’ve got you covered here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VxGaqm"&gt;What’s new about macOS Monterey?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qrSMDX"&gt;One of the most impressive demos that Apple showed during WWDC 2021 was the new drag-and-drop feature called Universal Control that’ll let you seamlessly move your cursor and files between an iPad and Mac computer, as if they were all hard-wired together. Check out Dieter Bohn’s video below to find out more about that feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BzFd4h"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="The best demo at WWDC 2021|102457" data-volume-uuid="8630beec6" data-volume-id="102457" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-284" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yZtXH3"&gt;Macs will also get &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios"&gt;Shortcuts&lt;/a&gt; and will be able to act as AirPlay targets, so your computer will be able to play content from your iPhone or iPad. There are more changes in the update, and my colleague Mitchell Clark &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22458628/apple-macos-12-monterey-features-updates-wwdc-2021"&gt;covers all of the highlights here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MpJ1SU"&gt;Here’s some more coverage:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IYh6eGH4UP7Q5H8ddZjpFtunO8I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22693426/macos_monterey_features.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="agPCNn"&gt;How to install the macOS Monterey beta on your main partition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="21T5f4"&gt;First off, &lt;strong&gt;back up your data&lt;/strong&gt; via Time Machine. This will allow you to revert to Big Sur should things not go well with the Monterey beta. If you’re planning to install this beta on your main machine, keep in mind that you may encounter problems (bugs, incompatibility issues, worse-than-usual battery life) that might get in your way — not what you want if you’re on any kind of deadline. Also, make sure that you have around 20GB of free space available on your hard drive before trying to install.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0EmTzc"&gt;There’s a way to avoid some of this possible drama. If you’re using a machine with macOS High Sierra or later, you can &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208891"&gt;use built-in tools to partition your hard drive&lt;/a&gt; so the beta can live in isolation. This way, you can test out the new features, then boot into your stable macOS partition with the rest of your data when you’re done. We’ll walk through that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cnjek8"&gt;Let’s get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="tusDFy"&gt;Head to &lt;a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/"&gt;Apple’s beta software portal&lt;/a&gt; via Safari.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="k1OEft"&gt;If you haven’t previously installed a public beta, you’ll need to sign up for access with your Apple ID. Otherwise, click “Enroll Your Devices” at the top-right corner of the webpage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xOFsNr"&gt;Click “macOS,” the middle option at the center of the next page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NcQIKX"&gt;Scroll down until you find a button that says “Download the macOS Public Beta Access Utility.” Click on it to download a .DMG file, which will enroll your computer. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AQuRZs"&gt;Upon booting the installer, you’ll be prompted if it doesn’t detect a Time Machine backup. (You did make a backup, right? Like I suggested above?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jIcbwa"&gt;Lastly, head to “Software Update” from the System Preferences app (if it doesn’t open automatically) to install the beta. If you’ve enrolled in the beta program, you should see the message “This Mac is enrolled in the Apple Beta Software Program” located underneath the big “Software Update” icon. Note: the download might not be available to you immediately. You’ll receive a notification once it is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5L1JEw"&gt;The update file will take a while to download. Once it’s done, hit install and run through the steps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ksY059"&gt;How to create a separate partition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="k9dw4y"&gt;Open Disk Utility (a built-in app you can find by typing its name into the Spotlight search bar). Your hard drive’s partitions will be listed under “Internal” along the left side of the window. You might only see one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="If your machine is using APFS, click the plus sign at top to create a new partition." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lj2ov76oEhHDPo6067qC8ptp7Cg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22693724/Screen_Shot_2021_07_01_at_12.22.36_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If your machine is using APFS, click the plus sign at top to create a new partition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="qoWZtE"&gt;If you’re using a machine with macOS High Sierra or newer, clicking your main partition should reveal that it’s a “&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208891"&gt;APFS Volume&lt;/a&gt;.” If so, you can then simply click the plus button above the word “Volume” at the top-left corner of the Disk Utility window to make a new volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="751ZpM"&gt;You can name the volume anything you want, then hit “Add.” Since storage formatted to APFS is shared across volumes, there’s no need to worry about how much space to set aside in the new volume when you create it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aljRC4"&gt;(Note: If your machine’s drive is formatted to Mac OS Extended instead of APFS, you can select the “Partition” button near the top of the Disk Utility window instead. You’ll need to name the partition, then decide how much storage you’d like to have on that slice of hard drive. Given that previous public betas have been over 10GB in size, I’d suggest at least 30GB to be safe.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6sYvFc"&gt;Now that you have another volume (or partition), you can choose to install the beta to that instead of your main drive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IDctbM"&gt;To switch between volumes or partitions, you’ll need to restart the machine and hold down the Option key during startup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="LozlSM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WbKXb1"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>Ghost of Tsushima is getting an enhanced director’s cut on the PS4 and PS5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_l-NArfs588lxVoks9T5B40PiR8=/0x0:1350x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69529908/51282495139_763df069a8_h.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8hDhb4"&gt;Sony and Sucker Punch’s hit game &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima&lt;/em&gt; is getting an enhanced director’s cut edition for both the PS4 and PS5 that will include a new island to explore and all of the content that has been released so far for the original game. The upgraded game will be available on August 20th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M89Zgl"&gt;The new content takes place on the island of Iki, and Sucker Punch says there will be new story content, characters, environments, armor, enemies, and more. “There are even new animals to pet!” &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/07/01/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-arrives-on-ps5-and-ps4-consoles-on-august-20/"&gt;Sucker Punch’s Andrew Goldfarb said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NJyfK3NNBaHiEKqrMDCFoRidnh8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22693702/51281763051_48114bdd53_h.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;An image of Iki Island in &lt;/em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima’s&lt;em&gt; expansion.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NsxI21"&gt;Alongside the additional content, &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt; will also have some PS5-exclusive features, such as using the haptic feedback and adaptive triggers on the DualSense controller. In addition, the PS5 version of the game will feature lip-synced voices for the Japanese voiceover option, addressing a major criticism from the original release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HXM4EZ"&gt;“There will also be enhancements to 3D audio on PS5, as well as drastically improved load times, 4K resolution options and framerates targeting 60 FPS” for the PS5 version of the game, Goldfarb said. It’s unclear how these updates may improve upon the PS5 optimization patch Sucker Punch &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SuckerPunchProd/status/1314641549406265346"&gt;released last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VH9Wzx"&gt;If you already own &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima,&lt;/em&gt; a patch will be available with “some” of the new updates when the director’s cut is available, according to Goldfarb. Current owners will also be able to bring their save over to the PS5 version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pJdeNA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt; will launch on its own for $69.99 on the PS5 and $59.99 on the PS4. But if you have the PS4 version of the original game, the path to upgrading to the director’s cut is a little complex. Here’s how Sony lays it out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="hTjFjX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you already own Ghost of Tsushima on PS4:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NvyExW"&gt;You can pre-order an upgrade to &lt;em&gt;Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt; on PS4 for $19.99 USD. This upgrade will become available starting on August 20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0a3639"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Starting on August 20:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8EPN0i"&gt;If you bought &lt;em&gt;Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt; PS4, you’ll be able to upgrade to &lt;em&gt;Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt; PS5 at any time for $9.99 USD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xk7Yhl"&gt;You can also upgrade directly (from original &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima&lt;/em&gt; PS4) to &lt;em&gt;Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt; on PS5 for $29.99 USD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="UtLRu9"&gt;This all means that for people who want to upgrade to the PS5 version, it’s going to cost $30 whether you take the option to pay $20 now and $10 on August 20th or you choose to just pay $30 at launch. &lt;/p&gt;
