    <title>Netflix just fired the organizer of the trans employee walkout</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jj54EgP9dAwP8AGQkM1a1fcVMmg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70000779/acastro_181101_1777_netflix_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5lfxHM"&gt;Netflix has fired a leader of the trans employee resource group who was organizing the upcoming October 20th walkout. The employee, who is Black and currently pregnant, asked not to be named for fear of online harassment. They have been encouraging trans employees and allies to walk out of work in protest of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22720724/netflix-suspends-trans-employee-tweeted-dave-chappelle-the-closer"&gt;Netflix’s handling of the Dave Chappelle special &lt;em&gt;The Closer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The employee declined to speak to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; for this story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B41xJf"&gt;“All these white people are going around talking to the press and speaking publicly on Twitter and the only person who gets fired is the Black person who was quiet the entire time,” says a former employee in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “That’s absurd, and just further shows that Black trans people are the ones being targeted in this conversation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZgBrDn"&gt;The employee was terminated on suspicion of leaking metrics to the press related to the Dave Chappelle special. Those metrics — about how much Netflix paid for &lt;em&gt;The Closer &lt;/em&gt;and how many people it reached — &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-13/netflix-staff-raised-concerns-about-dave-chappelle-special-before-release?srnd=equality&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;subsequently ended up in a report on &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. While the employee had shared the metrics internally, they spoke out against the leaks to colleagues, worried they might hurt the walkout movement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SzbWk7"&gt;The leaking of internal data is highly unusual at Netflix. While the company prides itself on transparency, employees are told that the culture can only thrive when Netflix data remains internal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yvHqbQ"&gt;A Netflix spokesperson confirmed the employees’ dismissal. “We have let go of an employee for sharing confidential, commercially sensitive information outside the company,” they said. “We understand this employee may have been motivated by disappointment and hurt with Netflix, but maintaining a culture of trust and transparency is core to our company.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xZv8uc"&gt;Controversy surrounding &lt;em&gt;The Closer&lt;/em&gt;, which was widely criticized by trans activists for being transphobic, has roiled Netflix in recent weeks. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22720724/netflix-suspends-trans-employee-tweeted-dave-chappelle-the-closer"&gt;The company suspended Terra Field&lt;/a&gt;, a trans software engineer who posted a viral tweet thread about the controversy, for attending a director-level meeting to which she wasn’t invited. Field has since been reinstated. The company is now sending employees details about what meetings they’re allowed to attend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6lhxtB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Valve bans blockchain games and NFTs on Steam</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eQwrFGXtUrMP0sAp8zX80GVAeBc=/0x0:1820x1213/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70000611/acastro_180509_1777_steam_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IVcxLA"&gt;Games that use blockchain technology or let users exchange NFTs or cryptocurrencies won’t be allowed on Steam, according to a rule added to &lt;a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding"&gt;Valve’s “What you shouldn’t publish on Steam” list&lt;/a&gt;. The change &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpacePirate_io/status/1448713803680473089"&gt;was pointed out by SpacePirate&lt;/a&gt;, a developer working on an NFT-based game, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpacePirate_io/status/1448713807312801796?s=20"&gt;who said&lt;/a&gt; that the change was because the company doesn’t allow game items that could have real-world value. But Steam could also be avoiding controversy with the move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zkI3KB"&gt;Looking at &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210826165938/https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding"&gt;a Wayback Machine capture of the rule page from late August&lt;/a&gt;, there are only 12 rules and no mention of cryptocurrencies or NFTs. The new rule is also missing from other documents — it currently doesn’t show up on the &lt;a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/steamdirect/"&gt;Joining the Steamworks Distribution Program page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RMxaqo"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Steam's point of view is that items have value and they don't allow items that can have real-world value on their platform. While I respect their choice, I fundamentally believe that NFTs and blockchain games are the future. It's why I started this journey with all of you.&lt;br&gt;3/4&lt;/p&gt;— Age of Rust (@SpacePirate_io) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpacePirate_io/status/1448713807312801796?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6AOvwC"&gt;Steam has a history of making controversial moderation decisions, especially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/1/17417790/steam-pornography-rules-guidelines-porn-visual-novels"&gt;when it comes to games with sexual content&lt;/a&gt;. In this case, though, it doesn’t seem like people are pressing F to pay respects to NFT games — a majority of the replies and quote tweets to SpacePirate’s tweets are praising Valve for the move (or mocking those that are upset about it). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="52ry6n"&gt;Valve didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. We also didn’t immediately receive a response when we reached out to one of its competitors, Epic Games, to see if it had any rules around NFT / crypto games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="m9r447"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U2XNch"&gt;It’s perhaps understandable why Steam would want to avoid having NFTs on its platform. Besides the justification cited by SpacePirate that they could have real-world value (which seems a bit weak, given the massive commercial communities around things like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/14/12186584/valve-gambling-statement-counter-strike"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CS:GO&lt;/em&gt; skins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Team Fortress 2&lt;/em&gt; hats), NFT and crypto-based games don’t have the best reputations. There’s the infamous Evolved Apes saga where a developer sold NFTs with the promise that they’d be included in a fighting game but then &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3dyem/investors-spent-millions-on-evolved-apes-nfts-then-they-got-scammed"&gt;seemingly took the money and ran&lt;/a&gt;. There are some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632765/vine-creator-dom-hofmann-blockchain-video-game-nft-supdrive"&gt;potentially interesting game concepts that use NFTs&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s hard to say how many of them would’ve been a good fit for Steam even if they were allowed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l2VLSl"&gt;While Steam is one of the most well-known PC game stores, it’s not the only one. Developers may not have much more luck with some of its bigger competitors, though — Epic’s CEO Tim Sweeney has said that the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696978/epic-tim-sweeney-nft-scam-concerns-web-3"&gt;isn’t interested in touching NFTs&lt;/a&gt;, though it’s unclear whether that just applies to the games Epic makes or its store as well. I reached out to Sweeney to ask but didn’t immediately receive a reply. It’s likely, though, that any platform or store that moderates content will have to make a decision about whether it wants to allow apps or games to sell NFTs — one of the biggest question marks right now &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reckless/status/1448054684128878592"&gt;may be Apple&lt;/a&gt; and how it handles apps like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684372/opensea-app-nft-ios-android-apple-google"&gt;OpenSea&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723131/coinbase-nfts-crypto-marketplace"&gt;Coinbase&lt;/a&gt; should they decide to start letting users buy the digital tokens.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple removed a popular Quran app in China</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fr6SfD1_9WZ82v4l6sH0JHOyxoI=/180x0:2574x1596/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70000499/Screen_Shot_2021_10_15_at_10.07.21_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Pakistan Data Management Services&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N1lmKj"&gt;Apple has removed &lt;a href="https://quranmajeed.app/"&gt;Quran Majeed&lt;/a&gt;, a popular app for reading and listening to the Quran, from the App Store in China, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58921230"&gt;the BBC reports&lt;/a&gt;. The company reportedly removed the app at the request of government officials, a somewhat surprising move given Islam is a protected religion in the People’s Republic of China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pVvcIw"&gt;Quran Majeed is available for free and “recognized by 25 million Muslim users around the world” &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id365557665"&gt;according to the app’s developer&lt;/a&gt; Pakistan Data Management Services. The app’s removal apparently had nothing to do with its religious content, “according to Apple, our app Quran Majeed has been removed from the China App Store because it includes content that is illegal,” the developer told the BBC. The developer says it’s now attempting to resolve the issue with China’s Cyberspace Administration. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reached out to both Apple and China’s US Embassy for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="cGVML3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How China complicates Apple’s chest-thumping about privacy ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/25/18020508/how-china-complicates-apples-chest-thumping-about-privacy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="TcFlQv"&gt;Without clearer explanation, the move seems like a possible overreach, though it does fall within &lt;a href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/470004039/files/doc_downloads/gov_docs/Apple-Human-Rights-Policy.pdf"&gt;Apple’s official stance on human rights abroad (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="HC0Pmo"&gt;We’re required to comply with local laws, and at times there are complex issues about which we may disagree with governments and other stakeholders on the right path forward. With dialogue, and a belief in the power of engagement, we try to find the solution that best serves our users—their privacy, their ability to express themselves, and their access to reliable information and helpful technology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="k2v4Kb"&gt;While it’s logical for business, that framing has placed the company in questionable positions before. Apple has &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/29/technology/china-apple-censorhip.html"&gt;removed VPN apps&lt;/a&gt; that allowed Chinese users to avoid censorship and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/17/technology/apple-china-privacy-censorship.html"&gt;proactively filtered out apps&lt;/a&gt; that mentioned Tiananmen Square, the Dalai Lama, or Taiwanese and Tibetan independence. Apple’s suppliers in the region &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428899/apple-suppliers-china-uyghur-forced-labor-report"&gt;have also been connected&lt;/a&gt; to the oppression of China’s predominantly Muslim Uyghur minority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h5wah6"&gt;Apple is in a difficult situation either way. It relies on the business relationships and sales it makes in China. Taking a strong stance against the government could put that in jeopardy. Just this week, Microsoft made the decision &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/14/22726189/microsoft-linkedin-china-censorship-shut-down"&gt;to shut down the local Chinese version of LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, acknowledging separately that it is becoming increasingly difficult to comply with the Chinese government’s demands. Apple hasn’t yet found that line for itself, and with how much it relies on China to make its iPhone business work, it might not happen anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm is salty about Pixel’s switch to Tensor but really shouldn’t be</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro lineup" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jtps-yBH1njQApS6SOZjpkkEdCY=/448x0:7198x4500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70000489/Google_Pixel_6__Portfolio_Shot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zbRw0I"&gt;The Google Pixel 6 phones will ditch Snapdragon chips for an in-house design, and Qualcomm is clearly feeling a little hurt about it. Qualcomm couldn’t help but throw some shade at Google — in the form of a red flag meme on Twitter (via &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/15/qualcomm-google-tensor-snapdragon/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). In August, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609924/pixel-6-google-tensor-soc-chip-cpu-gpu-samsung-apple"&gt;Google revealed its Tensor chip&lt;/a&gt;, which will make a proper debut at the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22691850/google-pixel-6-event-2021-fall-announcement"&gt;Pixel 6 event on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. This marks the end of an era where Pixel phones — and most of Google’s earlier Nexus line — relied on Snapdragon SoCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W8j0N8"&gt;The red flag meme started as a way to identify silly “warning signs” when dating but has since evolved to the point where it can apply to almost anything. Qualcomm came up with this questionable take on the meme, implying that Google’s choice to swap out the Snapdragon for the Tensor was a poor decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rxINZh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;"We've decided to make our own smartphone SoC instead of using Snapdragon"                      &lt;/p&gt;— Snapdragon (@Snapdragon) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Snapdragon/status/1448317606365179906?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ItrR5a"&gt;But the reality is that most Pixel users see the Tensor as something bringing exciting improvements to the device. When we got a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;sneak peek at the Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt;, Google showed off the benefits of a chip designed to make AI and machine learning processes more efficient. During the demo, we saw how the Pixel 6 could correct blurry photos, shoot better videos, and accurately transcribe speech to text — all features Google credits to the new Tensor chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0IadzQ"&gt;Twitter users posted scathing replies to Qualcomm’s tweet, pointing out that, thanks to the Tensor, Pixel users will also no longer have to deal with the limited support period for Qualcomm chipsets. A recent leak suggests the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/9/22718007/google-pixel-6-leak-teases-magic-eraser-camera-five-years-android-security-updates"&gt;Pixel 6 series will receive five years of Android security updates&lt;/a&gt;, which should help extend the life of the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ptxzj5"&gt;Couple that with the fact that, as &lt;em&gt;9to5Google &lt;/em&gt;points out, Google is one of Qualcomm’s smaller customers, and Qualcomm’s tweet becomes laughable. Qualcomm still provides chips for some of the biggest smartphone manufacturers, including Samsung, which &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/266220/global-smartphone-market-share-by-vendor-in-2007-and-2008/"&gt;sold 17 percent of all smartphones globally&lt;/a&gt; in the second quarter of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla rolls out Safety Score-based insurance product in Texas</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tesla Model S redesign" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n0zzBFMFcccqSxS0AICt3YFQ9Lg=/90x0:2790x1800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70000355/MS_Performance_Hero_Desktop.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Tesla&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cYOj3h"&gt;Tesla is now selling insurance to customers in Texas, two years after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/28/20837265/tesla-car-insurance-california-autopilot-discount"&gt;first launching the offering&lt;/a&gt; in its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22715458/tesla-move-headquarters-to-austin-texas"&gt;now-former home state&lt;/a&gt; of California. But the version in Texas is different. The company says it will evaluate driving behavior in real-time using the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/26/22693610/tesla-opens-full-self-driving-beta-software-more-customers"&gt;“Safety Score” feature&lt;/a&gt; that it recently launched to screen drivers who want to join the beta test of the company’s “Full Self-Driving” beta software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5hsZIn"&gt;That means drivers might wind up paying less — or more — per month based on how many forward collision warnings they rack up, how hard they brake, how “aggressively” they turn, how much distance they leave to the car in front, and whether they keep their hands on the wheel when using Autopilot. Tesla used some driving behavior metrics to develop premiums in California, but they were not real-time and relied more on &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/03/22/tesla-tsla-launch-in-house-insurance-program-more-states/"&gt;statistical evaluations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kkBhO6"&gt;The offering in Texas represents a big break from how other insurance companies arrive at their quoted premiums. Even ones that rely on data from telematics dongles plugged into a car still consider other factors like age. Tesla is, unsurprisingly, promoting those differences (via &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="oCYRxZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unlike other telematics or usage-based insurance products, Tesla does not require an additional device to be installed in your vehicle. Tesla uses specific features within the vehicle to evaluate your premium based on your actual driving. You will make monthly payments based on your driving behavior instead of traditional factors like credit, age, gender, claim history and driving records used by other insurance providers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OGpjH5"&gt;The company claims owners could pay premiums that are anywhere between 20 percent and 60 percent cheaper than the competition if they opt to use Tesla’s insurance. While other insurance providers relentlessly promote that they offer lower rates to safer drivers, the new version of Tesla’s insurance product could offer the most tangible version of that promise, as long as it works as advertised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1agon9"&gt;Tesla has been working to expand its insurance offering to other states, but CEO Elon Musk announced at the company’s recent shareholder meeting that Texas would be the first to follow California. Musk also announced at that meeting that he was relocating Tesla’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22715458/tesla-move-headquarters-to-austin-texas"&gt;headquarters to Austin, Texas&lt;/a&gt;, where the company has spent the last year building its next US automotive factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rsDzB6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>China launches latest crew of three en route to nation’s Tianhe space station</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hVjZKx"&gt;China successfully launched a new crew of three taikonauts into orbit this afternoon, sending them en route to the country’s primary space station, dubbed Tianhe. The crew will &lt;a href="https://www.space.com/china-shenzhou-13-astronaut-launch-webcast"&gt;meet up with the station in roughly eight hours&lt;/a&gt;, sparking a six-month stay in orbit. It’s set to be the longest mission taikonauts have ever taken in space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="firstHeading"&gt;The three taikonauts include commander Zhai Zhigang, Wang Yaping, and Ye Guangfu, part of China’s Shenzhou 13 mission. Zhai has been to space before and even performed the first spacewalk for China back in 2008 during the Shenzhou 7 mission. This will be Wang’s second spaceflight, and she will become the first woman to visit the Tianhe station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TOreLt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Wang will become the first woman to visit the Tianhe station&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NDniLS"&gt;While onboard the space station, the crew will test out technologies needed to continue construction and assembly on Tianhe. China launched the core module for Tianhe back in April, and the country plans to add two more modules to it throughout 2022. The Shenzhou 13 crew will also test out the station’s robotic arm, using it to move a spacecraft attached on one docking port to another, &lt;a href="https://news.cgtn.com/news/2021-10-14/Shenzhou-13-China-to-send-another-3-astronauts-to-space-on-Saturday-14lRSJXnj5C/index.html"&gt;according to CGTN&lt;/a&gt;. A couple of spacewalks are also planned to add a “robotic arm adaptor and suspension system” to help with future space station construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xgJoja"&gt;This is China’s second crew to live on Tianhe long-term. The last crew of three &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22537815/china-rocket-launch-astronauts-crew"&gt;launched in June&lt;/a&gt; and lived on the station for three months before returning in September. Shenzhou 13 is part of 11 planned launches to fully construct the Tianhe space station by next year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tether will pay $41 million over ‘misleading’ claims it was fully backed by US dollars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cryptocurrency Illustrations As Musk Roils Crypto Market" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jmksx5P5lWpchuky6NlbHQyTOdQ=/0x2:4000x2669/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70000133/1233100485.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Tether will be fined $41 million | Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n04D5w"&gt;Tether will pay $41 million to settle allegations by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) that it made untrue or misleading statements when it claimed its stablecoins were fully backed by fiat currencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IIisGB"&gt;The CFTC said in a &lt;a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8450-21"&gt;statement Friday&lt;/a&gt; that between June 2016 and February 2019, Tether misrepresented to customers and the cryptocurrencies markets that it had “sufficient US dollar reserves” to back every token when, in fact, its reserves were not fully backed the majority of the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8IQAJY"&gt;In addition, the CFTC said, Tether failed to disclose that it included unsecured receivables and non-fiat assets as part of its reserves, falsely telling investors it would conduct routine audits to show it maintained 100 percent of reserves at all times, even though its reserves were not audited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TaWZV8"&gt;“This case highlights the expectation of honesty and transparency in the rapidly growing and developing digital assets marketplace,” acting CFTC chairman Rostin Behnam said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SzkQuR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2021/attorney-general-james-ends-virtual-currency-trading-platform-bitfinexs-illegal"&gt;Tether was investigated&lt;/a&gt; by the New York attorney general for claims about its backing, setting with the agency in February. Under the terms of that settlement, Tether is prohibited from doing business in New York state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l1TuOd"&gt;Tether said in a &lt;a href="https://tether.to/statement-on-tethers-settlement-with-the-cftc/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Friday that the CFTC order “found no issues relating to Tether’s current operations,” adding that issues in the agency’s order were resolved when Tether updated its terms of service in February 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PvjPro"&gt;“As to the Tether reserves, there is no finding that tether tokens were not fully backed at all times — simply that the reserves were not all in cash and all in a bank account titled in Tether’s name, at all times,” Tether’s statement continues. “As Tether represented in the Order, it has always maintained adequate reserves and has never failed to satisfy a redemption request.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZ95HD"&gt;The inquiry by the CFTC “arose during a markedly different time in our ecosystem,” according to Tether, and dealt with challenges it says were common in the digital currency industry at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0FdVJ4"&gt;Tether is a digital currency known as a stablecoin, typically backed by a fiat currency like the US dollar or the Euro. They’re used mainly as payment vehicles and viewed as more stable (hence the name) than other digital currencies because they’re backed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PsOmDo"&gt;CFTC commissioner Dawn D. Stump said in a &lt;a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/stumpstatement101521"&gt;concurring statement&lt;/a&gt; that she agreed with the terms of the settlement, as “there were misrepresentations regarding the assets backing Tether, specifically that the USDt tokens were backed 1-to-1 by US dollars.  The evidence establishes that this assurance provided to tether customers was not 100% true, 100% of the time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jdsdzu"&gt;But Stump added she was concerned that the settlement might cause confusion among investors, noting that the CFTC “does not regulate stablecoins, and we do not have daily insight into the businesses” involved with stablecoins. Stump questioned whether “the actions of the CFTC in entering into this settlement with the Tether respondents create a false sense of security for those investing in stablecoins?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ymDY3f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Tether controversy, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22620464/tether-backing-cryptocurrency-stablecoin"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="r0oK2X"&gt;The CFTC also announced Friday that Bitfinex, a cryptocurrency exchange affiliated with Tether, has been fined $1.5 million for “illegal, off-exchange retail commodity transactions in digital assets” with Americans, in violation of the &lt;a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/7380-16"&gt;terms of a 2016 order&lt;/a&gt; from the CFTC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NIOYjO"&gt;In a statement, Tether said the CFTC’s findings regarding Bitfinex “relate to the timing and implementation of its ban on U.S. customers,” noting the CFTC’s order found no violations after December 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cLZtxe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Batman is getting another Fortnite comic crossover with one of the game’s most mysterious characters</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ioquGQUoXmBSCIuPheRwStXZYjA=/0x102:3030x2122/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69999934/Untitled.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DWjjEo"&gt;Epic and DC Comics are teaming up again for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22303107/batman-fortnite-comic-crossover-epic-games-dc-launch-date"&gt;another crossover&lt;/a&gt; with the one-shot comic &lt;em&gt;Batman/Fortnite: Foundation&lt;/em&gt; #1, which will arrive in comic book stores on Tuesday, October 26th. The physical comic will also include a bonus code for a Batman Who Laughs skin (which will also be available for purchase in the in-game store) and an exclusive loading screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="GezDku"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"With Batman: Zero Point, Fortnite’s lore makes a lot more sense","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/25/22399355/batman-fortnite-zero-point-comic-book"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="XclQG7"&gt;The new comic will pick up after the six-issue &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/25/22399355/batman-fortnite-zero-point-comic-book"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Batman: Zero Point&lt;/em&gt; crossover comics&lt;/a&gt; released earlier this year. But unlike last time, where the Caped Crusader was transported to Fortnite’s uniquely violent island, in the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Batman/Fortnite: Foundation&lt;/em&gt; one-shot, the island — or at least, one of its most mysterious denizens — is coming to face off against Batman in Gotham City:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="aQpNaB"&gt;Returning to Gotham City after the events of &lt;em&gt;Zero Point&lt;/em&gt;, Batman is faced with a new mystery and a new arrival. The Foundation, an enigmatic figure from Fortnite Island, emerges from the depths of Gotham Harbor, and the Dark Knight wants to investigate what he is doing in his city. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="43VRoO"&gt;The new comic also sounds like it’ll tie even deeper into Fortnite’s burgeoning lore, given the emphasis on &lt;a href="https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki/The_Foundation"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, a mysterious character who appeared &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333635/fortnites-season-6-single-player-event-storytelling"&gt;during Fortnite’s season six finale event&lt;/a&gt; and helped Agent Jones contain the energy of the exploding Zero Point (that sentence won’t make any sense unless you’ve been following the increasingly elaborate storyline of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s second season). The character also appeared at the bottom of a river &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lBFoxLvYHs"&gt;in the current season eight story trailer&lt;/a&gt;, hinting at a return soon — which presumably will tie into the upcoming Batman comic in some fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rz52BY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Batman/Fortnite: Foundation #&lt;/em&gt;1 also features a unique list of creatives behind the project: it’s co-written by Epic Games’ chief creative office Donald Mustard, Christos Gage (who wrote the previous Batman/Fornite crossover comics), and Scott Snyder, best known for his elaborate &lt;em&gt;Dark Nights Metal&lt;/em&gt; Batman comics (which introduced the villainous Batman Who Laughs character).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a1CWS0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best budget laptop of 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Cheap Laptop 2021: HP Envy x360 13" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/91Ojp27YU24CRpqeGNGMFxMlSuQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69807794/mchin_200705_4086_0001.0.6.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best cheap laptops for video editing, gaming, and more&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="3v5Ons"&gt;If you’re shopping for the best cheap laptop of 2021, the question to ask is: what’s most important, and what are you willing to sacrifice? Even the best cheap laptops aren’t perfect in every area — they have some strengths but cut corners to achieve their price tags. You can almost certainly find a budget laptop with a touchscreen, a premium-looking chassis, an HDMI port, a backlit keyboard, or stylus support, but you may need to consider which of those features you want the most, and which you can go without.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zqLems"&gt;Our pick for the best cheap laptop of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 13&lt;/a&gt;. We feel that the Envy has build quality, performance, and battery life that surpass those of many premium laptops. But we’ve tested dozens of systems in the sub-$800 range, and we’ve got a number of additional models on this list from Lenovo, Acer, Samsung, HP, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jVG16P"&gt;Our other picks for the best cheap laptop of 2021 include the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451261/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;. Many of these laptops also appear on our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"&gt;best Chromebook&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21369381/best-student-laptops-school-high-college"&gt;best student laptop&lt;/a&gt; lists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sPoJxi"&gt;Many of our picks for the best cheap laptop of 2021 are currently Chromebooks. We believe that Chromebooks are, in many cases, the best-value option for shoppers seeking a laptop under $500 and tend to offer better specs, features, and build quality than most Windows laptops at that price point. We hope to add more Windows laptops under $500 to this page in the future and are keeping a close eye on those releases.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Envy x360 13 is the best cheap laptop of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best cheap laptop of 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="r62WQ4"&gt;HP’s Envy x360 13, &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeBestLaptop101521&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fpdp%2Fhp-envy-x360-laptop-13z-ay000-8lz58av-1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for $689&lt;/a&gt; is the best budget laptop you can buy under $800. With a high-quality and sturdy convertible build, it looks like a device that should cost twice its price. It has plenty of other great features as well, including a really excellent keyboard and a bright, colorful screen. It’s also exceptional on the inside. Thanks to its AMD Ryzen processor, the system delivers all-day battery life and very smooth performance — it can even handle some light gaming. (Intel options are available as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ox216u"&gt;We have some minor complaints about the Envy, of course. The screen is 16:9, which is a cramped aspect ratio for multitasking. Our test unit had a somewhat limited port selection (notably, missing Thunderbolt and HDMI support) and came with some bloatware preinstalled. But none of these are deal-breakers at the Envy’s price point. Overall, budget shoppers will want for very little with this machine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="N7xEV5"&gt;The best laptop under $500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="hyeIry"&gt;If you’re looking for an absurdly cheap Chromebook that absolutely gets the job done, you should definitely be looking at the $260 Lenovo Chromebook Duet. The Duet is a 10-inch aluminum alloy Chrome OS tablet that comes with a kickstand and keyboard cover. It looks sturdy and classy, and it can easily function as either a tablet or a PC. But you’re not compromising &lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;much on performance for this device’s tiny size; as long as you’re not running dozens of tabs and apps, you should be fine. And we got over 11 hours of battery life in our testing, making it one of the longest-lasting Chromebooks we’ve seen in the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHlVCe"&gt;The main thing to know about the Chromebook Duet is that the screen is quite small — just 10.1 inches. That’s a fine size for a young student (especially with the touch capability) and for an adult’s secondary device for note-taking, Netflixing, and the like, but it’s not an ideal size for a primary work device unless you’re fine with quite a bit of squinting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aOmcws"&gt;The best budget laptop with Chrome OS &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="N34v09"&gt;If you’d prefer a more traditional Chromebook with a clamshell form factor, the $329 Acer Chromebook Spin 713 is an affordable option that’s all-around excellent. It has a gorgeous 3:2 display that delivers a sharp picture and bright, vibrant colors with plenty of vertical space. The screen alone would make the Chromebook Spin 713 a standout, but it has a number of other strengths as well, including a great keyboard, all-day battery life, and a comprehensive port selection, including an HDMI, in addition to USB-C, USB-A, and a microSD slot. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3 is the best cheap laptop with a built-in stylus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;h2 id="SSaLnR"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22526743/asus-chromebook-detachable-cm3-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IOuDKK"&gt;The best cheap laptop with a stylus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iQA7Ph"&gt;If you like the Duet’s size and detachable form factor but are willing to spend on something a bit more upscale, you may find the Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3 to be a better choice. Like the Duet, the CM3 is a 10.5-inch 16:10 Chrome OS tablet with a fabric cover, kickstand, and detachable screen. But the CM3’s kickstand folds multiple ways: you can crease it lengthwise to stand the tablet up like a laptop or fold it the short way and stand the tablet up horizontally. Plus, it comes with a built-in USI stylus and roomy keys with a surprising amount of travel. Battery life was also quite impressive: we averaged close to 13 hours of continuous work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oUYikQ"&gt;Where the CM3 lags a bit behind the Duet (and other cheap laptops you may try) is the power. Its MediaTek processor can be a bit sluggish compared to more pricier offerings. But the CM3 still offers a surprising number of perks for its sub-$400 price and makes a great student driver or secondary device. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Pavilion Aero 13 is a 13-inch powerhouse that weighs almost nothing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lYrZ3f"&gt;The best thin-and-light laptop under $1000&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="o8zBHM"&gt;If you’re looking for a budget Windows laptop that’s thinner and lighter than the Envy x360 while delivering similar category-topping performance, the $669 HP Pavilion Aero 13 is a good choice for you. It has a powerful eight-core Ryzen processor, which is one of the fastest processors for thin and light laptops that you can get. Not only does it perform well, but it’s also unbelievably light at just 2.1 pounds, and it comes with a blindingly bright 16:10 screen. It’s a standout in battery life, too — I averaged almost 11 hours of continuous work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOWROI"&gt;HP did have to cut a few corners to achieve those benefits at this price point. The audio on our model wasn’t great, and the device shipped with some cheap bloatware installed. But the Pavilion Aero 13 is excellent in almost every other way, and it won’t disappoint if you’re looking for a functional, cheap Windows PC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Ucqsb1"&gt;An affordable laptop with a bold look&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="pT23AG"&gt;If you’re looking for an affordable Chromebook that stands out from the crowd, the $549 Galaxy Chromebook 2 should be on your list. It comes in a bold “fiesta red” color (as well as a regular gray, if you prefer to blend in). It’s a touchscreen convertible with stylus support (though the stylus isn’t included). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QIDME"&gt;On top of the design, the Galaxy Chromebook 2 includes an excellent QLED panel, which is one of the best displays we’ve ever seen on a Chromebook. You also get a solid keyboard, decent battery life (we averaged 7 hours and 21 minutes of continuous work), and a port selection that includes two USB-C ports, a microSD slot, and a headphone jack. It’s easily one of the best Chromebooks you can buy and one of the best cheap laptops as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="w7TWDY"&gt;The best cheap laptop for Surface fans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="9t4Ji3"&gt;The $399 Surface Go 2 is a 10.5-inch tablet that’s about the size of a regular iPad. You’ll have to buy the keyboard cover separately, but the overall package is still quite affordable if you’re buying a lower-priced model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0hPLGr"&gt;You can configure the Surface Go 2 with a Pentium Gold or Core m3 processor. Those aren’t the fanciest or most powerful processors, but the system should still be adequate for your streaming and browsing needs, especially if you only need it to do one task at a time. It can run any Windows app, it’s easy to carry around, and it makes a solid secondary computer. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Acer Swift 3 is one of the best college laptops you can buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nxYz9i"&gt;The best budget laptop for students&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="DeUYiZ"&gt;Many of the best cheap laptops might be good choices for high school and college students, but the Acer Swift 3’s exceptionally durable build makes it an excellent choice for backpack-battering and dining hall spills. Its 14-inch screen also gives you more room for homework multitasking than some of the 13-inch machines here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVxnSd"&gt;But the highlight of the Swift 3 is its Ryzen 4000 processors. We tested a model with a Ryzen 7 4700U, which did an excellent job handling our daily multitasking workload, and delivered seven-hour battery life as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YWSkuR"&gt;On the outside, the Swift 3 isn’t the thinnest or most beautiful laptop you can buy, but it’s a solid performer in most areas. It has all kinds of ports, including USB-C, USB-A, and an HDMI. The backlit keyboard has a nice click to it and has a reliable integrated fingerprint reader as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="TA1Mem"&gt;A cheap laptop with standout build&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HqEdaD"&gt;The Yoga C740 is as straightforward as a laptop can get. It has a sturdy aluminum build and perfectly fine 10th Gen Intel processors. We were pleasantly surprised by the device’s audio — the upward-firing speakers on the sides of the keyboard deliver a nice surround-sound experience. The keyboard and touchpad are both quite comfortable to use. There’s not much to complain about and not much to enthusiastically praise — if you’re looking for a sub-$800 Windows laptop with a well-made aluminum chassis and a sturdy frame, you’re looking for the Yoga. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGHm6c"&gt;The C740 is a year old now, but that means you can get it at very affordable prices. We’re looking forward to reviewing its successor, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/18/21373719/lenovo-yoga-7i-6-convertible-laptops-intel-amd-processors-windows"&gt;Yoga 7i&lt;/a&gt;, shortly in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple just fired a leader of the #AppleToo movement</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MsR1rRZa5V1NA66eGMooeWmxaQA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69999823/acastro_210429_1777_epicApple_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wmn5zY"&gt;Apple has fired Janneke Parrish, a leader of the #AppleToo movement, amid a broad crackdown on leaks and worker organizing. Parrish, a program manager on Apple Maps, was terminated for deleting files off of her work devices during an internal investigation — an action Apple categorized as “non-compliance,” according to people familiar with the situation. The files included apps like Robinhood, Pokémon GO, and Google Drive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ZWZrT"&gt;Internally, some employees expressed disbelief that Parrish’s firing could be anything other than retaliation for organizing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7DJxKT"&gt;It’s the second time in recent months that an employee has been terminated after speaking out about Apple’s company culture. In September, the tech giant &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22666049/apple-fires-senior-engineering-program-manager-ashley-gjovik-for-allegedly-leaking-information"&gt;fired Ashley Gjøvik &lt;/a&gt;for allegedly leaking confidential information. Gjøvik has filed multiple charges with the NLRB related to how Apple treated her and the broader workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KoDODk"&gt;Gjøvik’s latest charge alleges that &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-12/apple-ceo-s-anti-leak-edict-broke-the-law-ex-employee-alleges?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;Tim Cook’s anti-leaking memo might violate US labor law&lt;/a&gt;. In September, the CEO sent a note to all Apple employees saying that “people who leak confidential information do not belong” at Apple. He also said the company was doing “everything in our power to identify those who leaked.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="66nB9c"&gt;The comments were related to an all-hands meeting on September 17th, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22687747/tim-cook-employee-leak-memos-do-not-belong-at-apple"&gt;which leaked to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qg3J4K"&gt;Apple’s recent actions seem designed to chill worker organizing. In August, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638150/apple-appletoo-employee-harassment-discord"&gt;employees launched the #AppleToo website&lt;/a&gt; to allow workers across the company — including AppleCare and retail — to submit stories about workplace harassment and discrimination. Parrish and Cher Scarlett, an Apple software engineer, then began &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@UrsulaRa"&gt;sharing these stories on Medium&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g7nECa"&gt;Parrish declined to comment for this story. Her attorney, Vincent P. White of White, Hilferty and Albanese, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge:&lt;/em&gt; “We can confirm she is no longer with Apple but cannot speak further to address the situation at this time.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YacI3p"&gt;Scarlett is &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/14/apple-worker-cher-scarlett/"&gt;currently on paid medical leave&lt;/a&gt; due to internal harassment she’s received while advocating for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22491629/apple-employees-push-back-return-office-internal-letter-tim-cook"&gt;remote work&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22609687/apple-pay-equity-employee-surveys-protected-activity"&gt;pay transparency&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O6l1JD"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
