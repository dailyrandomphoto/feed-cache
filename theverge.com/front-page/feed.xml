    <title>Samsung made a dedicated smart home dashboard, and we want one</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Sbmkzd"&gt;Samsung introduced its first standalone SmartThings smart home controller at its CES 2022 keynote this week. The Samsung Home Hub is designed to be a central place for a household to control and monitor their smart home without having to buy a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/28/22856937/samsung-family-hub-smart-fridge-bespoke-ces-2022"&gt;$4,000 smart fridge&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SN0ZZg"&gt;The portable, 8.4-inch touchscreen tablet has Samsung’s Bixby voice assistant built-in and will use AI to anticipate what you might need (we’ll see how that pans out). The Home Hub sits vertically in a charging dock and has two microphones and two speakers for hearing notifications and giving voice commands. Based on the images the company has shared so far, it appears to run Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ddsf9F"&gt;Samsung says at launch, the Home Hub will “be able to connect to every product within the SmartThings ecosystem,” with integrations for other devices, such as lights and door locks coming soon. There was no specific mention of this being a SmartThings software hub itself (Samsung has said it is integrating SmartThings hub software into many of its smart appliances), but it’s hard to imagine it won’t be. There’s no pricing available or a US release date, but it is scheduled to launch in Korea in March and globally after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GJ9HyD"&gt;There are still a lot of things we want to know about this: Will Bixby be the only voice assistant option? Is the AI thing going to be super annoying? But, at first glance, this looks a lot like the smart home controller we wish Apple, Amazon, or Google would make. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KWu9SHX6LIC2YPjyCbQyqBuWIPM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23148270/Samsung_Home_Hub_cooking.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Home Hub features Samsung SmartThings Cooking service, which is powered by Whisk, an AI-powered recipe platform. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BqpR5b"&gt;The transition from smartphone control of the smart home to voice control has not been a seamless one. There are many times when it’s easier to tap on a screen to turn on the lights or lock the back door than it is to raise your voice, and a simple, easily accessible interface to do this is something the smart home still needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="y4ftuv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If we’re going to drag members of our households into the smart home, it’s got to be easier for them to control it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CzgDIw"&gt;Smart displays from Google and Amazon have largely failed to provide a usable dashboard for this type of control, instead requiring multiple swipes and taps to get to what you need. These displays also try to be multitaskers in the home, part calendar, part radio, part TV, part smart home device, partly failing to do well most of what they attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FVtKPp"&gt;Case in point, Amazon’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22839220/amazon-echo-show-15-review-wall-mounted-alexa-tablet-kitchen-tv"&gt;Echo Show 15&lt;/a&gt;, which I thought would be the solution I’d been looking for to control my smart home; since I took down the aging iPad Mini I had installed in my wall. (Its screen finally gave up the ghost — turns out being permanently plugged in and sitting vertically on my wall for four years was not good for it.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Fv9VmS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon Echo Show 15 review: Alexa’s on your wall","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22839220/amazon-echo-show-15-review-wall-mounted-alexa-tablet-kitchen-tv"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="iiybzk"&gt;Sadly, the software on the Show 15 doesn’t live up to the promise of the hardware, and while it looks fantastic, its limited smart home controller interface means it just won’t work for my home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1K1tn"&gt;What I, and many like me, want is a dedicated smart home dashboard, something that has shortcuts to control devices, trigger scenes, and view live camera feeds. That’s not to say there isn’t room for Echo Shows and Google Nest Hubs that do part of what they’re supposed to do really well. But a dedicated smart home interface mounted on a wall or set up on a counter is what is needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="INsKYD"&gt;There have been a few attempts at solving this problem — the &lt;a href="https://www.brilliant.tech/home"&gt;touchscreen Brilliant Control Panel&lt;/a&gt; that replaces your existing light switches is an innovative solution that takes advantage of a house’s existing wiring. But installing that system in every room will set you back a pretty penny, and the screen is much smaller than a tablet, making it less intuitive for all users.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XTNxLts8ZSJtwi8Oh8e9PjnyrMQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23145171/2021_0611_Samsung_4D_Flex_Family_Hub_Menus_scaled.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Family Hub refrigerator features a built-in tablet that acts as a smart home controller.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cqcOVG"&gt;What I like about Samsung’s Home Hub so far is its size, its orientation, and its potential portability. A vertical screen is actually more useful for smart home control than a horizontal one, as you can fit more icons on the screen that way and ideally have quick access to more controls. The stand for the Samsung Home Hub looks like it could also hold the screen horizontally if you preferred, although it probably will only charge in the vertical position, and Samsung has said it can be picked up and moved around when required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fqyumo"&gt;The other thing it looks like they’ve done right here is make it a shared device. The problem with shoehorning existing tablets like the iPad into the role of a smart home dashboard is they’re designed as personal devices. A dedicated tablet for the home needs different software and a different approach.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/82DPvQk00b2cqDfDcL8PDB4xQRM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23148278/Samsung_Home_Hub_energy.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Energy monitoring of compatible appliances and services is part of Samsung SmartThings and can be monitored on the Home Hub.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="M27yiA"&gt;I’ve used the Samsung Family Hub smart fridge, and the Home Hub interface looks similar. Both largely resemble a blown-up version of Samsung’s SmartThings smartphone app. There’s a Favorites home screen with your favorite devices on it, a Devices tab for all your gadgets, and a Life tab where you’ll find Samsung’s connected services — such as Cooking, Clothing Care, Energy, Pet, Air and Home Care Wizard. That last one monitors your Samsung smart appliances and tells you when you need a new water filter for your fridge, as well as offers troubleshooting tips when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IiMBt"&gt;It’s not the smart home dashboard of my dreams, but it is a step in the right direction: a dedicated device for controlling the many aspects of your smart home that doesn’t attempt to do unnecessary party tricks but gives you and your household an easy way to turn the home on and off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="bphjZn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Smart displays from Google and Amazon have failed to provide a usable smart home interface&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zhIHQW"&gt;Speaking of Samsung’s connected services, the SmartThings Energy service, which monitors the power usage of all compatible connected devices and recommends ways for you to save energy based on usage patterns, is being expanded to include more products and services. &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-smartthings-expands-smartthings-energy-service-for-eco-friendly-home-solutions/"&gt;Samsung also announced partnerships earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that enable real-time monitoring of whole-home energy consumption in the SmartThings App. This type of integration should allow homeowners to set up automations based on energy costs or demand response events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TtNybN"&gt;During its CES keynote, Samsung also announced that it’s a founding member of the newly minted Home Connectivity Alliance (HCA). Founded in September 2021, the HCA’s main goal is creating “&lt;a href="https://homeconnectivityalliance.org/news-events/"&gt;Cloud to cloud interoperability across brands&lt;/a&gt;,” according to its website. At the keynote, Katherine Shin from Trane Technologies (an HVAC manufacturer that is also a member) said that the HCA is a global coalition of smart home appliance manufacturers focused on full interoperability between products. Interoperability has been a big problem in the home appliance space, as upgrade cycles for large appliances are much slower than for speakers and light bulbs. Members of HCA include GE Appliances, Electrolux, and Haier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0VbFUi"&gt;Samsung is also part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22787729/matter-smart-home-standard-apple-amazon-google"&gt;Matter, a new smart home standard&lt;/a&gt; with similar goals. How this initiative will fit in with Matter is unclear at this stage. Matter is a local protocol, with devices communicating primarily over a local network while still allowing IP access to connect to the internet. This new Alliance appears to be focused on expanding connectivity between cloud-based services. This is something Samsung has been pursuing more aggressively since it started to transition its SmartThings platform from a hardware-based smart home hub to a software-based service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RTHv7x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 5:25PM ET, Wednesday, January 5th, 2021:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added more details about the Home Hub and the HCA based on new information released by Samsung since we first published this article, including that the Home Hub will be released globally, previously the company had only said it would be launching in Korea.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sundance Film Festival goes virtual, Grammys postponed over omicron concerns</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CyXAUr"&gt;Both the Grammy Awards and the Sundance Film Festival have changed their 2022 plans due to a rise in COVID-19 cases across the country (via &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/05/grammy-awards-postponed-indefinitely-due-to-concerns-about-omicron-covid-spread.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2022/01/sundance-2022-cancels-in-person-1234688754/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Indiewire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The Grammy Awards show has been postponed until further notice, and the Sundance Film Festival will go virtual, rather than risk an in-person event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rNxzz5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Grammy Awards was postponed last year because of the pandemic&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AP8GDo"&gt;The 64th Grammy Awards ceremony was scheduled for January 31st, but as noted in a &lt;a href="https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/2022-grammys-complete-winners-nominees-nominations-list"&gt;post on the Grammy Awards website&lt;/a&gt;, CBS and the Recording Academy have decided to push it back “after careful consideration and analysis with city and state officials, health and safety experts.” There isn’t mention of a rescheduled date, but CBS and the Recording Academy say that “will be announced soon.” &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/05/entertainment/grammys-2021/index.html"&gt;The Grammy Awards was postponed&lt;/a&gt; last year because of the pandemic and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/14/22329964/grammy-awards-2021-how-to-watch-online"&gt;was held in March without a live audience&lt;/a&gt;. Viewership for the 2021 Grammys broadcast &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/15/business/media/grammy-awards-ratings.html"&gt;reportedly hit a record low&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43PDAc"&gt;Sundance Institute CEO Joana Vicente and festival director Tabitha Jackson &lt;a href="http://sundancecollab.activehosted.com/index.php?action=social&amp;amp;chash=7a53928fa4dd31e82c6ef826f341daec.1411&amp;amp;nosocial=1"&gt;have announced&lt;/a&gt; modified plans for the Sundance Film Festival, with the Utah-based show airing solely online. It was initially supposed to be a hybrid event, but festival organizers decided to go all virtual, citing the high transmissibility of the omicron variant. The Sundance Film Festival will still begin on January 20th and will consist of 11 days of online programming, with some adjustments to the screening schedule. COVID-19 had an impact on the Sundance Film Festival last year as well — not only was the event held online, but the effects of the pandemic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22262520/sundance-film-festival-2021-pandemic-these-days-pink-cloud"&gt;were artfully weaved into some of the featured films&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dead By Daylight drops Leatherface cosmetics after reports of harassment against Black players</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LujzN2Y4tFPqqYNVVgM0A1sWsug=/26x0:1646x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70352079/055_leatherface_key_art.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VVKOsu"&gt;Behaviour Interactive, developer of co-op survival horror game &lt;em&gt;Dead By Daylight&lt;/em&gt;, has decided to remove certain cosmetics from the game after years of complaints that they were being used in racist harassment against Black players. Announced as part of a &lt;a href="https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/302915/"&gt;developer update&lt;/a&gt;, the cosmetics will be removed in a forthcoming patch, and players who have unlocked the cosmetics will be compensated with in-game currency. In its update, Behaviour Interactive wrote: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bhzz3g"&gt;“Members of the community have shared their experiences with people targeting and harassing them while using some of these masks. These reports were disheartening to hear, and we absolutely condemn this behaviour. We are not comfortable having these masks in the game when they are used as a tool to spread hate. To that end, we will be removing The Cannibal’s unlockable faces in this upcoming Mid-Chapter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g9gUUc"&gt;Introduced to the game several years ago, the cosmetics were special skins designed for the “The Cannibal” killer, also known as Leatherface from 1974’s horror movie classic &lt;em&gt;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&lt;/em&gt;. The cosmetics allowed Leatherface to wear the faces of one of the four original survivor characters, one of whom is a Black woman named Claudette. Black players expressed unease about the Claudette version of the skin as it seemed like an instance of blackface. Blackface is a racist trope in media in which non-Black performers make themselves look like caricatures of Black people by darkening their skin, drawing on huge, exaggerated red lips, or wearing unkempt kinky-haired wigs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="37ivLz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are not comfortable having these masks in the game when they are used as a tool to spread hate.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kFrk5M"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MiladyConfetti"&gt;MiladyConfetti&lt;/a&gt; is a Black streamer and a member of the&lt;em&gt; Dead By Daylight&lt;/em&gt; partner program. She described the skin as “horrific” and originally thought the game was glitching as she didn’t believe a skin like that — one that involved a white man wearing the skin of a Black woman in a literal case of blackface — could exist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2S3Nzm"&gt;In addition to the skin itself evoking the specter of blackface, the way the skin was used caused an even greater concern. Black &lt;em&gt;Dead By Daylight&lt;/em&gt; streamers reported killers who would wear the Claudette version of the Leatherface skin — which they had taken to calling it “Blackface Leatherface” — and harass them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i2RB0C"&gt;“I was harassed by players who knew I was a streamer particularly with the Blackface Leatherface cosmetic,” MiladyConfetti told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I knew it was the players because after being harassed in the game, they would come to my stream and call me slurs and acknowledge that they were the killer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n866NJ"&gt;MiladyConfetti and other Black &lt;em&gt;Dead By Daylight&lt;/em&gt; players began a campaign advocating for the cosmetic’s removal citing its uncomfortable closeness to the racist act of blackface and its abuse by players targeting Black streamers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mabjdD"&gt;In November 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/sistakaren"&gt;SistaKaren&lt;/a&gt;, another &lt;em&gt;Dead By Daylight&lt;/em&gt; partner creator, released a video breaking down the problem she and others have had with Blackface Leatherface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0goPZx"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RE7RZv_dhC0?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WSd1PZ"&gt;The video contains numerous anecdotes of Black streamers being targeted by killers wearing the Claudette Leatherface skin. SistaKaren described how a Claudette Leatherface sent her messages saying, “I hate Black people,” and other messages that were ostensibly slurs but censored by chat filters. Another player recounted an incident in which a Claudette Leatherface would grief them, exclusively toying with or killing them while ignoring other survivors. The incidents of harassment got so bad that Black players, upon seeing a Leatherface wearing the Claudette skin, would immediately disconnect from the game as a protective measure, which, ironically, led to even more harassment. One Claudette Leatherface user incited a protracted harassment campaign against a streamer who disconnected upon seeing the skin, sending racist and toxic messages to the streamer’s Discord, Twitter, and Instagram profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H1zLar"&gt;The Claudette Leatherface skin is another example of racist players using things designed to be representative for Black people as a tool of harassment. Twitch has long struggled with people spamming the Trihard emote, which features the face of Black streamer Trihex, to harass Black streamers. The same is true of the “cmonbruh” emote, prompting many streamers &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/twitch-still-hasnt-fixed-its-racist-emote-problem-1835253131"&gt;to ban the use of both emotes&lt;/a&gt; outright to prevent that kind of behavior. In &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption Online,&lt;/em&gt; players &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/15/18183843/red-dead-online-black-character-racism"&gt;concocted elaborate racist roleplays&lt;/a&gt; in which they act as slave catchers to grief players with Black avatars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SuJNH8"&gt;“I feel good that [Claudette Leatherface] is removed,” MiladyConfetti said. “It was long overdue, especially because this conversation started years ago.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0mZiWf"&gt;Other players agreed, including the senior character artist at Behaviour Interactive who made the skins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9j4vsJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;As the artist who made the bubba masks, I'm glad they are being removed. As cool as it would have been to have an easter egg for all survivors. The reality of it is there were many players using them in harmful ways. Gamers, no matter the game please treat others with respect.&lt;/p&gt;— Eric Bourdages (@EZE3D) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EZE3D/status/1478429227699650579?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 4, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="riPDeU"&gt;Other players &lt;a href="https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/303173/is-removing-bubbas-masks-can-really-prevent-the-hateful-behaviors"&gt;on &lt;em&gt;Dead By Daylight’s&lt;/em&gt; forums&lt;/a&gt; see this action as ineffective as it seemingly “punishes” people who worked to earn the skin while racist players will simply find other ways to be racist. They suggest improved reporting features as a better solution to the racism problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mhHdwq"&gt;SistaKaren understands that Behaviour hasn’t magically solved the problem of player racism in &lt;em&gt;Dead By Daylight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yHPpXk"&gt;“It won’t [solve the racism problem], especially considering how anti-Black hostility and outright racism continue to be prevalent and normalized in gaming,” she told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oubvmV"&gt;“That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t also acknowledge the ongoing harm that Black players would experience,” she said. “While all of us have experienced racism in the game, the worst instances are always with someone wearing this cosmetic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5s7p7u"&gt;Behaviour Interactive’s decision to remove the Claudette Leatherface acknowledges that even though something may have been conceived with benign intentions, its use causes harm and that harm will not be tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0KxTOi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G6czLG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="61DndW"&gt;Although Fossil launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22864897/fossil-razer-skagen-gen-6-smartwatch-wear-os"&gt;two new smartwatches at CES&lt;/a&gt; today, there’s one big elephant in the room: the upgrade to Wear OS 3 won’t arrive for several months. To take the sting out of the wait, Fossil snuck in another new feature for its Gen 6 smartwatches: Amazon Alexa. As for when Alexa will arrive, you’ll have to settle for “coming soon.” Hopefully before Wear OS 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QjmEpD"&gt;In a statement to &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/01/05/fossil-amazon-alexa-gen-6-smartwatches/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Fossil says the update will come in the first half of 2022. This tracks with what Fossil told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a CES briefing, in which spokesperson Robyn Sills said Alexa would come to the Gen 6 devices “early this year.” Fossil sent me both the Skagen Falster 6 and the Razer x Fossil Gen 6 smartwatch, and yup, there’s a widget just for Alexa. If you tap it, however, you won’t bring up the voice assistant. You’ll just see a “coming soon” message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9K9ADb"&gt;So, between “coming soon,” “early this year,” and “first half of this year,” it’s anyone’s guess. With features like this, it’s not uncommon to see companies hedge on timelines, lest they &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1398-i-love-deadlines-i-love-the-whooshing-noise-they-make"&gt;make like Douglas Adams&lt;/a&gt; and watch self-set deadlines whoosh by. Still, if all goes well, it appears likely that Alexa compatibility will arrive before Wear OS 3. As for when the Wear OS 3 upgrades will arrive, that’s up to Google. For now, both Google and Fossil haven’t budged from the equally vague mid-to-late 2022 timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmqVLg"&gt;It might seem curious as to why Fossil would even tease Alexa if it’s not ready yet. The most likely reason is to give everyone something to look forward to while waiting for Wear OS 3, which could arrive in a few months or a whole year from now. In a briefing, Fossil told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that this awkward timing did impact initial Gen 6 sales, though surprisingly, the Gen 5E sales seem to be going strong. Given all the uncertainty, it makes sense that Fossil would want to highlight Alexa compatibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tYf7mY"&gt;For what it’s worth, it is (or will be) a win for Fossil. Voice assistants are increasingly common on smartwatches, but customers don’t really have a say in which assistant comes with their wearable. Wear OS watches are currently tied to Google Assistant and Apple Watches are Siri-only. Samsung has inflicted Bixby onto Galaxy Watch owners for years, and while Samsung said you’d be able to opt for Google Assistant on the new Galaxy Watch 4, &lt;a href="https://r1.community.samsung.com/t5/wearables/google-assistant-for-galaxy-watch-4/td-p/14235396"&gt;it has yet to officially arrive&lt;/a&gt;. Some watches, like Garmin’s newly announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22859098/garmin-venu-2-plus-vivomove-sport-smartwatches"&gt;Venu 2 Plus&lt;/a&gt;, simply connect you to your phone’s assistant. Others hook you up with a proprietary assistant, and that’s rarely a good time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lT7Op0"&gt;Right now, Fitbit is the only one that actually offers any sort of choice. Starting with the Fitbit Sense and Versa 3, you had the option between Alexa or Google Assistant. However, you could only do one or the other. As far as I can see on my review units, while there is an Alexa widget, that doesn’t stop you from using Google Assistant as well. Granted, there are few official details and Alexa on the wrist isn’t the best. However, Fossil offering a choice in assistants — or even the option to potentially use more than one — is a smart move. It’d just be smarter if it was here already. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oJn5Vq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1jKpnI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0LI7jM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This Tablo ATSC 3.0 tuner is a DVR for the 4K over-the-air TV future  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H_6sahkeTtTE4IVXW3ipRVsA68o=/73x0:841x512/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70351824/tablo_atsc3_hdmi_insitu.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This new Tablo box is built to grab TV from the air and record it.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Tablo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d1hCwN"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.tablotv.com/blog/tablo-atsc-3-quad-hdmi-a-tablo-dvr-for-nextgen-tv/"&gt;new Tablo ATSC 3.0 Quad HDMI&lt;/a&gt; is a DVR meant for the next generation of broadcast TV — which, if all &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/2/14488608/4k-tv-broadcasts-ajit-pai-atsc-3-hdr"&gt;goes according to plan&lt;/a&gt;, will involve 4K HDR content being sent out over the airwaves for free. It can record up to four channels at once onto an external hard drive, letting you watch programs back on your schedule, not broadcasters’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jcodtg"&gt;In the age of internet streaming, cable, and satellite, it can be hard to remember that there are still local TV stations broadcasting their programs over the airwaves, which anyone can watch for free if they have an antenna and receiver. But for some enthusiasts, viewing broadcast television is the new cord-cutting — and it’s those signals Tablos are made to record and playback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UcFphc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;ATSC 3.0 supports 4K HDR broadcasts, which will largely be free to watch if you’ve got the equipment&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K5cpIp"&gt;Cordcutter-friendly DVRs are a pretty mature concept at this point, with companies including Tablo and HDHomeRun producing them steadily for years. ATSC 3.0 changes things, though — it’s the follow-up to the digital standard that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_television_transition_in_the_United_States"&gt;replaced US analog TV broadcasts in 2009&lt;/a&gt;, and it supports plenty of upgrades, including support for 4K HDR broadcasts, high frame rate content, and more. While it’s currently not set to completely replace ATSC 1.0 anytime soon, some stations have started broadcasting content using both standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L9AkzM"&gt;Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.aftvnews.com/new-lineup-of-hdhomerun-ota-network-tuners-add-dvr-capabilities-and-expand-atsc-3-0-support/"&gt;HDHomeRun launched a new lineup&lt;/a&gt; which packed in ATSC 3.0 but limited it to just two of four available tuners. The new Tablo supports four ATSC 3.0 tuners. The Tablo can record either type of signal, depending on the channel it’s set to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7xwQ5"&gt;You can read more on the history of how ATSC 3.0 came to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/2/14488608/4k-tv-broadcasts-ajit-pai-atsc-3-hdr"&gt;in our explainer, here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3A6naR"&gt;Apart from the fact that it can record four ATSC 3.0 streams at once, the new Quad HDMI works a lot like Tablo’s other DVRs. It hooks up to an antenna, hard drive, and your TV, and you can use it to watch live TV, or programs that you’ve recorded. Tablo says the interface will tell you which channels are using ATSC 1.0 and which are using 3.0.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KFjZlZLY7OQUyt5Dx7jbQP7R7uU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23147873/tablo_atsc3_quad_hdmi_in_situ_straight_crop_new.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Tablo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Tablo also offers a &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.tablotv.com/tv-guide-data-subscriptions/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;subscription-based TV guide service&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; that unlocks additional filters and features.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AmwYuh"&gt;Tablo does warn that the experience won’t be exactly what its longtime users are used to. It’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/8/18173912/tablo-dvr-ad-skipping-ota-quad-tuner-internal-harddrive-ces-2019"&gt;automatic ad-skipping feature&lt;/a&gt; will only be available for ATSC 1.0 recordings, not for ATSC 3.0 ones. Tablo says it “hope[s] to be able to support this popular feature on ATSC 3.0 recordings in the future,” but it’s always best practice to buy something for the features it ships with, not the ones it might have later. The new Quad HDMI box also won’t be able to stream recorded content to other devices in your house, a feature available on &lt;a href="https://www.tablotv.com/tablo-tv-connected-dvrs-how-they-work/#hdmidevices"&gt;some of Tablo’s other boxes&lt;/a&gt;. It’ll only be able to playback video on the TV to which it’s physically connected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="title"&gt;The DVR will ship in “spring 2022,” for a cost of $300. That’s not inexpensive, especially after you factor in the added expense of an external hard drive, which is required if you want the digital video recorder to actually record. In &lt;a href="https://www.tablotv.com/blog/tablo-atsc-3-quad-hdmi-a-tablo-dvr-for-nextgen-tv/#faq"&gt;its FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, Nuvyyo (the company behind Tablo) tries to justify the price — compared to other ATSC 3.0-capable DVRs, all four of its tuners can make use of the new standard, instead of others that only have one or two hybrid tuners. For comparison, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SiliconDust-HDHomeRun-Flex-ATSC-NextGen/dp/B092GCN9NL?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the HDHomeRun Flex 4K ATSC 3.0&lt;/a&gt; costs $200 and only supports the newer standard on two of its four tuners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pMf7s9"&gt;The extra NextGen tuners may not be that big of a deal now, since &lt;a href="https://www.rabbitears.info/market.php?request=atsc3"&gt;there aren't tons of ATSC 3.0 broadcasts&lt;/a&gt;, but could become a boon in the future if the rollout expands and broadcasters start taking advantage of the ability to send 4K HDR content over the air.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Drone carrying a defibrillator saves its first heart attack patient in Sweden</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="a photo of the ever drone" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YA7myZEIlRlSaos1nY4u7GHRBFE=/29x0:5890x3907/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70351712/1sN1qEZA.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Everdrone AB&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qLOkhr"&gt;A man in Sweden is alive today thanks to — in part — a drone. The 71-year-old had a heart attack while shoveling snow in December and was resuscitated by a nearby doctor after a drone flew in a defibrillator, Everdrone &lt;a href="https://everdrone.com/news/2022/01/04/for-the-first-time-in-medical-history-an-autonomous-drone-helps-save-the-life-of-a-cardiac-arrest-patient/"&gt;reported Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eSvvzO"&gt;Someone having a heart attack needs help within 10 minutes in order to survive. Everdrone’s Emergency Medical Aerial Delivery (EMADE) service is designed to deliver help as quickly as possible — it allows emergency dispatchers to send a drone carrying the device to a caller’s home, kickstarting the lifesaving process before the ambulance arrives at their home. In this particular patient’s case, it took three minutes for the services to deliver the defibrillator to his home. A bystander, who happened to be a doctor on the way to his job, used the AED on the patient after providing CPR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Kdn3K"&gt;The drone was developed with the Center for Resuscitation Science at Karolinska Institutet, SOS Alarm, and Region Västra Götaland. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rm1Q5Y6abohtqPCv_qMPiIkMX0k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23147959/YU9_81Ho.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Everdrone&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="T3uleX"&gt;“This is an excellent real-world example of how Everdrone’s cutting edge drone technology, fully integrated with emergency dispatch, can minimize the time for access to live-saving AED equipment,” Everdrone CEO Mats Sällström said.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Tj6dm"&gt;In a four-month &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/advance-article/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab498/6358076"&gt;pilot study&lt;/a&gt; testing the EMADE program, the service got 14 heart attack alerts that would be eligible for drones. Drones took off in 12 of those cases, and 11 successfully delivered the defibrillators. Seven of those defibrillators were delivered before the ambulance arrived. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uE0nVu"&gt;In Europe, about 275,000 patients suffer from cardiac arrest annually with approximately 70 percent of those arrests occurring in a private home without a defibrillator on site, according to Everdrone. The survival rate is &lt;a href="https://www.resuscitationjournal.com/article/S0300-9572(20)30046-0/fulltext"&gt;around 10 percent&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HDFVme"&gt;Currently, the EMADE service can reach 200,000 Swedish residents. The company said it plans to expand to more locations in Europe this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T83y0a"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XG56Hx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Walmart is expanding its direct-to-your-refrigerator deliveries</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mac880N89UbkhONzAivjf29s9B0=/0x0:1400x933/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70351388/walmart_inhome_driver_delivers_ambient_items_in_customers_home.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image by Walmart / Wesley Hitt&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NzfM8C"&gt;&lt;a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2022/01/05/walmart-to-expand-inhome-delivery-reaching-30-million-u-s-homes-in-2022"&gt;Walmart plans to expand InHome&lt;/a&gt;, its delivery service that brings groceries (and other items) directly to your fridge or countertop, to 30 million US households by the end of this year. As a part of the expansion, the retail giant says it will hire 3,000 delivery drivers and establish an all-electric fleet of delivery vehicles, thousands of which it has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22867087/walmart-brightdrop-electric-delivery-van-gm-fedex"&gt;just ordered from the General Motors-backed electric vehicle company BrightDrop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dBh6cj"&gt;The InHome delivery service requires you to pay a $19.95 / month subscription fee, along with an optional $49.95 fee for a smart lock (if you don’t already have a garage keypad or a smart lock already) that grants bodycam-wearing Walmart associates access to your home — and your fridge. When the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/7/18656172/walmart-inhome-fridge-delivery-service"&gt;service first launched in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20915291/walmart-inhome-delivery-service-1-million-customers-usa-cities-direct-to-fridge"&gt;only serviced one million customers&lt;/a&gt; in select locations. The expansion will bring the service to more places across the US, but Walmart doesn’t make it clear where exactly it will be available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DJ6Jn6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Walmart’s service competes directly with Amazon Key, a similar program launched in 2017&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TqpJu5"&gt;Walmart’s service competes directly with Amazon Key, a similar program launched in 2017 that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/25/16538834/amazon-key-in-home-delivery-unlock-door-prime-cloud-cam-smart-lock"&gt;lets couriers inside your front door&lt;/a&gt; to drop off packages. But apparently, some people don’t feel comfortable letting complete strangers into their house, which is why Amazon later decided to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18167425/amazon-key-garage-business-home-deliveries-prime-ces-2019"&gt;add in-garage&lt;/a&gt; and in-gate deliveries as alternatives. No matter what service you choose, though, you’ll need to make some extra purchases, including an Amazon Key front door lock and Cloud Cam, a myQ-compatible garage door opener, or a professional installation of the Ring Access Pro for your gate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvK3JX"&gt;Unlike Amazon, however, Walmart won’t be contracting out some of its drivers to third parties (and hopefully won’t subject them to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421327/amazon-drivers-delivery-service-partner-rules-grooming-online-conduct"&gt;weird standards like how clean their fingernails are or what their breath smells like&lt;/a&gt;). Delivery drivers will be employed full-time by the company, allowing them to take advantage of health benefits, paid time off, 401(k) matching, and a $1.50 pay increase from standard store positions. Walmart also plans on filling these roles using some of its existing associates rather than hiring all new employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RJpNue"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>BMW debuts its new color-changing paint technology at CES: E Ink</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wt7tG5NUhFne4L5pDqI3fnGcbWc=/34x0:4929x3263/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70351237/37_SW_FinBMW_iX_eInk_Seite_02.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S309gS"&gt;If you’ve ever felt indecisive about what color vehicle to buy, BMW may have the car for you. The German automaker showed off its new color-changing paint technology at the 2022 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas that shares more in common with a Kindle than you’d think at first glance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JQc7k1"&gt;Relying on E Ink, the electronic paper technology used in e-readers, and the old Pebble watch, the color-changing paint technology is making its debut on a concept version of the BMW iX that is being presented at CES. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="3jt7HB"&gt;The surface coating of the BMW iX Flow featuring E Ink contains many millions of microcapsules, with a diameter equivalent to the thickness of a human hair. Each of these microcapsules contains negatively charged white pigments and positively charged black pigments. Depending on the chosen setting, stimulation by means of an electrical field causes either the white or the black pigments to collect at the surface of the microcapsule, giving the car body the desired shade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Y1gbuI"&gt;Just don’t expect to see this at your local BMW dealership anytime soon: the automaker says this is just an “advanced research and design project.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rSbUipS9hA7sxgdFy3ctIRkDa4I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146458/BMW_E_Ink.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Bg32he"&gt;The innovative paint scheme can be triggered at the touch of a button. Right now, the colors are limited to white, black, and grey. But despite the constrained palette, BMW says it could have implications for the efficiency of its electric vehicles.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YSzlgt"&gt;“A white surface reflects a lot more sunlight than a black one,” the company says. “By implication, heating of the vehicle and passenger compartment as a result of strong sunlight and high outside temperatures can be reduced by changing the exterior to a light color.” In cooler weather, darker tones will help the vehicle to absorb more warmth from the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="N3svwJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A white surface reflects a lot more sunlight than a black one”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6kDOpp"&gt;The concept of “personalization” is very popular right now in the auto industry. But while most of the efforts are focused on the interior, tweaking the software to remember the driver’s preferred vehicle settings, BMW is bringing the concept of personalization to the exterior of the vehicle.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gyIxE2"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="BMW debuts color changing car at CES #Shorts|105472" data-volume-uuid="0107188b7" data-volume-id="105472" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-594" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1zhQOx"&gt;How durable this high-tech paint is and whether it can withstand extreme weather is anyone’s guess. I can’t imagine this would handle well in a hail storm, for example. But don’t listen to me. Color-changing car!!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Instagram test brings back the chronological feed  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4Bb8BTlYaKvhNme0vljYoM8LJqo=/0x0:1428x952/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70351198/Screen_Shot_2022_01_05_at_1.30.42_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XlGh7L"&gt;Instagram head Adam Mosseri says the company has started testing two new feed settings, including the much-requested chronological option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0pYh9M"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1478767105444966401"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; shared today, Mosseri demonstrated a new menu with three options for how Instagram’s feed will display posts. The “Home” setting is what users are familiar with — a feed Instagram creates based on what it thinks will interest each user, ranked using an algorithm. A new “Favorites” feed will be populated with content from a subset of accounts a user chooses (Mosseri says he uses it for siblings, certain creators, and friends). And finally, a “Following” feed will return what many users have been asking for: a chronological stream of posts from accounts you follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rxLIHK"&gt;Mosseri &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22824609/instagram-chronological-feed-adam-mosseri"&gt;promised&lt;/a&gt; the chronological feed would make a comeback during a Senate subcommittee hearing in December. During a Q&amp;amp;A last month, he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828773/instagram-chronological-feed-details-mosseri-two-versions"&gt;also said&lt;/a&gt; Instagram was “already testing the favorites idea.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGl4PV"&gt;Instagram’s algorithmically sorted feed has been criticized by users since it was first introduced in 2016. Users have complained about going long periods of time without seeing posts from accounts they follow or having older posts at the top of their feeds. Creators have speculated about how algorithms decide which content to push to the top, and Mosseri has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22524332/instagram-how-it-works-blog-post-adam-mosseri-shadowban"&gt;written blogs&lt;/a&gt; explaining some of the methods used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kuB7RC"&gt;Some users have already noticed the new options in the Instagram app. The company didn’t immediately respond to questions about when it expects the change to become available to all users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Z5jcTw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Testing Feed Changes  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We’re starting to test the ability to switch between three different views on your home screen (two of which would give you the option to see posts in chronological order):&lt;br&gt;- Home&lt;br&gt;- Favorites&lt;br&gt;- Following&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We hope to launch these soon. More to come. ✌  &lt;a href="https://t.co/9zvB85aPSp"&gt;pic.twitter.com/9zvB85aPSp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Adam Mosseri (@mosseri) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1478767105444966401?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 5, 2022&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Volvo confident it can get its ‘unsupervised’ highway driving mode approved in California</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mZ4tsg0xgvL--NGUu3MizFe7PYw=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70351052/ahawkins_201221_4352_6501.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PBoqAM"&gt;Volvo announced a new advanced driver assist system called Ride Pilot system, in which its vehicles drive themselves on certain highways without any human supervision. Ride Pilot will be available as a subscription service to customers in California, the company announced at the 2022 Consumer Electronics Show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HJXQJr"&gt;It’s an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21248415/volvo-luminar-lidar-self-driving-highway-pilot-spa2"&gt;ambitious plan that carries its own risks&lt;/a&gt; and sets Volvo apart from its competitors, many of which are planning to launch self-driving technology as part of a robotaxi service rather than production cars for personal ownership. But Volvo believes that by limiting the operational domain — or conditions under which the car can drive autonomously — to just highways, it is creating vehicle technology that is not only safer but less costly as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hzdKxu"&gt;“We will not require hands on the steering wheel and we will not require eyes on the road,” Henrik Green, the automaker’s chief technology officer, said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. But when asked whether drivers will be able to take a nap in the car with Ride Pilot active, Green demurred. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="03ajZ8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re still being very purposely non-distinct in the wakeup time that we require”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pX9fBH"&gt;“We’re still being very purposely non-distinct in the wake-up time that we require,” he said. “Taking a nap requires a wake-up time, so let’s see how far and when we can get there. You need to be able to assume control in a certain time and take back the driving responsibility.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U7A047"&gt;Pending regulatory approval, the new feature will only be available to customers in California at first. Green described the state as a “good geographic location in terms of weather conditions: it’s sunny, it’s got good road conditions.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M3o8WM"&gt;Volvo’s forthcoming (and unnamed) electric SUV, which will be announced later this year, will be the first vehicle to feature Ride Pilot. Volvo’s Concept Recharge, which was revealed last summer, is meant to preview that SUV, as well as how the new driver assist system will be presented with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22547453/volvo-lidar-standard-autonomous-luminar-xc90-2022"&gt;fully integrated roof lidar from supplier Luminar&lt;/a&gt;. The design of the Concept Recharge will likely be similar to that of the electric XC90 successor due to arrive later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yg9jqK"&gt;In addition to Luminar’s lidar, Volvo’s Ride Pilot system will be powered by software developed by Zenseact, a subsidiary of Volvo which worked alongside the automaker’s own team of engineers. Luminar, which is based in Florida, has worked closely with Zenseact’s team in Sweden on a full-stack autonomous driving software for series production vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZryeUW"&gt;Green wouldn’t say when it plans on officially activating Ride Pilot, but he noted that it will almost certainly be sometime after 2022. “What is still not super clear is obviously the timeline both from our confidence and our validation that we are good to go, and [the regulations] need to be in place,” Green said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxnwI7"&gt;Ride Pilot is what the Society of Automotive Engineers would define as a Level 3 autonomous system, in which the driver’s supervision is not required in a highly controlled setting, like on certain mapped highways. But in Level 3 systems, the driver still needs to be ready to take control at a moment’s notice, leaving it somewhat in a nebulous zone between Level 2 advanced driver assist systems, like Tesla’s Autopilot, and fully driverless vehicles, like Waymo’s autonomous taxi service in Phoenix, Arizona. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tguxRd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Green wouldn’t say when it plans on officially activating Ride Pilot&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gmfQNk"&gt;California’s Department of Motor Vehicles oversees the largest autonomous vehicle testing program in the country, with over 60 companies permitted to operate test vehicles on public roads. Only a handful are approved to operate fully autonomous vehicles without safety drivers at the wheel, and even fewer have been approved to deploy vehicles for commercial purposes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SlACu8"&gt;But what Volvo is seeking to do is a bit different. The automaker is applying for a permit to test autonomous vehicles on public roads through the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles. Rather than deploy its vehicles as part of a taxi or delivery fleet, Volvo wants California’s approval to offer its Level 3 autonomous system to customers as a part of a subscription service — something the state has yet to do for any company. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1EcGVYXuX5km5EXkP22PFxRd60w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146040/292922_Volvo_Cars_Concept_Recharge_with_Luminar_s_Iris_LiDAR_on.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Volvo&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="F9mFs3"&gt;According to the DMV, a company wishing to deploy Level 3 capable vehicles on public roads must obtain authorization from the state before making their technology available to customers. Volvo has not applied for a deployment permit yet, a spokesperson for the agency said in an email. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bMXjGk"&gt;Offering Ride Pilot as a subscription presents a lower hurdle to consumers, Green said, given the large percentages of people who lease their vehicles rather than own them. “Not everybody sits on a big amount of cash available,” he said. “Subscription is a very low hurdle you can try out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ek7AVD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Other automakers have been tripped up by the promise of Level 3 driving&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bgyxFH"&gt;Most AV companies, including Waymo and Cruise, have said they are skipping Level 3 and working exclusively on Level 4 technology. The reason is that Level 3 is seen as being potentially dangerous, given the likelihood that drivers will be confused about when they need to takeover control of the vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CazJmR"&gt;Other automakers have been tripped up by the promise of Level 3 driving. In 2018, Audi said its A8 sedan would come with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/11/15952510/audi-a8-level-3-autonomous-driving-self-parking"&gt;a feature called Traffic Jam Assist&lt;/a&gt; that, when active, would relieve human drivers of the need to pay attention during stop-and-go traffic. &lt;a href="https://www.autonews.com/shift/why-level-3-automated-technology-has-failed-take-hold"&gt;But the feature was contingent on approval from local authorities&lt;/a&gt;, and Traffic Jam Assist remains dormant in most markets around the world. Audi has no plans to activate the feature, and Level 3 automation remains a morass of legal, regulatory, and business-related challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TYbri7PED-FssOQfbx_3-3HGLlY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146041/292920_Volvo_Cars_Concept_Recharge_safety_illustration.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2pNidc"&gt;Another potential hurdle is the potential for misuse by customers. A good example is Tesla’s Level 2 “Full Self-Driving” beta software that, despite its misleading name, still requires drivers to be vigilant while in use. Tesla’s customers often ignore the company’s warnings and misuse Autopilot to record themselves performing dangerous stunts. This type of rule-breaking is to be expected, especially in a society where clout-chasing has become a way of life for many people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWTeF3"&gt;Green says it’s a communications and a technology challenge for Volvo to ensure its customers know when they need to take over and when they are misusing the system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VpogGf"&gt;“It needs to be clear in the communication to the consumer,” he said. “It needs to be clear inside the vehicle while you are operating it. So a very important area.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IphrQp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
