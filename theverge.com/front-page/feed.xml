    <title>Google redesigns its emoji to be more universal and authentic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fCGoyN67c4oJDZrlIhku8-1UmvA=/158x0:1891x1155/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69591877/Untitled.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;992 of Google’s emoji designs are receiving tweaks.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hchssT"&gt;Google is tweaking 992 of its emoji designs to make them more “universal, accessible, and authentic,” &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/android/emoji-day-redesign-easier-sharing/"&gt;the company announced today&lt;/a&gt;. The new designs will arrive this fall alongside Android 12, but Google says they’ll also be available on older versions with apps that use its Appcompat compatibility layer. They’re also coming to other Google platforms like Gmail, Chrome OS, Google Chat, and YouTube Live Chat this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="li379f"&gt;None of the changes are particularly drastic. Instead, they’re mostly the kinds of tweaks that make the meaning of each emoji easier to understand at a glance by a wider range of people. The pie emoji, for example, currently looks like a classic American pumpkin pie. That’s fine for Americans, but it means that, in the UK, the design looked closer to a tart than a traditional pie. The new more universal design should fix this.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i-Ti0iEYP6HJgHvtukwHzweTWxc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22721252/Untitled.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;American-style pie versus a more universal design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XahE3y"&gt;In other cases, Google has given its designs a bolder, more exaggerated look, which is helpful considering how small they appear on most screens. The croissant and bacon emoji will now have more of a shine to them, while the scissors have a more exaggerated sharp edge. Vehicles like cars and taxis have also had their proportions adjusted to make them more eye-catching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tHdxhm"&gt;Finally, the bikini emoji no longer looks like it’s being worn by an invisible person, and the face mask emoji now shows a face with its eyes open. Google says it made this change to reflect the fact that masks have become “a universal way of showing kindness to others” rather than a symbol of someone being sick.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BN3pNgSy2k1oCUz3M1BUzms9S6c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22721254/Untitled__2_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The eye-opening new mask design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MeNiB5"&gt;It’s not unusual for companies to redesign their emoji like this, either to correct inaccuracies or reflect changing cultural assumptions about how they’re used. Last year, Apple made a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/3/21500163/apple-emoji-mask-medical-face-2020"&gt;similar tweak to its own mask emoji&lt;/a&gt; to show a smiling face underneath the mask, and it has also changed its syringe emoji to make it more appropriate as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285963/apple-emoji-ios-14-5-smiley-faces-hearts-more-skin-tones"&gt;symbol for vaccines&lt;/a&gt;. In 2019, it even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/9/24/20882195/ios-13-1-emoji-updates-squid-fixed-mosquito-abacus-puzzle-piece-heart-eyes"&gt;updated its abacus emoji&lt;/a&gt; after people pointed out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/5/26/18639006/apple-abacus-emoji-wrong-historically-inaccurate-math"&gt;problems with its old design&lt;/a&gt;. And let’s not forget Google’s redesigns of its burger and beer emoji in response to an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/5/16737066/google-burger-beer-emoji-android-8-1-fix-release-date"&gt;outcry in 2017&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3BT6Xj"&gt;If you’re wondering why we’ve seen such a flurry of emoji news over the past couple of days, it’s because this year’s World Emoji Day lands tomorrow, July 17th. Yesterday, we saw the announcement of the finalists for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578697/new-emoji-14-0-finalists-unicode-consortium"&gt;this year’s new batch of emoji&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook announced new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578633/facebook-messenger-sound-emoji-soundmojis"&gt;emoji with sound for its Messenger service&lt;/a&gt;, and even Microsoft got in on the action with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578352/microsoft-new-3d-emoji-clippy-windows-office"&gt;new set of 3D emoji&lt;/a&gt; across Windows, Office, Microsoft Teams, and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use SharePlay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dDiblckRVLHgrtbBPSEcr9coKKI=/248x0:1652x936/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69591839/Screen_Shot_2021_07_16_at_11.24.18_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aFX6H0"&gt;The headline feature for Apple’s fall updates (including iOS 15, iPadOS 15, tvOS 15, and macOS Monterey) is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22526742/apple-facetime-shareplay-ios-15-watch-party"&gt;SharePlay&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a new software feature on top of FaceTime that allows you to watch and listen to movies, TV shows, music, podcasts, and more with friends and family while video chatting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NVhoWh"&gt;Right now, the number of SharePlay-compatible apps is a pretty small list: the Apple TV app for movies and TV shows, the Apple Music app for music, and Apple’s Podcasts app for podcasts. The company is promising some bigger third-party partners when iOS 15 launches this fall, including HBO Max, Disney Plus, Paramount Plus, TikTok, and Twitch. Some big names seem to be skipping out for now, though: most notably, Netflix and YouTube. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xxxapQ"&gt;For now, if you want to try it, here’s how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wyP4fu"&gt;SharePlay with iOS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nDvm7iXfkPCtVxPnWrw6IuXTGBo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22721826/Apple_iPhone12Pro_iOS15_TV_Expanse_originals_060721_carousel.jpg.large_2x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Starting playback of a TV episode using SharePlay.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yCS1B9wBu4EH2FXYdzECRDF6Xdk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22721827/Apple_iPhone12Pro_iOS15_TV_Expanse_Messages_060721_carousel.jpg.large_2x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SharePlay allows you to still use your phone while watching shows together.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="c2EF2u"&gt;To use SharePlay on an iPhone or iPad, first, make sure that everyone on the call is using iOS 15 and iPadOS 15.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ilfgIM"&gt;Next, start a FaceTime call — either one-on-one or a group call — with everyone you want to watch or listen with. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ea1Yzs"&gt;Once you’ve done that, exit out of the FaceTime call (which will automatically move to a picture-in-picture window) and head over to a SharePlay-compatible app. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="n0Od7O"&gt;After that, playing something over SharePlay is as simple as it is when you’re just watching or listening alone: just select whatever content you want, and it’ll play for everyone. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Widx5O"&gt;Controlling a SharePlay stream just requires that you play, pause, and skip around as you usually would. SharePlay automatically keeps everyone’s streams in sync so that if one person pauses to get a snack, the movie will pause for everyone. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="6qSHbT"&gt;You have two options for ending a stream: either end it for everyone on the SharePlay call or end it just for you (letting everyone else continue to watch).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vDOHUv"&gt;SharePlay with macOS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="p50DLz"&gt;Using SharePlay on macOS Monterey works similarly to iOS and iPadOS: you’ll need to start a FaceTime call, launch a compatible app, and play some content that everyone on the call can access. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HktWcy"&gt;When you’re in a SharePlay session, you’ll be able to access controls for the call through a menu bar icon (instead of the pop-over menu that appears on iOS and iPadOS).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zxtzPYaDijnkIvV6LByNzsFSr-U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22721810/Apple_macos_monterey_facetime_06072021_big_carousel.jpg.large_2x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;macOS’s SharePlay menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ni0t4U"&gt;SharePlay with Apple TV&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2BmoYv"&gt;Using SharePlay with an Apple TV works a little differently than the other platforms, given that you can’t actually start (or participate) on a FaceTime call through an Apple TV itself. Rather, when you’re FaceTiming on a nearby iPhone, iPad, or Mac with SharePlay, the Apple TV will offer you the option to hand off the media portion of that call to the bigger screen through Control Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AWqzlT"&gt;To access that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Gzk4BJ"&gt;Simply follow the above steps to start a SharePlay FaceTime call.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="B3ceKN"&gt;Then press and hold the TV button on your Apple TV remote. From there, you’ll be able to select the new SharePlay icon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bzMSmjBnB5ZjwW2NfJYmIZIQ5c8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22721815/Apple_iPhone12Pro_iOS15_FaceTime_expanse_groupfacetime_060721_carousel.jpg.large_2x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iOS interface when watching a show on an Apple TV while using SharePlay.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WjF2c5"&gt;It’s important to note that only the music or movie that you’re watching will shift over to the Apple TV. Your FaceTime video will still be playing on the Mac, iPhone, or iPad that you started with. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rivian delays first electric pickup deliveries to September</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KqNdNUR3oq1L82c4DaveWQXldFg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69591771/rivian_electric_truck_3736.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RliHc0"&gt;Rivian has delayed the first deliveries of its long-awaited electric pickup truck again, this time until September. Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe broke the news to buyers in &lt;a href="https://www.autonews.com/manufacturing/rivian-ceo-tells-customers-first-deliveries-delayed-until-september?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;amp;utm_medium=twitter"&gt;an email&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/rivian-delays-deliveries-of-r1t-r1s-electric-vehicles-again/"&gt;Friday morning&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aWUAX6"&gt;The Amazon and Ford-backed EV startup originally planned to start delivering its electric pickup, the R1T, and its SUV, the R1S, in 2020. But it scuttled those plans at the beginning of the pandemic and said at the time that it would start deliveries in 2021 instead. Rivian eventually settled on starting deliveries of the R1T in June of this year, only to push that back to July, and now to September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U2zdB6"&gt;“We know you can’t wait to get behind the wheel of your vehicle,” Scaringe wrote in the email. “Earlier this summer, we announced that deliveries would begin in July; however, the timing for the first deliveries of the R1T has shifted to September, with the R1S shortly thereafter in the fall. I wanted to be sure you heard this from me directly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gK3Xz4"&gt;Scaringe said the “cascading impacts of the pandemic have had a compounding effect greater than anyone anticipated.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WLiGqc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Cascading impacts of the pandemic” are partly to blame&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hLGEJ2"&gt;“Everything from facility construction, to equipment installation, to vehicle component supply (especially semiconductors) has been impacted by the pandemic,” he wrote. Scaringe also said that trying to launch the pickup truck, SUV, and a delivery van being developed with Amazon while also building out a manufacturing facility in Illinois has been difficult, calling it a “complex orchestra of coordinated and interlinked activities where small issues can translate into ramp delays.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yXWMFr"&gt;Scaringe also copped to poor communication with reservation holders. “I have spoken with a number of you and know we need to do a better job at communicating specifics around deliveries. Our Guides will continue reaching out to schedule deliveries and will be there for any questions throughout the process,” he wrote. He promised to give more updates in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wWiLD0"&gt;Rivian was founded in 2009 but kept &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/23/17380600/rivian-electric-truck-pickup-suv-interview-rj-scaringe"&gt;an extremely low profile until 2018&lt;/a&gt; when it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/26/18111782/rivian-r1t-electric-pickup-price-specs-la-auto-show-2018"&gt;debuted the R1T and R1S at the LA Auto Show&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, it has raised an incredible amount of cash — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238670/rivian-funding-amazon-electric-truck-suv"&gt;more than $8 billion&lt;/a&gt; — from Amazon, Ford, and other institutional investors. The company is also working on going public, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-28/electric-truck-maker-rivian-is-said-to-select-ipo-underwriters?sref=DWzi38c2"&gt;which would add even more cash to its war chest&lt;/a&gt;. Its workforce has also ballooned to over 7,000 employees, Scaringe said in the email. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zXDTEB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google executive steps down after offensive manifesto about antisemitic past</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="RISE Conference 2017" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m8r33u7u7I-0e7q73B3FC76Ww30=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69591484/813031818.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by studioEAST / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="33h6SW"&gt;Google parted ways with a cloud services executive after he published a &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210614065822/https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/we-one-amr-awadallah/"&gt;LinkedIn manifesto&lt;/a&gt; about Israeli-Palestinian relations and his vehemently antisemitic past. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/16/google-separates-with-cloud-vp-after-employees-complain-about-manifesto.html"&gt;CNBC reports&lt;/a&gt; that Google faced internal criticism over Amr Awadallah, VP of developer relations at Google Cloud. While Awadallah said he published the piece to promote tolerance and understanding, employees objected to how Awadallah described Jews and expressed concerns about his past beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tez4yX"&gt;Awadallah began the June 13th post — titled “We are one!” — with a declaration that “‘I hated the Jewish people, all the Jewish people’! and emphasis here is on the past tense.” The 10,000-word manifesto discussed his upbringing in Egypt, saying he’d been “very cautious” working with Stanford research adviser and VMWare founder Mendel Rosenblum but that Rosenblum had “converted me to be a Jew lover to be honest.” Awadallah also cited a 23andMe analysis saying he had 0.1 percent Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry to claim he “belong[s] to the Jewish ethnic group by DNA.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nW40bz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This has made my job as one of your colleagues much harder”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y6QWld"&gt;At least one Google employee, Daniel Golding, publicly commented on the post. “On one hand, I’m grateful that you no longer hate my children. On the other, this has made my job as one of your colleagues much harder. The previous situation has made being a Jewish leader at Google tough. This has made it almost untenable,” Golding wrote. “I’m unsure why you would write this under your title and company affiliation and it frustrates me. You could simply have done this as a private person.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CWf64k"&gt;CNBC spoke with employees who said frustration had already been building over Awadallah’s leadership style and that the post had made it harder for employees to perform effective developer relations. Awadallah joined Google in 2019 after co-founding the cloud services company Cloudera. After a tense all-hands meeting where employees confronted Awadallah about the post, Google Cloud VP of engineering and product Eyal Manor reportedly sent an internal email announcing his departure. “I wanted to share that today is Amr Awadallah’s last day at Google,” it read in part, according to CNBC. Google declined comment on the story, and Awadallah did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; was able to confirm his departure from the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oIRU87"&gt;Google, along with other tech companies, has faced growing internal conflicts in recent years. Employees have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/10/21132366/google-eileen-naughton-culture-hr-people-operations-step-down"&gt;pushed back&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396112/google-ethical-ai-team-bias-harassment-timnit-gebru-firing"&gt;alleged bias and sexual harassment&lt;/a&gt; and a failure to live up to its stated ideals, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22370158/google-ai-ethics-timnit-gebru-margaret-mitchell-firing-reputation"&gt;firing prominent artificial intelligence ethics researchers&lt;/a&gt; who raised concerns about the company’s AI. In the email reviewed by CNBC, Manor reportedly noted that work at Google has been “particularly challenging with a number of organizational changes and leadership transitions while we’ve all been navigating a global pandemic and don’t have the benefit of connecting in person together like we used to.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Counterfeit wireless earbuds are being seized in record numbers at US border</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XOc9geu894FJNlcKQmF2IgkMZ6s=/0x0:1024x683/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69591470/AirPods.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/CBPChicago/status/1407021736089079815/photo/1" target="_blank"&gt;US Customs and Border Protection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kMwSLT"&gt;The number of counterfeit wireless earbuds seized by US border customs in 2021 has already surpassed last year’s total, according to &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/airpods-are-a-huge-hit-with-consumers-and-counterfeiters"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a sign of how eager the makers of these knockoffs are to keep riding the sustained popularity of earbuds like Apple’s AirPods and those from Samsung, Jabra, Bose, Sony, and other companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftpC8P"&gt;According to the report, “roughly 360,000 counterfeit wireless headphones” — valued at $62.2 million — were nabbed in the first nine months of fiscal 2021. That’s well above the 295,000 pairs that were confiscated during the whole of fiscal 2020. Just yesterday, US Customs and Border Protection &lt;a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/local-media-release/thousands-fake-apple-airpods-worth-13-million-seized-cincinnati-cbp"&gt;announced a major confiscation&lt;/a&gt; in Cincinnati. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eyvo0A"&gt;Around 80 percent of fakes entering the US come from China, and their manufacturers see a huge opportunity: &lt;a href="https://news.strategyanalytics.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Strategy-Analytics-True-Wireless-Stereo-Headset-Sales-Surge-90-in-2020-as-Chinese-Vendors-Surge/default.aspx"&gt;Strategy Analytics&lt;/a&gt; forecasted worldwide sales of Bluetooth headsets to be more than 300 million in 2020, and the true wireless earbuds market surged by 90 percent. Apple still holds a commanding lead in market share, though a crowded field has cut into that dominance. Research firm Canalys estimates that Apple took in at least $16 billion from AirPods sales last year, according to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; report. The introduction of the AirPods Pro in 2019 gave scammers a chance to try and wring even more money out of unknowing buyers. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xJcpfVFw7_W-F1lW4xc5kJPbDgs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22721822/clones.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/local-media-release/331000-worth-fake-airpods-seized-cbp-officers-louisville" target="_blank"&gt;US Customs and Border Protection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A confiscated shipment of AirPods counterfeits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="w5v7lp"&gt;OnePlus had to deal with an awkward controversy last September when US Customs and Border Protection &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/13/21435637/us-cbp-counterfeit-airpods-oneplus-buds-mixup"&gt;seized a shipment of the company’s earbuds&lt;/a&gt; and described them as counterfeit AirPods. There are design differences between the two, but the blatant AirPod clones are getting closer and closer to the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0LcIAZ"&gt;Some counterfeit earbuds are suspected to have been created “with genuine molds stolen from factories that work with Apple.” Others can mimic the AirPods pairing process on an iPhone and display a proper Apple serial number. But even in these situations, there are still subtle tells (like a bogus firmware version) that reveal a product as a fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DlzhRG"&gt;Highlighting the potential safety risks, Apple says it has a global effort in place to tackle the issue of knockoffs, and it’s working with law enforcement and e-commerce sites to prevent customers from being duped wherever possible. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Emergency department visits spiked during June heatwave in US Northwest</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Heatwave Sets Record Temperatures In Portland" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/If6tRxG9iqPVqVRsNxXRd9_fLhM=/0x0:2500x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69591227/1233703730.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="E6ROSc"&gt;The heatwave that scorched the Pacific Northwest in late June resulted in an enormous surge in emergency department (ED) visits in the region, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7029e1.htm#:~:text=Record%20high%20temperatures%20are%20occurring,States%20each%20year%20(2)."&gt;new analysis from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. There were 1,038 heat-related visits to the emergency department during the peak of the heatwave on June 28th in “region 10” — which includes Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Alaska. In shocking comparison, there were just nine similar ED visits in the region on the same day in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bqKjln"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Northwest was home to a disproportionate number of emergency department visits&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mVOQLl"&gt;While much of the West was suffering through sweltering heat in June, the Northwest was home to a disproportionate number of emergency department visits. Region 10 accounted for 15 percent of ED visits nationwide, although it only makes up 4 percent of the population in the US. The daily average for the number of heat-related emergency room visits was actually 69 times higher this year from June 25th–30th compared to the same time period in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t7qUcg"&gt;The severity of the heat was found to be “&lt;a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/western-north-american-extreme-heat-virtually-impossible-without-human-caused-climate-change/"&gt;virtually impossible&lt;/a&gt;” without climate change, a recent analysis found. The crisis shows how typically cool to tepid regions like the Pacific Northwest might struggle to adapt to extreme heat as climate change tests cities’ limits. Roadways &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22559961/heat-roads-washington-oregon-climate-infrastructure"&gt;buckled&lt;/a&gt; and power cables &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/dangerous-heat-wave-is-literally-melting-critical-infra-1847186624"&gt;melted&lt;/a&gt; because infrastructure wasn’t built to withstand the heat. Just a third of homes in the Seattle area have air conditioning, a &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/data/seattle-is-least-air-conditioned-metro-area-in-the-u-s-census-data-show-so-how-do-locals-keep-cool/"&gt;2018 study&lt;/a&gt; found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hpJf8J"&gt;“You get acclimated to warm in the summer, but that’s only if you’re used to experiencing those conditions. This could be very unlike any other heatwave they’ve experienced,” National Weather Service forecaster David Roth &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22547454/2021-heat-wave-temperature-high-heat-dome"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last month&lt;/a&gt;. “So yeah, you would worry more about heat exhaustion, heat stroke, that sort of thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N6SBRL"&gt;The new CDC data doesn’t even fully show the toll that extreme heat has had on the Northwest recently. Since its data was limited to emergency departments, it didn’t document people who might have sought help elsewhere — meaning its figures probably underestimate how widespread heat-related illness really was. The searing heatwave was also linked to hundreds of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jul/08/pacific-northwest-heatwave-deaths"&gt;deaths&lt;/a&gt; across the Northwestern US and British Columbia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OdG3Zq"&gt;Another heatwave is &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/07/14/western-heat-wave-rockies/"&gt;forecast&lt;/a&gt; to hit the Western US and Canada this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iLUz2a"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UPwQI8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5I2RUr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Netflix turned a slasher trilogy into a summer movie moment</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wcZltXgsZf_KuKGOZtwe0XXFdFw=/669x0:2931x1508/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69590973/Fear_Street_Part_3__1666_01_25_50_18r_rgb.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kiana Madeira and Gillian Jacobs in Fear Street Part 3: 1666.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nLpAf0"&gt;In order to keep her roles straight, &lt;em&gt;Fear Street &lt;/em&gt;star Kiana Madeira kept a big Five Star binder with her on set at most times. As part of the experimental slasher trilogy from Netflix, Madeira played two different roles across three movies, each set in a different time period. To make matters even more challenging, the schedule was incredibly compact: all three films were shot together over just a few months. So her binder served a crucial role. Inside were all three scripts, and she would write in it constantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mnCRy0"&gt;“Every time we finished a scene, I would make notes about how it went, how my character was feeling, how I was feeling, what I think we ended with in terms of the tone and the trajectory of the story,” she says. “My binder really helped keep me organized and on that path.” The binder even stayed in character; to go along with the first movie’s ’90s setting, she decorated it with images from old magazines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b4FgSK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fear Street&lt;/em&gt; represents something new for Netflix, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22559554/fear-street-trilogy-netflix-horror-movie-binge"&gt;a chance to merge the bingeable nature of streaming TV with a summer horror movie&lt;/a&gt;. Based on the young adult book series by R.L. Stine, the movies tell an interconnected story about a haunted town that spans generations, starting with the ’90s, before moving to the 1970s and, finally, 1666. To make the trilogy an event, Netflix devised an interesting release strategy: new movies were released on a weekly basis for three straight weeks throughout July, with the final chapter out today.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zQ85Jy45MbmS9UVUKpxLz1b7lzI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22721533/Fear_Street_Part_3__1666_00_52_05_07r_rgb.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kiana Madeira in Fear Street Part 3: 1666.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="52sMU5"&gt;Leigh Janiak directed all three movies and says she was first approached to work on a &lt;em&gt;Fear Street&lt;/em&gt; series in 2017. Back then, the idea was vague; the producers originally wanted to film a trilogy all at once and then release them theatrically over the course of a year. Janiak was brought on board to help solidify the details of that vision. “It was really an exhaustive search to find the right person who had that clarity of vision and that work ethic and ambition that can carry a years-long process,” says &lt;em&gt;Fear Street&lt;/em&gt; producer Kori Adelson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ytulTg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I didn’t want it to feel like you &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; watch this next movie because you didn’t get any answers.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bhlkeP"&gt;Janiak says she was excited about the concept, but quickly realized the challenge: “I was like, ‘How the hell do we actually do this?’” The answer, it seems, was preparation. “I was living in these movies for a good year and a half, two years, before we actually started shooting,” she explains. That included creating a TV-style writer’s room, where a group hashed out the plot and figured out ways to connect the three films in a way that made sense. The main focus, she says, was making sure each move could stand on its own while also working within the larger narrative arc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pd6HBu"&gt;“The biggest thing that I was thinking about was how do you keep an audience feeling like they’re satisfied with each movie, but still wanting to learn more in a way that they don’t feel like it’s a trick. There was a lot of time thinking about the ends of movie one and movie two,” Janiak explains. “I didn’t want it to feel like you &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; watch this next movie because you didn’t get any answers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYlc2d"&gt;All of that preparation and worldbuilding came in handy when production began. The three movies were filmed over a 106-day span in Atlanta. Because some actors had recurring roles or played multiple characters, the films were shot out of order in the name of efficiency: &lt;em&gt;1994&lt;/em&gt; was done first, followed by &lt;em&gt;1666&lt;/em&gt;, and then &lt;em&gt;1978&lt;/em&gt;. Madeira’s roles were particularly important; she played the hero, Deena, in the ’90s as well as a prominent role in the 1600s. (Saying any more would be a spoiler.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VctvQa"&gt;Part of that focus on efficiency meant being economical with things like reusing sets. As one example, there’s a mall that prominently features in multiple movies. It helped build visual parallels and connections between the different films but also ”created an effective production plan,” as Adelson describes it. “It was actually really smooth considering how much we had to do,” adds Madeira.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ODfBr7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dj3CXY8rKuY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IATF0o"&gt;It was an exhaustive process that frequently included filming days that lasted 12 hours or more. But Madeira believes that being so immersed in the world and her characters helped improve her performance. “I think because the experience was so condensed, and we shot them all back-to-back, we were just in it from the beginning to the end,” she says. “We didn’t have time to check out of the experience. I was really able to keep that intensity throughout, whereas I think if we had time in between, I would’ve maybe over-thought it. We didn’t have time to do any of that.” Janiak describes those few months as “like living in a black hole; there’s no past, there’s no future, there’s just &lt;em&gt;Fear Street&lt;/em&gt; in this moment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yTSHQ3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s no past, there’s no future, there’s just &lt;em&gt;Fear Street&lt;/em&gt; in this moment.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1gCRvG"&gt;The final piece of the puzzle was figuring out a release strategy. Though it was originally slated for theaters, eventually, the trilogy was picked up by Netflix, which created more opportunities to experiment. “It felt very freeing to be at a place where they aren’t beholden to these old rules,” says Janiak. The idea was to create a moment by utilizing the seemingly disparate concepts of appointment viewing and binge-watching. In practice, that meant giving each movie some space, while also ensuring that viewers could get to the next installment relatively quickly. “We felt like a week was the exact right period between films where we could keep our momentum but not cannibalize the film before it,” says Adelson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gUmpeM"&gt;As more and more companies move into streaming and the future of theaters remains a question mark, it’s likely we’ll see similar kinds of experimentation for new movies and series. For Janiak, despite all of the work involved in crafting &lt;em&gt;Fear Street&lt;/em&gt;, it’s something she’d like to try again in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DFThJF"&gt;“I am not a mother myself, but other women who I know that are have spoken to me about labor, and childbirth. It’s terrible but then you have this kid and a week later you’re like, ‘Oh, I should do this again.’ I feel like I’ve now finished the labor part of it, and we’re in the first weeks after,” she says. “It really was very challenging, but it was such a cool, fun opportunity that I probably would do it again. I can’t believe I’m saying that out loud. But yes, I think I would.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber agrees to reduced fine in fight over sexual assault data</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZqQsMUS2tzzivbkH0bk-4R_UnxU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69590958/acastro_180927_1777_uber_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EB49rt"&gt;Uber has agreed to pay $9 million to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) after refusing to hand over data about riders and drivers who were sexually assaulted, and pay a separate $150,000 fine, according to a settlement agreement reached Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ruvrMN"&gt;The CPUC will give $5 million of that money to the California Victim Compensation Fund, and the remaining $4 million will “go to address physical and sexual violence in the passenger carrier industry,” according to &lt;em&gt;The San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;, which reported on the agreement Thursday. Uber will also now provide data about the assaults to the CPUC, though it will remove any potentially identifying information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8dqgoF"&gt;The CPUC &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174943/uber-sexual-assault-fine-california-public-utility-commission-report-59-million"&gt;originally fined Uber $59 million in December 2020&lt;/a&gt; and threatened to suspend its license to operate in the state after the company failed to answer questions about a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20997939/uber-safety-report-2018-sexual-assault-ride-hailing-platform-stats"&gt;damning safety report&lt;/a&gt; it published the year prior. That 84-page report included aggregate data about thousands of sexual assaults in the US in 2017 and 2018 during trips taken with the company’s ride-hailing service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3cZ6n"&gt;Uber called the report “jarring,” but declined to provide more specific information about the assaults when the CPUC came asking. The CPUC also wanted to know more information about who at the company authored the report, especially because Uber admitted in the fine print that it did not “assess or take any position on whether any of the reported incidents actually occurred.” (The CPUC has regulatory authority over transportation companies in California and regularly investigates complaints against them.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NeiwXX"&gt;Uber refused to answer the CPUC’s questions and hand over the data on the grounds that it would put sexual assault survivors at risk. It appealed the CPUC’s fine in January, calling the $59 million fine “extraordinary” and claiming that the CPUC was “penaliz[ing] Uber for its good-faith efforts to stand with survivors.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Automattic, owner of Tumblr and WordPress.com, buys podcast app Pocket Casts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fOgkSVy6eVoKp8os6cZgmcBBBP4=/0x0:2044x1363/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69590761/pocket_casts.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Pocket Casts&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OcKBl0"&gt;Pocket Casts has a new owner. Automattic, which runs WordPress.com and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/14/20804894/tumblr-acquisition-matt-mullenweg-ceo-automattic-wordpress-verizon-changes-vergecast"&gt;recently purchased Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://wordpress.com/blog/2021/07/16/popular-podcast-app-pocket-casts-joins-automattic/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; today that it’s acquired Pocket Casts, the well-regarded podcast app. The blog post announcing the purchase didn’t offer much in the way of a preview, but it did tease potential future integrations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fLt6aV"&gt;“As part of Automattic, Pocket Casts will continue to provide you with the features needed to enjoy your favorite podcasts (or find something new),” the post states. “We will explore building deep integrations with WordPress.com and Pocket Casts, making it easier to distribute and listen to podcasts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dn415Z"&gt;Pocket Casts launched in 2010 and &lt;a href="https://blog.shiftyjelly.com/2018/05/04/the-next-chapter/"&gt;sold to&lt;/a&gt; NPR and a group of other public media groups eight years later. It’s been well-received, particularly from sites like &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, because it’s available across platforms. It started monetizing through a program called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20870656/pocket-casts-plus-podcast-app-subscription-update-price"&gt;Pocket Casts Plus&lt;/a&gt;, which charges users a monthly subscription fee for features like desktop app access and a standalone Apple Watch app, in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cmRiUy"&gt;Pocket Casts &lt;a href="https://current.org/2021/01/public-media-owners-agree-to-sell-pocket-casts-podcast-platform/"&gt;initially&lt;/a&gt; went up for sale in January after its board of public media members voted to do so. The app, which is free to download, was losing money, and NPR &lt;a href="https://current.org/2021/01/public-media-owners-agree-to-sell-pocket-casts-podcast-platform/"&gt;reportedly lost&lt;/a&gt; $800,000 on it last year. We’ve reached out to Automattic for comment on how it plans to monetize the app, as well as to learn more about whether it’s keeping all of the Pocket Cast employees on full-time. We’ll update if we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Z8KAD7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Pocket Casts went up for sale in January&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iGopNT"&gt;Interestingly, the Spotify-owned app Anchor &lt;a href="https://wordpress.com/blog/2021/02/22/turn-your-wordpress-com-blog-into-a-podcast-with-anchor/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a partnership with WordPress.com in February this year, which allows people to turn blog posts into audio content with a few clicks. Although the feature relies on text-to-speech technology, which isn’t as personal and human-sounding as, well, a real human, the broad idea clearly speaks to WordPress’ interest in helping bloggers communicate through podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gyhqb7"&gt;Presumably, it’ll keep building on that vision with its Pocket Casts acquisition. Although Pocket Casts is a listening app, it’s also well-known for its discovery features and curation. It’s possible Automattic could push people toward content from its WordPress users. &lt;/p&gt;
