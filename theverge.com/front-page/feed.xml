    <title>Basecamp implodes as employees flee company, including senior staff</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jZLm_mGAkyY8ErX3pKUIEZ1WVgg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69214523/acastro_210427_4564_basecamp_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Rsb258"&gt;After a controversial blog post in which &lt;a href="https://world.hey.com/jason/changes-at-basecamp-7f32afc5"&gt;CEO Jason Fried outlined Basecamp’s new philosophy&lt;/a&gt; that prohibited, among other things, “societal and political discussions” on internal forums, company co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson said the company would offer generous severance packages to anyone who disagreed with the new stance. On Friday, it appears a large number of Basecamp employees are taking Hansson up on his offer: according to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;contributing editor Casey Newton’s sources, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1388212468510380034?s=20"&gt;roughly a third&lt;/a&gt; of the company’s 57 employees accepted buyouts today. As of Friday afternoon, 18 people had tweeted they were planning to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imvU5z"&gt;Not long after Fried’s Monday blog post went public — and was revised several times amid public backlash online — Hansson outlined the terms of the new severance offer &lt;a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/let-it-all-out-78485e8e"&gt;in a separate Wednesday blog post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="fCHjvm"&gt;Yesterday, we offered everyone at Basecamp an option of a severance package worth up to six months salary for those who’ve been with the company over three years, and three months salary for those at the company less than that. No hard feelings, no questions asked. For those who cannot see a future at Basecamp under this new direction, we’ll help them in every which way we can to land somewhere else. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="LzeYE9"&gt;Among those who announced on Twitter they’re leaving the company are reportedly &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ThatDetroitAndy/status/1388195273336401920?s=20"&gt;head of marketing Andy Didorosi&lt;/a&gt;, head of design &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jonasdowney/status/1388205182916440070?s=20"&gt;Jonas Downey&lt;/a&gt;, and head of customer support &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kikiaards/status/1388208900608954371?s=20"&gt;Kristin Aardsma&lt;/a&gt;. Most cited “recent changes” at the company as their reason for leaving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="swCiZ4"&gt;“Given the recent changes at Basecamp, I’ve decided to leave my job as Head of Design,” Downey tweeted. “I’ve helped design &amp;amp; build all of our products since 2011, and recently I’ve been leading our design team too.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yqhXIP"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I resigned today from my role as Head of Marketing at Basecamp due to recent changes and new policies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'll be returning to entrepreneurship.

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;After nearly 8 years, given the recent changes at Basecamp, I’ve decided to leave my job as an Android programmer there. Will eventually be looking for something new, so please feel free to reach out / RT. DMs open.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank you all for your support and kindness. It means a lot. ❤️&lt;/p&gt;— Dan Kim (@dankim) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dankim/status/1388210746585198596?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RMdmo5"&gt;Software developer John Breen is tracking additional Basecamp departures &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_breeeeen_/status/1388198260603506693?s=20"&gt;in this Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mmuCEA"&gt;The original blog post that started the brouhaha at the tiny company with an outsized voice also detailed how Basecamp would do away with “paternalistic benefits,” committees, and would prohibit “lingering or dwelling on past decisions.” But it was the “societal and political discussions” item that stirred up the most reaction: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="HFRQ9e"&gt;Today’s social and political waters are especially choppy. Sensitivities are at 11, and every discussion remotely related to politics, advocacy, or society at large quickly spins away from pleasant. You shouldn’t have to wonder if staying out of it means you’re complicit, or wading into it means you’re a target. These are difficult enough waters to navigate in life, but significantly more so at work. It’s become too much. It’s a major distraction. It saps our energy, and redirects our dialog towards dark places. It’s not healthy, it hasn’t served us well. And we’re done with it on our company Basecamp account where the work happens. People can take the conversations with willing co-workers to Signal, Whatsapp, or even a personal Basecamp account, but it can’t happen where the work happens anymore&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="oJ18j0"&gt;While the company argued that it was just trying to get its own employees focused on work, company founders don’t tend to shy away from “societal and political discussions” online, with Hansson in particular having become a vocal critic of Apple’s App Store policies, to the point that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276511/north-dakota-senate-bill-2333-apple-google-app-store-antitrust-monopoly"&gt;he has testified&lt;/a&gt; in favor of antitrust regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d104Vi"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406673/basecamp-political-speech-policy-controversy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; later reported&lt;/a&gt;, the initial motivation for the letter stemmed from internal disagreement over a controversial list of “funny names” of Basecamp customers. Several of the names on the list, which resurfaced several times over the years and of which management was well aware, were of Asian or African origin. Employees considered their inclusion inappropriate at best, and racist at worst. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OchrrX"&gt;Hansson acknowledged the list and tried to move on (you can read his internal communications &lt;a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/let-it-all-out-78485e8e"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), but employees pressed the issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A9hLZE"&gt;Hansson did not reply to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge o&lt;/em&gt;n Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku and YouTube TV are now in an all-out public showdown</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gSjC9gG1SOL_DAaI5AM39i2UlfI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69214294/acastro_180806_1777_youtube_cancel_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4K8qRf"&gt;On Friday morning, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22411711/roku-removes-youtube-tv-channel-store"&gt;Roku pulled YouTube TV from its channel store&lt;/a&gt;. Its removal came after Roku’s distribution agreement for the app expired and negotiations between it and Google fell apart without any new deal in sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gole8M"&gt;The popular streaming hardware maker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403740/roku-youtube-tv-google-standoff-competition-negotiations-contract"&gt;warned customers of this outcome&lt;/a&gt; earlier in the week, claiming that Google was demanding unrealistic terms to renew YouTube TV’s slot on the platform. Those asks, according to Roku, included access to sensitive customer data and an apparent commitment from Roku to support AV1 decoding in future products. That requires extra hardware that Roku maintains could increase the cost of its devices. Roku also says that Google is trying to have changes made to Roku’s search feature, an assertion that Google has strongly denied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJOHay"&gt;The war of words has quickly gotten intense, with Roku noting the antitrust investigations that Google currently faces and framing this standoff as another example of the company wielding its “monopoly position.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YIfay8"&gt;On the other side, Google has pointed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21324139/peacock-roku-amazon-fire-tv-hbo-max-streaming-warnermedia-nbcuniversal-disney-apple"&gt;Roku’s recent spats with HBO Max, Peacock&lt;/a&gt;, and others as a clear, growing trend of Roku abusing its huge market share and influential presence in the living room. “Roku terminated our deal in bad faith amidst our negotiation,” the company said on its YouTube TV blog. “Unfortunately, Roku has often engaged in this tactic with other streaming providers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qx00vX"&gt;The back-and-forth is reminiscent of the carriage disputes that regularly happen between cable companies and TV network owners. But this is a much more 2021 version, and Roku is squaring off with a tech giant that doesn’t seem to be in any hurry to back down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gPFv9L"&gt;Here’s a rundown of how the relationship between the two companies quickly spiraled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EGL21X"&gt;Roku and YouTube TV dispute timeline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="kWAH2L"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 26th:&lt;/strong&gt; Roku sends an email to customers, explaining that it might soon have to remove YouTube TV. “Recent negotiations with Google to carry YouTube TV have broken down because Roku cannot accept Google’s unfair terms as we believe they could harm our users,” the company says. At the end of the email, Roku tells frustrated customers they should urge Google to make a deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8pwQO5"&gt;Google responds soon after, saying, “We’re disappointed that they chose to make baseless claims while we continue our ongoing negotiations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g7PlNe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 30th, 8:00AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt; YouTube TV is removed from the Roku channel store. Those who have already installed the app on a Roku device can continue using it, but new downloads are no longer possible. Subscriptions from within the YouTube TV app are also disabled. Roku sends another email to customers about the situation and urges them not to delete the YouTube TV app if they already have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J6I49N"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 30th 11:50AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt; Google strikes back at Roku &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/update-our-youtube-tv-members-roku/"&gt;with a blog post&lt;/a&gt; that accuses the company of underhanded negotiation tactics. “Our initial conversations started with Roku simply to renew the current terms of their ongoing deal with YouTube TV, which has been in place for several years. Our offer to Roku was simple and still stands: renew the YouTube TV deal under the existing reasonable terms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X8pRXh"&gt;Google criticizes Roku for unnecessarily bringing the flagship YouTube app into negotiation talks; the deal for that app doesn’t expire until December. But Google tacitly acknowledges it’s pushing Roku to adopt the AV1 codec, saying, “Our agreements with partners have technical requirements to ensure a high quality experience on YouTube.” The company again denies it has asked Roku for exclusive customer data or to change its search feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F79PoC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 30th 1:19PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt; Google tries to rally YouTube TV customers into its dispute with Roku. In an afternoon email, customers are encouraged to tweet at Roku and contact the company in other ways to voice their support for YouTube TV staying on the platform. Google reminds customers of fallback methods for viewing YouTube TV, including casting and using other streaming devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wD2I96"&gt;What are Roku and Google fighting over?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="sJXTQG"&gt;Roku claims that Google is making demands on several fronts. It’s accusing the company of trying to muck with its search results, strong-arming Roku into supporting AV1, and asking for a deeper layer of customer data that other streaming apps don’t have access to. “We simply cannot agree to terms that would manipulate consumer search results, inflate the cost of our products, and violate established industry data practices,” Roku said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9GxWIH"&gt;Google has flatly denied trying to interfere with search or demanding a special view into customer data. Its statements portray Roku as a bully in streaming hardware that’s angling for “special treatment” that other YouTube partners don’t receive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wanGJy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protocol’s&lt;/em&gt; Janko Roettgers &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/youtube-tv-roku-issues"&gt;covers the AV1 codec situation nicely&lt;/a&gt; here. Google has been pushing Android TV device makers and smart TV manufacturers to build in support for AV1 decoding. YouTube is a hugely popular app, so Google has quite the bargaining chip. AV1 is a more efficient codec for high-resolution video streaming in 4K HDR and 8K, but it requires hardware for decoding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aAX6nI"&gt;The bit of irony in all this is that Google’s own $50 Chromecast with Google TV does not currently include hardware-based AV1 decoding. So Roku is upset Google wants it to “accept hardware requirements that would increase consumer costs.” Roku’s cheapest streaming players still undercut the Chromecast by as much as $30. If the price of those goes up, Roku loses a key advantage over the competition. But there’s no denying that these disputes between Roku and content providers are becoming more frequent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yOrOj5"&gt;We’ll have to see how long this feud continues on for. For the sake of paying YouTube TV subscribers, hopefully it won’t stretch out too far. But based on today’s comments, it seems like the rift between Roku and Google is only growing deeper.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instacart shoppers say their accounts were wrongly deactivated</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2FgVPbtBg1L7Qd68RFzCHgkZhm0=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69213953/instacart_shopper_produce.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Instacart&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YURJhx"&gt;Some Instacart shoppers claim that the company has wrongfully terminated their accounts in response to fraudulent activity, locking them out of future earnings until they get reactivated, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/30/tech/instacart-deactivations/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNN Business&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xq8mB5"&gt;The shoppers &lt;em&gt;CNN Business&lt;/em&gt; spoke to were identified as having “linked accounts,” which, in Instacart’s terminology, means an account believed to have indicators of fraud, though not necessarily with compromised data connected to a shopper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="z4Hh8v"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The shoppers may be the victims of phishing scams&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N6dclF"&gt;The company offers a process for appealing deactivations, but at least one of the shoppers &lt;em&gt;CNN Business&lt;/em&gt; spoke to, Rachael Freedman, still hasn’t had her account reactivated because her appeal was denied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wwtcL3"&gt;Instacart didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment on Friday. The company did tell &lt;em&gt;CNN&lt;/em&gt; that “We take the safety and security of the Instacart platform very seriously,” but that “there has not been a breach or hack of the Instacart platform.” The company says it has measures in place for workers who’ve been the victim of a phishing scam to get back into their accounts “in a timely manner.” It’s not clear why that hasn’t applied to Freedman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T4N3RE"&gt;The scam that Instacart workers described sounds similar to an issue &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409937/scammers-hack-target-gig-workers-drain-bank-accounts"&gt;Target’s Shipt gig workers&lt;/a&gt; encountered. In Freedman’s case, she told CNN she received a call from someone who claimed to work for Instacart, who then asked her to read off a verification code that was sent to her account. Not long after she shared her information, she was locked out. It appears the scammer changed the password to her account — again, very similar to what Shipt shoppers described, except in her case, Instacart responded by deactivating Freedman’s account completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="zuW3uv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The human cost of Instacart’s grocery delivery","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21267669/instacart-shoppers-sick-extended-pay-quarantine-leave-coronavirus"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="qWraZO"&gt;Instacart cautions shoppers against sharing their information with anyone who identifies themselves as an Instacart employee outside of its official channels, like the app or its 24/7 shopper chat. The pandemic has made grocery delivery a crucial service, but the ease with which workers can have their income affected through no fault of their own illustrates how vulnerable gig workers like Instacart shoppers are. In addition to working on the front lines during a pandemic, last year, Instacart shoppers reportedly had to deal with some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/10/21216317/instacart-tip-baiting-grocery-employees-delivery-pandemic"&gt;customers baiting larger orders with even larger tips&lt;/a&gt;, only to have those tips shrink upon delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dpFjwT"&gt;Gig workers like Instacart shoppers typically lack the job stability and workplace protections that full-time employees enjoy.  At least one Biden administration official has said it’s time to &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/4/29/22409952/labor-secretary-gig-workers-uber-lyft-employees-contractors"&gt;reclassify gig workers as employees&lt;/a&gt;, which would alleviate some of the uncertainty. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>If your paycheck is missing, QuickBooks may be to blame</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="(Flickr) American money" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/in0aLzCo3GUo-oekdyrUkRJWom0=/0x43:1024x726/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69213746/4603130687_d0a0862bc4_b.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Flickr&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ckgTym"&gt;Due to an issue with QuickBooks processing direct deposits, some people had a very unpleasant morning, waking up to see either that their paycheck hadn’t arrived, or that they had a ton of employees asking why they hadn’t been paid. If you’re one of those people, it may not be time to panic just yet — &lt;a href="http://status.quickbooks.intuit.com/incidents/jnhwslhtskgd"&gt;QuickBooks says&lt;/a&gt; that the issue has been resolved and that the money &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/QuickBooks/status/1388174723079495685?s=20"&gt;should be arriving in accounts&lt;/a&gt; by the end of today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q3h1TZ"&gt;QuickBooks claims the missed payments were caused by an issue with a third party. Some users, though, are upset with how Intuit, which owns QuickBooks, handled the situation, claiming that they couldn’t get a hold of the company on their phone or chat lines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Y4WL4T"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;What the heck &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/QuickBooks?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@QuickBooks&lt;/a&gt;. My employees need to get paid. Fix your stuff ASAP. Nobody is answering the phones or helping in the chat. Been on hold for 2 hours now.&lt;/p&gt;— Ashwin Chary (@CharyAshwin) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CharyAshwin/status/1388135526155292677?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/QuickBooks?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@QuickBooks&lt;/a&gt; I almost got fired by my boss because he thinks I forgot to run payroll. Fun way to wake up. At least update your phone lines and websites to let us know it’s a known issue. I waited 30 minutes before I thought “let me see what’s trending on Twitter”.&lt;/p&gt;— Michael (@CardinalMike08) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CardinalMike08/status/1388129602917306368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u2tODA"&gt;QuickBooks told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it’s working on communicating with “impacted customers,” but it’s definitely not the type of situation you want to deal with on a Friday morning, especially one on the 30th — if you’re an employee, you probably have a bunch of bills coming due, and if you’re an employer, you probably don’t want all your workers mad at you because of a computer glitch that’s not your fault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RlRqdj"&gt;If you’ve been impacted and still haven’t seen payment by the end of the day, you can let &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; know by emailing tips@theverge.com.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vergecast: iOS 14.5 features, Apple sales skyrocket, and podcasting </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/49IftTcv4YejD0OvTXvVkauQc2U=/0x0:1224x816/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69213471/fbpodcasts.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sFXTBx"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where host Nilay Patel discusses the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o2IYZK"&gt;This week on &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;, Nilay brings in &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; deputy editor Dan Seifert and news editor Chaim Gartenberg to discuss the features added in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403554/apple-ios-ipados-14-5-now-available-iphone-unlock-face-mask-app-tracking"&gt;Apple’s iOS update to 14.5&lt;/a&gt;, Apple and other tech companies’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407894/apple-q2-2021-earnings-iphone-ipad-mac"&gt;skyrocketing&lt;/a&gt; earnings despite the ongoing pandemic, and how the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22368552/global-chip-shortage-end-tsmc-samsung-ps5-supply-demand-intel"&gt;global semiconductor shortage&lt;/a&gt; is affecting the tech industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UFFObc"&gt;Later in the show, senior reporter Ashley Carman runs through the recent developments in podcasting platforms. At an event last week, Apple announced a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22381980/apple-podcasts-app-subscriptions-new-design"&gt;subscription feature within Apple Podcasts&lt;/a&gt; for creators to offer to their listeners. Ashley discusses the audio product developments announced this week from competitor companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22404273/spotify-podcast-subscriptions-monetize-subscriber-shows"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403617/facebook-podcast-player-release-in-app-pages"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403852/siriusxm-roman-mars-99-percent-invisible-acquire-stitcher"&gt;SiriusXM&lt;/a&gt;, and what this may mean for podcast creators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zmxql9"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP5942362223&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EbKZDJ"&gt;There’s a whole lot more in between all of that — like Samsung’s newly announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22405540/samsung-galaxy-book-pro-360-features-price-photos-video-release-date"&gt;Galaxy Book Pros&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22405894/epic-apple-store-fortnite-trial-kickoff-witnesses-list"&gt;upcoming trial between Epic Games and Apple&lt;/a&gt; — so listen here or in your preferred podcast player to hear the full discussion. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hulu’s live TV service is finally getting Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, MTV, and other ViacomCBS channels today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jH6yVvT3vKKZ6-fN5I-J-W8ZWhU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69213191/acastro_200320_1777_huluStock_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EUvGXu"&gt;Hulu’s live TV service is finally getting nine new ViacomCBS channels — Comedy Central, BET, Nickelodeon, Nick Jr., VH1, CMT, MTV, TV Land, and Paramount Network — as part of its regular $64.99 per month cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OPAMMd"&gt;If that sounds familiar, it’s because &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212874/hulu-live-tv-channels-nickelodeon-mtv-bet-comedy-central-viacomcbs"&gt;Hulu first announced&lt;/a&gt; that these channels would be coming to its service on January 4th, almost four months ago. But despite the long gap, the new channels are finally debuting for subscribers today. Customers who pay for Hulu’s live TV service will also get on-demand access to additional ViacomCBS library titles, including  &lt;em&gt;Freaks and Geeks&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Moesha, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Sister, Sister&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;starting today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ocAJnL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A long wait, but Hulu customers can finally watch MTV&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PykPym"&gt;Other ViacomCBS channels — BETher, MTV2, NickToons, TeenNick, and MTV Classic – will also be available for Hulu’s live TV customers starting today, but only through &lt;a href="https://help.hulu.com/s/article/entertainment-add-on?language=en_US&amp;amp;u1=VergeHulusLiveTVService043021"&gt;Hulu’s $7.99 per month Entertainment package&lt;/a&gt;, which also includes channels like CNBC World, the Cooking Channel, and Discovery Family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6G08g3"&gt;Hulu isn’t announcing any price hikes to go with the new channels at this time: the basic live TV service will still cost $64.99 per month (which the company has charged for the service since its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570259/hulu-live-tv-price-increase-cable-sports-news-virtual-bundle-disney"&gt;$10 price increase last November&lt;/a&gt;.) That price also puts Hulu’s live TV service at exactly the same starting point as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308449/youtube-tv-price-increase-64-99-viacom-hbo-new-channels"&gt;Google’s YouTube TV&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g7tazG"&gt;That said, there’s a strong possibility that Hulu could raise prices in the future to help cover the new ViacomCBS channels, similar to YouTube TV (which increased its price from $50 per month to $65 per month last summer after it added ViacomCBS’ lineup.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>English soccer teams have started a four-day social media boycott to protest online abuse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Manchester City v Tottenham Hotspur - Carabao Cup Final" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pjjs1AXZgiVT8qmeAXMBw8TUTIw=/0x0:3739x2493/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69212943/1314373970.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Flathers/Manchester City FC via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="axFjtB"&gt;English soccer teams and organizations &lt;a href="https://www.thefa.com/news/2021/apr/24/english-football-social-media-boycott-20210424"&gt;are all shutting down their Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram accounts&lt;/a&gt; for the weekend as part of a massive social media blackout to advocate for better policies regarding discrimination and abuse that players and members of clubs receive on those platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tdRnyf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;English football will unite for a social media boycott from 3pm on Friday 30 April to 11:59pm on Monday 3 May, in response to the ongoing and sustained discriminatory abuse received online by players and many others connected to the game.&lt;a href="https://t.co/GYTAuWAEgN"&gt;https://t.co/GYTAuWAEgN&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/dNLuv62nw5"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dNLuv62nw5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— FA Spokesperson (@FAspokesperson) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FAspokesperson/status/1386062441654759424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FogyQu"&gt;Groups participating in the blackout include &lt;a href="https://www.premierleague.com/NoRoomForRacism"&gt;the Premier League&lt;/a&gt;, the English Football League, the Professional Footballers’ Association, the Football Association, the League Managers Association, the Football Supporters’ Association, and more. Clubs that are part of the Premier League, EFL, Barclays FA Women’s Super League, and Women’s Championship will all be shutting down their social channels over the weekend as part of the protest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bbO81y"&gt;The blackout comes after the various English soccer organizations banded together in February to request changes from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey &lt;a href="https://www.thefa.com/news/2021/feb/11/letter-to-facebook-and-twitter-20210211"&gt;in an open letter&lt;/a&gt; requesting that the companies take stronger action against discriminatory and racist comments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SLvVHG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We are switching off our social media channels from 3pm on Friday 30 April, until 23:59pm on Monday 3 May, in response to sustained and ongoing online abuse.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Enough?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Enough&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StopOnlineAbuse?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#StopOnlineAbuse&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/toiIg3FfWW"&gt;pic.twitter.com/toiIg3FfWW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Raheem Sterling (@sterling7) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sterling7/status/1388131029718798338?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IGObZp"&gt;Specifically, the soccer groups advocated for four improvements: that posts be blocked or filtered if they contain racist or discriminatory material; that abusive posts be removed through “robust, transparent, and swift measures”; the addition of improved verification processes to allow for law enforcement to identify users and to stop abusive posters from making new accounts; and that the platforms work closer with law enforcement groups to identify people posting discriminatory content in cases where it breaks the law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wrPR09"&gt;The leagues hope this weekend’s boycott will build on that movement, noting that while progress has been made, players, teams, and other members of the English football world still feel that there’s a lot more that Facebook and Twitter could do to help stop internet abuse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jNiPMp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LdBIFK"&gt;We’re just a week out from the release of &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt;, and as part of the game’s promotional campaign, Capcom has uploaded an absolute treat to the YouTube channel for &lt;em&gt;Biohazard&lt;/em&gt; (which is the name of the &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; series in Japan): &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/7-Bq9nV-uHg"&gt;an official puppet show starring characters from the game&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Yes, everyone’s favorite tall vampire lady, Lady Dimitrescu, is one of the puppets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UOhY13"&gt;The three-minute video is simultaneously adorable and terrifying. The show is entirely in Japanese, so I don’t have any idea what the actual story is — I think all of the puppets are meeting up to paint together, using blood as the ink? But it’s worth watching for some seriously silly puppet antics, like puppet-Lady Dimitrescu gleefully gulping down a bucket of blood. And the video’s title suggests this is just the first episode, &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-village-makes-for-a-delightfully-demented-1846795680"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so it appears there’s more to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0C3xQZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt; will launch on May 7th for PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X / S, PC, and Stadia. The game’s final demo will unlock in North America tomorrow, May 1st, at 8PM ET, and Capcom &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404242/resident-evil-village-final-demo-week-vampire-werewolf"&gt;recently extended its availability&lt;/a&gt; so you can play it through May 9th at 8PM ET. Once you start the demo, though, you only have 60 minutes to play it.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>10 percent of you will be Goblinized today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Shadowrun Trilogy" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sFdY6gUxXl3ALJa0IhES7AuvJ64=/1x0:928x618/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69212829/shadowrunork.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Harebrained Schemes&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CfTkeT"&gt;I woke up feeling a little strange this morning, but I didn’t think much of it. It’s just another day living in the pandemic. But after I got some strange looks at the cafe, I started to get a little worried. On my way home, I took a sip of my coffee and somehow pierced through the paper cup with bottom fangs that I didn’t have yesterday. I ran to the bathroom mirror when I got inside, only to discover that I’d turned into an ork. Awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OCgnNq"&gt;As decreed by the &lt;em&gt;Shadowrun &lt;/em&gt;lore (via Twitter user &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Gen_Ironicus/status/1388110456057999360"&gt;@Gen_Ironicus&lt;/a&gt;), April 30th, 2021 is the day of Goblinization. The &lt;a href="https://shadowrun.fandom.com/wiki/Goblinization"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shadowrun &lt;/em&gt;wiki over at &lt;em&gt;Fandom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;says that, today, 10 percent of the world’s population will be transformed into orks and trolls for no apparent reason. Guess I just got lucky!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKvJpk"&gt;I thought maybe Goblinization would primarily target people who had played the &lt;em&gt;Shadowrun &lt;/em&gt;tabletop RPG or the video games. I’ve only played the first-person shooter released in 2007 for the PC and Xbox 360, so I’m not the world’s biggest fan. But now that I’m an ork, perhaps I’ll give &lt;em&gt;Shadowrun: Dragonfall&lt;/em&gt; a try now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aFe316"&gt;If you aren’t currently feeling or noticing the transformation taking effect, don’t worry. It could happen later in the day. The lore says that most humans will change before “the very eyes of horrified spectators, causing much panic and alarm.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iH5iMr"&gt;And as if the COVID-19 pandemic weren’t enough, apparently Goblinization is the start of major strife between humans and the “&lt;a href="https://shadowrun.fandom.com/wiki/Metahumanity"&gt;metahumanity&lt;/a&gt;” created during today’s events. Perhaps worse, it’s said to eventually lead to the Coffee Famine of 2022. I don’t know if I’ll survive that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="liSdRE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Telecom groups sue New York over low-income broadband law</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TLuXQ8xj4fygvXeS0SyBMQTvaRY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69212795/acastro_180608_1777_net_neutrality_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yCLjSM"&gt;Trade groups representing some of the largest telecom companies, including AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon, are suing New York over a new state law forcing them to provide cheaper broadband plans for low-income families in the state, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/att-verizon-new-york-broadband-law-41448df8-370c-403a-8826-60159daf1877.html"&gt;as first reported by &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ELBJq4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22388184/new-york-affordable-internet-cost-low-income-price-cap-bill"&gt;Earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo signed a bill that would require internet service providers to offer a $15 a month broadband internet option for low-income consumers and families in the state. It’s one of the first laws in the country enforcing such a rule. But groups like USTelecom, CTIA, and the New York State Telecommunications Association argue that the state has no authority to set broadband prices and that the law could impair the companies’ abilities to upgrade their networks in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="y4mRWD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“While well-intended, this bill is preempted by federal law”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NrsFPx"&gt;“While well-intended, this bill is preempted by federal law and ignores the $50 monthly broadband discount recently enacted by Congress, as well as the many unprecedented commitments, donations and accommodations that broadband providers have made for low-income consumers since the pandemic began,” the coalition said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;Axios &lt;/em&gt;Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="acKujh"&gt;As of right now, some internet providers offer their own low-income options for consumers, but none of these programs are mandated by law. There are other subsidy programs like Lifeline offered by the Federal Communications Commission that help decrease the cost of connectivity for families. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qTrkRJ"&gt;In December, Congress approved &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22193133/us-coronavirus-covid-relief-stimulus-package-broadband-huawei-zte"&gt;over $3 billion&lt;/a&gt; to help consumers pay for internet service during the pandemic. The trade groups cite this law as a reason the New York broadband mandate goes too far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QgzCme"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="njwnEb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
