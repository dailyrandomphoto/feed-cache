    <title>Entire school board resigns in shame after forgetting their WebEx call was public</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d7rqhX"&gt;You would &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; the entire world would know how Zoom works by now. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/2/9/22274865/zoom-hearing-cat-filter-lawyer-texas-live-court-hearing"&gt;Lawyers can be cats&lt;/a&gt;, congressmen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276998/tom-emmer-coronavirus-relief-lawyer-cat-house-financial-services"&gt;are sometimes inverted&lt;/a&gt;, but pants are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; actually &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/reporter-no-pants-good-morning-america-gma-abc-coronavrius-quarantine_n_5ea84676c5b6c3fed182cebb"&gt;optional&lt;/a&gt;. That didn’t keep the Oakley Union Elementary School District’s board of trustees from badmouthing parents during a &lt;em&gt;public &lt;/em&gt;WebEx call — suggesting that parents just “want their babysitters back,” or want to go back to smoking marijuana (via &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/entire-california-school-board-resigns-after-chewing-ou-1846316976?rev=1613862062331&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Gizmodo&amp;amp;utm_content&amp;amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;amp;utm_source=facebook"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D6MUy1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;3) School Board Trustee Richie Masadas then appeared to link parents' frustration over close closures to drug use. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"My brother had a delivery service for medical marijuana and his clientele were parents of kids at school."&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nbcbayarea?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@nbcbayarea&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/vgAhY90lmG"&gt;pic.twitter.com/vgAhY90lmG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Bigad Shaban (@BigadShaban) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BigadShaban/status/1362547405212831753?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3OCjjR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3XaJHU7QlY"&gt;The full 8-minute video&lt;/a&gt; below isn’t quite as incendiary as the play-by-play makes it sound. It seems likely the board was just airing some general frustrations, unaware they were being watched. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQsZOZ"&gt;One even asked “Are we alone?” before telling the board how she felt about criticism from parents: “Bitch, if you’re going to call me out, I’m going to fuck you up.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jt1MM7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C3XaJHU7QlY?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fB9YlJ"&gt;Narrator: they weren’t alone. They were being recorded, it went viral, over 7,000 people &lt;a href="https://www.change.org/p/registrar-of-voters-contra-costa-county-recall-oakley-union-elementary-school-district-board/u/28581187"&gt;signed a petition&lt;/a&gt; asking them to resign, and that’s exactly what they did. Every single member has now resigned, according to &lt;a href="https://ouesd-ca.schoolloop.com/file/1500178971291/1563866277263/6727833713582977629.pdf"&gt;a letter from superintendent Greg Hetrick (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; — who was part of the call, by the way.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sophisticated hackers snuck sleeper malware into nearly 30,000 Macs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="It uses TouchID for biometrics. Overall the hardware is identical to the last model" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s6vt3HLWA4Y4aySCbtfWuJFY3b0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68852253/vpavic_4291_20201113_0429.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="avO70x"&gt;There’s a popular stereotype that Apple’s computers are largely immune to malware. Not only is &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/2/12/21134681/mac-pc-virus-malware-malwarebytes"&gt;is that incorrect&lt;/a&gt;, it appears that sophisticated hacker(s) might have been toying with the idea of a heist or drop nasty enough they’d have needed to cover their tracks. &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/02/new-malware-found-on-30000-macs-has-security-pros-stumped/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, security researchers at Malwarebytes and Red Canary discovered a mysterious piece of malware hiding on nearly 30,000 Macs, one designed to deliver an as-yet-unknown payload, and with a self-destruction mechanism that might remove any trace that it ever existed. They’re calling it Silver Sparrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pQyTEK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://redcanary.com/blog/clipping-silver-sparrows-wings/"&gt;Red Canary’s own blog post&lt;/a&gt; goes into more detail, including how they discovered multiple versions targeting not only Intel, but also newer Macs based on Apple’s own M1 chip — which is quite the thing, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;given how new Apple’s M1 computers are&lt;/a&gt; and how few vulnerabilities have been discovered yet. It was &lt;a href="https://objective-see.com/blog/blog_0x62.html"&gt;literally just one week ago&lt;/a&gt; that Objective-See security researcher Patrick Wardle published a story about the first piece of malware discovered in the wild targeting Apple Silicon, and now we have two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7EPGdK"&gt;Thankfully, Silver Sparrow was &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;able to cover its tracks before being outed, there’s no indication it was used to do any damage, and Red Canary writes that Apple has already revoked the binaries (which should theoretically keep you from accidentally installing it yourself). But the idea damage could have been done isn’t theoretical: they actually found these strains of malware on Macs in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BeOzBK"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Given all of this, Silver Sparrow is uniquely positioned to deliver a potentially impactful payload at a moment’s notice, so we wanted to share everything we know with the broader infosec community sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;— Red Canary (@redcanary) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/redcanary/status/1362558570601058305?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KJrIqw"&gt;Researchers warn that Apple’s transition from Intel to its own silicon may make it easy for other bad actors to slip malware through the cracks, too: you can read quotes from several of them &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-m1-malware/"&gt;in this &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung imagines how its first AR glasses might look in these leaked concept videos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ifoICACRqJ731TOl3RHV-_exFaw=/215x0:2345x1420/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68851905/samsung_glasses_lite_4.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="okxZs2"&gt;Samsung has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/2/21/14682126/samsung-c-lab-ar-vr-projects-mwc"&gt;toying with AR glasses for years&lt;/a&gt;, most recently trotting out an extremely basic set of image-projecting goggles &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21052028/samsung-ces-2020-press-conference-ballie-smart-cities-ai-supercut"&gt;on the CES 2020 stage&lt;/a&gt;, but I’ve never seen the company suggest it might like to build an actually ambitious augmented reality wearable computing device — until perhaps today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NuIZNS"&gt;WalkingCat, a fairly reliable source of gadget leaks, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_h0x0d_/status/1363394302336847878"&gt;has published two new concept videos&lt;/a&gt; that show off some of the fun things a pair of “Samsung Glasses Lite” could do, like projecting a giant virtual screen where you can play your games, letting you kick back in your private movie theater, give you a giant virtual computer monitor, fire up an auto-dimming “sunglasses mode,” or act as an instant first-person-view screen for your DJI drone, complete with telemetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WhkjYU"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://streamable.com/o/8xiot5" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xT213I"&gt;The second video shows off the very similar “Samsung AR Glasses” concept, though this time it’s letting the user “see” 3D digital objects appear in the real world, a visual that should be instantly familiar to you if you’ve ever seen any of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVXH5V8MVQo"&gt;Microsoft’s HoloLens marketing.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yhfvpd"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://streamable.com/o/znub5d" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G51HlO"&gt;If you’ve never tried a Microsoft HoloLens or Magic Leap, though, you should know that reality is a long ways away from the visualizations you see here. Today’s waveguides, lasers, projectors and micromirror combinations usually give you a pretty small field of view with see-through AR glasses like these. If you’re standing right next to a virtual computer monitor, you’d only be able to see part of it at a time — the rest would be out of your field of view. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ryVT1U"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;and..... this is the 3D holographic version &lt;a href="https://t.co/PXDAHjDNWb"&gt;https://t.co/PXDAHjDNWb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— WalkingCat (@_h0x0d_) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_h0x0d_/status/1363404172201132034?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rJYWtq"&gt;To me, the most interesting part of these videos is how Samsung imagines you’ll be using a smartwatch to navigate the interfaces. Short-term, that might be more realistic than trying to tap on things that don’t actually exist or make midair gestures with your hands, and smartwatch control is a paradigm that other companies working on AR headsets are no doubt considering. Apple has both a smartwatch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266190/apple-vr-headset-ar-glasses-8k-displays-cameras-hand-tracking-details-report"&gt;and an AR headset in development&lt;/a&gt;, of course, and the Facebook hardware division that’s building AR glasses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280798/facebook-smartwatch-messaging-health-fitness-release-date"&gt;is reportedly now working on a smartwatch, too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sTpWqE"&gt;Speaking of Samsung and smartwatches, two known leakers &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-android-smartwatch-183330688.html"&gt;are now saying&lt;/a&gt; Samsung may go back to Android for its next smartwatch, instead of its own Tizen platform it’s used for watches for years now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5kw0Dx"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="HoloLens 2: inside Microsoft's new headset|62360" data-volume-uuid="8839bbd74" data-volume-id="62360" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-1" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jzvsN1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U7jOre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1EDjlO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s Blade 15 Base is $500 off today, but this Asus Zephyrus G14 deal is the one I’d pick</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fr4-UXpYImSvDK6LZYSexG3w4Yg=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68851657/awhite_200319_3954_4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Avery White / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WdEbTi"&gt;Pop quiz: which is the better deal, $500 off a Razer Blade laptop, or $150 off an Asus Zephyrus G14? It might hinge on whether you need a webcam, because in practically every other way the Asus is the laptop I’d buy today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5Xlkc"&gt;That’s not to say there’s anything particularly wrong with the Razer Blade 15 Base at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B086MGY9TZ/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;today’s unheard of price of $1,099 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (regularly $1,599): aside from the paltry 256GB of solid state storage, you’re looking at a speedy 6-core Core i7-10750H processor, GeForce GTX 1660 Ti graphics that should competently tackle yesteryear’s biggest titles, a 144Hz 1080p screen, plus plenty of ports packed into an attractive black CNC aluminum chassis with single-zone RGB lighting. The deal at midnight PT Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GMcPAxqZtHaUD38xNaWIsZDkzOo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22318899/blade_zephyrus.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uObDu2"&gt;But for just $100 more, you can currently get the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 at Best Buy for $1,199, which just so happens to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;our pick for the best ultraportable gaming laptop you can buy&lt;/a&gt;. While its Nvidia RTX 2060 Max-Q graphics can actually be slightly slower than the 1660 Ti (depending on the game) and there’s no Thunderbolt ports, you’re likely looking at nearly double the battery life from its 8-core AMD Ryzen 9 4900HS chip — plus a 1TB SSD that should be able to actually hold a decent selection of games. It weighs far less at just  over 3.5 pounds; compare to 4.7 pounds for the Razer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wGa3pG"&gt;That’s just based on the spec sheet: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;you can read our whole review for more&lt;/a&gt;, or our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21340554/razer-blade-stealth-13-review-keyboard-specs-price-features"&gt;Razer Blade Stealth 13 review&lt;/a&gt; where the Asus still managed to blow a newer and lighter Razer laptop out of the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oVVRlR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9505867"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2DZD8Z"&gt;All that said, I could still easily see you picking the Razer for the slightly more powerful graphics, the $100 cheaper price, the sleek profile, the blacked-out design, or that all-important webcam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w8phOs"&gt;And remember that neither of these machines have the latest and greatest graphics: Nvidia’s RTX 30-series laptop GPUs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226544/nvidia-rtx-3080-laptops-gpus-ces-2021"&gt;are only barely starting to roll out&lt;/a&gt;. If you don’t need a new machine soon, it might be worth waiting a while longer to see what an RTX 3060 laptop might do for you — like the upgraded Zephyrus G14, &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/633495/10014?prodsku=6452913&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fasus-rog-zephyrus-14-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-9-16gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-1tb-ssd-moonlight-white-moonlight-white%2F6452913.p%3FskuId%3D6452913%26ref%3D212%26loc%3D1&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on backorder for $1,499&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="aLpjD6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"A list of the new GeForce 30-series laptops","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266921/nvidia-requiring-companies-share-clock-speed-power-gaming-laptop-rtx-30-series-gpu-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>The FAA is no longer concerned with SpaceX’s Starship SN9 and SN8</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w2WswsojJsV6_nItjYskEqVUyJE=/45x0:435x260/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68851460/spaceship_crash_space_x.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T5RD5K"&gt;The FAA seems satisfied with its investigations into Elon Musk’s last two SpaceX Starship tests, each of which ended in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262937/spacex-sn9-starship-test-flight-successful-explode-landing"&gt;an explosive crash&lt;/a&gt;, and the conclusion of those investigations should clear the way for a new SN10 flight in the very near future. In fact, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1363600651712794624"&gt;Musk just tweeted &lt;/a&gt;there’s a “good chance of flying this week!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nSD9CZ"&gt;Late last month, we broke the news &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256657/spacex-launch-violation-explosive-starship-faa-investigation-elon-musk"&gt;that SpaceX had violated its launch license&lt;/a&gt; with its Starship SN8 launch in December, but an FAA spokesperson now says that matter has already been settled, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jackiewattles/status/1362888690586980353"&gt;according to CNN’s Jackie Wattles.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="GK7H6p"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cdsFET"&gt;It’s not yet clear when the Starship SN10 might launch, but &lt;a href="https://www.cameroncounty.us/spacex/"&gt;Boca Chica is already closing the local highway and beach&lt;/a&gt; in preparation for “non-flight testing activities” on Monday, which some are interpreting to mean &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_vehicle_system_tests#Static_fire"&gt;a static fire test.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A note, the paperwork filed for next week's closure specifies    -       activities.  For comparison, the SN9 flight was described as 'space flight activities' in the same part of the equivalent filing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Throttle expectations appropriately.&lt;a href="https://t.co/7Er5HdRaH6"&gt;https://t.co/7Er5HdRaH6&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/SZSwkOkLvn"&gt;pic.twitter.com/SZSwkOkLvn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Boca Chica Road Closures (@BocaRoad) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BocaRoad/status/1362598116461924352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

Better than a coin flip, I suppose? &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>United Airlines flight safely lands after dramatic engine failure caught on camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rz9R4z6sfx_wfuItgh6tmMpIsA4=/53x0:1988x1290/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68849369/UE328.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8MCKWr"&gt;A United Airlines flight experienced a dramatic-looking engine failure just after takeoff from Denver International Airport on Saturday afternoon. UA328, originally headed to Honolulu, quickly circled back to the airport and made a safe landing after the pilots calmly &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DillonMThomas/status/1363239538185756673"&gt;made a “mayday” call&lt;/a&gt; to air traffic control. There were no injuries among the 231 passengers and 10 airline staff on board, according to the FAA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4pZAty"&gt;Since it’s 2021, the incident was thoroughly captured with both photos and video. Passengers shared video of what looks to be a significant right engine failure, with visible damage, flames, and trailing smoke:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="C5zJ0c"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Flight 328 &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/united?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@united&lt;/a&gt; engine caught fire. my parents are on this flight    everyone’s okay though! &lt;a href="https://t.co/cBt82nIkqb"&gt;pic.twitter.com/cBt82nIkqb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— michaela  (@michaelagiulia) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/michaelagiulia/status/1363241125495136267?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nYpUeM"&gt;That isn’t what I’d want to see looking out the window seat. Engine failures are rare, but do happen. Modern planes are designed so that they’re able to remain in the air for an extended period and safely land with only a single functioning engine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CfI9RS"&gt;Photographer Hayden Smith snapped a series of images of the Boeing 777-200 plane that offer a closer look at the damaged engine from the ground and posted them to Dropbox not long after the plane safely landed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/05IwDokARrXS3vCxRwxp2fcLRzs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22317735/plane2.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="V2zoLN"&gt;But even before that, a dash cam managed to get the moment that the engine seemingly blew out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pWTTAS"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oQ3xGE"&gt;Reports followed of engine debris landing in neighborhoods near the plane’s flight path, which was also caught on video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Jz4DBK"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Pedestrians filmed the falling engine parts impacting the nearby soccer field. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BAREESTHETICSCO?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@BAREESTHETICSCO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/YYPdrpqP5Z"&gt;pic.twitter.com/YYPdrpqP5Z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— JACDEC (@JacdecNew) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JacdecNew/status/1363241028690599938?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ffeseH"&gt;Local authorities are investigating and say that so far there’ve been no injuries related to the shed debris. The plane’s engine cowling is visible in some of the images shared across social media. Nearby residents are being asked to check their property for any pieces of the engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Yx8X46"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;These pictures are wild. According to reports, plane debris fell from the sky and landed in different neighborhoods in Denver &lt;a href="https://t.co/aRKtJP4q7u"&gt;https://t.co/aRKtJP4q7u&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/8EC6DesIZ2"&gt;pic.twitter.com/8EC6DesIZ2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— philip lewis (@Phil_Lewis_) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Phil_Lewis_/status/1363237308074496002?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="87DHrb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B9Y6gl"&gt;As is usual in these circumstances, the FAA and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NTSB_Newsroom/status/1363254016558399492"&gt;NTSB&lt;/a&gt; will investigate what went wrong with UA328’s engine. But the incident is another reminder of just how resilient airplanes are designed to be — and how anytime there’s an incident of this magnitude in modern times, it’s going to be captured extensively from nearly every angle within minutes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="AqUQ6q"&gt;I know it’s often mocked when people cheer their airplane touching down safely after a completely normal flight, but in this case, I think I can relate.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rare’s unreleased N64 game Dinosaur Planet has leaked </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UmzsMQ8wnbi6URj3vwsdNXHvrDQ=/0x43:1024x726/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68848839/dinoplanet.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Forest of Illusion&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U0NPA4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dinosaur Planet&lt;/em&gt; is an unreleased Nintendo 64 game by Rare that ultimately evolved into &lt;em&gt;Star Fox Adventures&lt;/em&gt; for GameCube. But thanks to the preservationists at Forest of Illusion, it’s now possible to play that unfinished, original title. A build of the game from December 1st, 2000 — well into its development cycle — was retrieved from a disc purchased from a private collector. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xbx1Q4"&gt;Screenshots of the game feature Fox McCloud; as noted by &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-02-20-rares-unreleased-dinosaur-planet-for-n64-out-in-the-wild-gameplay-emerges"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Nintendo’s Shigeru Miyamoto was reportedly influential in pushing the developers to shift the game into a Star Fox title. &lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry’&lt;/em&gt;s John Linneman uploaded 20 minutes of gameplay, and here you can also see Fox replacing one of the original game’s intended protagonists, Sabre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yhaWrZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Today we have released Dinosaur Planet by Rare for Nintendo 64. The development was halted and moved to the GameCube, where it was then released as Star Fox Adventures. Enjoy! (More info in this thread).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Link to the dump:&lt;a href="https://t.co/gQGGcU4vJK"&gt;https://t.co/gQGGcU4vJK&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Orub7RU3fa"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Orub7RU3fa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Forest of Illusion (@forestillusion) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/forestillusion/status/1363090008916193282?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WmIhUU"&gt;Forest of Illusion notes that “the game will currently not run 100 percent perfectly on any emulator. Expect many graphical issues with shadows and lighting, and some slowdown. It should however, work perfectly fine with flashcarts.” Flashcarts allow for games to run on original N64 console hardware &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gdSlK0"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hH_Nn4QwHgU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6LYkFf"&gt;The influence of &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&lt;/em&gt; is evident, but it’s very interesting to get a look at the moody atmosphere that Rare was working on before &lt;em&gt;Dinosaur Planet&lt;/em&gt; became &lt;em&gt;Star Fox Adventures&lt;/em&gt; on the GameCube. Forest of Illusion also &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/dino_20210220"&gt;uploaded the game to the Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fy4rtf"&gt;February is proving to be a month of gems for Rare’s fans; earlier in February, the canceled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22267913/goldeneye-007-xbox-360-live-arcade-nintendo-64-remake-remaster-rare"&gt;Xbox 360 remake of &lt;em&gt;GoldenEye 007&lt;/em&gt; was leaked&lt;/a&gt; onto the web. Much like Dinosaur Planet, it’s very playable despite being unfinished. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Some viewers of Metallica’s BlizzCon performance heard the least metal music imaginable </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pmGgPnwIrkhXKRe832G_2QtQYUI=/215x0:2099x1256/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68848532/Screen_Shot_2021_02_20_at_12.02.48_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;That disclaimer at the bottom would prove relevant.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Blizzard&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gi56ia"&gt;Despite its later-than-usual timing and going completely virtual for the first time, yesterday’s BlizzCon keynote brought with it some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22285677/blizzcon-2021-news-trailers-diablo-wow-burning-crusade"&gt;big news and exciting trailers&lt;/a&gt;. It also featured a musical performance from Metallica. The band isn’t new to BlizzCon, having first appeared at the conference in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FYqIij"&gt;Viewers on many platforms (including Blizzard’s own Twitch and YouTube channels) heard a performance of Metallica’s 1984 tune “For Whom The Bell Tolls.” Several Twitch streamers broadcasting BlizzCon muted the feed during Metallica’s appearance to avoid &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525481/twitch-streamers-dmca-takedown-notices-riaa-copyright"&gt;any potential DMCA troubles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nDCJfy"&gt;But on the &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/920716549"&gt;Twitch Gaming feed&lt;/a&gt; that was &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; carrying the stream, well, things took an amazing turn. Within seconds of the song beginning, the audio was replaced by what &lt;a href="https://music.avclub.com/twitch-censors-live-metallica-concert-with-dorkiest-mus-1846314134"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AV Club&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; perfectly summed up as “the dorkiest, most &lt;em&gt;Zelda &lt;/em&gt;forest-ass music imaginable.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8n16R2"&gt;The transition really makes the whole story here, so please watch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6zmU5Q"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gKhc21Y0Xdw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iO6BB1"&gt;It would seem the music performance rights that Blizzard obtained for its own channels didn’t extend to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21271803/twitch-gaming-channel-exclusives-news"&gt;Twitch’s in-house gaming channel&lt;/a&gt;, so we were instead rewarded with this glorious moment. Could they have just cut the audio altogether? Sure, but that wouldn’t have been as fun. This version of the opening keynote stream currently has over 1.2 million views. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="RnpnqH"&gt;If you want to see Metallica’s actual performance, it’s right at the 1:24:50 mark on either &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1AvJ0SRjw8"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/920697882"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;.

There’s a lot to chew on there with Napster and the contentious DMCA quagmires that regularly pop up today. But let’s leave that for another day. For now, just imagine Lars Ulrich and company actually jamming out to this RPG adventure music. It all syncs up nicely at times.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Postmates workers are getting scammed out of their earnings by phishing schemes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Shake Shack Plans To Return $10 Million Loan To U.S. After Uproar" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ENqQiHP-WMdzfhs-MP7qZOtX1QE=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68848016/1210482601.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SoDRLL"&gt;Over at &lt;a href="https://themarkup.org/working-for-an-algorithm/2021/02/18/postmates-drivers-have-become-easy-prey-for-scammers-and-drivers-say-the-companys-not-helping"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an alarming story about a rash of phishing scams that have been targeting gig workers for Postmates. Drivers are receiving phone calls from people claiming to be Postmates employees, who urge the workers to give over their login details — usually under the guise that it’s necessary to keep a driver account in good standing or avoid claims of fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jvD5PH"&gt;Once the scammers obtain that info, they switch the debit card information on the account — Postmates makes weekly deposits of a worker’s earnings, but instant transfers can also be requested — and then drain the balance of everything that’s in there. &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; has spoken to many Postmates gig workers who’ve been preyed upon with this scam, and others are using Reddit and social media to warn their fellow drivers about the phishing and social engineering attempts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XkIjAx"&gt;The unknown call usually comes in right after an order. (Placing an order allows the perpetrators to easily reach their Postmates driver by phone.) Some scammers have gone so far as to involve restaurants in their scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XZvcmn"&gt;Drivers say that Postmates isn’t doing enough to make them aware of the phishing threat, which has only grown more common during the COVID-19 pandemic. Scammers are taking advantage of how busy and hurried these gig workers often are, so drivers are asking for more safeguards in the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0oRCks"&gt;One suggestion is an automatic hold on a driver account whenever the deposit information changes, just to give some more time to prevent a worker’s money from being siphoned out. Another measure that could help would be a caller ID that clearly identifies when a call is coming from a Postmates customer account. Postmates has &lt;a href="https://support.postmates.com/fleet/articles/360022299432-article-How-can-I-keep-my-account-safe-"&gt;this support page&lt;/a&gt; on protecting accounts, but several drivers told &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; they’d never seen it before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bbPxXJ"&gt;Postmates says it has implemented two-factor authentication and can block cashouts if fraud is suspected. But drivers that’ve been hit by the scam say the company is hard to reach, so they have little hope for recouping their lost earnings. The whole story at &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; is worth a read — and yet more reason to tip well whenever you lean on the gig economy. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stretched vaccine timelines re-enter the spotlight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vaccination process against COVID-19 begins in Colombia" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FV_Ru2IicYlPOiV2Bj44VEwstDg=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68847802/1231243754.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xkFQQR"&gt;As the pandemic drags on, experts are exploring ways to stretch still-limited vaccine supplies to get as many people protected as possible. One idea that’s resurfaced this week involves allowing more time in between the first and second doses of the two-dose vaccines. This time, though, there’s some additional data that suggests it might work.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VX0bZf"&gt;Here’s the idea: two leading vaccines, made by Pfizer / BioNTech and Moderna require two doses. But their early data &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/08/health/covid-vaccine-pfizer.html"&gt;showed pretty significant protection after the first dose&lt;/a&gt;. That got people thinking — is it worth giving more people partial protection with just one dose? Or should they stick to the schedule and fully vaccinate fewer people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="q5WGNa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7YTwEw"&gt;Back in December, some experts &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/18/opinion/coronavirus-vaccine-doses.html"&gt;encouraged researchers to set up trials&lt;/a&gt; to find out if a single dose of a two-dose vaccine would be effective. Around the same time, health authorities in the UK &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-delays-second-covid-19-vaccine-dose-as-europe-ponders-how-to-speed-up-immunization-11609334172?mod=article_inline"&gt;decided to plow ahead &lt;/a&gt;without those studies, and prioritized getting first shots in arms, allowing people to delay their doses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Y66g6"&gt;This week, we got more data that shows that a single dose of Pfizer / BioNTech actually does a pretty good job of preventing illness. A study in Israel found that a first shot was &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/pfizer-vaccine-may-offer-strong-protection-first-dose-israeli-study-fi-rcna300"&gt;85 percent effective&lt;/a&gt; at reducing symptomatic cases of COVID-19 in healthcare workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kpXv0h"&gt;There are some caveats. Here’s a major one: most of the people in the study ended up getting their second dose relatively quickly. That means researchers can only say that the first dose is effective between 15 and 28 days after a person gets that first shot. How long protection lasts beyond that is still unknown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2PGXTC"&gt;That’s why some experts are still urging caution when it comes to changing the schedule between those vaccines. “Until such time that there are good clinical trials that show that a single dose provides an equivalent level of protection, I don’t know that we should abandon our approach or create new policies,” &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/pfizer-vaccine-may-offer-strong-protection-first-dose-israeli-study-fi-rcna300"&gt;Jonathan Tempte told &lt;em&gt;NBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lQJmdS"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-25/why-delaying-the-second-covid-vaccine-shot-is-messy-quicktake"&gt;It’s messy&lt;/a&gt;, and researchers don’t agree. Some, including Anthony Fauci maintain that sticking to two on-schedule doses can &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/both-covid-vaccine-doses-critical-stay-ahead-variants-fauci-says-n1257041"&gt;help keep the US ahead of dangerous variants&lt;/a&gt; of the virus. Others lean towards taking a strategy more like the UK’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LfAaFZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s an old saying that we wouldn’t use parachutes or aspirin if we waited for randomized trials, either.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VkmD68"&gt;“I think this [strategy] is something on which reasonable people could disagree, but saying you should only do something supported by randomized evidence when there’s an emergency would have precluded us from using masks, social distancing, from doing all the things we know are good public health practices,” Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at Harvard told &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/02/experts-tout-delaying-2nd-covid-vaccine-dose-us-deaths-mount"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CIDRAP News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month. He added: “There’s an old saying that we wouldn’t use parachutes or aspirin if we waited for randomized trials, either.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pEoUfc"&gt;Here in the US, states are trying to speed up doses — and looking to the federal government for guidance. The CDC has already said that in extreme circumstances, providers &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html"&gt;can stretch the window&lt;/a&gt; between their patients’ shots from three to four weeks up to six. This week, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-16/cdc-advisers-weigh-guidance-for-delaying-second-covid-shots?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that a committee that advises the CDC was considering whether or not to recommend changing the schedule in a smaller working group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rz7XOw"&gt;That discussion might not make it to the full committee any time soon. The working group might decide that they need to see more data, or it might not make it to the next COVID-19-related meeting in favor of discussing more pressing issues — including their recommendations for the single-shot Johnson and Johnson vaccine. (Another meeting of that committee &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/agenda-archive/agenda-2021-02.pdf"&gt;is planned for this coming week&lt;/a&gt;, but its focus is on a host of other deadly diseases, including ebola, dengue, and rabies.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VKi80h"&gt;Even if the committee &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; take it up immediately, the question of when to administer doses is fascinating, and one we’ll be watching as the vaccine rollout accelerates, and more data just keeps pouring in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="um8S35"&gt;Here’s what else is happening this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="yhi9ZX"&gt;It sounds crazy, right? Am I crazy? I definitely have that psychological battle where I start to doubt everything. Could it all be in my head? I’ll tell myself I need to try harder. I’ll force myself out of bed, but then I get in the shower and the hot water turns my hands purple. My heart rate spikes. I get so dizzy I have to sit down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="nBh9TN"&gt;As my father’s health declined, I thought about how MAD the world is now; behind all the well-meaning gestures to honor frontline workers like him, there is the willingness to endanger their lives to keep commerce flowing.
