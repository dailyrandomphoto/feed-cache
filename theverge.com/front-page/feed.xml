    <title>Firefox says its revamped SmartBlock won’t break Facebook login buttons anymore</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1HSZIg"&gt;Firefox 90 introduces the next version of SmartBlock, the browser’s tracker blocking mechanism built into its private browsing and strict modes, which now has improvements designed to prevent buttons that let you log into websites using your Facebook account from breaking, Mozilla announced on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ydtHbN"&gt;SmartBlock was first introduced with Firefox 87 in March, and if you aren’t familiar, here’s Mozilla’s description of how it works, &lt;a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/03/23/introducing-smartblock/"&gt;from the company’s blog&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="qDQ8Cp"&gt;SmartBlock intelligently fixes up web pages that are broken by our tracking protections, without compromising user privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7AlGhZ"&gt;SmartBlock does this by providing local stand-ins for blocked third-party tracking scripts. These stand-in scripts behave &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; enough like the original ones to make sure that the website works properly. They allow broken sites relying on the original scripts to load with their functionality intact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="qjXN4v"&gt;Sometimes, though, the feature would break Facebook login buttons. &lt;a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/07/13/smartblock-v2/"&gt;In a new blog post&lt;/a&gt;, Mozilla’s Tom Wisniewski and Arthur Edelstein explain why this would happen, using an example of trying to log in to Etsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7HiMRA"&gt;“Prior to Firefox 90, if you were using a Private Browsing window, when you clicked on the ‘Continue with Facebook’ button to sign in, the ‘sign in’ would fail to proceed because the third-party Facebook script required had been blocked by Firefox,” they write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="epPqYd"&gt;With Firefox 90 and SmartBlock 2.0, though, you should be able to use Facebook login buttons all while SmartBlock 2.0 still blocks cross-site tracking. On the updated browser, “initially, Facebook scripts are all blocked, just as before, ensuring your privacy is preserved,” they write. “But when you click on the ‘Continue with Facebook’ button to sign in, SmartBlock reacts by quickly unblocking the Facebook login script just in time for the sign-in to proceed smoothly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kcLrvS"&gt;Firefox 90 is launching Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Can Polestar design a new kind of car company?</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vrK-QfAq4c7tOay7v5PKkzMEv5o=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69575056/VRG_Decoder_ThomasIngenlath_site.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath wants the freedom of an auto startup with the benefits of an established player&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="FkhoFK"&gt;We are back after our week off, and we’ve got a good one today. On this episode, I’m talking to Thomas Ingenlath, CEO of Polestar, a new car company with close family ties to Volvo. Polestar has two models you can go out and buy today: the $150,000 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/17/16487290/polestar-volvo-hybrid-electric-revealed"&gt;hybrid Polestar 1&lt;/a&gt; sports coupe and the somewhat more reasonable $60,000 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21365032/polestar-2-hands-on-first-drive-electric-android-automotive-photos-range"&gt;Polestar 2 sedan&lt;/a&gt;, which has been getting pretty good reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMG4gp"&gt;Now, Polestar is an interesting company. It’s effectively a startup with tight ties to Volvo, and Thomas himself is Volvo’s chief design officer. So we talked a lot about what kind of company Polestar is — it’s pretty small and has the ability to rethink a lot of things about how a car company is organized, while having the ability to fall back on a larger company if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XbM7ew"&gt;We also talked a lot about what makes a car company a car company at a time when everything about cars seems up for grabs. Thomas told me he doesn’t think of Polestar as an &lt;em&gt;electric&lt;/em&gt; car company. Instead, he sees the brand as a set of “core values” about what a car is, with the technology underneath replaceable over time — maybe a long period of time. Eventually, Thomas told me, something else will take over from EVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UeFiOi"&gt;But back here on the ground, the transformation of cars into rolling electric computers is just getting started. We also talked about some basic questions that keep coming up: how is the charging network for Polestar EVs getting built up? Polestar and Volvo have chosen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18537200/google-android-auto-volvo-polestar-2-hands-on-demo-io-2019"&gt;to run Android Auto for the entire center stack&lt;/a&gt;. Why give up that part of the experience to Google? As cars slowly head toward self-driving capability, who should own the maps and navigation information? And how should we think about upgrading the computers in our cars over time? If you listened to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22444294/ford-f150-lightning-pickup-truck-jim-farley-interview"&gt;my interview with Ford CEO Jim Farley&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll note that Thomas’ answers are strikingly different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="go7kvI"&gt;In fact, I’ll leave on that note: Thomas is still a designer at heart, and I think you can hear that when you listen to this conversation. You’ll see what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sAq87W"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP2477017309" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BzLh8b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following transcript has been edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R4YSwk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s a lot to talk about. Polestar is a new car company. There are quite a lot of new car companies lately, there’s an EV revolution happening, but I want to start at the beginning. Polestar began as part of Volvo. It was spun out in 2017. You’re still using some of Volvo’s dealer network. You have some Volvo design elements. Give me the brief story of where Polestar came from and what that relationship to Volvo is now.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DBYS4i"&gt;The relationship to Volvo is very simply put into a picture. It’s a parent company, it was born there and it raised its baby and it’s growing up and becoming an adult, and we are on the progress of moving out, earning our own money, and becoming independent. We will always be some kind of family, but of course we will develop our own life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vDDQzj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How big is Polestar? How many employees do you have?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vcDlUF"&gt;Size-wise, we are still not at all [a] big fat OEM, despite the fact that we have two cars in production. We are still around 1,000 people. The trick here, and that is where the main business idea behind Polestar lies, [is that] we use elements that are existing in the family, like contract manufacturing, partly, as well as technology platforms that we’re using. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hfNJL1"&gt;Of course, hundreds and thousands of engineers and workers are working there, but they’re not employed by Polestar. We do contract engineering, contract manufacturing, and have that type of asset-light approach to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XMzzxU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is that a different approach than Volvo? One of the core questions I have for you is: the reason you spin out a company is to get rid of some of the institutional baggage that has developed over a long period of time. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="02H324"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is Polestar trying to make a new kind of car company and reset, or do you want to get better efficiency out of all the assets that Volvo has, but point them at a different market?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fX9QSw"&gt;For us at Polestar, it’s definitely the speed and the way you can really build that company and make decisions on innovation, [and] how you set up your customer business. You can really do this in a small company much, much faster, and then embrace it, and the day that you [make a] decision, you can implement it immediately. That works so much faster here and you definitely have that advantage of a new company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZrFdgW"&gt;Having said that, at the same time you use [the] efficiency of the infrastructure of manufacturing and really bring that to a higher use as that’s a benefit for all of us. That’s really where, of course, it’s as much a win for us as it is for the big Volvo there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BH10tr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polestar has two models out now. There is &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/17/16487290/polestar-volvo-hybrid-electric-revealed"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the Polestar 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, a hybrid sort of sports coupe. It’s very expensive. It starts at $155,000. I just specced one out. I made it more expensive than that very quickly. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sRpI1a"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21365032/polestar-2-hands-on-first-drive-electric-android-automotive-photos-range"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Polestar 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; is sort of the more mainstream model. It’s all electric, it’s a hatchback. It starts at $61,000. Why start there at the very top of the market, when it seems like there’s a lot of opportunity for more mainstream electric cars?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ubHJCj"&gt;These two products exactly frame the brand. Yes, we put the Polestar 1 as that highlight product, really showing the ambitious technology that we put in there and of course, a high price ticket. It’s a super luxurious car. It’s very low volume. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z53d9z"&gt;A year later we showed the foundation, the entry ticket to the brand, where [the] Polestar 2 came in as this electric premium hatchback. That’s really where we framed what will be the playground of where we develop, now, the brand. The future portfolio that comes out now over the next three years, will fill the space in between. I understand that there’s still an empty space in between, but we have to start somewhere and we decided to frame it first and then start painting, rather than to start somewhere in the middle and you diffuse to the ends and you don’t know where the borders are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VTLDG4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do the hybrid at all? If you think the future is EVs, obviously hybrids are an interim step, but why start with gas-engineered cars at all?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z96vWr"&gt;We had that discussion, of course, in the beginning. Why do you have a hybrid at all in your lineup? In the end, [we said] “should we really be so dogmatic about it?” It is a car that has the longest electric range of a hybrid, 120, 130 kilometers you can go. For a lot of people, that car is actually a great entry into that electric arena. It helps people to actually feel comfortable about driving an electric car, people who might have never, ever thought about it before. They discover with that car, “Wow, actually the electric part is the really cool part about it,” and it was always clear. It is that one fulfillment of a dream that we all had, a super beautiful GT and the technology is awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="v8obM0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9545330"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7I4lzv"&gt;Hybrid is part of the electric journey. We will, of course, from now on have the electric lineup of the portfolio. Yeah, a little bit of an unorthodox beginning, but then again it’s the whole thing, the whole brand Polestar. It’s not just a marketing exercise where you do a perfect plan from A to Z. It is a living thing. It has its history, how it all grew, and I think it has its charm to it, that we actually don’t just simply do everything textbook. [We] give it a little bit more [room] to breathe, and at the end decided, it is absolutely in line with what the company philosophy is about and that’s why we felt at the end of the day, electric will be a certain period of Polestar. Let’s face it, in 50, 60, 70 years, we will still be Polestar, but technology might have changed again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VIUpor"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s a really interesting way of framing it. The startup company CEOs tell me, “We’re an electric car company.” The big company CEOs say, “We’re on our journey to being an electric car company.” You’re not saying that. You’re saying, “We’re a car company and we have to adapt over time.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gCNoWA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think of Polestar as an electric car company in the way that many new car companies explicitly frame themselves that way?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GpUTSA"&gt;I totally believe what we create here over time is a brand and that is the core value. We create something that I really hope that in 100 years we look back and we think, wow, what a brand we created. And imagine if Porsche would have said, “Oh, we are a combustion engine company.” Then you bury yourself. Now, no. Of course you reinvent yourself and okay, combustion engines were the first, I don’t know, 50, 60 years, and now they go into electrification. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V8VVpL"&gt;For me, that is of course a super important period. I mean, don’t get me wrong. Electrification is the topic of the time and I’m the first one to say, “Come on, we have to fully switch into that gear now,” but we should not think that [from] now till eternity that will be the drivetrain. It will be for quite a long time, but then again, what will happen in 50, 60 years?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="G8lmD7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“In 50, 60, 70 years we will still be Polestar, but technology might have changed again.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4PHqoP"&gt;Maybe there will be something else. I never would connect a specific technology as a core of the brand. I once had a boss in R&amp;amp;D and he said, “We are a proper company. We need a combustion engine factory, otherwise we are not a proper car company,” and already at that point in time, I thought, “What you create is a brand and the brand is the core value.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="at0DCv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let me push you on that a little bit. For the longest time — maybe they didn’t know it — but companies like Porsche, Honda, what have you, they were combustion engine companies. They were organized around this big, heavy thing that you had to put in front of the car and it needed a gas tank, and it needed to vent the exhaust out, and they had to manage heat, all this stuff.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K7ht7D"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And the entire apparatus of designing and selling and maintaining their product was organized around the drivetrain and so, even if they didn’t know that they were combustion engine car companies, they had to build themselves around the reality of the core piece of their product. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ty4F9q"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When I talk to the CEOs of new car companies, they often say, “Oh, the old car companies won’t be able to do this because they have 500 engineers who work on exhaust systems who will be resistant to change and the opportunity with electric cars is to completely rethink a car from the ground up and to throw out all of the baggage.” Where do you see that balance? Because you have what is a fairly unique viewpoint so far that I’ve heard.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7fZFnP"&gt;To a certain extent, of course, it is a problem to initiate now this change, from what has been a company that has been so entirely busy with making a combustion engine work in a car, which actually is very difficult because it’s quite a funny way of changing movement from going up and down into rotation. So, that has its problems. They solved it quite nicely, but of course it involved lots of people doing that. Both extremes to me are wrong. I mean, that combustion engineering, yes. You really need a big, big effort to change a company from that kind of locomotion going in that direction into a different direction. That’s a hell of a task and that’s, of course, our advantage, that we are not busy with that. We can fully concentrate on the new. Fine, but it’s again not just simply making a computer on wheels or a mobile on wheels. It’s still that kind of experience that you have to embrace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FTwTe0"&gt;And that has a digital aspect. It has, as well, an emotional and physical aspect. The car is a moving object. It is still, for mankind, an amazing experience that you can actually accelerate yourself faster than your own feet can carry you. That is still an emotional experience. Embracing that is about an emotional experience that you have in your car and that includes the physical, the digital aspect, and the senses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7xzoyN"&gt;You have to bring into the experience of the brand, and to me, it’s a much more holistic experience that is not connected just to the eternity of one technology. At the moment, how much we embrace and cherish the element of bringing your digital life that you enjoy so much into the car as well and make that seamless. It’s as important as having the electric drivetrain, like you said, that you actually have that ability to connect to your digital life in the car, as much as you do it whilst you’re cooking in the kitchen. That of course is one of the monster tasks for car companies and that’s still not solved 100 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="m6M9pS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The car is a moving object...That is still an emotional experience.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lVIZD5"&gt;That’s what we are all busy with, but there’s one big aspect as well, the customer relations which comes into the picture, and building a car company that is not always detached from the customer that much, and we experience that now fully. Having a direct consumer business is such a massive experience, you really are directly with the customer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QYQNrz"&gt;They come with all the complaints and with all the emotions to you and that’s great, but you have to cater for that. You have to be prepared for that, where until today all the dealers out there [were] doing that for you, now suddenly you’re in the direct business. So, these are all amazing new things that we as a young company are trying to embrace and do and that is definitely where all the OEMs that are out there still have to get onto that journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JtRb0d"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re a former designer. What you just said had a lot of design thinking in it, a lot of user-centric thinking in it. What parts of being the CEO have surprised you the most in that transition going from head of design at various places to now the CEO of Polestar?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tmcGk0"&gt;Of course, bit by bit the creative part, being in the design studio disappeared, and now I’m only, I don’t know, four hours per week over there and being together with Max [Missoni] and Robin [Page] in the design studio. That I definitely miss. Having said that, daily work on making things, [keeping] it together, [trying] to make things that are impossible possible, every day getting things over that hurdle of, “Ah, but can we not do it like that because it’s so—” Every day I try to push for that. It’s the same that I did over the last 10 years in the design studio, trying to make designs happen where it’s such an energy to bring it alive and real in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nTDcti"&gt;And it’s still the same thing. But now on a bigger scale, it’s now about a whole brand and about a whole company, and to keep it together and really make everybody feel like, wow, this is our thing. It’s not a place where you come and people provide you with something. No, it’s your workplace. And if you don’t pick up that spoon from the table when you left it there, there’s not anybody coming. Feel that ownership and treat the company like it’s your own company. And I wish everybody in the design studio does it, and everybody here at Polestar does it. That is for me a big difference of people really feeling that much engaged and involved into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VvplLv"&gt;It makes me happy when I see people do it that way and feel it, and have that same passion for it. And it drives me crazy when I see that people come to work, who like it, basically, but don’t see that it has to come with yourself delivering on it as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zkNnfL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I ask every executive who comes on the show this question. You are the CEO of a small car company that is connected to a very big company. You’re trying to launch a new brand. You’re trying to launch new products. You have a lot of decisions to make. What is your decision-making framework?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5m3N90"&gt;I [am] really trying to understand what you mean by framework, Nilay. Can you explain it a little more? What [do] you actually mean with that question?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EgjkoZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think that most leaders of large organizations have to make so many decisions with unknown outputs, there’s not a right decision. Every decision is balancing a trade-off. The point of my question is to understand how leaders balance the trade-offs. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="okUwYf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As the leader of a large organization, you can’t know that you’re going to be right. You have to make a bet. No matter what that thing is, whether you are carving a clay model for a car, or if you are deciding how to operate your dealer network. These are just kind of repeated decisions or repeated tasks. And I think most people, even if they don’t recognize it, develop a framework for doing the things they do.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eVkY6K"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And one of the things that gets taken for granted a lot is at some point there isn’t a right choice. There’s just a balance of priorities and interests, and making that trade-off is very difficult. So that’s what I’m always trying to get at is, what is your instinctive way of balancing the trade-offs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UBLTbi"&gt;I guess such a long period of my life has been connected to making decisions within the design frame, where you have, at the end of the day, it never could be a committee decision. It is such a personal decision about deciding on which is the right way to go, left or right, model A or B. What do you do? And as much as you try to back up your opinion with maybe some kind of facts and figures that you listen to, there’s still, as well, a lot about a gut feeling. And the gut feeling is not about taste. It’s about really you judging about what the future will bring and out of the best picture that you can draw out of the information, and your sense for what is going to happen and bringing that into your decision. Just simply dare to make that decision and that prediction of what will be the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CJ6zVh"&gt;I’m not scared of that anymore because I actually noticed that you can rationalize a lot of things and explain, and I’ve trained that so much, to actually make that connection of things that you predict for the future and what, partly, you feel about where the trend is going, and how you can argue about it and how you can make a rationale out of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZhMdv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s put that into practice. What risks have you taken in rethinking the car and what risks have you held back on?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sDyJ8c"&gt;Well, that started 10 years ago when we, for example, decided to go for... The forcefulness strategy was Volvo to go for only touchscreen, when everybody was doubting that you could make a premium car company without a minimum of six cylinders, and that touchscreen… with sticky fingers and stuff on it. So that was one decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hzzvhG"&gt;The other thing, definitely embracing the Android Google thing and going for that. And when the rest of the world was saying, “Oh, how can you dare to let them into your demand? They will all dominate it,” and stuff. These are decisions where you definitely have to make brave decisions, offering a car where you say, “No. Yeah, it’s a premium car, but do you need, for a premium car, to equip it with this leather standard? No.” There is a new premium and you can offer to customers who pay lots of money for it, new materials that are not necessarily a natural leather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3w2XMi"&gt;When we did the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195499/volvo-xc40-recharge-ev-suv-first-drive-specs-price"&gt;Volvo XC40&lt;/a&gt;, for example, everybody thought, “Ah, come on, just do a little copy of the XC90, XC60.” I said, “No, we don’t do just a little copy. We do something new. We do some radical new design.” When we did the Polestar 2, we said, “Yes, that is how a modern sedan looks.” It doesn’t look like a traditional sedan and that stance and that power that it has, it’s great. And my God, there were not lots of people believing that [about] the Polestar 2, why didn’t we just do another SUV as a first start? And I’m so happy about having passionate customers who exactly feel how great that car looks and stands on the road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fpMkWb"&gt;But I’ll tell you, three, four years ago, there was a very [small] minority of people in our management team who believed that that would be a great success. So there are lots of decisions where you are really on your own at that point in time. And you cannot go to a clinic and just clinic it because that’s so difficult to predict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G30k7a"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s talk about the decision to use Android in the car. Volvo was early. Now, it seems to be what everyone’s doing. Stellantis, which makes Fiat and Jeep, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/02/hands-on-with-stellantis-new-android-based-uconnect-5-infotainment/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;they are using Android in the car&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, in the center stack. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260176/ford-google-android-infotainment-os-2023"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ford just announced&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; it will be using Android in the future. What is the balance between letting Google own what has become a primary user experience in the car and what you want to design?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KflEyA"&gt;Well, it’s customer benefit. If we promise to have a voice recognition that works, if we promise to have a navigation that actually knows that new restaurant around the block that opened a week ago, and they know already, they want to know the opening times when they put it into the navi. That is what we never can do on our own. That experience we can only do if you have a great partner with a great search engine behind it and everything. Do we give up that experience? No. People sitting in a Polestar don’t think that suddenly it is populated by something outlandish owned by Google. It is such a Polestar experience nevertheless. It’s a partnership. And that is where if you go, then, to Ford or wherever, it will be a brand experience there. That is still possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hq2vLn"&gt;Let’s face it, on my Apple iPhone, I have Google Maps, and just because I use Google Maps, it’s not that I suddenly say, “Oh, but this is not an iPhone anymore.” So I think there, we have to be a little bit more sophisticated in how we discuss it. It’s not like suddenly the whole product experience becomes a Google experience. Yeah, there’s a part of it, and I embrace what they do for our car and it’s a great partnership. And I think there the expertise of both brands come together and create just a beautiful product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uouv19"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s your data sharing agreement with Google like? How much data do they get to pull out of the car?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h2191b"&gt;Yeah, that’s absolutely like on the phone, where the customer can actually totally switch, even within the individual apps, he can decide on how much data he provides and how much he keeps for himself. So that is where that works very much like in any phone setting, where you go in and do your privacy settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2O69eE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But the telematics that you collect about the cars, how much of that do you share with Google?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IQNrW"&gt;Well, it’s very similar. Of course, this is not like the whole software. The software that runs the car is, of course, an automotive software. The Google part is the entertainment part. So that’s where people have to understand it’s not like the whole software of the car is run by Android. That is really the entertainment part, where you go into the app store, the navigation, and all of that, is the Google Android part. While, of course, the whole safety-relevant, drivetrain-relevant, the battery management, all of that, the whole autonomous capabilities of the car, the safety, all that is our software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CT6Ys8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The reason I ask is actually about autonomy. As cars begin to drive themselves more and more, as there’s more driver assistance features, things like maps become critically important to the operation of a car and telling the car where you want to go. And there is obviously a connection between your autonomous driving system and the user experience of telling the car in the center screen. The map underneath actually tells the car where it is and what might be coming up. And then the data that is collected to refine and improve self-driving. That’s a lot of layers that need to connect, and it seems like Google sits right at the middle of it for you. I’m curious how you see that relationship developing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3LFMNs"&gt;No, there is clearly a big, big distinction between what is the entertainment system, and okay, the navigation is of course sitting in there. But what we provide today with our autopilot, which has very much made that difference, we don’t call this an autonomous system. It is a support system where you’re still in the loop, but this is a software that is completely independent from the Google software. In the future, when we develop, in our next car coming, this to a highway pilot, which of course then will reach, as well, autonomous qualities, but you really can let go at some point in time. That, of course, is a system which is together with the software company here in Gothenburg, who is developing that, and we have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22533711/luminar-lidar-autonomous-vehicle-hands-on-demo-austin-russell"&gt;Luminar LIDAR&lt;/a&gt; then for that. So all of that is on a completely different page where we develop this technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LvOPQY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think the auto industry should kind of give up on developing the infotainment stack? I watch every car review on YouTube, and every car reviewer just sort of waves at the center of the car and says it has CarPlay and Android Auto, and then they move on. I’m very curious, is that the end of the road? Is there more innovation there yet to come?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K7p3oZ"&gt;I think this has become far too much of a big, big, major question. Imagine in the past, we were always buying our radio from, I don’t know, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaupunkt"&gt;Blaupunkt&lt;/a&gt; or whatever company there was. It was never the carmaker who made the radio. It was never a carmaker who made a phone. We just simply bring the stuff into the car, and I don’t see it as such a major thing. It definitely is not like suddenly this becomes the major domain. Maybe I’m too naive. Maybe I’m such a naive guy, but I don’t think that it is really this big devil that we invite to our table, and suddenly we lost it all. That to me is one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JNaMwG"&gt;And of course, it’s not as naive as saying, come on, we buy a seat from Recaro. I know that there is a bit more to it. Of course, we have to be smart and clever how we do the contracts and how much the user experience is still a brand-owned experience. And I think so far, my experience with Google is that they absolutely support that we have a brand-owned experience, even though we use their system in our car. And there, I’ve so far, over the five years that we [have been] working now together on that, have not had a negative experience, but I would be, now, more scared than we were in the beginning, rather the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cB8lqm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the things that’s different between, I don’t know, a Blaupunkt radio in the ’90s, or a Recaro seat in a car now; those things are pretty modular. When I didn’t like the Blaupunkt radio in the old BMW I inherited from my mom. I just replaced it. I just took it out and put a different one in. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l9fU5J"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can’t do that with a modern center stack. You can’t say, as the user, “I don’t like this,” or, say I bought a $60,000 Polestar 2. It has been on the road for five years. The computer is falling behind. Do you see a future in which people can replace the computers in their cars, the way that you might get a new phone or you might get a new smartwatch?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UREiPo"&gt;To replace the computer is a difficult thing. And in the past, it was already the same. To a certain degree, technology at some point will age. What is so great about the system today is that you actually can upgrade it and it can actually download new software over the air. And that is, indeed, an amazing experience. And that makes cars that can’t do that suddenly feel really old. That’s true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5hjemg"&gt;But one thing that you can do, you actually can run different apps. And for example, one of the great things, you can go and use a better route planner as your navigation instead of Google Maps. In the future, there will be other navigation apps as well. So you can make your choices. And there are providers that come in from other corners that give you an alternative choice. You can listen to your music from Spotify. There are choices and there’s an open system where different apps are running and you can make your selection as a consumer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mglj0h"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah. But the hardware doesn’t change. How long should a Polestar 2 last?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUGO4U"&gt;Designing a product for forever will be very, very difficult. That is where I saw some studies, and it is sometimes really, really difficult to keep a system that open that you permanently will try to upgrade it, and you at some point realize, well, it doesn’t economically make sense anymore because you start rebuilding the whole thing. And at some point, the physical elements and electric components, after a couple of decades, this is just not up-to-date. Fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9yAE5u"&gt;So the capability of the car today to, through software updates, be renewed and adapt is actually a big, big step to keep the electronics and the car in sync with the physical product, and the batteries actually last an incredibly long time. The car is one of the long-lasting goods. You will replace your computer and your telephone far more often than your car. So, that the electronics and the software in the car became updateable over the air is a major step to actually make the car not feel old too early when the mechanics and everything are still working very well. So for that reason, I think we actually made a major improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5JLFyV"&gt;Nevertheless, at some point in time, in 30, 40 years, this car, after it having been a second- and third-hand car, might reach the border of where this is still appropriate technology. Okay. Fair enough, that we cannot stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="28RydZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forty years is high. That’s much more than I was expecting. To be very reductive, if I have a five-year-old smartphone, I know it’s time that the apps won’t run on it. The processor is old. The battery might be decaying. It’s time to get a new smartphone. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mZX8Q8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But with a five-year-old car, there’s nothing to me that says it’s time to get a new car. That car is probably still working just fine, but the software in it, the smartphone part of it, the center stack, is on the same pace as the computer industry. So now I’m driving a car that has a five-year-old smartphone in the center of it, and that part I can’t replace. Do you see that coming, that you’ll eventually be able to replace just the part of the car that needs to keep pace with the smartphone industry that it’s built on?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BqKt7a"&gt;I believe in five years time, this is still a damn great product and the software and stuff will be absolutely still appropriate. That there might be a newer product at some point in time where you feel certain features and certain functionality is maybe more tempting for you, fair enough. Having said that, that doesn’t mean that your car being six, seven years old suddenly feels inappropriate, as I very much believe that that technology will keep quite a high value over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Egu26"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You talked a lot about the design of the Polestar 2 and rethinking it and making it look athletic. When I look at cars, the exterior design of cars can be timeless. Then you sit down in a car that’s 10 or 15 years old, and the screen in the middle is small and the graphics are bad. And you’re like, “This is dating the car more than the design trends of the moment.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NBaoz9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re a designer. I’m wondering how you see that tension.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="whJOie"&gt;I don’t think that that is totally true. Culture at times is changing, and the car that is five, six, seven years old, definitely, you can tell that this time has passed into [the] exterior as well. They might be still appealing, and that is what I love about the car industry, that they’re actually not this throwaway kind of aesthetics and products. But nevertheless, you can always tell. So I think it’s pretty much in sync.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1KQx8S"&gt;When I was choosing that profession of designer, I was actually not necessarily that car fanatic, that I could only have imagined becoming a car designer. But what I loved about that industry was that you actually spent that much decent time to make a product really, really mature and great, and that you would make it not age that quickly, that you actually cherish that it’s quite a lot of money that it costs, and it should last a long time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l5LKmr"&gt;That aspect, we still value quite highly here in the car industry. I feel on pretty safe ground there. And we’d rather have that attitude, how you will build a house and how you invest into a house, and that you respect that this is something where you put lots of resources and stuff in, and that you try to make it really long-lasting. I think that’s a really good aspect of the car industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WwWa0N"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the big things that’s changing in the car industry is our relationship to charging the electric car. I bring it up because it feels like one of those things that if you buy a Polestar 2 now, your experience in driving and using and charging it today will be very different than it is five years from now. That infrastructure is building. Regardless, whenever we cover any car that’s not a Tesla, our readers come to us and say, “Well, Tesla has a superior charging network. Why would we buy anything that isn’t a Tesla?” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sK55c8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You talked about building Polestar as a brand more than a car company. Tesla is a dominant brand. It’s run by Elon Musk who says whatever he wants on Twitter whenever he wants. So there’s a brand element to competing with Tesla. And then, there’s just a very tangible “people think their charging network is superior,” and that’s the reason to buy a Tesla. Tell me about charging first and then tell me about competing with the brand.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UsMKhB"&gt;Well, once you drive an electric car, you realize that charging is, for most days of the year, not an issue at all. And for most people never will be, because they have it fully charged every morning in front of their door, and you actually have that advantage of never, ever having to go to a petrol station. That’s awesome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3CCNdl"&gt;Yes, if you do a trip to a destination that is much further away, a town that you visit when you have to charge in between, there’s actually, in most regions in Europe, I can tell and definitely within America as well, you will find that place. It needs a bit more planning at the moment. You have to make sure that you checked it before, I acknowledge that, but it’s definitely, today, possible to do that trip. There are situations, in wintertime, going to a faraway ski resort, yes, I see that there will be situations where it’s still a hassle and why not everybody is ready to drive electric cars and maybe if it’s their only car, that I totally acknowledge. We try to help it, but it will still take a couple of years until we have total convenience and for that time being, Tesla definitely has invested a lot of money in their charging network, but I nevertheless cannot see that that is the future, because if each and every car company on the planet would do the same, we would have a parallel network of thousands of charging stations and it wouldn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kLEABE"&gt;We have to, all together, work on an open charging network so that we really make a meaningful investment into the future and that’s what we try to develop and support, and just now made a really good offer over summer for each of our customers to use as well here in Europe. &lt;a href="https://ionity.eu"&gt;IONITY&lt;/a&gt; charges us a really, really attractive rate and stuff and that’s how we reached, already, a quite good status. I can see that discussion over the next two, three years will totally disappear because petrol stations will have to switch to provide electric charging and that is where, naturally, demand will create the right infrastructure. It’s an initial thing that we have to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d1uWCH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you talked to Tesla about opening up the Supercharger network, about participating with them or having them participate with you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jn5FbJ"&gt;Well, there have been talks in the past and I’m sure there will be talks in the future. They sometimes say they will open it and let’s see if they, at some point, really will do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ktlozo"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you ever think of just going crazy on Twitter to compete with Elon Musk and build the Polestar brand the way that he builds the Tesla brand?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DEKKVM"&gt;No, I don’t think that is my style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w29GE9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you think about competing with Tesla as a brand? Tesla famously does no marketing. They’re a very different kind of company.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pwv4Dx"&gt;You have to be authentic and, that’s maybe his way of being authentic, and fine, we have to be our way authentic, and we have to be as a brand as authentic as possible and I think we should never, ever try to imitate somebody [but] to see, who are we? Let people participate in our story and that is, I think, what we really followed the way of the last years, that we make people understand why we’re doing things, what we believe in, and try to share the joy and the passion about what we create and try to make that better with the people giving us feedback. That’s our way and we are not a brand that would put a specific person into the limelight for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qzAuOw"&gt;It’s a different way of building it, and having said that, it’s still fairly individual and I think a colorful brand. I think that we will never [be] shy of expressing an opinion. We went very bold out and declared the end of the combustion age and said goodbye to that. We were very bold in declaring that it’s our way, going with Google Android. We have very clearly stated that we dislike the way of compensating for CO2 emissions, that we truly believe that the way to zero emissions is something that we have to do without compensation and really make it happen over the next nine years that we have a zero emission car. I think that’s where we made our points and feel that we built our brand around these beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wuFutV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much do you think you have to pay attention to the broader political and regulatory climate? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22370302/polestar-carbon-neutral-electric-car-no-offsets"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have called carbon offsets a cop-out&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. You say you’re just going to build a zero-emissions car without buying any offsets. It looks like the Biden administration is going to approve an infrastructure plan that doesn’t have as much money in it for EV charging as people had initially hoped. Is that stuff you’re tracking and responding to? Is that stuff you think that the broader industry will have to react to?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gKFDMo"&gt;I think we, of course, have to take part in the discourse. We cannot shy away from that. We are not politicians. That’s their job, but definitely us as a company in the industry, we have to have our opinion and make sure we have our voice in it and that’s where we participate in the discourse, where we express our opinion and definitely try to push and say, “Come on guys. We cannot always play safe.” We have to have a position. For example, when we made our life-cycle assessment of the Polestar 2 public, I mean, of course, it was a step where we knew that people will abuse these arguments against us and where we say, “Yeah, come on, we have to survive that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hIvvEK"&gt;It’s not a short-term thing. We have to take that fight, that discussion and it might not always be sunshine, but we cannot shy away from that. It’s definitely needed and we always said the car industry has to face reality and we have to be, for our customers, clear in our opinion and transparent about it. I think that is what people definitely expect from a modern brand, that you don’t put your head into the sand and just try to be as smooth as ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0pbFdW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve mentioned before in previous interviews that you didn’t have any major consumer impact or cancellations through the pandemic, which is great, but one of the big issues coming out of the pandemic &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547826/chip-shortage-cars-playstation-5-gpus-semiconductors-time-foundaries-tsmc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;is the chip shortage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, which is hitting the auto industry particularly hard. How has that affected Polestar?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EsRQIY"&gt;So far so good, but it’s definitely an issue and it is a week-by-week review of where we are, do we have the pieces together for the production? It’s definitely not predictable over the course of the next weeks and months how much the effect will be or not. This is definitely where the whole industry is in incredible difficulty in planning. [It] became a short period where you can do your planning, that it is absolutely difficult to have any prediction how it will play out over the course of the next half year. So far, we managed together with Volvo to get halfway decent through it, but definitely we have, as much as everybody else in the industry, to really monitor it week after week while we keep the production together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ib2H1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has that affected your plans for the Polestar 3? Which I think last I checked, late 2021 was the date. Are you still on track for the Polestar 3?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="96HGXS"&gt;Yes. We are on track with Polestar 3. That has not affected the plans for that car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wKNN7R"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And the Polestar 3 is your SUV, correct?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xslnW7"&gt;Yes. The Polestar 3 will be our first SUV in the car line and using that new electric platform that will be out and first with this car, and be a really awesome car. I’m so much looking forward to [it] for lots of reasons. As we said, “Look, this is actually the design statement, the direction where we are going,” and the Polestar 3 will be full-fledged in this great Polestar language and that will not be that standard SUV, like you know it today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JqOgGT"&gt;We really believe that the SUV has to change a bit when it comes to the electric age. You cannot be that high and upright in the air and at the same time, just making that coupe SUV is, as well, not our style. So, it will be a really nice, cool design statement. I mean, it’s an almost five-meter car. It’s a real big SUV for us Europeans. I know in the US you wouldn’t call it big yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q9oWYj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re a car designer. What is going on with the front end of cars? You’re designing an SUV. Are you going to put a giant grill on it or those huge BMW nostrils? What is happening? Can you stop it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zMH0Hd"&gt;Well, we will not go into that. The issue is of course, a car needs a face. You have to recognize the face, but you cannot just simply continue making this big open air intake, as a fake air intake—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PryJKR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But do you go to the bar with the designers at BMW and ask them, “Why are you doing this?” Do you tell your designers not to do that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Djuo5G"&gt;And they will come up with lots of reasons why that is good for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wOwQEe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;... It’s a small community, I’m wondering if you have insight.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ois7ip"&gt;Well, we will use the &lt;a href="https://about.polestar.com/news/precept-smartzone/"&gt;Smart Zone&lt;/a&gt; and that is what we showed, that you can see on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/26/21455850/polestar-precept-electric-car-concept-android-production"&gt;the Polestar Precept&lt;/a&gt;. We said, “Come on.” They aren’t just sensors and cameras and radars, and we nicely collect them under that transparent shield and that will be, instead of an air intake, we will have a Smart Zone and it looks super cool and electric and high-tech. So, you have to go along and I mean, instead of just having no face, I mean, of course you have to create a modern face that gives the new technology a meaning. So, we collected all of that nicely in what we call the Smart Zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u2vWXA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think that car design will get more radical as we get away from the expectations around what gas cars look like and we go towards electric cars?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LVFDbD"&gt;It was always a challenge to the designers to actually dare to not just simply continue on a path [where] your experience was successful in the past. I mean, that always has been the challenge that you have to dare to do that next step and yes, there’s no guarantee for success, but you cannot just simply recook the old recipe, and especially in times when you have the great opportunity of new technology coming. That’s always a driver of new aesthetics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="px32gm"&gt;So, of course you have to embrace it and really dare to take it, but at the same time, not do it superficially and just create a fancy new look to look different. It has to be rooted in the technology and the need for it and how you interpret it. It needs a really thorough, intellectual process of working it into something meaningful. So, whatever superficial styling comes, it will never work in the long run. You really have to do a decent job and do your homework and really try to make sense out of the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wIMZHQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s great. Well, Thomas, thank you so much for being on &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. I really appreciate the time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="leSvFz"&gt;It was a pleasure. Thanks a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pixar’s Turning Red asks ‘What if the Hulk turned into an adorable, giant red panda instead?’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z6xDNNzuyatW9FUriInqQnBv8zE=/218x0:2084x1244/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69575000/Screen_Shot_2021_07_13_at_8.32.08_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="34kAqF"&gt;Mei Lee is an ordinary 13-year-old in the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqdHP2dWQ9M"&gt;first trailer for &lt;em&gt;Turning Red&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the next film from Pixar — unless she gets stressed out or overexcited. Then she turns into a gigantic talking red panda in a massive explosion of pink smoke, not unlike an adorable version of The Incredible Hulk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nasyZf"&gt;Adding to the problem is Mei’s (Rosalie Chiang) overprotective mother, Ming (voiced by Sandra Oh), who’s seen in the trailer sneaking to watch over her at school, causing an altercation with a security guard that leads to one of Mei’s panda-sized incidents. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/etRxBqkhn_Cf9Fx9_QOoUxz9H1c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22714490/Screen_Shot_2021_07_13_at_8.32.08_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Hk6CXg"&gt;While the initial teaser doesn’t offer too many details on what sort of misadventures Mei will have (as both a teenager and a giant panda), it does bear the distinction of being the first full-length animated Disney film to be definitively set in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wPTupS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turning Red&lt;/em&gt; is also the first feature-length film from director and writer Domee Shi, who had previously worked for years as a storyboard artist at Pixar before stepping into the spotlight with her &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/culture/2018/4/24/17270946/pixar-bao-incredibles-2-director-domee-shi-tribeca"&gt;Oscar-winning short &lt;em&gt;Bao&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="IsvqhB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The director of Pixar’s Bao on the challenges of animating a living dumpling","url":"https://www.theverge.com/culture/2018/4/24/17270946/pixar-bao-incredibles-2-director-domee-shi-tribeca"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="CaxyqT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turning Red&lt;/em&gt; is set to hit theaters on March 11th, 2022, and like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22568344/encanto-trailer-disney-lin-manuel-miranda"&gt;recently teased &lt;em&gt;Encanto&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (coming from Walt Disney Animation Studios), it represents a restored faith in Disney that families, in particular, will be returning to theaters soon. The company had previously moved its last year and a half’s worth of animated films — including &lt;em&gt;Luca&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Soul&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Raya and the Last Dragon&lt;/em&gt; — to either exclusive or hybrid releases on Disney Plus due to the shuttering of theaters during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FDA adds warning about a nerve condition to the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Coronavirus - Vaccination rush also on holiday" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t6UTOEXjQ7aIKwEdCNPGj-AmLG0=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69574975/1232865115.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson’s vaccine awaits use in a freezer.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Matthias Bein / picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hmsEXN"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration added a warning to the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/146304/download"&gt;fact sheet&lt;/a&gt; for the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine saying that the shot may lead to an increased risk of a nerve condition called Guillain–Barré syndrome. The agency says that the benefits of the vaccine still outweigh the risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uwPcVM"&gt;There have been around 100 cases of the syndrome reported among the roughly 12.6 million people who have received the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/07/12/johnson-and-johnson-warning/"&gt;to &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a very rare complication, but people who have received the shot appear to be around &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/12/us/fda-warning-johnson-johnson-vaccine-nerve-syndrome.html"&gt;3 to 5 times&lt;/a&gt; more likely to develop Guillain–Barré syndrome than the general population. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LC6kVj"&gt;There’s no sign that the Moderna or Pfizer / BioNTech vaccines carry a similar risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ESJhy"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Guillain-Barr%C3%A9-Syndrome-Fact-Sheet"&gt;Guillain-Barré syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, the body’s immune system attacks the nerves. It can cause tingling in the hands and feet, weakness, and coordination problems. Most people recover fully, but it can lead to permanent nerve damage in some cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o8CF4x"&gt;The syndrome has been linked to vaccines before. The US &lt;a href="https://www.history.com/news/swine-flu-rush-vaccine-election-year-1976"&gt;stopped using&lt;/a&gt; a swine flu vaccine in 1976 after reports that people who took the vaccine developed Guillain-Barré. Some years, there is a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/guillain-barre-syndrome.html"&gt;small increased risk&lt;/a&gt; of the syndrome with the seasonal flu vaccine — usually around one or two additional cases for each 1 million flu shots administered. The CDC notes that people may be more likely to develop Guillain-Barré from the flu than from the flu shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Ez38c"&gt;This is the second health risk associated with the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine. US health agencies recommended &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381469/covid-vaccine-pause-blood-clots-johnson-fda-cdc"&gt;pausing the administration&lt;/a&gt; of the shot in April after it was linked to a rare clotting disorder. The company added a warning about the risk of the disorder, and the pause lifted after 10 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tUzlyR"&gt;Agencies have not recommended a pause on the vaccine this time. The vaccine remains available and will simply feature an additional warning label. People in the United States also have access to the Moderna and Pfizer / BioNTech vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zvd7Jm"&gt;Experts were hopeful that the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson shot would play a major role in the US vaccination campaign because it only takes one dose, instead of the two doses needed for either Moderna or Pfizer / BioNTech. So far it has been administered to &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations"&gt;less than 10 percent&lt;/a&gt; of people vaccinated in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v7HmUE"&gt;The number of people who get vaccinated each day in the US has fallen to around 500,000, down from a peak of around 3 million in April. The number of COVID-19 cases has &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html"&gt;started to climb again&lt;/a&gt; as the Delta variant takes hold around the country. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>BuyDig’s Google Nest Hub bundles are steeply discounted on eBay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jjbjSXmWiIknCMpwMolPmM-0w7E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69574923/dseifert_20210323_4485_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="besxIk"&gt;For many, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22535003/best-smart-displays-alexa-google-echo-nest"&gt;best smart display&lt;/a&gt; is the one that features whichever virtual assistant they prefer, whether it be Amazon’s Alexa or Google Assistant. However, despite its sluggish performance, it’s hard to argue against the Google Nest Hub if you’re already invested in Google’s ecosystem or own one of the many products under the Nest umbrella. The latest model touts a 7-inch display, reliable sleep tracking, and better sound, thanks to a 1.7-inch driver, rendering it more than just a premium photo frame that rolls through images you have stored in the cloud. And like all smart displays, it allows you to control every facet of your home, from your lighting and the TV to the temperature in your living room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xXdCYa"&gt;For a limited time, you can pick up a Google Nest Hub (second-gen) and a budget-friendly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21725036/google-nest-thermostat-2020-review"&gt;Nest Thermostat&lt;/a&gt; for $167 through &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F324687194939%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F7%2F13%2F22574503%2Fgoogle-nest-hub-best-buy-philips-hue-smart-bulbs-amazon-fire-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BuyDig’s official storefront&lt;/a&gt; on eBay. If you prefer a smart speaker over a thermostat, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F313593807202%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F7%2F13%2F22574503%2Fgoogle-nest-hub-best-buy-philips-hue-smart-bulbs-amazon-fire-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BuyDig is also offering&lt;/a&gt; the same Hub model with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21501300/google-nest-audio-assistant-smart-speaker-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Google Nest Audio&lt;/a&gt; for $140, more than $100 off what they would cost if you were to purchase them separately. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22357214/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-assistant-smart-display-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FmHHL3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10649377"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OhxHF6"&gt;If you’re looking to add further convenience to your home, Best Buy is offering a three-pack of &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1746038460463558648#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Philips Hue white and color smart bulbs for $135&lt;/a&gt;, one of the lowest prices we’ve seen on the popular smart home accessory in recent months. The dimmable, Bluetooth-enabled A19 bulbs allow for more than 16 million colors, and while you won’t be able to take full advantage of them without opting for the optional Hue Bridge, you’ll still be able to shuffle through the full spectrum of colors with just a few taps on your smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ax2Ib2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10649409"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The apt-titled Cube essentially represents the middle ground between a streaming device and a smart speaker, while offering the same functionality found on the like-minded Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K. The capable streamer features support for Dolby Vision, HDR10, and HDR10+, for instance, along with hands-free functionality and a hexa-core processor that ensures the Cube’s interface is the snappiest of all Amazon’s current streaming devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xIB816"&gt;Normally $120, the Fire TV Cube is currently available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/all-new-fire-tv-cube-with-alexa-voice-remote/dp/B07KGVB6D6/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Famazon-fire-tv-cube-16gb-2nd-gen-streaming-media-player-with-voice-remote-black%2F6375372.p%3FacampID%3D0%26cmp%3DRMX%26irclickid%3DQJaSroQtuxyLRzW0UfQwQyYMUkByT7SkExnTVM0%26irgwc%3D1%26loc%3DNarrativ%26mpid%3D376373%26ref%3D198%26skuId%3D6375372&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-fire-tv-cube-4k-uhd%2F-%2FA-79829325%3Fref%3Dtgt_adv_XS000000%26AFID%3Dgoogle_pla_df_free_local%26CPNG%3DElectronics%26adgroup%3D8-6%26clkid%3D7b1bfd5dNc95f11eb971842010a246ff0%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target for $100&lt;/a&gt;, which is nearly the lowest price we’ve seen on the streaming device outside of Amazon Prime Day. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/10/20907056/amazon-fire-tv-cube-2nd-gen-2019-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Keeping a steady hand while shooting video on your phone is rarely easy, however, which is why picking up a stabilizer like the DJI Osmo Mobile 3 isn’t a bad way to go if you’re looking to achieve a more professional look while on the move. The foldable, last-gen gimbal provides solid object tracking, 15 hours of battery life, and the ability to switch from landscape to portrait mode in a flash, as well as a “Sports Mode” for those times when you need the gimbal to move just a bit quicker.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood has figured out how to monetize financial nihilism</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9GP1isuQSB1rrZRQCA19VEWKkT4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69574757/acastro_210201_1777_robinhood_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;And the financial system only has itself to thank&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="aALQOn"&gt;It’s sometimes hard to identify era-defining moments when they happen; usually you can only really see them after the wave rolls back. Helpfully, Robinhood has given us &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1783879/000162828021013318/robinhoods-1.htm#ib5a32e8afc3b422193a2f2891a49e0c9_842"&gt;a high place to stand&lt;/a&gt; so we can see a little farther — though I don’t think that’s the point of its S-1, which is a document filed in order to make an IPO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBpZq8"&gt;Robinhood, you may recall, has been controversial. Just before the S-1 landed, we discovered a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557419/robinhood-finra-fine-70-million"&gt;$70 million fine from FINRA&lt;/a&gt;, a finance industry corporation that regulates its members; Robinhood was fined for — among other things — failing to protect its customers. This is the largest fine it’s ever handed out. (Seems weird to me that $53 million is for FINRA and only $17 million is for the investors who FINRA says were harmed, but whatever, finance industry gonna finance industry.) Anyway this is the consequences of those &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373990/robinhood-ipo-form-regulators-finance"&gt;whoopsie outages&lt;/a&gt; in March 2020 around major trading days. Robinhood has also had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22388447/robinhood-app-dogecoin-rally-failed-trades"&gt;oopsies around Dogecoin in April&lt;/a&gt;, so I guess we’ll find out if anyone cares about that sometime next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="OFkQM7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Robinhood app has lovely design, but the app isn’t the product&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T2zUFd"&gt;Robinhood’s messiness is part of the fun. There’s like, six pages of lawsuit disclosures in the S-1, including 50 class-actions stemming from January alone, some beef with the Securities and Exchange Commission, allegations from Massachusetts that Robinhood’s broken some laws, New York&lt;em&gt; just asking questions &lt;/em&gt;about money laundering, and so on. Oh, and the Northern California US Attorney’s Office has CEO Vlad Tenev’s cell phone. (The actual phone, not just his number.) On the positive side, Robinhood has settled a civil suit brought by the family of Alex Kearns, a 20-year-old novice trader &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/robinhood-sued-by-family-of-alex-kearns-20-year-old-trader-who-killed-himself-.html"&gt;who killed himself&lt;/a&gt; wrongly believing he’d lost more than $700,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kml2c7"&gt;Messiness aside, the financials suggest that Robinhood had a good Q1! There were 18 million “net cumulative funded accounts” on Robinhood by the end of the first quarter, according to the document. That’s 44 percent growth over the end of 2020, when there were 12.5 million such accounts. If you can cast your mind back to last January, there was that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;GameStonk thing&lt;/a&gt;, where a bunch of retail traders piled into GameStop and sent the shares, in their parlance, &lt;em&gt;to the moon&lt;/em&gt;. Robinhood caught some flack — and, apparently, a pile of lawsuits — for restricting trading during that period, but it looks like the entire episode was a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287381/robinhood-citadel-financial-services-house-day-traders"&gt;net positive&lt;/a&gt;, even if it did piss some users off! &lt;em&gt;Laissez le bon temps rouler, bébé.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o1YntO"&gt;But let’s talk about &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/robinhoods-debut-is-clouded-by-sec-scrutiny-of-payment-for-order-flow-11625655600?mod=djemalertNEWS"&gt;payment for order flow&lt;/a&gt;, which, whew, 81 percent of first-quarter revenue! (Man, I’d personally put some eggs in another basket.) That tells you who Robinhood’s &lt;em&gt;clients&lt;/em&gt; are: Citadel et al, the people who pay for its service. So what, exactly, are they buying? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5wVivU"&gt;Look, the Robinhood app has lovely design, but the app isn’t the product. Trades from Robinhood users are Robinhood’s real product. The main insight Robinhood had was that in a mobile-first world, they could outflank other brokerages by reaching retail customers. They were right about that! But it means we have to be clear about what the real value in the financial system looks like: data, and fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="YCMfII"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Robinhood’s retail customers are n00bs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UxkrLo"&gt;Robinhood loves to brag that it is giving access to people who have never traded before. To my eye, however, it seems like Robinhood is advertising that most of its users are &lt;a href="https://www.partypoker.com/en/how-to-play/school/advanced/tips/spot-a-fish"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not &lt;em&gt;impossible&lt;/em&gt; for a novice to enter the markets, understand them, and make money... but, man, it’s weird out here. Like, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-08/stablecoin-issuer-circle-to-go-public-in-4-5-billion-spac-deal"&gt;a stablecoin issuer is trying to SPAC&lt;/a&gt; for a cool $4.5 billion &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7676451f-23a9-42eb-a179-c3ebbcfc0bff"&gt;without saying exactly what’s backing the stablecoin&lt;/a&gt;. If you did not understand that sentence, that’s because&lt;em&gt; it’s fucking nonsense.&lt;/em&gt; I wish all the first-time investors the absolute best of luck in the markets; they will need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XpYWfS"&gt;Goldman Sachs, underwriter of Robinhood’s S-1, is doing this IPO for the fees, as are the other banks listed. The big money is &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-01-24/goldman-won-t-underwrite-just-anyone?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;serving as a middleman&lt;/a&gt; in a maximum number of transactions; Goldman made a couple billion on its &lt;a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/media-relations/press-releases/current/pdfs/2021-q1-results.pdf"&gt;underwriting business alone in Q1&lt;/a&gt;. Citadel is one of Robinhood’s actual clients; it works as a market maker, and to encourage Robinhood to route its trades to Citadel so Citadel can make money on &lt;a href="https://a16z.com/2021/02/17/payment-for-order-flow/"&gt;the bid-ask spread&lt;/a&gt;, it engages in payment for order flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kappUE"&gt;The setup means that Robinhood makes its money when users trade. The more frequent the trading, the more money Robinhood makes. This is part of what makes the mobile-first design on Robinhood noteworthy — it’s a trading app for a group of users who are accustomed to reacting to our smartphone notifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A7xH5B"&gt;But it is also important to understand that Robinhood’s retail customers are n00bs. (They phrase it more politely, like this: “We take pride in the fact that we are expanding the market by welcoming new investors into the financial system.”) They’re also pretty young — about 70 percent of the assets under Robinhood’s custody come from people aged 18 to 40. Robinhood continues “to welcome an increasing proportion of women to our platform,” a hilariously indirect phrase. What do we think, ladies? Is Robinhood 70 percent men? 90 percent men? 95 percent? I wouldn’t have to contemptuously speculate if that number were &lt;em&gt;in the document&lt;/em&gt;, you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="lblahc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Intense buying by Robinhood users forecast negative returns”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VzOlzm"&gt;The default settings on the Robinhood app turn on notifications for price movements; the user can choose whether the threshold is 5 percent or 10 percent. (There are also notifications for 52-week highs and lows.) It’s possible those notifications encourage users to make trades that aren’t in their interests; impulse selling, for instance. Of course, users can turn them off, but companies get to choose the default. The default for Robinhood isn’t to encourage buy-and-hold by requiring users to manually check in on their investments, allowing them to forget about them most of the time; instead, Robinhood wants to send notifications for movement, which might inspire trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EjcC8u"&gt;Now, &lt;a href="https://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/papers/Day%20Traders/Day%20Trading%20and%20Learning%20110217.pdf"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href="http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/papers/Day%20Traders/Day%20Trading%20Skill%20110523.pdf"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; shows that day traders &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-15/day-traders-in-brazil-study-would-ve-done-better-with-9-to-5-job"&gt;mostly lose money&lt;/a&gt;. And research that focuses on Robinhood specifically shows that their traders are &lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3776874"&gt;mostly noise&lt;/a&gt;. During “herding events,” when Robinhood users all crowd into a stock together, “intense buying by Robinhood users forecast negative returns,” &lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3715077"&gt;researchers found&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ry10mR"&gt;The users also seem to be crowding into weird assets. Robinhood was a part of the GameStonk mass meme, and also made almost $30 million on Dogecoin in the first quarter, a frankly astounding amount of money to make on a shitcoin. It is &lt;em&gt;especially &lt;/em&gt;astonishing, as &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-07-02/robinhood-ipo-filing-is-a-lesson-in-meme-finance"&gt;Bloomberg’s Matt Levine points out&lt;/a&gt;, that Robinhood made that much money in the quarter &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; Dogecoin peaked. “Robinhood is the brokerage for fun gambling on meme stocks and meme cryptocurrencies,” Levine writes. And that is great for Robinhood’s customers, including Citadel!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Mxytxs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Meme trades aren’t the cause of widespread distrust, they’re the symptoms of it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bO49wY"&gt;Okay, but what are the users getting out of it? Levine thinks &lt;em&gt;fun gambling,&lt;/em&gt; and that might be right, given the age bracket. Take the meme stocks — in June, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/03/business/dealbook/amc-meme-stocks.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; wrote&lt;/a&gt; of them that “when stock prices are divorced from fundamentals, it cements the public perception that markets can be manipulated — by a small group of insiders or a large group of determined traders — and therefore can’t be trusted.” This is exactly backwards. That ship sailed a decade ago for everyone with student loan debt who couldn’t get a job because of the 2008 financial crisis, a result of Wall Street’s wild betting on the housing market. Oh, and the &lt;em&gt;adults&lt;/em&gt; who were &lt;a href="https://dealbreaker.com/2012/08/sp-has-a-perfectly-good-explanation-for-rating-deals-structured-by-cows-which-a-lucky-federal-jury-will-get-to-hear"&gt;supposed to protect us by evaluating risk&lt;/a&gt;? Why, they were telling each other that those deals’ models didn’t &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122471995644960797"&gt;adequately capture the real risks&lt;/a&gt;. But it didn’t matter — the deals could even be “structured by cows and we would rate them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aTb8Tf"&gt;Are there any people under the age of 40 who have ever&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;thought markets were something besides a casino? Meme trades aren’t the &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt; of widespread distrust, they’re the &lt;em&gt;symptoms&lt;/em&gt; of it. And those people under 40 who think finance is for gambling? They’re the lucrative part of Robinhood’s user base. Legal issues aside, it seems like Robinhood has a good business model for monetizing financial nihilism — which is the kind of thing investors might get excited about. Whether that’s good for Robinhood’s users or the financial system at large isn’t a question the S-1 is designed to answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="o7IfC8"&gt;You know who Robinhood might be good for, though? Tenev and his co-founder, Baiju Bhatt, who stand to get &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-robinhood-gives-founders-second-chance-14-billion-windfall-2021-07-09/"&gt;stock awards worth an estimated $1.4 billion&lt;/a&gt; as executive compensation if Robinhood’s shares trade high enough.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s latest glass speaker is a more affordable dose of bizarre design</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2ydqGryP2jvVKLSdHXR-dCasp6Y=/1x0:1050x699/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69574730/1__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The speaker features a “candlelight mode.”&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5Rgnf7"&gt;Sony is releasing another one of its glass lantern speaker hybrids, and it comes in at $100 less than its predecessor. The &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sony-electronics-introduces-new-lspx-s3-glass-sound-speaker-creating-a-warm-and-inviting-atmosphere-in-any-space-301331110.html"&gt;LSPX-S3&lt;/a&gt; is a $349 wireless Bluetooth speaker that vibrates a glass tube to act as a tweeter, which Sony says allows it to send sound in all directions around it. There’s also a light inside the glass with 32 different brightness levels, allowing the speaker to act as a bedside lamp or candle-replacement on the dinner table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dmimdZ"&gt;As its name suggests, the LSPX-S3 is Sony’s third with this unusual form-factor, and it’s also the cheapest yet. The original LSPX-S1 sold for $799 after its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/25/11501594/sony-glass-sound-speakers-magnificent-expensive"&gt;launch in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="https://electronics.sony.com/audio/audio-components/hi-res-audio/p/lspxs2"&gt;the LSPX-S2 cost $449&lt;/a&gt;. The third-generation speaker is still expensive (at $349), but the thought of buying two of them to pair together in stereo no longer seems patently ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dn3UTfQS2OM6Z6hL0lVXYt5qGKQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22714417/9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The glass tube serves as the speaker’s tweeter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xs96Oq"&gt;Alongside its glass tweeter, the LSPX-S3 also has a mid-range driver and a passive radiator for low-end notes. Battery life is rated for up to 8 hours, it charges over USB-C, and there’s support for Sony’s LDAC codec — which we consider the gold standard for Bluetooth audio if you’ve got a device that supports it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uEh6c4"&gt;Sony’s new glass speaker will be available to order from August.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>We want to see your internet bill</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OOFEWsVJrdkLKqootfNKmReCweU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69574700/acastro_170711_1777_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="62mluZ"&gt;You don’t always get what you pay for in internet access. Most places only have one option, so you’re stuck picking the good plan or the bad plan from a single carrier, and if the expensive “broadband” plan turns out to be closer to dial-up speeds, there isn’t much you can do. And that’s without getting into the big swaths of the country that don’t even have a broadband option on the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lEklvk"&gt;So we’re joining with &lt;em&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/em&gt; to take a close look at the problem, collecting as many internet bills as we can to get a sense of which telecoms are holding up their end of the bargain — and which ones are falling short. The idea is to get a bird’s-eye view of the speeds people are actually getting, and what they’re paying for those speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HIG77B"&gt;To get there, &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/upload/broadband/?EXTKEY=BBA17EET1F"&gt;we want to take a look at your internet bill&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/em&gt; has put together a site to collect your information and do a quick speed test. The whole thing should take about seven minutes, and you’ll be doing your part to build a better internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jqnNBK"&gt;A few quick notes on privacy: your bill will be encrypted as soon as you update it, and &lt;em&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/em&gt; has pledged to only record relevant data such as price, bundle, speed, and hidden fees, and they’ll delete bills when they’re no longer needed. The site will ask you to create a login as a way to keep the information private and safe, but you won’t have to pay for anything and no personally identifiable information will be shared with outside researchers. You can get more answers about the specifics &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/member-support/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TGUVIC"&gt;We’re hoping this project will give us tens of thousands of bills to pore through, and spur on some great investigations for later on in the year. So &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/upload/broadband/?EXTKEY=BBA17EET1F"&gt;head over to the site and show us your bill&lt;/a&gt; — and in a few months, we’ll tell you what we found.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube’s TikTok competitor YouTube Shorts is rolling out globally</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/juIwLzvirtAuXeatna55CVymfTk=/0x0:3300x2200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69574531/Home.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8407lx"&gt;YouTube’s TikTok competitor, YouTube Shorts, is now rolling out globally. The service launched first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436158/youtube-starts-tiktok-competitor-short-form-video-instagram-reels-beta-test"&gt;in India last year&lt;/a&gt;, before expanding to around 26 countries including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22334540/youtube-shorts-us-beta-tiktok-competition-launch"&gt;the US&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22518828/youtube-shorts-audio-sample-feature-uk-launch"&gt;the UK&lt;/a&gt;. Now YouTube Shorts, which is still in beta, will be available “across more than 100 countries around the world where YouTube is available.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x07o4W"&gt;YouTube Shorts is playing catchup to TikTok as the short-form video platform of choice, but Google’s service is pushing Shorts’ integration with the wider YouTube ecosystem as a key selling point. It recently added the ability for Shorts creators to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22518828/youtube-shorts-audio-sample-feature-uk-launch"&gt;sample audio from YouTube videos&lt;/a&gt;, and says it’s exploring ways to offer quick links from Shorts to YouTube videos they’ve taken samples from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hnfBI6"&gt;Ironically, while YouTube is going to great lengths to emulate TikTok’s format, TikTok is experimenting with formats that are closer to YouTube’s traditional focus. It recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558856/tiktok-videos-three-minutes-length"&gt;tripled its maximum video length&lt;/a&gt; to three minutes for everyone, and has been slowly rolling out apps on TV platforms like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264642/tiktok-android-tv-launch-not-working-google"&gt;Android TV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573707/tiktok-fire-tv-app-uk-france-germany-smart-tv"&gt;Fire TV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PC market growth slows amid global chip shortages</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GUniDEa74RZMelqP27eR9oyHxEU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69574512/akrales_190930_3689_0056.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZeTBGP"&gt;The PC market is showing early signs of its growth slowing down, after an impressive run of shipments throughout 2020. Both &lt;a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS48069721"&gt;IDC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-07-12-gartner-says-worldwide-pc-shipments-grew-4-point-six-in-second-quarter-of-2021"&gt;Gartner&lt;/a&gt; conclude that growth in the second quarter of PC shipments has slowed this year. Demand for new PCs is still above what we saw before the pandemic hit, but a mixture of softer demand and the effects of the global chip shortage mean it’s not growing as quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pPJ0PG"&gt;“The market faces mixed signals as far as demand is concerned,” says Neha Mahajan, a senior research analyst at IDC. “With businesses opening back up, demand potential in the commercial segment appears promising. However, there are also early indicators of consumer demand slowing down as people shift spending priorities after nearly a year of aggressive PC buying.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xsfmfd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The market faces mixed signals as far as demand is concerned”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1hvCRw"&gt;IDC says more than 83 million PCs were shipped in the second quarter of 2021, while Gartner’s own figure is more than 71 million. Gartner does not include Chromebook shipments in its results, but the research firm says “Chromebook shipments were once again strong in the second quarter of 2021.” Either way, both firms agree that year-over-year growth in this latest quarter wasn’t as strong as 2020’s sudden growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="49cZN5"&gt;That doesn’t mean PC sales are about to suddenly plummet, but the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225356/pc-sales-shipments-2020-growth-idc-canalys-remote-work"&gt;first big growth we saw in a decade&lt;/a&gt; could be starting to wane. Lenovo is still the top PC manufacturer worldwide, and Gartner says Apple, Acer, and Asus all grew faster than the overall market thanks to better availability of consumer PCs. “The consumer PC market was less impacted by shortages than the enterprise market, as vendors can be more flexible in the system design of consumer models, enabling workarounds for certain supply constraints,” says Gartner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TVCSsc"&gt;While there are clearly early signs of slowing growth in the PC market, Microsoft and its OEM partners will be hoping to revitalize PCs even further later this year. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22553666/microsoft-windows-11-october-20th-release-date-hint-rumor"&gt;Windows 11 will likely arrive in October&lt;/a&gt;, and Microsoft’s minimum &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555371/microsoft-windows-11-cpu-support-hardware-requirements-tpm-response"&gt;hardware requirements&lt;/a&gt; mean many will need to upgrade PCs. A new version of Windows always comes with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/15/9544645/microsoft-intel-dell-lenovo-hp-pc-does-what"&gt;big marketing campaigns&lt;/a&gt;, and Windows 11 will be no different.
