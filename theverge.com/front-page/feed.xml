    <title>Microsoft is now a $2 trillion company</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZaDnTb"&gt;Microsoft can add &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/06/24/microsoft-closes-above-2-trillion-for-first-time"&gt;ending the day as a $2 trillion company&lt;/a&gt; to the list of things it’s accomplished today, alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22546791/microsoft-windows-11-announcement-features-updates"&gt;announcing Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;. That makes it the second American publicly traded company ever to have a market capitalization of over $2 trillion (the other member of the club being Apple, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21375223/apple-2-trillion-market-cap-first-us-company-stock-price"&gt;which achieved it in August 2020&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/22/tech/microsoft-2-trillion-market-cap/index.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;CNN Business&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TkPpPq"&gt;It’s easy to see how 2020 contributed to Microsoft’s success: the PC market &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225356/pc-sales-shipments-2020-growth-idc-canalys-remote-work"&gt;grew by over 10 percent in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, according to estimates from IDC and Canalys, and seems &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22380920/pc-market-q1-growth-year-over-year-chip-shortage-covid-demand"&gt;to have kept some of that momentum&lt;/a&gt; this year. Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21334725/microsoft-q4-2020-earnings-azure-surface-xbox-gains-growth-profits-sales"&gt;also saw success&lt;/a&gt; with with its Surface devices, Xbox content, and cloud services — the company says its Intelligent Cloud segment &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2FInvestor%2Fearnings%2FFY-2020-Q4%2Fsegment-revenues" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;brought in $48 billion alone&lt;/a&gt; in its 2020 fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LQifFL"&gt;There’s also, of course, the aforementioned announcement of Windows 11, which could drive upgrades for people whose computers don’t &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/microsoft/22544171/microsoft-windows-11-system-requirements-hardware"&gt;meet the minimum requirements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="krLdwQ"&gt;The company’s market cap briefly rose above $2 trillion &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/22/tech/microsoft-2-trillion-market-cap/index.html"&gt;earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, but it had fallen ever so slightly below the mark by the time markets closed. Today, Microsoft was able to make it to market closing with a cap of $2.009 trillion, &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT?p=MSFT"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Yahoo Finance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reddit recovers from major outage </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rQ2APLAogSFb5qS1A8E_IMBtVnM=/81x67:1151x780/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69501469/Screen_Shot_2021_06_24_at_3.20.17_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reddit’s error page.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Reddit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y7awr5"&gt;Reddit was down for many on Thursday, but the company has implemented a fix and the site seems to be working normally. While the outage was going on, Reddit would regularly take a while to try to load a page before showing an error screen with error code 503. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ic34n1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.redditstatus.com/"&gt;On its status page&lt;/a&gt;, Reddit first reported an “elevated level of API errors” at 5:04PM ET Thursday, but &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/reddit/"&gt;Downdetector showed&lt;/a&gt; a huge spike of user reports of problems shortly after. (At their peak, reports surpassed 40,000.) At 6:51PM ET, Reddit said a fix was being implemented, and at 7:18PM ET, &lt;a href="https://www.redditstatus.com/incidents/3710db57k6n8"&gt;Reddit said the fix was in place&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wsB15vpWmM5q38QVVMsRqxBOWAo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22680198/image.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;What you might see when you try to load Reddit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="305erl"&gt;During the outage, the company also took to Twitter to assure users that its “team of Technical People” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Reddit/status/1408196051241029635"&gt;was working on the issues&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1BTTbp"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Sounds like some of you are experiencing issues accessing Reddit — fear not, our team of Technical People is working on it!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pls don't shoot the messenger,&lt;br&gt;social media manager&lt;/p&gt;— Reddit (@Reddit) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Reddit/status/1408196051241029635?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PyBz3n"&gt;Reddit didn’t reply to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gRiMky"&gt;This isn’t Reddit’s first recent outage — the site went down for almost an hour &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419545/reddit-partial-outage-down"&gt;in May&lt;/a&gt;. And Reddit was also taken down by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523953/twitch-reddit-down-fastly-outage-issues"&gt;huge global web outage in June&lt;/a&gt; that also affected sites like Amazon, Twitch, and even us here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;That outage was caused by issues with the Fastly content delivery network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7vt47U"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 24th, 7:41PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Reddit says the outage has been fixed, so we have updated this article accordingly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is supporting AMD’s answer to DLSS on Xbox consoles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KrgnTG4QrlAonCramQjA-0lTbuI=/142x0:1650x1005/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69501671/xboxamdfsr.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fpJH50"&gt;Microsoft is enabling Xbox developers to utilize AMD’s answer to Nvidia’s DLSS on console games. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22545441/amd-dlss-fidelityfx-super-resolution-fsr-supersampling-tests-benchmarks"&gt;FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) appeared recently&lt;/a&gt; on Windows PCs with the aim of boosting frame rates and maintaining image quality. It’s AMD’s answer to Nvidia’s Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) and early tests have shown it’s a promising technology that will work across multiple games and platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X9HLxp"&gt;FSR is now making its way to Xbox games, too. Microsoft has started previewing support for FSR in its Game Development Kit for both Windows and Xbox today. “It’s supported on Windows, Xbox Series X and S, and Xbox One consoles,” says Jason Ronald, Microsoft’s director of Xbox program management. “FSR was designed to enable developers to achieve higher frame rates and resolutions with minimal work for developers across both console and PC.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bScrVg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Excited to continue our close partnership with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AMD?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AMD&lt;/a&gt; and see what game developers can do with FidelityFX Super Resolution, available to preview in our GDK today for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Windows?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Windows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Xbox?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Xbox&lt;/a&gt; Series X|S and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XboxOne?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#XboxOne&lt;/a&gt; consoles. &lt;a href="https://t.co/A446cNRUug"&gt;pic.twitter.com/A446cNRUug&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jason Ronald (@jronald) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jronald/status/1408156048179879936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DYb95m"&gt;The preview means it will be a while until Xbox games can take advantage of higher frame rates with FSR, but we’d expect to see it appear once Xbox games can be fully certified with FSR support. That’s likely to be some months away yet, so realistically we won’t see FSR appear in Xbox games until later this year or even early 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="daAmA7"&gt;Still, it’s encouraging to see Xbox support FSR early on. We reached out to AMD to clarify when this will be coming to PS5, but AMD isn’t commenting on that yet. Given the wide support across both AMD and Nvidia GPUs on PC, we’re fully expecting to see FSR appear on PS5 at some point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YDdkNR"&gt;Sony’s PS5 is currently lacking VRR or 1440p support on the PS5, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302646/sony-ps5-ssd-expansion-coming-summer-report"&gt;long-awaited M.2 SSD slot&lt;/a&gt; still hasn’t been enabled, so FSR support could be on Sony’s list of things to do. Sony has opened up a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538335/sony-ps5-beta-software-system-features-sign-up"&gt;PS5 beta program&lt;/a&gt; ahead of its next major system update, so fingers crossed we hear more about FSR support or the other missing PS5 features soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Thermapen One promises to make the best meat thermometer even better</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NBID9YftBCio6HIqabguTCZFVOY=/208x0:2197x1326/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69501379/Screen_Shot_2021_06_24_at_5.19.23_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZdZfdl"&gt;The ThermoWorks Thermapen is legendary among chefs as the gold standard in kitchen thermometers, affording the fastest and most reliable temperature readings around. And today, the company has revealed its latest model: &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thermoworks.com%2Fthermapen-one%3Fquantity%3D1%26color%3D16&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F24%2F22548839%2Fthermoworks-one-meat-thermometer-faster-grilling" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the $105 Thermapen One&lt;/a&gt;, which promises to achieve even faster temperature readings: less than a second (hence the name).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uTafjq"&gt;ThermoWorks says the new thermometer is the only sub-second instant-read thermometer that can take a “full temperature reading” — technically five full readings in order to reduce uncertainty — without using estimations or predictive algorithms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bd8HEP"&gt;The company says it spent more than five years developing the new thermometer, which features an improved thermocouple system developed in conjunction with Electronic Temperature Instruments to balance the faster speed with the delicate electronics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="k6UbSc"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wjyNBPPDN1s?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YvVVBz"&gt;In addition to the faster sensor, the Thermapen One also adds a few quality-of-life features, including a brighter backlight that’s better at adapting to ambient light and a redesigned battery door that’s easier to open (which does still require a screwdriver to maintain its IP67 water resistance, something that’s important given that it’s meant to be used in kitchens). It also has a longer five-year warranty, which is good to see given its relatively expensive price tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X3Tqh0"&gt;Admittedly, the Thermapen One is probably overkill for most home chefs; ThermoWorks offers a cheaper $35 &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thermoworks.com%2FThermoPop%3Futm_source%3Dgoogle_shopping%26utm_medium%3Dorganic%26gclid%3DCj0KCQjw2tCGBhCLARIsABJGmZ71CgKqvS0azm5AfBNQsrAmG9sIXHsOFXJU8hnOCchkydwJ9gxPYCMaApq4EALw_wcB&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F24%2F22548839%2Fthermoworks-one-meat-thermometer-faster-grilling" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Thermopop thermometer&lt;/a&gt; that can achieve readings in a comparatively glacial three to four seconds. But if you’re the kind of chef who really needs to-the-second or absolutely accurate temperature readings, the new Thermapen One seems like a great option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yIvUnP"&gt;The Thermapen One renders the old Thermapen Mk4 obsolete, and it will be sold at a slightly higher $105 price point. If you’re a chef on a budget who can tolerate ever-so-slightly longer speeds, the company is selling out the rest of the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thermoworks.com%2FThermapen-Mk4%3Fquantity%3D1%26color%3D16%26utm_source%3Dgoogle_shopping%26utm_medium%3Dorganic%26gclid%3DCj0KCQjw2tCGBhCLARIsABJGmZ5y7bUdnnkyOayQ47wUPobhwDz2Pk5OOoS8E_4uGXldqiqlSjWD4dsaAr3hEALw_wcB&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F24%2F22548839%2Fthermoworks-one-meat-thermometer-faster-grilling" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mk4 models at a discounted $69 price&lt;/a&gt;. Preorders for the Thermapen One start today, with shipping starting in mid-July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g5dSRQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 7:15PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new battery door does still require a Philips-head screwdriver to replace the AAA battery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Baltimore spy plane program was invasion of citizens’ privacy, court rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fh6MOCVnn-PokR65GjPMsxxey1s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69501249/acastro_190204_1777_privacy_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fN6L0i"&gt;The city of Baltimore’s spy plane program was unconstitutional, violating the Fourth Amendment protection against illegal search, and law enforcement in the city cannot use any of the data it gathered, &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22680040/fourth_circuit_decision_baltimore_june_24_2021.pdf"&gt;a court ruled Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. The Aerial Investigation Research (or AIR) program, which used airplanes and high-resolution cameras to record what was happening in a 32-square-mile part of the city, was &lt;a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/bs-md-pol-plane-canceled-20210203-ha3ixtgiyfg4rpgmfftrsd6uwu-story.html"&gt;canceled by the city &lt;/a&gt;in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DKTCqd"&gt;Local Black activist groups, with support from the ACLU, sued to prevent Baltimore law enforcement from using any of the data it had collected in the time the program was up and running. The city tried to argue the case was moot since the program had been canceled. That didn’t sit well with civil liberties activists. “Government agencies have a history of secretly using similar technology for other purposes — including to surveil Black Lives Matter protests in Baltimore in recent years,” the ACLU said in a &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/federal-appeals-court-rules-baltimore-aerial-surveillance-program-unconstitutional"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j58UDW"&gt;In an en banc ruling, the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit found that “because the AIR program enables police to deduce from the whole of individuals’ movements, we hold that accessing its data is a search and its warrantless operation violates the Fourth Amendment.” Chief Judge Roger Gregory wrote that the AIR program “is like a 21st century general search, enabling the police to collect all movements,” and that “allowing the police to wield this power unchecked is anathema to the values enshrined in our Fourth Amendment.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="er7D1l"&gt;The AIR program was run by a company called Persistent Surveillance Systems &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/9a3nyp/baltimore-police-cant-explain-why-their-all-seeing-spy-planes-were-kept-secret"&gt;with funding from two Texas billionaires&lt;/a&gt;. The city police department admitted to using planes to surveil Baltimore residents in 2016 but approved a six-month pilot program in 2020, which was active until October 31st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TMTJPu"&gt;City authorities said the AIR program was meant to help stem violent crime, and a district court had ruled that the program was capable only of short-term tracking and that people weren’t necessarily identifiable in the images collected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nonpf4"&gt;But the Fourth Circuit majority said that assessment wasn’t accurate and said since the AIR program “opens ‘an intimate window’ into a person’s associations and activities, it violates the reasonable expectation of privacy individuals have in the whole of their movements.” The court added that the AIR program surveillance “transcends mere augmentation of ordinary police capabilities. People understand that they may be filmed by security cameras on city streets, or a police officer could stake out their house and tail them for a time.... But capturing everyone’s movements outside during the daytime for 45 days goes beyond that ordinary capacity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r5uBLX"&gt;Plaintiff Dayvon Love, director of public policy for Leaders of a Beautiful Struggle, said in a statement Thursday that his organization had maintained that aerial surveillance isn’t a legitimate or effective means for making Baltimore’s communities safer. “We have always sought to challenge the racial imbued ideology of police-ism: the belief that all urban problems must be addressed primarily or exclusively through the lens of policing,” Love said. “And we are gratified that Chief Judge Gregory saw the importance of that challenge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XbWkhW"&gt;The Baltimore Police Department did not immediately reply to a request for comment Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon is acquiring a podcast hosting and monetization platform</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PfFwq5QOFbzG4r8bNnNKsWbXUtI=/0x0:710x473/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69501005/amazonmusicart19.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Amazon Music&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MZAWyd"&gt;Amazon Music is getting more serious about its podcast endeavors. Today, the company &lt;a href="https://podcasters.amazon.com/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s acquiring Art19, a major podcast hosting and monetization platform for an undisclosed sum. This means Amazon will now have a hand in hosting podcasters’ shows as well as selling ads against them because Art19 operates an ad marketplace that targets and inserts ads into programming. We’ve reached out to Amazon Music to learn more about what this acquisition might mean for podcasters who host on the service and will update if we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cRZYor"&gt;This is a major step for Amazon as it looks to take on a bigger role in the podcasting world. Amazon Music only started offering podcasts in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21439531/amazon-music-podcasts-prime-titles"&gt;September last year&lt;/a&gt;, as did Audible &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536963/amazon-free-podcast-update-catalog"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt;. But in the time since, Amazon Music has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/30/22098312/amazon-music-wondery-acquire-buy-podcast-industry"&gt;acquired Wondery&lt;/a&gt;, one of the last major independent podcast networks. Today’s acquisition gives it a fuller role in the industry. Not only will it make content through Wondery and distribute shows through its app, but now, Amazon can host those podcasts, as well as third parties’, and sell ads against them. This gives Amazon even more data about what’s happening both inside and outside its app. (Amazon Music already &lt;a href="https://advertising.amazon.com/solutions/products/audio-ads"&gt;sells audio ads&lt;/a&gt;, so Art19’s business might complement that work.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9cPTvU"&gt;We’ve seen this same scenario already play out with Spotify. The company started out making content-based acquisitions, like that of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/6/18213462/spotify-podcasts-gimlet-anchor-acquisition"&gt;Gimlet Media&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/26/18282301/spotify-podcasts-parcast-acquisition-gimlet-media-anchor"&gt;Parcast&lt;/a&gt;, but then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21557458/spotify-megaphone-podcast-streaming-ad-insertion"&gt;acquired Megaphone&lt;/a&gt;, an Art19 competitor. In that case, Spotify has focused on bringing a proprietary ad-serving technology to the platform, called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/8/21056336/spotify-streaming-ad-insertion-technology-ces-launch"&gt;Streaming Ad Insertion&lt;/a&gt;, in order to encourage podcasters to move over to the hosting service and take advantage of its ad marketplace. Other companies in the space have also taken a similar position. iHeartMedia &lt;a href="https://www.tritondigital.com/news-item/February-17-2021/iheartmedia-to-acquire-triton-digital-from-scripps"&gt;acquired Triton Digital&lt;/a&gt;, and SXM Media acquired Midroll, an ad-serving marketplace and platform, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/13/21315911/siriusxm-stitcher-podcast-deal-buy-midroll-earwolf"&gt;in July&lt;/a&gt;. As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22287309/podcast-iheart-media-triton-digital-acquire-spotify"&gt;we said&lt;/a&gt; in February, the podcasting business isn’t only about the flashy exclusive content deals, but who can sell and monetize shows.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft will let devs keep every penny their Windows app makes — unless it’s a game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TJB6DMAmoyceCvC1nAVMTvyEH_w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69500961/acastro_180507_1777_microsoft_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LFZuGI"&gt;As part of its Windows 11 announcements on Thursday, Microsoft revealed &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/06/24/building-a-new-open-microsoft-store-on-windows-11/"&gt;a major policy change&lt;/a&gt; to incentivize developers to make apps for the Microsoft Store: starting on July 28th, if a developer uses their own or a third-party payment system in their app, Microsoft will let them keep 100 percent of the revenue. But the deal has one important caveat: it doesn’t apply to games, Microsoft confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Uher5"&gt;That omission further muddies the ongoing debate about the differences between an app and a game and app store policies around each — a distinction that is one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436014/apple-roblox-epic-fortnite-trial-what-is-game-name-change"&gt;core issues&lt;/a&gt; in the ongoing legal battle between &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;-maker Epic Games and Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FKSjej"&gt;Microsoft is largely on the side of apps and games being different because its bottom line depends on it. During the Epic trial, the company testified that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422691/microsoft-xbox-consoles-profit-software-services-revenue-apple-epic-games-trial"&gt;sells expensive Xbox hardware at a loss&lt;/a&gt; and makes its profits from the 30 percent cut it takes of game sales and subscriptions. But it also seemed like Microsoft was saying that PC games were different: the company recently announced that it would lower its cut of game revenues in the Microsoft Store &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409285/microsoft-store-cut-windows-pc-games-12-percent"&gt;from 30 to 12 percent starting on August 1st&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PXs1cS"&gt;It’s not clear if Epic CEO Tim Sweeney was aware of the caveat when &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1408094368918032386"&gt;he tweeted this&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jVlEs2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The 2021 version of Microsoft is the best version of Microsoft ever! &lt;a href="https://t.co/RTpFHpWazG"&gt;https://t.co/RTpFHpWazG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1408094368918032386?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2WzWEx"&gt;While the new 100 percent revshare option doesn’t apply to games, it’s still a significant policy shift — one that both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22546635/microsoft-windows-11-new-app-store"&gt;Windows chief Panos Panay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549007/microsoft-windows-11-satya-nadella-remarks-apple"&gt;Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella&lt;/a&gt; made a big deal about in their remarks at Thursday’s keynote. Now, we just have to see if the new model is enticing enough to bring more developers to the Microsoft Store and if the pressure will lead other platform holders like Apple and Google to make similar changes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft didn’t kill Skype, but Windows 11 is shoving it out of sight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GqoI_RRu6Fnfk5qIVQtM0K9RDOQ=/296x0:1916x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69500923/Panos_Panay_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VeaCGG"&gt;Today’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22546829/microsoft-windows-11-event-live-blog-updates-news"&gt;Windows 11 news&lt;/a&gt; is all about where Microsoft sees computing going over the next few years, but it’s just as much the story of how Skype has flourished and ebbed since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/10/14/2489611/microsoft-skype-deal-complete"&gt;its $8.5 billion acquisition&lt;/a&gt; a decade ago. Five years ago, Skype was the big name in internet calling and video, and Microsoft made it an “inbox app” for Windows 10 that was included at installation and launched at startup by default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftAfzH"&gt;Now, after a pandemic year that has had more people using their PCs for voice and video than ever before, Skype was nowhere to be seen in the Windows 11 presentation or materials. Instead, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548738/microsoft-teams-windows-11-integration-announcement-features"&gt;Microsoft Teams gets a highlight spot&lt;/a&gt; in the new center-aligned taskbar and deep integration into Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Windows 11 taskbar - Teams" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cYzD4KWLOukYAjnxxcVeaW2-Sd4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679800/Windows_11_Chat_Integration_Screen_1000x625.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 11 taskbar - Teams.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="e9cJTM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Skype is no longer an inbox app for new devices that run Windows 11.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qibL0d"&gt;The future vision that Microsoft had for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/18/8243879/microsoft-skype-for-business-video"&gt;Skype everywhere&lt;/a&gt; has turned into a reality — but that reality made competitors Zoom and FaceTime into household names instead. Back in June, when Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298766/microsoft-teams-personal-launch-preview-accounts"&gt;made Teams available for personal accounts&lt;/a&gt;, the company still paid lip service to Skype, saying, “For folks that just want a very purpose-built app, Skype is a great solution, and we support it and encourage it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="7leYsx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Microsoft’s Skype struggles created a Zoom moment","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21200844/microsoft-skype-zoom-houseparty-coronavirus-pandemic-usage-growth-competition"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="fJJuFq"&gt;But now, if you want to use Skype, you’re going to have to go find it in the Microsoft Store like any other app. A company spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;: “Skype is no longer an inbox app for new devices that run Windows 11. The Skype app is available to download through the Microsoft Store for free.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Skype Windows 8" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G74MFrdc8E7LT-HmXweIQaIDBeU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/885592/skypewindows8.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fnHCA9"&gt;You can see just how precipitously Skype has fallen over the last year when you consider which other apps Windows 11 will include out of the box; even Windows Terminal will be a pack-in. Skype joins OneNote, Paint 3D, and 3D Viewer as the apps that will no longer come with the OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JNA3kd"&gt;Even adding one-click “Meet Now” features &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21200844/microsoft-skype-zoom-houseparty-coronavirus-pandemic-usage-growth-competition"&gt;couldn’t help Skype compete early in the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. The sudden push to go remote saw regular users choose powerful enterprise-grade chat apps, with giants like Microsoft and Google opening their doors to encourage the trend. Now, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22538240/google-chat-allo-hangouts-talk-messaging-mess-timeline"&gt;just like Google&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft has a complicated array of conferencing tools to sort out, and Windows 11’s launch suggests it’ll cut the fat sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TPcyTp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 11’s Intel-powered Android apps will run on AMD and Arm processors, too</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a6mGBXP8__2x6BkHh5HnvuV5aHA=/114x0:1323x806/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69500917/7JTO7hJ.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mbafi7"&gt;One of the biggest announcements at today’s Windows 11 reveal was that Microsoft would offer the option to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548428/microsoft-windows-11-android-apps-support-amazon-store"&gt;run Android apps on its new operating system&lt;/a&gt;, powered by a new “Intel Bridge” compiler that helps those apps run on x86 systems. But despite being an Intel-developed system, Android apps on Windows 11 won’t just be limited to computers with Intel CPUs. AMD and Arm-based processors will also support Android apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yyt4a3"&gt;“Intel believes it is important to provide this capability across all x86 platforms and has designed Intel Bridge technology to support all x86 platforms (including AMD platforms),” Intel confirmed in a statement to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Microsoft further corroborated that Android applications will be available for all silicon providers, including Arm, although the company isn’t talking about how well those apps will actually run yet. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bQsWHzPy50glKWWo_pWUtfaCzW4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679872/lcimg_9abbdc71_7b16_4ba0_b22a_2e6b359bcd82.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Xmubfc"&gt;According to Intel, Bridge itself is a run-time post compiler that translates applications that are compiled for non-x86 platforms (in this case, Android applications) into x86 instructions (which can run on Windows 11 with Intel or AMD CPUs). It’s a bit like a reverse version of Apple’s Rosetta software for its M1 Macs — but instead of converting x86 applications to run on Arm, it’s letting Arm-based apps run on x86 chips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lo3RVC"&gt;Arm-based Windows 11 devices, which won’t need that extra translation layer, will presumably be able to run Android apps without Intel Bridge, although Microsoft hasn’t fully explained how that will work just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J2apmqBvj8UrUdfeSi8Iyijd_Nk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679133/androidappswindows.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GsndhM"&gt;Windows 11’s Android apps are offered through a new partnership with Amazon’s Appstore. Android apps like TikTok will be listed on the new Microsoft Store, although users will also have to log in to their Amazon accounts in order to be able to install the mobile applications. Once set up, though, Android apps will run similar to any other windowed application, including the ability to pin them to the taskbar or snap them alongside other apps. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ViacomCBS again restructures its leadership in its bid to win the streaming wars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ypISp02O941Mtaa7SwStQ3XMx-U=/88x0:1033x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69500899/Paramount_Plus.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: ViacomCBS&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g0tSRB"&gt;ViacomCBS is once again changing up leadership to emphasize its focus on streaming and ensure the success of its streaming services, particularly its late-to-the-party content giant Paramount Plus. The announcement comes just a day after &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/comcasts-ceo-built-a-cable-giant-can-he-build-a-streaming-giant-11624473722"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; NBCUniversal had approached ViacomCBS about joining streaming forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YCk3aJ"&gt;ViacomCBS &lt;a href="https://ir.viacomcbs.com/news-releases/news-release-details/viacomcbs-announces-enhanced-streaming-content-leadership"&gt;announced Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; title changes and additional oversight for several of its executives currently overseeing various ViacomCBS content properties, particularly for its recently launched Paramount Plus streaming service. Leadership reorganizations focused on streaming have become standard for major parent companies of recently launched services like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514728/disney-streaming-reorganization-plus-espn-hulu-studios-movies-network-tv-shows-pandemic"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/7/21359128/warnermedia-reorg-bob-greenblatt-kevin-reilly-hbo-max-jason-kilar-streaming"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; — and ViacomCBS has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21524771/viacomcbs-all-access-paramount-plus-reorganization-disney-netflix"&gt;previously seen&lt;/a&gt; internal shifts meant to prop up Paramount Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CBIfdJ"&gt;In a statement, ViacomCBS boss Bob Bakish said Paramount Plus’ first few months “have demonstrated the power and potential of our platform, as well as audiences’ appetite for a broad and diverse array of content, all in one place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gn5InD"&gt;Tanya Giles, who serves as the general manager of MTV Entertainment Group, has been promoted to chief programming officer of streaming at the company and will specifically focus on content for Paramount Plus and Pluto TV. ViacomCBS reported reaching &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/viacomcbs-grows-global-streaming-subscribers-paramount-plus-1234948505/"&gt;36 million global paid subscriptions&lt;/a&gt; back in May. But that figure is towered over by services like Disney Plus and Netflix, which have zoomed past the 100 million- and 200 million-subscription mark, respectively. Giles’ new role, while one of several announced this week, is among the more significant changes in the company’s leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OIyGv9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Paramount Plus’ first few months “have demonstrated the power and potential of our platform”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ScfU8i"&gt;CBS president and CEO George Cheeks now additionally holds the title of chief content officer of news and sports at Paramount Plus. Chairman and CEO of Paramount Pictures, Jim Gianopulos, is now also chief content officer of movies at Paramount Plus. Bruce Gillmer, who is president of music, music talent, programming, and events will oversee music at the service, while MTV Entertainment Group president Chris McCarthy now also holds the title of chief content officer of unscripted entertainment and adult animation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R6jYjf"&gt;Chairman and CEO of Showtime Networks, David Nevins, now additionally holds the role of chief content officers of scripted originals at Paramount Plus. An &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/emmy-winner-david-nevins-joins-25036/"&gt;Emmy-winning producer&lt;/a&gt;, Nevins was attached to &lt;a href="https://www.viacomcbspressexpress.com/showtime/executives/view?id=23"&gt;award-winning productions&lt;/a&gt; that include &lt;em&gt;Arrested Development&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Law &amp;amp; Order: SVU&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Friday Night Lights&lt;/em&gt;, and his promotion as a key figure within the Paramount Plus C-suite seems smart on the part of ViacomCBS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QljTN7"&gt;Meanwhile, Nicole Clemens, president of Paramount Television Studios, will also oversee Paramount Plus’ original scripted series. Lastly, Brian Robbins, president of kids and family entertainment, will now also hold the title of chief content officer of kids and family programming at Paramount Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v74gdu"&gt;The restructure comes at an interesting time for the company. Paramount Plus, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300993/paramount-plus-streaming-wars-netflix-disney-launch-date-price"&gt;launched in March&lt;/a&gt;, is one of the now seemingly innumerable streaming services all competing for subscribers. It’s unclear whether ViacomCBS’s long-game strategy is an eventual merger along the lines of the recent deal between &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451111/att-ceo-stankey-unleash-assets-warnermedia-discovery-hbo"&gt;WarnerMedia and Discovery&lt;/a&gt;, but reports from &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/comcasts-ceo-built-a-cable-giant-can-he-build-a-streaming-giant-11624473722"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/nbcuniversals-streaming-strategy-raise-prospect-of-warnermedia-merger"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; indicated NBCUniversal had approached ViacomCBS about teaming up. According to the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;, ViacomCBS declined that offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vVSC6N"&gt;By the looks of it, ViacomCBS is instead amassing a leadership team to help its scrappy service compete in the streaming wars in earnest. &lt;/p&gt;
