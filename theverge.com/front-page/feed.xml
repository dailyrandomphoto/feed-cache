    <title>Instagram is rolling out a new tool to automatically filter out abusive DMs </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WB7kRqVRBrqTKRAxFBIvPsWoeEg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69161216/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HQIZBl"&gt;Instagram announced a new tool today that will allow users to automatically filter out direct message requests containing offensive words, phrases, and emojis. The tool is targeted at celebrities and public figures who receive a large number of unwanted, harmful DMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1VujYE"&gt;The update builds on Instagram’s work to combat hate speech on the platform. In February, the company said it would begin &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276491/instagram-direct-message-hate-speech-account-disabled-policy"&gt;disabling the accounts of users who sent multiple harassing messages&lt;/a&gt;. In 2018, the company expanded its offensive comments filter to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/1/17308012/instagram-offensive-comment-filtering"&gt;automatically block comments that attack a person’s appearance or character&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qdRvcq"&gt;The message requests filter can be toggled on or off in a new section of the app called “hidden words.” When it’s on, offensive messages will be pushed to a separate folder. DMs in this folder are concealed, allowing users to browse messages without needing to read what they say. If a user taps into a message, they can read, delete, or report it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="laMCw2"&gt;The company says it worked with “leading anti-discrimination and anti-bullying organizations” to come up with a preset list of offensive phrases. Users can also customize their own list based on what they don’t want to see.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DqToNx"&gt;Instagram said the new feature will be rolling out to “several countries” in the coming weeks, though it did not specify which countries those are. The company plans to expand to more countries in the next few months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P4O2nd"&gt;As part of the announcement today, Instagram also said it is rolling out a tool to allow people to preemptively block new accounts from harassers. Now, when a user blocks someone in the app, they’ll have the option of blocking any new accounts that person creates. The company declined to specify how it does this, saying only that it uses a “variety of signals” to detect new accounts from those same users. The feature will be pushed out globally in the next few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TrNRMu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GM9SSk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Logitech announces cheaper Magic Keyboard alternative for new iPad Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cIhR5Hfs7KeT1zVyy3kYGUa0DJI=/0x1:1497x999/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69161192/lct.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="efHctY"&gt;Apple just announced an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22385675/apple-ipad-pro-m1-chip-specs-features-price"&gt;M1-powered update to the iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;, and Logitech has followed up with a new keyboard and trackpad accessory for the 11-inch and 12.9-inch models. The Combo Touch is a case with a Microsoft Surface-style kickstand and a detachable backlit keyboard with a trackpad. It connects over the iPad Pro’s Smart Connector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hSDFxZ"&gt;Logitech already released a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231088/logitech-combo-touch-ipad-keyboard-trackpad-case-review-price-specs-features"&gt;similar Combo Touch keyboard for 10.2-inch and 10.5-inch iPads&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a related &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fipad-keyboards%2Ffolio-touch.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F21%2F22395219%2Flogitech-combo-touch-keyboard-new-ipad-pro" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Folio Touch&lt;/a&gt; for the 11-inch iPad Pro and 10.9-inch iPad Air. The Folio Touch’s keyboard isn’t detachable and its trackpad is a little smaller than the new Combo Touch, but otherwise it’s a comparable product.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yKbpM07pVTlgcVfm02zqpYAPk0A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22459035/lct2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="d5nEia"&gt;This is the first time Logitech has offered a keyboard/trackpad option for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, however, and it’s significantly cheaper than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21227345/magic-keyboard-ipad-pro-tablet-laptop-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Apple’s own Magic Keyboard&lt;/a&gt;. The 11-inch model is $199.99 and the 12.9-inch model is $229.99 versus the $299 and $349 that Apple charges, meaning you could save about $100 or more on the sticker prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FX4sJC"&gt;You might actually prefer Logitech’s design, as well. It’s not as sleek as the Magic Keyboard, but the case will offer better protection for the iPad, the detachability and kickstand offers an extra degree of versatility, and the keyboard has a useful function row. The 11-inch model is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fipad-keyboards%2Fcombo-touch-ipad.920-010095.html%3Fcrid%3D1762%23buy-combo-touch-ipad&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F21%2F22395219%2Flogitech-combo-touch-keyboard-new-ipad-pro" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available to pre-order now&lt;/a&gt;, while the 12.9-inch version is listed as “coming soon.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Your AirTag can’t say horseshit but it can say shit horse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pOzVugXqLpd3tX4pcM19AHxVNfg=/126x0:683x371/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69160283/Screen_Shot_2021_04_20_at_3.51.50_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hs4Xss"&gt;After what feels like ages of rumors, speculation, and worry that I was getting way too obsessed with a Bluetooth item tracker that seemed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/2/17924312/tile-mate-pro-premium-subscription-launch-battery-range-price"&gt;similar to ones&lt;/a&gt; made by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22227621/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-price-release-date-tile-locator"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373410/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-plus-uwb-ar-bluetooth-price-release-date"&gt; other companies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/20844326/apple-airtags-bluetooth-tracker-keys-tile-features-price"&gt;AirTags are finally here&lt;/a&gt;. But before you preorder the Mentos-esque pucks, there’s something you should be aware of: if you want to engrave your AirTags, you can’t combine a horse and poop emoji in that order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="20rRSu"&gt;That’s right, the emoji version of “horseshit” is a no-go when getting an engraving for Apple’s newest product. Here’s what happens when you try to make that your engraving of choice:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NutL9CXqgO33Uqx7XCe7_CRxh-M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22458423/Screen_Shot_2021_04_20_at_4.48.33_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple says no to “horseshit” in emoji form.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QMOxcH"&gt;Curiously, poop and then horse (“shit horse”) is totally fine, though. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q1Uymr65Ow6aJYNmaOZraMUcD6w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22458224/Screen_Shot_2021_04_20_at_3.20.01_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple has no problem with “shit horse”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JxnslX"&gt;Fictional horse excrement is fair game too. Despite being a horn away from being exactly the same emoji, “unicorn shit” works fine. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r6JUfeJdQV-RlelRmLeRZXEqBfg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22458484/Screen_Shot_2021_04_20_at_5.27.33_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple is more forgiving of fictional horses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AMOJ6R"&gt;As do emoji representations I tried for “snake shit,” “monkey shit,” “chicken shit,” and even “shit bird.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="93hkSZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10457217"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="86gPs9"&gt;Similar limitations apply to actual offensive words as well. Apple gives you &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; enough letters for some creative diction, but catches some of the obvious offenders. “SUCK,” “NSFW,” and “BUTT” are still on the table though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fjKJne"&gt;This is all very silly on some level, but consistent with the conservative California Dad lens through which Apple seems to make most of its product decisions. The same emoji restrictions are present on AirPods and iPad engravings, for example. Though on those devices, “horseshit” does seem to work — so if you really want to brand your AirPods case that way, go for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mabrO7"&gt;We’ve reached out to Apple to see if these limitations are deliberate or a bug.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Who knew Tim Apple was a professional thief?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jCEFnGDhoGu_YcMPvSjC4NS90rs=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69160236/tim_cook_spy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ca3vDl"&gt;Tim Cook, the mild-mannered Apple CEO, probably didn’t have to lift more than a finger to launch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394227/apple-ipad-pro-2021-how-where-to-buy-preorder-link"&gt;a new line of iPad Pros&lt;/a&gt; with the company’s Arm-based M1 chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YlFWXE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/7/18254958/tim-cook-apple-trump-username-changed-twitter-name-potus-president"&gt;Tim Apple&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand? He’s the kind of daring superspy who can pull off a high-security heist, slicing through plate glass, rappelling down buildings, and dodging lasers, all with a trusty grappling hook at his side — as you’ll see in the video above.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YYlMcEJK9MWmfi8-NurEkdWKq_E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22458419/tim_apple_cook_mission_impossible_4.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0cOS2X"&gt;Also, he’s apparently able to &lt;em&gt;unsocket&lt;/em&gt; a soldered-down chip, perhaps the most impressive trick of all — except perhaps for the one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/20/20974999/trump-is-lying-about-the-new-apple-factory"&gt;where he gave Donald Trump a “new” factory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22241646/apple-tim-cook-gave-the-first-mac-pro-to-trump"&gt;the “first” Mac Pro&lt;/a&gt; off its assembly line. Not bad for a 60-year-old, even one who’s in charge of the most profitable company in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V3KzH0"&gt;I sure hope he’s ready for the memes! Here’s one single GIF with everything you need.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S5diw-UInTf-H3Wa5iQYT1Tx-sM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22458418/tim_apple_cook_mission_impossible_2.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uCtRQA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are all the AirTag accessories we know about </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fYC-sV9f26gLYdwC4ya5f937KLY=/821x0:2261x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69159412/airtag_accessories_header_202104.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="afQCgp"&gt;The Apple AirTags &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/20844326/apple-airtags-bluetooth-tracker-keys-tile-features-price"&gt;have finally been announced&lt;/a&gt;, and with them come a ton of accessories to make them easier to use (so much easier than if it had, say, a built-in way to attach it to things). While a small tracking puck could be carried in a bag, there are a variety of other things that you may want to put an AirTag on that require some sort of holder or the judicious use of tape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aibtVD"&gt;These are all the accessories we could find that are either listed for preorder on the maker’s site or have a page on Apple’s store. We don’t have official ship dates for most of them, but it’s probably a safe bet that the ones on the Apple Store will become available when the AirTags do, on April 30th. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zukTwfmRIxQklWUdl7oFS7ls-Ow=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457924/HNPX2.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Belkin’s AirTag holder. Tie it to anything!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;h2 id="pAbwNc"&gt;Belkin&lt;/h2&gt;

Both products have a circular holder for the AirTag and come in white, black, blue, and pink.

&lt;p id="678fYv"&gt;Nomad also offers its take on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fairtags-leather-keychain&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a keychain&lt;/a&gt;, but (characteristically) its version is a leather pouch that encases the AirTag. The company also has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fairtags-glasses-strap&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a glasses strap&lt;/a&gt;, which acts both as a strap to keep your glasses handy and as an AirTag holder in case you manage to misplace them. Both are listed for $39.95 but are marked down to $29.95 if you preorder, which you are able to do now on Nomad’s site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="XGObNE"&gt;Cyrill / Spigen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IwxThP"&gt;Cyrill is offering a &lt;a href="https://www.cyrill.com/collections/airtag/products/black-airtag?variant=36909671776414"&gt;vegan leather keychain accessory&lt;/a&gt; in two colors, black and “stone” (which is a light gray). It costs $19.99 and seems to be available now. Spigen, Cyrill’s parent company, is also offering its own AirTag cases: a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.spigen.com%2Fcollections%2Fapple-keynote%2Fproducts%2Fairtag-case-valentinus%3Fvariant%3D32709738725423&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;keychain accessory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.spigen.com%2Fcollections%2Fapple-keynote%2Fproducts%2Fairtag-case-rugged-armor%3Fvariant%3D32709737971759&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a ruggedized case&lt;/a&gt; with a hefty clip connector (and what appears to be a bottle opener, though it’s not listed as a feature). Both are $24.99 — the keychain is available to order today, and the rugged case is available for preorder.&lt;/p&gt;

It is worth noting, though, that the accessories do include an AirTag with a custom “Hermès” engraving, so you can flex while you find. The key ring and bag charm come in orange, brown, and what looks like black but is listed as “bleu indigo.” The luggage tag is currently only shown in brown. Like Belkin’s offerings, they are currently unavailable through the Apple Store.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Woman detained for protesting Tesla at Shanghai auto show </title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by STR/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L50eoy"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-regulators-summon-tesla-on-quality-issues-11612788928?mod=article_inline"&gt;simmering issue of how Tesla deals with customer complaints in China&lt;/a&gt; came to a boil this week as police detained a woman after she protested at Tesla’s booth at the Auto Shanghai 2021 trade show. The woman was dragged off the show floor after jumping on top of a Tesla Model 3, where she shouted about a brake issue the company has been criticized for with its China-made cars. Tesla has since said it will conduct a self-inspection of its service and operations in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fa1HRq"&gt;The woman, who police referred to only by her surname “Zhang,” according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, was detained for “disrupting public order.” She has protested before about the brake issue, after she was involved in a crash. She is reportedly being held for five days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tL3aHP"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A female Tesla owner climbed on top of a car’s roof at the Tesla booth to protest her car’s brake malfunction at the Shanghai auto show Monday. The booth beefed up its security after the incident. &lt;a href="https://t.co/ct7RmF1agM"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ct7RmF1agM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Global Times (@globaltimesnews) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/globaltimesnews/status/1384021874439462918?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G2VoLj"&gt;Video of Zhang on top of the Tesla went viral on Monday across China’s biggest social networks, and on Twitter, where &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/globaltimesnews/status/1384021874439462918"&gt;state-owned tabloid Global Times shared a clip&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DuEOTL"&gt;Tesla’s China division initially said on Chinese platform Weibo that Zhang had crashed her car because she was speeding, but &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/tesla-china-backlash/"&gt;admitted&lt;/a&gt; it still hasn’t “fulfilled [its] wish” to “win assurance and understanding from consumers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Szdywe"&gt;That response stoked an already fervent reaction to the protest. Another state-owned news outlet, CCTV, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/autoshow-chinese-woman-who-stormed-tesla-display-car-show-detained-5-days-2021-04-20/"&gt;called for an investigation&lt;/a&gt; into the alleged brake problems, while a third, Xinhua, said &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1998869/a-womans-tesla-protest-stole-the-spotlight-at-shanghai-auto-show/"&gt;Tesla showed “no sincerity in solving the problem.”&lt;/a&gt; Government agencies have spoken up, too. The Commission for Political and Legal Affairs of the Communist Party of China Central Committee said on WeChat that Tesla should respect Chinese consumers and comply with local laws and regulations, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-20/tesla-knocks-keep-coming-as-china-chides-over-vehicle-safety?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, while the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said “enterprises should not be arrogant and unreasonable,” according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vAZgbP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tesla’s initial response only stoked the criticism from customers and state agents&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pNhzmi"&gt;The reaction was so intense that Tesla released a second statement Tuesday apologizing for not handling Zhang’s complaints sooner. It also capitulated slightly on the brake issue, saying in the same statement that it will now review its service and operations as a result of the protest and the backlash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dDDRnH"&gt;Tesla has been making cars in China since it opened a new factory outside Shanghai in early 2020 — the first in the country to be wholly-owned by a foreign automaker. While that factory already accounts for a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-19/tesla-china-demand-powers-ahead-with-record-registrations?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;huge part of Tesla’s global sales&lt;/a&gt;, the company has been plagued with complaints about the quality of the cars it makes there. Tesla was rebuked by multiple government agencies earlier this year in China over &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-regulators-summon-tesla-on-quality-issues-11612788928?mod=article_inline"&gt;how it’s handled customer complaints about the quality of its cars&lt;/a&gt;. In response, the company said it “sincerely accepted the guidance of government departments” and that it had “deeply reflected on [its] shortcomings.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r3PIbX"&gt;Tesla’s response to pressure from the Chinese government is a stark response to how it acts in the US, where CEO Elon Musk &lt;a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/tesla-s-tone-with-china-authorities-differs-from-musk-s-in-u-s"&gt;often teases regulators&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kX4Lxl"&gt;Apple revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394034/apple-new-imac-m1-chip-colors-design-specs-price-release-date"&gt;a redesigned iMac and Magic Keyboard&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22384756/apple-spring-loaded-event-recap-biggest-announcements-airtag-ipad-pro-imac"&gt;its “Spring Loaded” event&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, but didn’t, for some reason, decide to change the Magic Mouse 2’s infamous charging solution. While the mouse will come in new colors to match the new iMacs, Apple confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that its charging port is still on the bottom — meaning that five and a half years after its introduction, Apple still seems to think that the best way to charge the mouse is by flipping it over (rendering it useless) and plugging in a Lightning cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VmjxDi"&gt;The Magic Mouse’s charging situation has long been a bit of a joke — my former colleague Nick Statt equated it to looking like “a beetle with its legs in the air” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/8/9872746/apple-bad-hardware-design-iphone-case-pencil-magic-mouse"&gt;all the way back in December 2015&lt;/a&gt;, and frankly, I’m having a hard time coming up with a better description.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JY7mfNejfVDbX486GvNIzYAolMo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9833361/Apple_Magic_Mouse_Bad_Design_2.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Magic Mouse 2, charging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2oB2Xr"&gt;Why didn’t Apple didn’t take the opportunity to change things up alongside the new iMac and Magic Keyboard? The company made obvious and good improvements to both of those products. Why not tweak the Magic Mouse’s design to have, say, a charging port in the front? That’s how wired / wireless mice have done it for years, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse"&gt;including our favorite gaming mouse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="woB3ta"&gt;There is some hope that Apple is willing to dump bad design, though. The first Apple Pencil had a similarly meme-worthy charging solution that required you to plug it directly into a iPad’s Lightning port, but Apple fixed that years later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/30/18023772/new-apple-pencil-2-2018-ipad-stylus-price-release-date"&gt;with the Apple Pencil 2&lt;/a&gt; by letting it wirelessly charge off the side of iPads that support it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H29froDJmJ7jGd02m_Yr6TsF07M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13358115/Apple_Pencil_Bad_Design.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The old Apple Pencil, charging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="p46ecz"&gt;And Apple finally responded to complaints about the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300891/apple-tv-siri-remote-touchpad-button-design-form-function"&gt;frustratingly finicky&lt;/a&gt; touchpad on the Apple TV’s remote today by unveiling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394196/apple-tv-4k-new-siri-remote-sold-separately-price-buttons"&gt;the new Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt;, which has a scroll wheel and a clickpad. I’m crossing my fingers Apple will update the Magic Mouse next.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will now let you buy an M1 Mac Mini with 10-gigabit networking</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZIff1-czpgmAu09IH-jKzuHA-cU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69159929/cwelch_201114_4292_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z1igo4"&gt;The M1-powered Mac Mini &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmac-mini&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394631%2Fapple-m1-silicon-mac-mini-intel-networking-10gb-ethernet" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;can now be configured&lt;/a&gt; to included 10-gigabit networking, an option that the computer was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;notably missing compared to its Intel-powered counterpart&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/20/apple-silently-updates-m1-mac-mini-with-optional-10-gigabit-ethernet-port/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The update to the 2020 computer seems to have come during Apple’s store update that came with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22384756/apple-spring-loaded-event-recap-biggest-announcements-airtag-ipad-pro-imac"&gt;bigger product announcements today&lt;/a&gt;, including a new iMac and iPad Pros. Adding the faster networking will add $100 to the price of the computer — the same price as if you were to add 10Gbps to the Intel version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="expeBB"&gt;When Apple added the 10Gbps port as an option to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/16/18097117/apple-mac-mini-2018-review-upgrade-faster-more-powerful-features-price"&gt;the Mac Mini in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, it was welcomed by those running home and professional servers, as well as anyone who needed fast network access from a cheaper Mac (like video professionals using network-attached storage). But when Apple introduced a faster version of the computer with its own custom chip, the ability to add networking faster than the standard Gigabit Ethernet was no longer there. If the lack of 10Gb networking took the (as of now) least expensive M1 computer out of the running for you, it’s now an option again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NI1UyM"&gt;You can order the Apple Silicon Mac Mini with faster networking today, but it may be a bit of a wait for the configuration — Apple estimates that I could have a stock M1 Mac Mini shipped to me in two days, but adding the 10Gb ethernet turns that into two weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Two queens in talks to join Marvel’s Secret Invasion on Disney Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/74Qd38Flz_kHkmZd0O2ggKPAm8s=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69159683/CaptainMarvel5ba0fe91d3532.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chuck Zlotnick / Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wSd2x8"&gt;The Marvel Cinematic Universe may soon be home to two new queens. Yesterday, &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/olivia-colman-in-talks-to-join-samuel-l-jackson-in-marvels-secret-invasion-exclusive"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter &lt;/em&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that Olivia Colman was negotiating a role in Marvel’s &lt;em&gt;Secret Invasion &lt;/em&gt;Disney Plus series, and today, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/emilia-clarke-secret-invasion-marvel-1234955746/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Emilia Clarke is in talks to do the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vm5eAJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Secret Invasion&lt;/em&gt; is expected to be the television adaptation of the comics storyline of the same name that’s focused on a hostile takeover of Earth led by a shape-shifting alien race you may already know and love from &lt;em&gt;Captain Marvel&lt;/em&gt;: the Skrulls. Few details have been revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167976/disney-investor-day-2020-biggest-announcements-plus-marvel-star-wars-pixar-animation"&gt;since the project was first announced&lt;/a&gt;, but we do know the show will feature the return of Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and Ben Mendelsohn as the friendly Skrull Talos, who was last seen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/3/20681596/spider-man-far-from-home-mid-post-credits-scene-plot-hole-nick-fury-maria-hill-aliens"&gt;impersonating Fury&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Far From Home. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S7T0in"&gt;There are some interesting possible characters for Colman and Clarke to play, too. In the comics, Empress Veranke is the leader of the Skrulls, and Colman’s time as both Elizabeth II on &lt;em&gt;The Crown &lt;/em&gt;and Queen Anne in &lt;em&gt;The Favorite&lt;/em&gt; could certainly translate to alien royalty. You could make the same case for Clarke’s turn as Daenerys Targaryen in &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones &lt;/em&gt;as well. There’s also the possibility of Abigail Brand, the leader of extraterrestrial-focused security agency S.W.O.R.D., making an appearance in the show, which could be a great recurring role for either actress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hc2nRA"&gt;There’s no announced release date for &lt;em&gt;Secret Invasion&lt;/em&gt;, but with at least three Marvel films and several TV shows still slated to come out in 2021, there’s a good chance there’ll be some hints of what’s going on with the cosmic, space-based side of the Marvel universe soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You may have to actually pay for Apple TV Plus to watch Ted Lasso’s second season</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B1EptwL5tAw0vo1N4La88skGlJI=/108x0:1280x781/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69159678/ted_lasso.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple TV Plus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FkJGBf"&gt;Apple TV Plus launched on November 1st, 2019, but odds are that you (along with almost two-thirds of other Apple TV Plus customers) aren’t actually paying for it, thanks to Apple’s lengthy free trials. But Apple may have finally found the carrot to convince people to actually shell out their hard-earned cash for another streaming service: the upcoming second season of sleeper hit &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;, which is set to debut on TV Plus on July 23rd — just after Apple’s free subscriptions for its earliest customers end on July 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7bfKm3"&gt;It’s no secret that Apple TV Plus has a paying subscriber problem: as of January, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/apple-tv-plus-freeloader-problem-percent-free-1234890385/"&gt;research firm MoffettNathanson noted&lt;/a&gt; that approximately 62 percent of TV Plus subscribers are enjoying Apple’s free ride. The free trials for the service were originally intended to last a year, but Apple has kept extending them — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21508148/apple-tv-plus-free-period-extended-february-2021-streaming"&gt;first to February&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233276/apple-free-tv-plus-service-trials-extended"&gt;and then to July&lt;/a&gt;. The company still offers a free year for new customers, but July 1st will be the day that anyone who signed up at or shortly after launch runs out of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="joZ5Oh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple TV Plus is still looking for its big win","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/21/21262291/apple-tv-plus-morning-show-licensed-movies-netflix-disney-plus-quibi"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wINydT"&gt;Apple has been trying to grow TV Plus into a hit, but some of its highest-profile shows (like &lt;em&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;See&lt;/em&gt;) failed to be the big, breakout hits that Apple was hoping for. And the ongoing extensions of the free trial period have started to feel like Apple was fishing for a big enough hit to hook customers into signing up — and somehow, it seems that the wildly popular &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; might be it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ow2nfS"&gt;The first season of the show (which is based on a series of Jason Sudeikis commercials) debuted quietly last summer, but the charming cast, heartfelt storytelling, and sheer optimism of the series have resonated with fans in the past several months. It’s also won Apple some of its streaming service’s most prestigious awards, including a Golden Globe for Sudeikis’ role as the titular coach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQv0wd"&gt;The show is by far the biggest hit for Apple’s service, which makes the upcoming second season Apple’s best shot for hooking subscribers. That’s especially true since &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;’s second season will offer 12 episodes, which could guarantee several months of customers given Apple’s weekly releases — enough, perhaps, for Apple to get subscribers on board with another big marquee show like &lt;em&gt;Mythic Quest&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21295512/apple-tv-plus-foundation-show-trailer-isaac-asimov-wwdc-2020"&gt;its upcoming &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; adaptation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
