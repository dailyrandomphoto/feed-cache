    <title>Netflix employees at the heart of the Dave Chappelle controversy file charges against the company</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OOsOfR"&gt;Two Netflix employees at the heart of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728337/netflix-fires-organizer-trans-employee-walkout-dave-chappelle"&gt;Dave Chappelle controversy&lt;/a&gt; have filed labor charges against the company, alleging the streaming giant retaliated against them for engaging in protected activity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zFVV2l"&gt;B. Pagels-Minor, a Black trans program manager, was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728337/netflix-fires-organizer-trans-employee-walkout-dave-chappelle"&gt;fired while organizing a walkout&lt;/a&gt; related to Netflix’s support of Chappelle’s comedy special&lt;em&gt; The Closer&lt;/em&gt;, which has been widely condemned as transphobic. Terra Field, a trans software engineer, was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22720724/netflix-suspends-trans-employee-tweeted-dave-chappelle-the-closer"&gt;suspended after posting a viral tweet thread&lt;/a&gt; about the issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MYna08"&gt;Netflix said it fired Pagels-Minor for allegedly leaking confidential information — a charge they have categorically denied. The company said Field was suspended for attending a director-level meeting she wasn’t supposed to, though it reinstated her after finding no ill intent. In the charge, Field says she and hundreds of other Netflix employees were invited to attend the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZdpKbP"&gt;Now, the employees are filing unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board. They say Netflix’s actions were designed to stop workers from speaking out about their working conditions, including the desire to create a safe environment for Netflix staff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2kd2p"&gt;“This charge is not just about B. and Terra, and it’s not about Dave. It’s about trying to change the culture and having an impact for others,” says attorney Laurie Burgess. “The charge is all about collective action. It’s about supporting your coworkers and speaking up for things you care about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cQbmTd"&gt;Filing with the NLRB supports the goal of collective action. But it’s also an easier choice than filing in state court, as both Pagels-Minor and Field signed Netflix employment agreements that require them to resolve disputes in private arbitration, &lt;a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/the-growing-use-of-mandatory-arbitration/"&gt;a process that tends to favor the employer&lt;/a&gt;. (This is common at large tech companies, though both Google and Activision Blizzard have recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22750450/activision-blizzard-ends-forced-arbitration-bobby-kotick-paycut"&gt;ended forced arbitration&lt;/a&gt; due to employee organizing efforts.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oV1gBg"&gt;The NLRB investigates all charges it receives. If it finds the allegations have merit, it can try to secure a settlement or, if that fails, issue a complaint. For employees, the best-case scenario outside of settling is getting reinstated with backpay and forcing Netflix to post a notice that workers are allowed to engage in protected activity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="My53N6"&gt;In a carefully worded statement, Netflix implied Pagels-Minor was the source &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-13/netflix-staff-raised-concerns-about-dave-chappelle-special-before-release?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;behind a &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; story&lt;/a&gt; that contained internal metrics about how much Netflix paid for &lt;em&gt;The Closer. &lt;/em&gt;The&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/16/media/netflix-employee-fired-david-chappelle/index.html"&gt;narrative then spread in the media&lt;/a&gt;, though employees who spoke to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;said they didn’t believe it was true. After Pagels-Minor was fired, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; continued to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-10-17/dave-chappelle-s-special-cost-more-than-squid-game?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;publish stories containing internal metrics&lt;/a&gt; about Netflix shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XASC0W"&gt;B., who is 35 weeks pregnant, is now about to lose their health insurance. “Amidst all the stress, I am trying to take one day at a time and focus on my health,” they said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “As a high-risk pregnancy, I have to be careful. We don’t even know what our health insurance situation is, and we are scheduled to be in a hospital having a baby in less than 30 days.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TGIqbk"&gt;Field has applied for medical leave from Netflix. Since speaking out, she has received a credible death threat and been doxxed. “This is what happens with trans people — we’re tolerated as long as we’re quiet, but if we speak up we get harassed,” she says in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It has been a really stressful few weeks, but I intend to keep fighting for our community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7XOR16"&gt;Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos is continuing to stand by the special, although he’s &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/10/netflix-ted-sarandos-speaks-up-dave-chapplle-the-closer-controversy-interview-1234858762/"&gt;walked back previous claims&lt;/a&gt; that “content on screen doesn’t directly translate to real-world harm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lx5cgk"&gt;Earlier this week, a &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; investigation found that in 2020, Netflix &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22747488/netflix-suppress-cuties-algorithm-search-results-dave-chappelle"&gt;suppressed search results after the controversy around the film &lt;em&gt;Cuties&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to quell public outrage. The company did not take similar steps for &lt;em&gt;The Closer&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="acWfW7"&gt;The trans employee resource group &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733098/netflix-trans-employees-demands-dave-chappelle-walkout"&gt;released a list of demands&lt;/a&gt; ahead of the October 20th walkout. They want Netflix to invest in trans creators and revise internal processes on commissioning potentially harmful content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ySGJ8E"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iFixit teardown of the 2021 MacBook Pro reveals easier battery swaps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Stretchy adhesive being pulled out of the MacBook case" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D4XKs1Pzbz9ciQvtwenwg88di68=/0x3:7360x4910/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70064757/MBP_M1_2021_42e3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The trackpad has to be removed to reveal two of the pull tabs | Image: iFixit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WwFeoc"&gt;Online tech repair guide and parts retailer iFixit has published its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F54122%2Fmacbook-pro-2021-teardown&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F29%2F22753063%2Fmacbook-pro-ifixit-teardown-battery-swaps-pull-tabs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;latest teardown&lt;/a&gt; for the new 2021 MacBook Pro and reveals at least one small win for reparability: the ability to replace the battery pack modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vwjDJY"&gt;The battery modules in the new MacBook Pros, much like many mobile devices, are now attached via adhesive strips with pull tabs. This makes it easier to remove them, as long as none of the tabs rip while pulling. The trackpad needs to also be carefully removed to reach the remaining pull tabs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d2W2ZP-_AkC5s1ZYf852Xw5BjVw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22967611/MBP_M1_2021_117_Updated3f.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: iFixit&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iInWyk"&gt;Batteries in MacBook Pros used to have their own frame or shell, which made them easier to install or remove via screws or locking tabs (although that takes more interior space). Starting in 2012, Apple wanted to make laptops thinner, so battery structures were removed to save some real estate. The biggest issue with MacBook Pro model years 2012–2020 was that Apple used glue to all but permanently fuse the battery to the top case of the laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2L7j3q"&gt;HDMI and SD card ports are fixed to the logic board, but the rest of the ports are modular, though you would have to remove the whole logic board to replace them. Fans and the speakers also require a logic board removal before a replacement is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="X4IIqJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple MacBook Pro 14 and 16 review: return to form","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="oglYwI"&gt;The only real remaining qualms are that replacing the screen would mean losing True Tone, and replacing Touch ID would lose its main ability. While Touch ID in iPhones being non-repairable used to make sense for security reasons, it’s interesting to see no new development on reparability here since Apple’s new wireless &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397196/magic-keyboard-touch-id-m1-mac-macbook-intel"&gt;Touch ID keyboard&lt;/a&gt; can be paired to different M1 computers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft overtakes Apple to become the world’s most valuable company</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_S6-ZSuIqJAq06MfIPCm8Y-DUFg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70064740/acastro_180507_1777_microsoft_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0rvyfP"&gt;Microsoft surpassed Apple’s market cap on Friday to become the world’s most valuable public company. The change follows Apple’s Thursday earnings, where the company posted strong results but revealed that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751418/apple-q4-2021-earnings-supply-constraints-chip-shortage"&gt;lost $6 billion to supply chain constraints&lt;/a&gt;. On Tuesday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22747241/microsoft-q1-2022-earnings-revenue-cloud-services-surface-gaming-xbox"&gt;Microsoft also shared positive earnings&lt;/a&gt; boosted by Office, Windows, and its cloud products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bhS3PO"&gt;At Friday’s market close, Microsoft’s market cap was almost $2.49 trillion while Apple’s was about $2.46 trillion, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/29/microsoft-passes-apple-to-become-the-worlds-most-valuable-company-.html"&gt;according to CNBC&lt;/a&gt;. This isn’t the first time Microsoft has passed Apple; the Windows-maker surpassed Apple’s market cap &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/26/18109784/microsoft-apple-market-cap-2018-valuable-company"&gt;in 2018&lt;/a&gt; for the first time since 2010 and once again in July 2020. (Alphabet has also taken the crown from Apple, surpassing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/1/10889286/alphabet-passed-apple-worlds-most-valuable-company"&gt;Apple’s market cap in 2016&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QnHud8"&gt;But Apple has been a leader in the markets for some time, being the first US company to hit a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/2/17638764/apple-worlds-first-1-trillion-company-market-cap-stock-price"&gt;$1 trillion market cap in 2018&lt;/a&gt; and, just two years later, becoming the first US company to hit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21375223/apple-2-trillion-market-cap-first-us-company-stock-price"&gt;a $2 trillion market cap&lt;/a&gt;. (The iPhone is still a massively successful product, after all.) So it’s not out of the realm of possibility that Apple retakes the title of the world’s most valuable company sometime soon. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mastodon puts Trump’s social network on notice for improperly using its code</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lVWvrXF3wPoPiq65FmRo2QIOTS8=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70064410/mastodon.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="G2Np4L"&gt;Mastodon has sent former President Donald Trump’s company a formal notification that it’s breaking the rules by using Mastodon’s open-source code to build its social network, named Truth. This news comes from &lt;a href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2021/10/trumps-new-social-media-platform-found-using-mastodon-code/"&gt;a blog post by Mastodon’s founder Eugen Rochko&lt;/a&gt;, but others have previously pointed out that the organization behind Truth, the Trump Media and Technology Group (or TMTG), was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/22/22740354/trump-truth-social-network-spac-mastodon-license-software-freedom-conservancy"&gt;violating Mastodon’s software license by not providing the source code&lt;/a&gt; for the site built on top of it. Trump’s group has 30 days from when the letter was sent to comply with the license or stop using the software, or it could lose the right to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NqIqmG"&gt;While Truth hasn’t officially launched yet, internet users discovered that a test version basically had the same interface as Mastodon, and that &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93b5kp/mastodon-lawyers-tell-truth-social-trump-source-code-public"&gt;some of the code for the site was unchanged&lt;/a&gt; from the other social network’s code. By itself, that’s actually the intended use of open-source software — but as the &lt;a href="https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2021/oct/21/trump-group-agplv3/"&gt;Software Freedom Conservancy pointed out last week&lt;/a&gt;, apps or websites based on software that uses the AGPLv3 license have to in turn provide their own source code. According to &lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#WhyUseGPL"&gt;the foundation that wrote AGPL&lt;/a&gt;, it’s meant to make the community’s software better: if you improve on something that someone else made, they should be able to benefit from your work like you did theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vDz6av"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Calling your software proprietary doesn’t work when it’s not your code&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s77Tq6"&gt;As Mastodon and Rochko reiterated on Friday, though, TMTG hasn’t done that — it &lt;a href="https://truthsocial.com/terms-of-service/"&gt;even went as far as to call its software “proprietary,”&lt;/a&gt; and seemingly tried to hide the fact that it was based on Mastodon. Now that the Truth has been revealed, however, TMTG will either have to rebuild it without using Mastodon’s code — a tall order, as bootstrapping a social network site isn’t particularly easy — or release its source code and change the terms of service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ssf4DS"&gt;It’s not the first time Mastodon has had to deal with, as &lt;a href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2021/10/trumps-new-social-media-platform-found-using-mastodon-code/"&gt;Rochko puts it&lt;/a&gt;, “people so antithetical to [its] values” trying to build on top of its open-source platform. In 2019 Gab, a social network known for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18049132/gab-social-network-online-synagogue-shooting-deplatforming-return-godaddy-paypal-stripe-ban"&gt;getting banned from almost everything&lt;/a&gt; due to how many toxic users it had, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/12/20691957/mastodon-decentralized-social-network-gab-migration-fediverse-app-blocking"&gt;decided it would use Mastodon as a backend&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike that situation though, where Gab wasn’t really breaking any rules (at least regarding its use of the software), Truth is violating the AGPL by using Mastodon's code in an unauthorized way. How TMTG will deal with the gauntlet now that it’s been thrown down (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/22/22740354/trump-truth-social-network-spac-mastodon-license-software-freedom-conservancy"&gt;twice&lt;/a&gt;) is anyone’s guess, but it’ll have to respond unless it wants to open itself up to possible legal action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MzstYD"&gt;Trump Media and Technology Group didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FDA clears Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for kids ages five to 11</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A health worker holds a vial containing Pfizer Covid-19..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SrN328K5cqZ2P1sMAbRLXJM7u8Y=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70064178/1235826570.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dinendra Haria/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4U5fsf"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration authorized &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-authorizes-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-emergency-use-children-5-through-11-years-age"&gt;the Pfizer / BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for five- to 11-year-olds&lt;/a&gt;, opening up the shots to a new age group and ending an anxious wait for families of children in that bracket. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QOcBW9"&gt;Children are less likely to have severe symptoms if they contract COVID-19, but they can still catch and spread the disease. Cases and deaths in children peaked in September, which was the worst month for that age group — there were &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/data-shows-more-children-are-getting-sick-dying-covid-n1281616"&gt;over a million&lt;/a&gt; new cases in that group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pViHZs"&gt;The authorization makes vaccination available to 28 million new people in the US. &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-trends-among-children-school/"&gt;Polling in September showed&lt;/a&gt; that around a third of parents say that they wanted to vaccinate their five- to 11-year-old children “right away” after authorization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zv5ZAx"&gt;The Pfizer / BioNTech vaccine is available for this group under an emergency use authorization. The FDA fully approved the shot for people 16 and older, but it’s still considered an emergency use product for people five to 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AwF7KV"&gt;California says that it &lt;a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/10/01/california-becomes-first-state-in-nation-to-announce-covid-19-vaccine-requirements-for-schools/"&gt;plans to add&lt;/a&gt; the COVID-19 vaccine to the list of vaccines required to attend school as soon as it has full approval for school-aged kids and teenagers. New York is &lt;a href="https://www.hudsonvalley360.com/news/nystate/ny-weighs-covid-vaccine-mandate-for-school-children/article_f109828f-0ad1-5d18-882a-411434f48f02.html"&gt;considering&lt;/a&gt; a similar requirement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6THCn1"&gt;The other two COVID-19 vaccines available in the US, the Moderna and Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson shots, are only available to people 18 years of age and older. The FDA was close to clearing the Moderna shot for adolescents between 12 and 17, but &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fda-delays-moderna-covid-19-vaccine-for-adolescents-to-review-rare-myocarditis-side-effect-11634315159"&gt;delayed the decision&lt;/a&gt; to take a closer look at the data around the rare risk of heart inflammation. Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson is still conducting trials in younger age groups. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AOC calls Facebook a ‘cancer to democracy’ after Meta rebrand</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uS7GI2"&gt;Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) called Facebook a “cancer to democracy” in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1453812534599950340?s=20"&gt;a tweet&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday shortly after the company announced that it was changing its corporate name to Meta to better represent its focus on building &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701104/metaverse-explained-fortnite-roblox-facebook-horizon"&gt;the metaverse&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NvwjJo"&gt;“Meta as in “we are a cancer to democracy metastasizing into a global surveillance and propaganda machine for boosting authoritarian regimes and destroying civil society… for profit!” said Ocasio-Cortez &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1453812534599950340?s=20"&gt;on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9LqASD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Meta as in “we are a cancer to democracy metastasizing into a global surveillance and propaganda machine for boosting authoritarian regimes and destroying civil society… for profit!” &lt;a href="https://t.co/jzOcCFaWkJ"&gt;https://t.co/jzOcCFaWkJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1453812534599950340?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K4v52N"&gt;Ocasio-Cortez is one of Facebook’s loudest critics in Congress and has called the company a threat to democracy before. When lawmakers first started to critique Facebook’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/12/18261597/facebook-amazon-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-aoc-elizabeth-warren-democracy-problem"&gt;market dominance in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, she tweeted, “Facebook may have its own problems, but it’s increasingly starting to look like our society (namely, our democracy) has a Facebook problem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u3wXaT"&gt;Earlier this month, Facebook’s years of scandals reached a boiling point when the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; several articles on the company’s own research provided by whistleblower Frances Haugen. Weeks later, Haugen testified before the Senate Commerce Committee’s subcommittee on consumer protection, outlining how platforms like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710539/facebook-whistleblower-hearing-instagram-child-safety-congress"&gt;Instagram harm children and teens&lt;/a&gt;. That testimony sparked new interest from lawmakers to regulate the tech giant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2o12RN"&gt;Facebook has since refused to publish more of its internal research that Haugen leaked, but the company faced yet another scandal when reporters gained access to additional Haugen documents and authored a deluge of other articles examining the company on Monday. These reports have only motivated lawmakers to pursue further legislative action, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22745234/facebook-new-name-meta-metaverse-zuckerberg-rebrand"&gt;Facebook’s corporate rebrand&lt;/a&gt; hasn’t distracted them from these efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Lq2jn3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You can run, but you can’t hide, Facebook”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Un7aZa"&gt;“You can run, but you can’t hide, Facebook,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), who is leading measures to protect child privacy online, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SenBlumenthal/status/1453872465743130644?s=20"&gt;in a Thursday tweet&lt;/a&gt;. “A new nom de plume may confuse &amp;amp; distract, but won’t erase years of devious practices &amp;amp; disregard for privacy, kids’ well-being, spreading hate, &amp;amp; genocide.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aU8al6"&gt;“Changing Facebook’s name doesn’t change what you’ve done, Mark,” Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), the top Republican on Blumenthal’s subcommittee, said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UPse2S"&gt;As part of her 2020 presidential platform, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) was the first to call on the federal government &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/8/18256032/elizabeth-warren-antitrust-google-amazon-facebook-break-up"&gt;to break up Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and other tech giants. Warren reinforced this point &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SenWarren/status/1454086975380729867?s=20"&gt;in a Thursday tweet&lt;/a&gt;, writing, “Facebook changing their corporate name to Meta isn’t going to change the underlying facts. They’re a monopoly. They crush competition. And they refuse to control the spread of misinformation and harmful content on their site. We need to break up Facebook.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eIZXzN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wHp4i3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Developers can now try on Google’s Jacquard smart fabric tech</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YNvrxQDmPgwT1F7wC6WiSlvPsjc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70063714/vpavic_171005_2036_0013.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Swiping into new ideas | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A0VKDI"&gt;Google’s Project Jacquard touch-sensitive fabric technology, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/28/8682957/touch-sensitive-fabric-and-tiny-radar-chips-hands-on-with-ataps"&gt;first revealed&lt;/a&gt; at Google I/O in 2015, now has a way for interested third-party developers to integrate the tech with their own software via the new &lt;a href="https://atap.google.com/jacquard/jacquardsdk/"&gt;Jacquard SDK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMFUjP"&gt;Previously only a handful of companies signed up for Jacquard, including Levi’s, Samsonite, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/4/20849788/google-project-jacquard-yves-saint-laurent-smart-backpack-cit-e-bluetooth-fabric-control-price"&gt;Yves Saint Laurent&lt;/a&gt;. Now developers can use the SDK to integrate the Jacquard tag, connecting its sensors with their apps to communicate touch and motion data.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Samsonite Konnect-i" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3NpdZPSxE9TqXB39e_PthgqepRQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21925987/cfaulkner_200929_4215_0004.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsonite’s Konnect-i backpack is one of very few products to integrate the touch-sensitive fibers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4V6OFK"&gt;Google’s ATAP (Advanced Technology and Projects) team announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/29/8687613/levi-google-atap-partnership-announced"&gt;first partnership&lt;/a&gt; with Levi’s in 2015, and put Jacquard technology into customers’ sleeves two years later with the 2017 release of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/25/16354712/google-project-jacquard-levis-commuter-trucker-jacket-price-release-date"&gt;Levi’s commuter jacket&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KU3g5x"&gt;We thought the jacket was neat but also pretty expensive with a price that started at $350. Two years after the initial 2017 drop, Jacquard got redesigned into a smaller tag and integrated into another line of Levi’s products at a lower price. The 2019 release of the Jacquard and Levi’s trucker jacket was a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/30/20888909/google-levi-project-jacquard-available-trucker-sherpa-jackets-price-design"&gt;solid update on a shaky idea&lt;/a&gt;, which has historically been a prelude to Google &lt;a href="https://killedbygoogle.com"&gt;sunsetting things&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rSFxAm"&gt;It remains to be seen how well outside developers will embrace Jacquard, and how much support they can expect from Google. The FAQ section of the &lt;a href="https://atap.google.com/jacquard/jacquardsdk/"&gt;SDK site&lt;/a&gt; only asks one question: “Can someone add new abilities to the official Jacquard app?” to which Google responds in short: “No. The current Jacquard app remains as built.” Thankfully, the release of an SDK means that Google ATAP can hand off what seems to be their burden child and give Jacquard a fighting chance to prove it can do more than just skip your music tracks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A tweaked display cable might give your next laptop slightly better battery life</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Laptops 2020: Dell G5 15 SE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mu26ih0-Du8k2Uzu6KLL73EqBKY=/99x76:1818x1222/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70063696/cfaulkner_200714_4098_0010.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UbwkZe"&gt;Don’t you love standards? I do, for the most part, particularly when they’re fixing things, and the new VESA Embedded DisplayPort 1.5 (or eDP 1.5 for short) looks likely to do that in future fancy-screened laptops. It’s promising more power savings with adaptive-sync screens, OLED panels, and displays that come with their own embedded memory for the battery saving Panel Self-Refresh (PSR) feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nbfZ9X"&gt;eDP is the standard for cables and ribbons that connect your high-res screen to the rest of your laptop or tablet, and technically it’s supported all those things before — but they haven’t necessarily played nicely together. For example, I had to turn off PSR &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/14/20909422/dell-xps-15-7590-2019-review-oled-core-i9-specs-features-price"&gt;when I reviewed the OLED-equipped Dell XPS 15 in 2019&lt;/a&gt; because the screen was constantly flickering, even though manufacturers &lt;a href="https://pcper.com/2011/09/panel-self-refresh-a-new-way-to-save-power/"&gt;have had a decade&lt;/a&gt; to figure out the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6_ip8F84MUJ9zOfXOTo5CS2ISjw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22967236/VESA_eDP_1.5_Panel_Replay_scaled_e1635348221890.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;VESA&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Panel Replay can update part of an image, instead of the entire frame.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YRJOnW"&gt;You probably shouldn’t expect &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; additional battery life here: in each of these cases (adaptive sync, OLED and PSR), VESA’s generally talking about additional runtime when your screen isn’t working very hard — perhaps not even moving at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4bVUJH"&gt;Adaptive sync can tell your GPU to spit out fewer frames to match a slower refresh rate of your screen, saving power. Panel Self-Refresh can tell your GPU to produce no additional frames at all since the memory in your display could just store the current screen image in its frame buffer. And with an OLED screen, which has some natural persistence (it’s why blacks can sometimes smear), you may be able to forgo some frames as well. In each case, your GPU gets to power down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wI8GLJ"&gt;Now, VESA says eDP 1.5 adds Panel Replay, a feature also coming to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230654/displayport-2-monitors-delay-vesa-statement"&gt;the delayed DisplayPort 2.0&lt;/a&gt; for external monitors and desktop GPUs — it allows your computer to update &lt;em&gt;part&lt;/em&gt; of your screen while leaving the rest untouched, and it works with adaptive sync. eDP 1.5 also formally supports lower refresh rates for OLED screens without the frame buffer, allows adaptive sync to fine-tune the framerate to avoid skipping or repeating frames during video playback, and specifically addresses flicker. There’s also a new “ability to disable the display interface during normal operation (when not using panel self-refresh) during the vertical blanking period, which provides added power savings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Dudn1"&gt;Overall, “eDP 1.5 achieves power saving by enabling the GPU to briefly power down between frames, which combined with the capability to adjust the frame rate based on workload, allows for additional power saving opportunities,” writes VESA’s chairman. “ We look forward to the increased battery life this will enable across a broad spectrum of laptop PCs.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uncharted creative director Amy Hennig is making a Marvel game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="BAFTA LA Celebrates Amy Hennig" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c00A8bL4rnQXoJXEB0gd-JjIe44=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70063580/539785444.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for BAFTA LA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qsAHFQ"&gt;Amy Hennig, a former creative director at Naughty Dog who currently leads Skydance New Media, will be working on a new Marvel video game. &lt;a href="https://skydance.com/news/skydance-new-media-joins-forces-with-marvel-entertainment-to-create-an-all-new-interactive-title/"&gt;Skydance describes the game&lt;/a&gt;, which is its first, as a “narrative-driven, blockbuster action-adventure game, featuring a completely original story and take on the Marvel Universe” but hasn’t said which superheroes will be featured in the game. The studio also hasn’t shared a release date (or even a release timeframe) and hasn’t said which platforms the game will be available on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SIO9zV"&gt;Despite how little we actually know about the game, Hennig’s involvement in a story-driven Marvel project is an intriguing proposition. Hennig served as a writer and creative director for the first three &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; games, so hopefully, this new Marvel game will similarly blend action and heart to make for a compelling experience. (The combination worked well in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22747428/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-review-ps5-square-enix"&gt;new &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; game released this week&lt;/a&gt;, after all.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tM8icE"&gt;Skydance’s new game also joins an impressive lineup of Marvel games on the horizon, which include the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22641590/midnight-suns-marvel-tactics-rpg-xcom-firaxis-trailer-release-date-gamescom"&gt;tactical RPG &lt;em&gt;Marvel’s Midnight Suns&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from XCOM developer Firaxis and Insomniac’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665533/spider-man-2-insomniac-games-peter-parker-miles-morales-venom-ps5-2023"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665529/insomniac-wolverine-ps5"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Wolverine&lt;/em&gt; game&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re a Marvel fan, there are some exciting games to look forward to.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A new wave of lo-fi games is reshaping horror</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jZk_ucYrLUYRnBo3mikdqLOCEr8=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70063156/If_on_a_WInter_s_Night_Four_Travelers_alt.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If on a Winter’s Night Four Travelers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Indie developers are turning pixels into scares&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="I2bUwl"&gt;Something writhes in video game horror’s dark underbelly; it has been doing so for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="81ooOV"&gt;But lately, convulsions have grown violent and the hideous mass threatens to spill over into the mainstream where more respectable nightmares reign. The likes of &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Alan Wake&lt;/em&gt; are now adhering to the same rules governing spectacle as the latest &lt;em&gt;FIFA&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; installment, terrifying you at pristine 4K resolutions. This is the ninth console generation currently shaping our entertainment landscape, after all, and there are certain expectations as regards visual fidelity. Have you seen how the sun’s rays reflect on Castle Dimitrescu’s marble floors?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJa2Ct"&gt;New retro horror scoffs at such notions of verisimilitude. It will draw the curtains to keep volumetric lighting out and puke all over the exquisite tiling so you’re not distracted by its intricate patterns. A steady procession of brash alternatives to the handful of dominating franchises (as well as the mid-budget imitations) has been making its presence felt recently. These games are inspired by long-obsolete genres implementing unconventional mechanics and evoking memories from the medium’s rich past. Wildly divergent, this new generation of lo-fi horror games is united by a shared philosophy: treating earlier, era-specific styles from the crude polygons of the original PlayStation to 1-bit monochrome palettes not as intermediary failures on the path to some dubious ideal of “realism,” but embracing them as valid aesthetic springboards in their own right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B3XMRJ"&gt;And people have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21120144/world-of-horror-steam-panstasz-lovecraft-early-access-launch-preview"&gt;paying attention&lt;/a&gt;. In the last couple of years, the scene has exploded. Puppet Combo — who has been turning his favorite childhood VHS slashers into low-poly gore-fests for about a decade — has just started his own production company, &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?publisher=Torture%20Star%20Video"&gt;Torture Star Video&lt;/a&gt;, mobilizing his popularity to highlight the talents of other creators in the niche. Two ongoing anthology series, &lt;a href="https://hauntedps1.itch.io/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Haunted PS1 Demo Disc&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/18324/Dread_X_Collection_Year_1_Bundle/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dread X Collection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, have revitalized a format oddly neglected in the medium. And themed game jams have imposed time and theme constraints on developers consistently producing some of the most imaginative work in the field, exemplified by Teebowah’s Game Boy-inspired creepy excursion in &lt;a href="https://teebowah-games.itch.io/fishing-vacation"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fishing Vacation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Ben Jelter’s trailer-park enigma of &lt;a href="https://benjelter.itch.io/opossum-country"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Opossum Country&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But what has prompted the sudden surge of popularity for such archaic iconography? And why the disproportionate focus of such efforts on horror?&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dread Delusion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nOlwNT"&gt;A partial answer to the first question is glaringly obvious. Nostalgia has emerged as a pervasive cultural force in the last decade, from synthwave YouTube playlists to &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt;. Why should gaming be exempt from its influence? Under the alias -IZMA-, Adam Birch released &lt;a href="https://izma.itch.io/deadeus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadeus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the Game Boy in 2019, a Lovecraftian small-town mystery in the vein of classic JRPGs. He admits nostalgia is part of what motivates him. “When I was a kid growing up, I had a Game Boy and had friends with Mega Drives and SNES. That era is seared into my brain because of [these consoles]. It stands to reason that, when people finally achieve the ability, they’d attempt to make games similar to those that made them fall in love with it all in the first place.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P3Myy6"&gt;The generational angle is certainly consistent with the timeline of the phenomenon. Roughly a decade separates the establishment of pixel art as a viable aesthetic even for mainstream games (such as the 2011 iOS hit &lt;em&gt;Superbrothers: Sword &amp;amp; Sworcery EP&lt;/em&gt; which sold more than a million copies) from the crude polygons and grainy video currently in the ascendant. The time span neatly corresponds to the gap between the heyday of the 8-bit platforms referenced by the former and the release of Sony’s groundbreaking PS1 console that inspires the latter — or the period during which a new crop of indie developers could have come of age. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="LA5Ilz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s also something about the tactility of physical media which is gratifying.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F2jX9A"&gt;James Wragg, creator of standout &lt;em&gt;Haunted PS1 Demo Disc&lt;/em&gt; entry &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1574240/Dread_Delusion/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dread Delusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, corroborates, albeit with an important caveat. “A lot of it is nostalgia, sure — the PlayStation start-up music will forever stimulate a cluster of neurons in my head. [But] there’s also something about the tactility of physical media which is gratifying; just as book lovers will relish the smell of a new book, flipping through a manual before you pop a disc in a PS1 drive is a more enticing ritual than clicking a ‘download’ button.” Nostalgia may be a universal impulse, but its siren call is most effective when it responds to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/smarter-living/why-we-romanticize-the-past.html"&gt;a certain lack&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0qW6LY"&gt;Birch believes the lack is not so much about the paraphernalia that used to accompany a game’s packaging (even as he catered to that need by also releasing &lt;em&gt;Deadeus&lt;/em&gt; as a physical cartridge) but of a sufficiently diverse range of stories and experiences within the blockbuster sphere. “It has almost become a cliche that there will be a bloated overworld map with 1,000 similar tasks and some watchtower to climb. This on top of a climbing price tag and an almost ‘safe’ approach to subject matter all paves the way for completely off-the-wall, cheaper indie games to go down some dark story paths and fill the void.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RGMkO-ymgBSN-2ClulNWI99mbAY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22962898/FAITH.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Faith.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ispzvr1UwH34vvGhcZD14DIB_hI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22962899/FAITH_alt.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Faith.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lVJpka"&gt;As for developers, a different sort of lack may account for new retro horror’s appeal: the ability to compete with big-budget spectacle. “Using low-poly models or creating 1-bit visuals is a much more sensible option for most indie devs who might be more interested in telling a story or inducing specific feelings than in movie-realistic graphics,” says Laura Hunt, co-creator of the decidedly unrealistic but visually stunning cosmic-horror adventure &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1603980/If_On_A_Winters_Night_Four_Travelers/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;If On A Winter’s Night, Four Travelers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. While she has worked on perennial favorite Adventure Game Studio, a wider range of accessible specialist tools are increasingly facilitating the creation of perfect simulacra of a Commodore 64 or an SNES title. Birch even acknowledges that the genre and mood of &lt;em&gt;Deadeus&lt;/em&gt; were shaped by the limitations of GB Studio, the engine he experimented with while developing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0wsf7T"&gt;While arguments based on generational nostalgia apply equally to most retro-styled games, the growing availability of intuitive middleware points to an aspect of the phenomenon that is more horror-specific. Ted Hentschke, the mind behind the &lt;em&gt;Dread X Collection &lt;/em&gt;project, believes that, as with the flood of found-footage movies that followed &lt;em&gt;Paranormal Activity&lt;/em&gt;’s wide release in 2009, “the current popularity of retro-styled horror games has less to do with nostalgia than it does with the idea that any one of us can do it. When you look at Airdorf’s &lt;a href="https://airdorf.itch.io/faith"&gt;&lt;em&gt;FAITH&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, that little pixel guy walking around, it doesn’t seem impossible that I could do that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="BqzH43"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They can prime the player’s mind to be surprised and creeped out.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2pr6Cq"&gt;There’s a reason for that. &lt;em&gt;Faith&lt;/em&gt; may be one of the most famous titles in the scene, an exorcism simulator that put to rest any silly notions that pixel art can’t scare the wits out of you, but it looks as if it could run on a 1982 Atari console. Mason Smith, better known as Airdorf, has an explanation for the capacity for such unorthodox visuals to unsettle that circles back to the blockbuster-fatigue argument. “Since retro-styled graphics have this innocent lo-fi quality to them, I think they can prime the player’s mind to be surprised and creeped out when the game goes after the player themselves, more so than your advanced 3D graphics.” While the homogeneity of marquee franchises will put off a segment of the audience in any genre, it is horror that, by its very nature, thrives on the unexpected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W7eFV0"&gt;This framing also serves to illuminate a deeper link between new retro horror and the cursed-media fad manifesting in the form of &lt;em&gt;Ringu&lt;/em&gt;-inspired movies, explicitly meta games (such as Ivan Zanotti’s &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/429720/IMSCARED/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Imscared&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), and umpteen creepypasta threads. As &lt;em&gt;Faith&lt;/em&gt; oscillates between pixel-art gameplay and jarringly incongruous rotoscoped cutscenes, the latter are so much more obviously advanced that they generate an impression of the game clambering up the ontological ladder and coming alive. Airdorf concedes that “although it was never meant to be a ‘cursed’ meta-game, I still admired the long-lasting effects those had on players. There are a few details that came from the ‘cursed’ game phenomenon, like the chromatic aberration effect that glitches the screen a little bit when something spooky happens.” Paradoxically, the flexibility of retro visuals allows for a broader arsenal of scares than the mandates of realism dictating the direction of big-budget horror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5U3OXg"&gt;At the same time, the question arises whether, with an expanding fan base and the arrival of the PS1 as an in-vogue reference point, the scene is inching toward an impasse. The long-running appeal of pixel art has already led to it being assimilated into the mainstream and, to some degree, stripped of its power to surprise. Could that be the future for other strains of new retro horror? More fundamentally, while people will always feel a personal sense of nostalgia for the console they grew up with, the PS1 was arguably the last piece of hardware to effect deep cultural change while introducing an instantly recognizable iconography. It is not that it’s too early to adopt, say, an Xbox 360 aesthetic; it’s that the very notion of it seems inconceivable. It is not unreasonable to suspect that we are running out of distinct visual styles to reclaim from the medium’s history, but whether that spells doom for the movement as a creative endeavor remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SHFTJy"&gt;Wragg offers a thoughtful rebuttal. “Like impressionism in painting, the PS1 style portrays reality through the subjective vision of an artist. With smaller budgets and less at stake, these artists are free to create worlds that are surreal, strange, or uniquely beautiful in a way that you might not see in the mainstream industry. The intentional jankiness of the scene is like when punk music incorporates noise and reverb, a postmodern acceptance of the seams and imperfections within art that becomes part of the artwork itself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="4GIsmA"&gt;In this light, it’s not the fondness for a particular era’s visuals that defines this haphazard movement whose instruments of revolution consist of blocky pixels, garish colors, and a whole lot of visual static. Instead, it’s the impetus to seek a language of creative expression outside accepted conventions. New retro horror is just the latest iteration of that never-ending quest. &lt;/p&gt;
