    <title>Listen to the sounds of China’s Zhurong rover on the surface of Mars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="China’s Zhurong rover on the surface of Mars, next to its landing platform." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jc4M1FjR6iIVU574r-T7R4qSgVg=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69511112/zhurong_rover_selfie.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="http://www.cnsa.gov.cn/n6759533/c6812126/content.html" target="_blank"&gt;CNSA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GpBtSv"&gt;In March, NASA released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/3/11/22324870/nasa-perseverance-supercam-laser-strike-audio-recording-micrphone"&gt;audio of its Perseverance rover&lt;/a&gt; firing lasers on the surface of Mars. Now China has released audio of what it says is its Zhurong rover arriving on the red planet and getting settled in, &lt;a href="https://spacenews.com/chinas-zhurong-rover-returns-landing-footage-and-sounds-from-mars/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Space News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports. China has also released pictures of its Mars rover, which is unexpectedly cute as we saw in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22529603/china-cnsa-zhurong-rover-selfie-mars-perseverance"&gt;its first “selfie”&lt;/a&gt; a few weeks ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kRKEqY"&gt;Listen to what it sounds like as Zhurong rolls down the ramp of its lander vehicle on to the surface (but just to manage your expectations: you’re not going to hear any “pew pew pew” noises). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SfDRdh"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Xa97M5nsWU?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=9&amp;amp;start=9" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Lohqey"&gt;The solar-powered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436072/china-tianwen-1-mars-landing-zhurong-rover"&gt;Zhurong first landed on Mars&lt;/a&gt; in May, part of China’s Tianwen-1 mission which arrived in Mars’ orbit in February. After descending from the Tianwen-1 orbiter above the planet’s surface, Zhurong began its Martian journey on Utopia Planitia, a smooth plain where NASA’s Viking 2 lander touched down in 1976. That’s more than 1,000 miles away from the Jezero Crater where the US rover &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289668/nasa-mars-perseverance-rover-success"&gt;Perseverance touched down in February&lt;/a&gt;, however, so it’s not likely the two rovers will be hanging out together anytime soon. NASA’s Curiosity rover, which landed on Mars in 2012, was spotted by NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter &lt;a href="https://www.space.com/mars-rover-curiosity-on-mont-mercou-orbit-photo"&gt;climbing the planet’s Mont Mercou&lt;/a&gt; last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JB2V2S"&gt;Zhurong, named for a Chinese god of fire, is almost halfway through its 90-day mission. But like &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/463600a"&gt;other rovers&lt;/a&gt; on the red planet, it could &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00575-2"&gt;continue&lt;/a&gt; to traverse Mars’ surface for several years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oA6VZY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: The Harder They Fall, Ted Lasso, The Suicide Squad, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FwBR07XF1meccu6ml0OlduyE8yE=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69510942/king_and_elba.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Regina King and Idris Elba in &lt;em&gt;The Harder They Fall&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKz5kZr8mrg&amp;amp;ab_channel=Netflix" target="_blank"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5eTIke"&gt;Since it was one of the top picks on Netflix and everyone’s talking about it, I started watching Manifest and got five episodes in before I realized it was basically a version of Lost with a few wacky twists and I am not falling for THAT again. But the deeply weird and wonderful &lt;em&gt;The Good Fight&lt;/em&gt; is back, and the pilot had Christine Baranski and Audra McDonald at their best, so I can’t wait to see what happens this season (although we said goodbye to two of the show’s best characters, boo). Also can we talk about &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;? We probably can’t without giving away spoilers but episode three gave us a LOT, most of which I suspect were attempts at misdirection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KQN1sH"&gt;I got so engrossed in writing last Sunday’s trailers post that I totally missed the new &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; trailer that dropped that day. Derp. Don’t worry, I’ve included it here (in case you haven’t already watched it 1,000 times like I have).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OPphFJ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pKz5kZr8mrg?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="AUbM7U"&gt;The Harder They Fall &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iPeNzE"&gt;This trailer (sorry, it’s the official &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;teaser&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) for a Western about rival outlaw gangs opens with a train heist where Regina King and Lakeith Stanfield free Idris Elba from captivity— with &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zWRjgathjA&amp;amp;ab_channel=gd73"&gt;“Let’s Start”&lt;/a&gt; by Fela Kuti playing — and then proceed to shoot their way out in slow-motion. It’s almost too much cool to take in all at once. Our plot: Outlaw Nat Love (Jonathan Majors) and his gang Stagecoach Mary (Zazie Beetz), Bill Pickett (Edi Gathegi), and Jim Beckwourth (RJ Cyler) are rivals of the newly-released Rufus Buck (Elba) and his crew, Treacherous Judy Smith (King), and Cherokee Bill (Stanfield). Delroy Lindo and Damon Wayans Jr., also star in &lt;em&gt;The Harder They Fall&lt;/em&gt;, (what a cast!) which is directed by Jeymes Samuel and is coming to Netflix soon (hurry up pls!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yRcGXN"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/reP1gVGpFKo?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="R4dHfK"&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="RXhhjk"&gt;Ted unleashes his alter ego Led Tasso to be tough and mean to the floundering Richmond football club and it’s so goofy and ridiculous but so very &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; (lol he calls them “turd birds” what?). Jason Sudeikis and the rest of the crew are back in the second season, and we have less than a month to wait for new episodes, you guys (side note: you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22543775/apple-tv-ted-lasso-merch-kit-jersey-trailer-season-2"&gt;buy Richmond jerseys&lt;/a&gt; at the Ted Lasso merch store). Season 2 of &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; premieres July 23rd on Apple TV Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3khcqb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eg5ciqQzmK0?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="B9yc13"&gt;The Suicide Squad&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="V7HVWx"&gt;Is Idris Elba in every movie coming out this summer? (for the record I am very OK with this). James Gunn’s take on the band of supervillains led by Elba as Bloodsport (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JamesGunn/status/1407730256283193351"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; at last!) has them taking on even badder bad guys on a remote jungle island. Margot Robbie, Viola Davis, Joel Kinnaman, Michael Rooker, Pete Davidson, Nathan Fillion, and John Cena also star in&lt;em&gt; The Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to theaters and HBO Max on August 6th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PKpjTu"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8YjFbMbfXaQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="QJyLPV"&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HCs08s"&gt;We saw a&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;teaser&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; for this movie back in April, but this is the official &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;trailer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (and again, I don’t think there’s really much difference between teasers and trailers anymore, but I digress). Simu Liu plays Shang-Chi, trained as an assassin as a child, who is trying to escape to have a normal life. This latest movie in the Marvel cinematic universe has an almost entirely Asian cast, including its title character. And yes, the giant monster Shang-Chi is shown fighting in a cage match &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MCU_Direct/status/1408233747082878988?"&gt;looks to be Abomination&lt;/a&gt;. Tony Leung, Michelle Yeoh, and Awkwafina also star in &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,&lt;/em&gt; coming to theaters September 3rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e7PAyF"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yKG0RodrzVo?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="EPVmei"&gt;Schmigadoon! &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="hCQ1aL"&gt;Keegan Michael Key and Cecily Strong play a couple trapped in a musical until they find true love. OK, sure, why not. This six-episode series has an all-star cast of musical talent, including Kristin Chenoweth, Alan Cummings, Fred Armisen, Jane Krakowski, and Martin Short. This feels like one of those flicks that is either going to be super funny or super cringe (although I did laugh at Strong’s character realizing that musicals kill people off all the time, so that’s a good sign). &lt;em&gt;Schmigadoon! &lt;/em&gt;(I’ll let them have the exclamation point) comes to Apple TV Plus on July 16th, with new episodes every Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I00scW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leaked renders of Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 show four color options </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aCMLh66kl6MC5vA3noHW2AMLBF8=/127x0:1074x631/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69510367/samsung_galaxy_buds_2_render_feat.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-official-renders-design-colours-exclusive/" target="_blank"&gt;91Mobiles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gomkgu"&gt;Leaked renders of the Galaxy Buds 2 obtained by &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-official-renders-design-colours-exclusive/"&gt;gadget site&lt;em&gt; 91Mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggest the next iteration of Samsung’s earbuds will look pretty &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21400695/google-pixel-buds-2-2020-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review"&gt;similar to&lt;/a&gt; Google’s Pixel Buds. A May &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/galaxy-buds-2-fcc-leak/"&gt;filing with the FCC&lt;/a&gt; showed the earbuds woud come in a white case with rounded edges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BmcV4k"&gt;The new images confirm &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/05/galaxy-buds-2-color-report/"&gt;previous reports&lt;/a&gt; that the buds will come in four different colors: black, green, purple, and white. The cases in the new renders show each will have a white exterior, while the internal color will match the buds. There aren’t a lot of other details available yet, including price, but the new renders show that the Galaxy Buds will have two microphones for improved noise reduction, and their in-ear design will include silicon tips, much like the Galaxy Buds Pro. According to &lt;em&gt;91Mobiles&lt;/em&gt;, the Galaxy Buds 2 aren’t expected to have active noise cancellation, but will have active noise reduction. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WNi8eLwp2I1XVBMO78CrLXAP5Ck=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22684459/samsung_galaxy_buds_2_renders_09.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WtUU69"&gt;The FCC filing showed the Buds 2 with a charging case that holds a 500mAh battery, and each earbud will have a 60mAh battery. &lt;em&gt;91Mobiles &lt;/em&gt;speculates that Samsung may unveil the Galaxy Buds 2 at Mobile World Congress, which gets underway on June 28th, but also hold out the possibility that the buds will be revealed in August, when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22546997/samsung-galaxy-watch-active-4-renders-leak-tizen-wear-os-smartwatch"&gt;Samsung may launch&lt;/a&gt; new Galaxy Z devices.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube reportedly took down videos by group documenting human rights abuses in China</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1F1aLPakXJdu5gT_KkNoMxoUvks=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69510143/acastro_180806_1777_youtube_cancel_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="inZKkl"&gt;YouTube took down several videos from a human rights organization’s channel, which was attempting to document human rights abuses in China’s Xinjiang province, for violating its anti-harassment policy, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-youtube-takes-down-xinjiang-videos-forces-rights-group-seek-2021-06-25/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NJQvWt"&gt;On June 15th, Atajurt Kazakh Human Rights said the Google-owned video platform disabled its channel entirely, telling the group it had received too many strikes against its channel for videos where people displayed identification cards showing they were related to missing Xinjiang residents. That apparently broke YouTube’s rule against displaying personal information, which led to the videos’ removal. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5uns79sHr1AZiUw1ikV7PQ"&gt;The channel&lt;/a&gt; was restored three days later, according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="87Iglq"&gt;YouTube reportedly asked Atajurt to cut out or conceal the IDs in the videos, but the channel’s administrator said  they didn’t want to do so out of concern that such action would damage its credibility. Atajurt has been praised by organizations including &lt;a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/08/21/silencing-activist-shows-kazakhstans-contempt-rights"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt; for helping to expose human rights violations. According to &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/06/24/1027048/youtube-xinjiang-censorship-human-rights-atajurt/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Atajurt posts testimonies from the family members of people detained in Chinese internment camps in Xinjiang. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K9j5ec"&gt;Most of the videos that were removed have been restored following appeals, but some remained unviewable, and according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, Atajurt is backing up its videos on blockchain-based video platform Odysee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yR2Upn"&gt;Google didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment on Sunday, but told &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; that it welcomes “responsible efforts to document important human rights cases around the world.” YouTube has “strict policies that prohibit harassment... including doxing,” which is why it doesn’t allow personally identifiable information to be published. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qhMiCq"&gt;A June 10th &lt;a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/06/china-draconian-repression-of-muslims-in-xinjiang-amounts-to-crimes-against-humanity/"&gt;report from Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt; found that the Chinese government had conducted state-organized persecution, including torture, against people in Xinjiang provice in western China, including Uyghurs and Kazakhs. The United Nations has estimated that at least 1 million &lt;a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/2/22/china-rejects-uighurs-genocide-charge-invites-uns-rights-chief"&gt;Uyghurs are being held&lt;/a&gt; in internment camps in China, a claim that China has disputed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I75BZ5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9XGr6m"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="mzMYwW"&gt;According to a Friday filing with the Federal Communications Commission (first &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/verizon-smart-display-alexa"&gt;discovered by &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), Verizon is preparing to launch a smart display device based on the Alexa voice assistant. &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/NKR-LVD1-IDU"&gt;The FCC filing shows&lt;/a&gt; a basic-looking device that resembles an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529891/amazon-echo-show-5-2nd-gen-alexa-smart-display-review"&gt;Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt;, with an 8-inch display and front-facing camera, and the specs show it has 4GB of RAM, 16GB of internal storage, Bluetooth, wi-fi and 4G connectivity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MAXnhT"&gt;It’s not clear from the filing what the user interface will look like on its screen but the device, referred to as LVD1, will “wake” when users speak the phrase “Hi Verizon” to it. That would seem to confirm, as &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; notes, that the device is part of Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231336/amazon-alexa-auto-ai-custom-digital-assistants-car-makers"&gt;Alexa Custom Assistant program&lt;/a&gt;, which allows companies to build their own versions of Alexa for their branded devices. building Alexa skills specific to certain devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z3Zvd4"&gt;A user manual included in the FCC filing indicates the device supports the BlueJeans videoconferencing platform that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21223454/verizon-bluejeans-video-zoom-conferencing-rivals"&gt;Verizon acquired last April&lt;/a&gt;, which would be a logical use for it. At the time of the acquisition, Verizon said in a statement that “BlueJeans will be deeply integrated into Verizon’s 5G product roadmap, providing secure and real-time engagement solutions for high growth areas such as telemedicine, distance learning and field service work.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8pe3mo"&gt;Verizon didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GbHHE2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Volkswagen plans to stop selling combustion engine vehicles in Europe by 2035</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tYpBVgWDxjXIUPCNOHg6gZet4DQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69508669/acastro_200406_1777_volkswagen_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="innDt7"&gt;Volkswagen plans to stop selling combustion engines in Europe by 2035, a board member told German newspaper &lt;em&gt;Muenchner Merkur  &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/vw-end-sales-combustion-engines-europe-by-2035-2021-06-26/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Lnb90"&gt;Klaus Zellmer, Volkswagen’s board member for sales, told the newspaper that the company would “exit the business with internal combustion engine cars in Europe between 2033 and 2035.” But, he added, it would take longer to stop selling combustion engines in the US and China— that will come “somewhate later,” he said— and in South America and Africa, where he said “it will take a good deal longer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SCpK1a"&gt;Zellmer said the automaker’s entire fleet will be carbon neutral by 2050 at the latest. He wants to see electric vehicles to account for 70 percent of the company’s total sales in Europe by 2030. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HHgy1V"&gt;Volkswagen’s carbon-neutral targets are close to several competitors; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287284/ford-electric-vehicles-ev-europe-2030"&gt;Ford said earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; will only sell electric vehicles in Europe by 2030, and plans to spend $1 billion to convert its factory in Cologne, Germany, into an EV production line. And in April &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22399212/honda-gas-car-phase-out-2040-electric-vehicle"&gt;Honda said it plans&lt;/a&gt; to phase out gas-powered cars by 2040. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="td3AC3"&gt;Several European countries have their own targets for banning traditional gas-powered vehicles, with Norway aiming for 2025 and France looking at 2040, and the UK planning &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-54981425"&gt;on 2030&lt;/a&gt;. In the US, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452825/california-ban-combustion-gas-vehicles-cars-2035"&gt;California plans&lt;/a&gt; to ban the sale of gas-powered vehicles by 2035, with several other states adopting California’s model. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Johnson &amp; Johnson settles opioid case with New York for $230 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration Johnson &amp;amp;amp; Johnson logo seen..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pJ3hZO6Ri4Qq_KmEvKxwchF5JLU=/0x209:5000x3542/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69508384/1233004651.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5XARA0"&gt;Pharmaceutical company Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson will pay $230 million to settle an opioid lawsuit with the state of New York, the state’s attorney general said Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZyu5f"&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2021/attorney-general-james-reaches-230-million-settlement-treatment-and-prevention"&gt;release from New York AG Letitia James&lt;/a&gt;, Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson “has committed to ending the manufacture and sale of all opioids and opioid products for distribution in the state of New York, as well as to no longer ship these products anywhere within the United States.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H6mC6i"&gt;The company &lt;a href="https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-reaches-opioid-settlement-agreement-with-new-york-state-consistent-with-terms-of-previously-announced-broader-settlement-agreement-in-principle"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt; Saturday that it “made the business decision in 2020 to discontinue all of its prescription pain medications in the United States.” The settlement removes Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson from a trial &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/johnson-johnson-settles-new-york-opioid-case-for-230-million-11624716067?mod=hp_lead_pos1"&gt;scheduled to begin in New York on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, but not from other cases across the US, where local governments, states, and Native American tribes have sued pharmaceutical companies over the flow of opioids into their communities.  &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/johnson-johnsons-oklahoma-opioid-penalty-reduced-to-465-million-11573854343?mod=article_inline"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson was ordered to pay $465 million&lt;/a&gt; in an opioid case in Oklahoma in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZ78bm"&gt; “Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson helped fuel this fire, but today they’re committing to leaving the opioid business — not only in New York, but across the entire country,” James said in a statement. “Opioids will no longer be manufactured or sold in the United States by J&amp;amp;J.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KAqswQ"&gt;The drugmaker said in its statement Saturday that the settlement was not an admission of liability or wrongdoing, and is “consistent with the terms of the &lt;a href="https://www.jnj.com/statement-on-opioid-resolution"&gt;previously announced&lt;/a&gt; $5 billion all-in settlement agreement in principle for the resolution of opioid lawsuits and claims by states, cities, counties and tribal governments.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hsAp0a"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dune release date has been delayed yet again</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nDDxOlU8K9y3bSKGxSlV4WQYVc0=/288x0:1574x857/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69508062/chalamet.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9xhJrPXop4&amp;amp;ab_channel=WarnerBros.Pictures" target="_blank"&gt;WarnerBros&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zwgNNr"&gt;Denis Villeneuve’s &lt;em&gt;Dune &lt;/em&gt;was among the big 2020 movies that saw its release date delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. After being moved to October 1st, Dune’s release has been pushed back yet again, this time to October 22nd, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/dune-delayed-warner-bros-1235005456/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reports. The move was one of several releases Warner Bros. rescheduled, with the Clint Eastwood-directed &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1924245/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cry Macho&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; moved to September 17th, and &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8110232/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Many Saints of Newark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; a prequel to &lt;em&gt;The Sopranos&lt;/em&gt;, moved to October 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lHrZsV"&gt;The adaptation of the 1965 Frank Herbert sci-fi classic has an all-star cast that includes Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Stellan Skarsgård, Zendaya, Jason Momoa, Josh Brolin, Dave Bautista, and Javier Bardem. &lt;em&gt;Dune &lt;/em&gt;is slated to be the first of two movies based on the book. The movie coming out in October (at this point, anyway) will cover the massive novel’s first half, while a second as-yet-unnamed movie is planned to cover the rest. There was also an &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/2019/6/10/18660412/dune-villenueve-dune-movie-streaming-show-sisterhood"&gt;HBO Max prequel series&lt;/a&gt; in the works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7OWyQi"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n9xhJrPXop4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mTD8H6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; is among the upcoming Warner Bros. movies slated to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;debut on HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; at the same time it hits theaters. That controversial decision &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;announced by Warner Bros. in December&lt;/a&gt;, didn’t sit well with many in the industry including Villenueve. He blasted the studio’s then-parent company AT&amp;amp;T, saying in a &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/film/news/dune-denis-villeneuve-blasts-warner-bros-1234851270/#article-comments"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;op-ed&lt;/a&gt; that it had “hijacked one of the most respectable and important studios in film history.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439964/at-t-warnermedia-discovery-merger-spin-off"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T announced in May&lt;/a&gt; that it would spin off its WarnerMedia business to merge it with TV company Discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jXBIwa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; is still scheduled to have its world premiere at the Venice International Film Festival in September.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Start your weekend off right with eBay’s early Independence Day deals</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Bose 700 offer some of the best noise cancellation you can get, especially for shy of $250. | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RWUXw6"&gt;Prime Day is officially behind us — well, sort of. The annual two-day shopping blitz saw an abundance of terrific discounts, from noise-canceling headphones to brilliant OLED TVs, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/6/23/22546806/prime-day-leftover-deals-apple-headphones-video-games-sale"&gt;some of which have stuck around&lt;/a&gt; for the remainder of the week. Retailers are already moving on, however, and we’re already seeing an influx of deals ahead of Independence Day, including a sizable discount on one of our favorite pairs of noise-canceling headphones, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review"&gt;Bose 700&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NQDyer"&gt;But eBay isn’t the only one offering discounts this weekend. Right now, you can also save on Apple’s luxe Magic Keyboard for the iPad Pro, the perfect summer speaker, and the white whale that is Microsoft’s Xbox Series S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6fqE1h"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fe%2F_electronics%2Ffourth-of-july-certified-refurbished-coupon%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkevt%3D1%26mkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26campid%3D5336757017%26toolid%3D10001%26customid%3D66960X1514734Xee175627ef5fb0ed8783debb55597fa3&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F6%2F26%2F22550441%2Frefurbished-headphones-bose-700-apple-magic-keyboard-bluetooth-speaker-xbox-series-s-deal-ebay-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Save 15 percent on refurbished headphones and more at eBay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgAvcX"&gt;While we don’t always recommend picking up pre-owned gear, it’s hard to ignore a 15 percent discount on products that are already discounted and certified refurbished. In preparation for the 4th of July, eBay is offering exactly that, slashing prices (up to $150) on some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt;, along with chargers, smart thermostats, and a range of other popular items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jcuekx"&gt;To take advantage of the limited-time offer, just use coupon code &lt;strong&gt;JULY4SAVINGS&lt;/strong&gt; on any of the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fe%2F_electronics%2Ffourth-of-july-certified-refurbished-coupon%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkevt%3D1%26mkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26campid%3D5336757017%26toolid%3D10001%26customid%3D66960X1514734Xee175627ef5fb0ed8783debb55597fa3&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F6%2F26%2F22550441%2Frefurbished-headphones-bose-700-apple-magic-keyboard-bluetooth-speaker-xbox-series-s-deal-ebay-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eligible items listed here&lt;/a&gt;.

Normally on sale for upwards of $300, Best Buy is currently offering the  &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1744442736410767329#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Magic Keyboard for $199&lt;/a&gt;, more than 40 percent off the initial list price. Keep in mind that this model is only compatible with the third- and fourth-gen, 12-9-inch iPad Pro. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21227345/magic-keyboard-ipad-pro-tablet-laptop-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="rqIAGT"&gt;Summer’s arrival marks many things, including the opportunity to get outside. And if you’re looking to hit the pool or your backyard for an outdoor hang, a little Bluetooth speaker can go a long way in kicking out the jams. Like most speakers in the Ultimate Ears lineup, the Wonderboom 2 offers clear, dependable sound, but does so within a pint-sized waterproof package that also floats and can take a bit of a beating. Temporarily on clearance, the Wonderboom 2 is &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/___vg__p_22314050__t_w__r_theverge.com__d_D/https://www.att.com/buy/accessories/speakers/ultimate-ears-wonderboom-2-speaker-black.html?source=ECAuAT10600aff12A&amp;amp;wtExtndSource=5513721&amp;amp;CI=CJ_AFFILIATE&amp;amp;RI=CJ1&amp;amp;RD=37922269&amp;amp;tfn=aff&amp;amp;cjevent=6a0b300fd57611eb802016ad0a1c0e12" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at AT&amp;amp;T for $65&lt;/a&gt;, the best price we’ve seen on the portable speaker this year. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/6/4/18647361/ultimate-ears-wonderboom-2-bluetooth-speaker-update-waterproof-stereo-battery-99" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="qSjvHO"&gt;Like the Series X, Microsoft’s Xbox Series S hasn’t exactly been easy to find, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260564/microsoft-xbox-series-x-stock-june-supply-constraints" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;shortages likely to continue&lt;/a&gt; into the second half of the year. However, if you’re a Costco member — or don’t mind &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/join-costco.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;paying the $60 enrollment fee&lt;/a&gt; to become one — now is your chance to make the jump to next-gen. The Series S is currently &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/xbox-series-s-all-digital-console.product.100784872.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Costco for $290&lt;/a&gt;, and while it lacks a disc drive and only offers 4 teraflops of performance compared to the Xbox Series X’s 12, it still exhibits quick load times and more processing power than its last-gen predecessors, Plus, it can tackle all of the same games, including most Xbox One titles. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549021/xbox-series-s-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Telegram adds group video calling at last</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9Y6DRZ95wiWqIFOnBffjJ7olZsY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69507830/acastro_180417_1777_telegram_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jhZcmr"&gt;Messaging chat app &lt;a href="https://telegram.org/blog/group-video-calls"&gt;Telegram has added&lt;/a&gt; group video chat to its mobile and desktop apps at last, something it promised was coming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/24/21234254/telegram-messaging-app-group-video-calling-security-usability"&gt;back in April 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Voice chats in any group on the platform can be turned into video calls by tapping the camera icon to turn on your device’s video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OmrKBr"&gt;Telegram says an unlimited number of users can participate in an audio call, but group video calls will be limited to the first 30 people who join a voice chat. The company plans to increase that limit “soon,” it said in its announcement. Users can also share their screens during a video call. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fxzp3CS0er15Ow9eJ4VGZQoJjOE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22683167/telegram_gif_video_calls.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://telegram.org/blog/group-video-calls" target="_blank"&gt;Telegram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Fc4J8B"&gt;Telegram CEO &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/telegram/status/1349014065931284480?s=20"&gt;Pavel Durov said in January&lt;/a&gt; that the company had reached 500 million active users, many of whom came to the platform after the Facebook-owned rival chat platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233257/whatsapp-privacy-policy-update-delayed-three-months"&gt;WhatsApp bungled the introduction&lt;/a&gt; of a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/28/22458805/whatsapp-privacy-policy-no-plans-limit-functionality"&gt;privacy policy&lt;/a&gt;. Still, Telegram’s introduction of group video calls lags the competition; WhatsApp, which had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21134652/whatsapp-2-billion-monthly-active-users-encryption-facebook"&gt;2 billion users&lt;/a&gt; as of February,  &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/30/17632650/whatsapp-group-video-calling-feature-now-live"&gt;added group video and voice calling&lt;/a&gt; in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EqVe3u"&gt;Along with the long-awaited group video calls, Telegram added several other new features, including improved noise suppression, and animated backgrounds. Users on Telegram’s iOS or Android apps can choose from several default options or &lt;a href="https://telegram.org/blog/animated-backgrounds"&gt;create their own&lt;/a&gt; animated backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7GHcd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
