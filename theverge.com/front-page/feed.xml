    <title>June heatwave was the ‘most extreme’ on record for North America</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2HksXk"&gt;The devastating heatwave that struck the Northwest US and southwest Canada in June was “the most extreme summer heatwave” ever recorded in North America, according to a new &lt;a href="http://berkeleyearth.org/june-2021-temperature-update/"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; from nonprofit research group Berkeley Earth. That’s based on the magnitude of the heatwave, or how much warmer it was than normal. Record temperatures in the region reached roughly 20 degrees Celsius (or 36 °F) hotter than average in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t6Km4B"&gt;Canada recorded its &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/06/30/canada-record-heat-experts-react/"&gt;hottest temperature ever&lt;/a&gt; on June 29th when the village of Lytton in British Columbia reached an astonishing 49.6 degrees Celsius (121 degrees Fahrenheit). Typical temperatures there in June are closer to 20 to 30 degrees Celsius (68 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="OcqjHk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The consequences of that heat are staggering&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vuyuqh"&gt;The consequences of that heat are staggering. Scorching temperatures fed wildfires, which burned down &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/08/americas/canada-lytton-wildfire-climate-change-indigenous-intl-cmd/index.html"&gt;90 percent of Lytton&lt;/a&gt;. There were at least &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-heat-dome-sudden-deaths-570-1.6122316"&gt;570 heat-related deaths in Canada&lt;/a&gt; and at least &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jul/08/pacific-northwest-heatwave-deaths#:~:text=Record%2Dbreaking%20US%20Pacific%20north%2Dwest%20heatwave%20killed%20almost%20200%20people,-Officials%20reported%20116&amp;amp;text=The%20death%20toll%20from%20the,and%2078%20in%20Washington%20state."&gt;194 in the US&lt;/a&gt;. Thousands more people wound up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580120/emergency-department-visits-spiked-june-heat-wave-us-northwest"&gt;in emergency departments&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mz8ei1"&gt;The late June heatwave was a “1,000-year event…hopefully,” according to a preliminary &lt;a href="https://climate.gov/news-features/event-tracker/preliminary-analysis-concludes-pacific-northwest-heat-wave-was-1000-year"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The severity of the heat would have been “virtually impossible” without human-caused climate change, both NOAA and a separate &lt;a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/western-north-american-extreme-heat-virtually-impossible-without-human-caused-climate-change/"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; from an international team of researchers found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="id__gejqvpocyna"&gt;For the entire Northern Hemisphere, it was the warmest June on record averaged across all land areas. Nearly 4 percent of the surface of the Earth hit record high average temperatures during the first half of 2021, according to the Berkeley Earth analysis. That’s despite the cooling effect of a La Niña event. Looking at the first six months of the year, “Nowhere has been record cold,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RARohde/status/1421131167210819599"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; Berkeley Earth lead scientist Robert Rohde.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7c6MKA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The odds of more “record-shattering” heatwaves&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yuja40"&gt;Globally, the odds of more “record-shattering” heatwaves like the one that took such a huge toll in the US and Canada in June are likely on the rise. Prolonged, record-breaking extreme heat events are two to seven times more likely to take place from now until 2050 compared to the previous three decades, according to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594471/heatwaves-prediction-more-study-climate-change"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; published earlier this week. That estimate is based on a scenario in which greenhouse gas emissions stay high, like they are today. There’s still some hope of avoiding that future — but first, humanity &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522736/carbon-dioxide-co2-record-climate-change"&gt;will have to stop burning&lt;/a&gt; quite so many&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;fossil fuels. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>‘May be an image’: what it’s like browsing Instagram while blind</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Animation of a blank Instagram post on the left emitting an audio waveform that breaks apart before reaching an ear on the right." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/znhhRhwoXG3kuYzwCPkZfgBYjcU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69657662/VRG_ILLO_4686_Social_Media_A11y_002.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The ridiculous sounds of social sites&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="WWfjrj"&gt;Using a screen reader to navigate Instagram, as some people with low vision do, is a strange patchwork of sounds. It can be overwhelming, especially if you’re used to quickly scanning information with your eyes, to hear a synthetic voice clunkily rattle off usernames, timestamps, and like counts as though they’re all equally important as the actual content of the post. Among all that auditory stimulation, if someone added alt text to their photo, you might hear something like “John and I standing with our ankles in the water at the beach. John is making a distressed face while I menacingly hold out a dead crab and laugh.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iTXr2N"&gt;The image descriptions used by screen readers have to be added by users, and like many accessibility features in social media, those fields are regularly neglected. In those cases, the voice will sometimes recite alt text that Instagram or the user’s device generates automatically. The result, Danielle McCann, the social media coordinator for the National Federation of the Blind, tells me, can be pretty funny. The descriptions that have evolved from &lt;a href="https://tech.fb.com/how-facebook-is-using-ai-to-improve-photo-descriptions-for-people-who-are-blind-or-visually-impaired/"&gt;years of machine learning&lt;/a&gt; still often misidentify what’s happening in photos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VDNI3j"&gt;Recently, she was scrolling through Instagram when her screen reader said there was a photo of “two brown cats lying on a textured surface.” Her husband informed her that it was actually a bridal shop ad featuring a woman in a wedding dress. “Thank goodness I wasn’t [commenting] like, ‘Oh those cats are cute,’ you know?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wUS7yR"&gt;These kinds of algorithmic misinterpretations are pretty common. Here’s a sampling of descriptions I heard while I browsed Instagram with VoiceOver on my phone: “red polo, apple, unicorn” (a photo of a T-shirt with a drawing of a couch on it), “may be an image of indoor” (a photo of a cat next to a house plant), “may be an image of food” (a photo of sea shells), “may be a cartoon” (almost every illustration or comic panel), and a whole lot of “may be an image of one person” (a variety of photos featuring one or more people).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yyubbx"&gt;As devices have gained accessibility settings like magnification, high contrast, and built-in screen readers, social media has also slowly become more accessible for people who are blind or have low vision: many sites and apps respond to users’ device settings, have options to toggle light and dark modes, and enable users to compose image descriptions. But the existence of those features doesn’t guarantee people with disabilities won’t be excluded online. Social media accessibility is a group effort. People have to know about the features, understand what they are, and actually remember to use them. A platform can have a hundred accessibility options, but without buy-in from every user, people are still left out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iXy3xP"&gt;Even when people use alt text, they often don’t fully think through what’s important to convey to someone who can’t see photos. Some people will write overly simplistic descriptions like “red flower” or “blonde girl looking at sky,” without actually describing what it is about the images that makes them worth sharing. At the other end, multiple paragraphs of text to describe one image can be annoying to navigate with a screen reader. McCann tells friends to think of alt text as a writing exercise: “How do you provide as much information in as few words as possible?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K67Hzr"&gt;“The general rule is to be informative, not poetic,” says the American Foundation for the Blind (AFB). “But on social media, feel free to add some personality — you’re probably sharing that picture of your dog because he has a hilarious quizzical expression, for example, not because he is a black-and-white pitbull mix.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fcv144"&gt;While automated image descriptions might eventually improve beyond the level of mistaking a woman in a wedding dress for some cats, they can’t replace the human element. Facebook had an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/3/20681231/facebook-outage-image-tags-captions-ai-machine-learning-revealed"&gt;image outage&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 that showed all of its users the photo tags that are usually hidden, displaying machine-assigned descriptors like “Image may contain: people standing.” Are the people contained in that image embracing and making goofy faces? Are they standing in front of a breathtaking vista? Social media can feel a lot less social if your access to the content shared within it relies on computers’ conservative interpretations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VKvMyR"&gt;Advocates stress that accessibility should always be a consideration from the start, “not as an add-on to an already-existing platform well after the fact,” says AFB. But most popular platforms, including Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok, didn’t take that route during initial development, and are instead constantly playing catch-up to improve their accessibility. When those improvements roll out, it’s never guaranteed that people will consistently use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="kwIby5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Just because they’re visual doesn’t mean that they’re immediately not attractive to people who are blind or low vision”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nuEW73"&gt;One of the biggest barriers is the assumption that blind people just won’t be interested in visual media. “Just because they’re visual doesn’t mean that they’re immediately not attractive to people who are blind or low vision,” says McCann. “I think that’s one big misconception: ‘Oh, well, they don’t care about pictures.’ But we do.” When culture is molded on social networks, it sucks to lose out on a shared social language because you can’t see the images everyone is talking about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HzvxYs"&gt;Christy Smith Berman, a low vision editor at Can I Play That, responded to a TT Games tweet that announced the delay of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars Lego&lt;/em&gt; with text on an image. When she replied with a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thepuppiesNpink/status/1377987541870243843"&gt;request for alt text&lt;/a&gt;, Smith Berman was met with responses from people expressing disbelief that blind people would even be on Twitter to begin with, let alone care about video games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MPr53L"&gt;Those false assumptions often mean that people are left out of fun cultural moments on social media. Memes usually involve rapidly evolving iterations of undescribed images with tiny words in weird fonts. Viral videos are reposted and shared without any kind of description, through audio or text, of what’s happening on-screen. “Oh, that must be somebody dancing,” thinks McCann when she encounters a TikTok with no audio besides music. “Well, no, it’s actually somebody making a cheesesteak. But I didn’t know that because there’s no audio indication.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h1J2rQ"&gt;“A lot of the memes that people share, they don’t add alt text to it,” says Steven Aquino, a legally blind journalist. Aquino doesn’t use a screen reader, instead relying on magnification, but he’s still sometimes left wondering what’s going on in memes. “It’s really hard because I can’t see so well, and I just feel like, ‘Okay, it’s supposed to be funny, but I can’t tell.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGwgYM"&gt;Beyond a simple neglect of accessibility features, conveying visual humor through text isn’t something everyone has a knack for. The funniest images rely on comedic timing through careful visual composition, prior knowledge of a specific meme, or familiarity with several different cultural references. Writing an image description for an esoteric meme can feel like explaining internet culture to your grandparents: you suddenly don’t know how to describe what exactly made you laugh. The complicated nature of meme literacy isn’t something we can blame on platforms — it’s just not something the average person is used to putting into words. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7KqKMu"&gt;But there are other less complicated factors that can impact the online experiences of people who are blind or have low vision. Aquino points out that people will use special unicode characters in their Twitter display names that are harder to read and aren’t interpreted as letters by screen reading software. A screen reader isn’t technically incorrect if it reads a character as “mathematical bold capital,” but most sighted people will read it simply as a letter with different formatting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="qslmkH"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;You       it's    ℯ to       your tweets and usernames         . But have you          to what it             with assistive technologies like          ? &lt;a href="https://t.co/CywCf1b3Lm"&gt;pic.twitter.com/CywCf1b3Lm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kent C. Dodds (@kentcdodds) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/1083073242330361856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 9, 2019&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WinCPc"&gt;“For people that do use screen readers, this software is only so smart,” says Aquino. “So if you’ve got a clever name, your voiceover or whatever it is that you use is going to fail.” Tweets that include rows of emojis, or a lot of special characters to create an image or convey cursive script, can be &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/ieAkh6rMARc"&gt;hellish to listen to&lt;/a&gt; when they’re read by a screen reader. Posting a screenshot of the tweet with alt text is a workable alternative, but people rarely know to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QRaKBL"&gt;McCann is glad that many sites have improved their accessibility options over the years, but she wishes they were more widely used and wonders why they aren’t better promoted. TikTok has &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/accessibility/en-us/"&gt;text to speech&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21612380/tiktok-photosensitive-epilepsy-warning-update-coming"&gt;warns people&lt;/a&gt; when flashing effects in their videos might trigger seizures, so why can’t all social sites have better prompts for encouraging users to add captions, visual descriptions, and alt text? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8MLce"&gt;“The onus is on the disability community to educate,” she says. “Why isn’t there more education from these mainstream companies?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="hU0uVJ"&gt;McCann wishes it were easier for her to join the party when things like TikTok videos go viral. “Unless I have someone sit with me and explain to me what’s going on, I definitely feel like I can’t have a conversation about it with someone,” she says. “It is exclusionary to a point, because I like jokes. I like pasta recipes. I want to know that stuff! I’m still a part of the social fabric.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RIgILf"&gt;
&lt;script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;$(".c-entry-hero__image").html('&lt;style&gt;.vrg-video-lede {max-width: 800px;margin: 0 auto;} .vrg-label {height: 1px;width: 1px;overflow: hidden;position: absolute;} .vrg-inner-container {height: 100%; position: relative;padding-bottom: 100%;overflow: hidden;}@media screen and (max-width:768px){.vrg-inner-container {height: 100%;}} .vrg-media {position: absolute;top: 0;left: 0;width: 100%;height: 100%;} .vrg-media img {height: 100%;width: 100%;max-width: 100%;position: absolute;top: 0;left: 0;object-fit: cover;} .vrg-media video {height: 100%;width: 100%;position: absolute;top: 0;left: 0;object-fit: cover;display: inline-block;}&lt;/style&gt;&lt;figure class="vrg-video-lede" aria-label="media" role="group"&gt;&lt;span class="vrg-label"&gt;Video&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="vrg-inner-container"&gt;&lt;div class="vrg-media"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22749302/VRG_ILLO_4686_Social_Media_A11y_001.jpg" alt="Animation of a blank Instagram post on the left emitting an audio waveform that breaks apart before reaching an ear on the right."&gt;&lt;video src="https://volume-assets.voxmedia.com/production/a848f8f12adea7db7f62510d854c986b/VRG_ILLO_4686_Social_Media_A11y_001.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;');&lt;/script&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk calls Apple’s App Store fees a ‘de facto global tax on the Internet’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Saturday Night Live - Season 46" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K8qmgti1mlml3NmF5TTdl1BeUAU=/0x1:3000x2001/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69657521/1232778207.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo By: Will Heath/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WC23UO"&gt;Elon Musk has had a busy Friday on Twitter. After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602017/elon-musk-tim-cook-apple-ceo-demand-tesla-acquisition"&gt;flatly denying that he has ever spoken to Apple CEO Tim Cook&lt;/a&gt; in response to a wild story alleging he demanded to take over as the company’s CEO as part of an acquisition offer, Musk has now tweeted his support of Epic Games’ fight against Apple over App Store policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ypPcEN"&gt;“Apple app store fees are a de facto global tax on the Internet,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1421152540394143746"&gt;he said&lt;/a&gt;. “Epic is right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tgM4kg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Apple app store fees are a de facto global tax on the Internet. Epic is right.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1421152540394143746?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mmbDWB"&gt;Epic is currently embroiled in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;a legal battle with Apple&lt;/a&gt;, arguing that its App Store rules, which allow Apple to take a 30 percent commission on many transactions on the App Store, are unfair and anti-competitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RiXz6b"&gt;Perhaps aiming to take advantage of the massive spotlight Musk is bringing to the fight by tweeting about it to his 58.7 million followers, CEO Tim Sweeney, who has been a vocal opponent of Apple on Twitter, posted his latest salvo against the iPhone maker just 25 minutes after Musk’s tweet. “In the future all physical goods will have a digital presence, and Apple will tax and gatekeep world commerce,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1421156142047170567"&gt;Sweeney said&lt;/a&gt;. “Apple must be stopped.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nhEBpM"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The Apple Tax is far more pernicious than many realize. “It only applies to digital goods accessible on iOS”, they say — but in the future all physical goods will have a digital presence, and Apple will tax and gatekeep world commerce. Apple must be stopped.&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1421156142047170567?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xS2O2V"&gt;Apple has not replied to a request for comment. Epic pointed &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; to Sweeney’s tweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gTt2vb"&gt;Epic faced off with Apple in court for much of the month of May, and while we’re still awaiting a verdict on the lawsuit, the trial itself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22454959/epic-apple-trial-recap-video-tim-cook-xbox-playstation-business"&gt;revealed all sorts of interesting information&lt;/a&gt;. Epic has also filed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22583467/epic-fortnite-google-play-store-lawsuit-amended-complaint-filed"&gt;an antitrust suit against Google&lt;/a&gt; over Play Store policies, though that case is moving more slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jnkh7y"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 30th, 3:28PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added that Epic pointed us to Sweeney’s tweet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk and Apple deny wild story that he tried to replace Tim Cook </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tesla CEO Elon Musk Testifies In SolarCity Trial" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PB8X5BB1v1lSmOKT3NMpA6tkUZE=/0x0:5167x3445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69657090/1233956452.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h6GRyd"&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk reportedly demanded to become Apple’s CEO in a 2016 phone call with current Apple CEO Tim Cook, according to an upcoming book about Tesla. The story, shared by &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2021-07-30/power-play-tesla-book-review"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, comes from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Power-Play-Tesla-Elon-Century-ebook/dp/B08MQ4KWWR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Power Play: Tesla, Elon Musk, and the Bet of the Century&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reporter Tim Higgins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J05FIO"&gt;As the book tells it, Cook suggested to Musk that Apple acquire Tesla, and Musk said he wanted to be CEO. Cook reportedly agreed, but Musk clarified that he wanted to be the CEO of Apple. “According to a former aide who heard (Musk’s) retelling of the exchange,” Cook said “Fuck you” before hanging up the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F3B4B3"&gt;But Musk and Apple have both suggested that the conversation couldn’t have happened because Musk and Cook have never spoken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iMiQC5"&gt;Musk, in a tweet on Friday, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1421150913075503112"&gt;flat out said that&lt;/a&gt; “Cook &amp;amp; I have never spoken or written to each other ever.” He also said that he attempted to meet with Cook about Apple acquiring Tesla, a meeting that Cook refused. (Musk previously discussed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195959/elon-musk-tesla-tim-cook-apple-sale-meeting-acquisition-refused"&gt;this attempted meeting in December&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gpC1X4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Cook &amp;amp; I have never spoken or written to each other ever. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was a point where I requested to meet with Cook to talk about Apple buying Tesla. There were no conditions of acquisition proposed whatsoever. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He refused to meet. Tesla was worth about 6% of today’s value.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1421150913075503112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="saX9fM"&gt;When asked for comment about the reported conversation, Apple pointed to remarks Cook made during an interview with &lt;em&gt;The New York Times’&lt;/em&gt; Kara Swisher where he denied having ever spoken to Elon. “You know, I’ve never spoken to Elon, although I have great admiration and respect for the company he’s built,” &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/opinion/apples-ceo-is-making-very-different-choices-from-mark-zuckerberg.html?showTranscript=1"&gt;Cook said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TXM0qp"&gt;Musk also claims that much of the book is false. “Higgins managed to make his book both false *and* boring,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1421145405530771458"&gt;Musk said in a tweet on Friday&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QTfPhv"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Higgins managed to make his book both false *and* boring   &lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1421145405530771458?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gG8JnF"&gt;And Musk apparently tried to dash cold water on the book while it was being written, telling Higgins that much of the book was “nonsense,” according to the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="InHm3k"&gt;Musk apparently did not participate in the creation of “Power Play.” In an author’s note at the end, Higgins writes that Musk “was given numerous opportunities to comment on the stories, facts, and characterizations presented in these pages. Without pointing to any specific inaccuracies, he offered simply this: ‘Most, but not all, of what you read in this book is nonsense.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Hpddym"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timkhiggins/status/1421156081041088512"&gt;Higgins says&lt;/a&gt; that Musk had “plenty of opportunities” to comment and that the story of the conversation with Cook “comes from Musk’s own account of the conversation, according to people who heard the retelling at the time.” In an earlier tweet, he also characterized the story of Musk and Cook’s conversation &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timkhiggins/status/1421138332814303233?s=21"&gt;as one that was&lt;/a&gt; “told inside Tesla as the company struggled with the Model X.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fbkLaC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Musk was given plenty of opportunities to comment on this. He didn’t. This anecdote comes from Musk’s own account of the conversation, according to people who heard the retelling at the time. &lt;a href="https://t.co/GRKZRBsaeR"&gt;https://t.co/GRKZRBsaeR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Higgins (@timkhiggins) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timkhiggins/status/1421156081041088512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="T4Bjev"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;As detailed in POWER PLAY, this is a story that was told inside Tesla as the company struggled with the Model X, according to people who heard it, and as some hoped for a white knight to save the day. Musk’s message was clear: Tesla’s fate was in their own hands. &lt;a href="https://t.co/4e0KJb3CD2"&gt;https://t.co/4e0KJb3CD2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Higgins (@timkhiggins) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timkhiggins/status/1421138332814303233?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="choHTi"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timkhiggins/status/1421138447595675651?s=21"&gt;He also says that Apple&lt;/a&gt; “was given several opportunities to comment prior publication and declined.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VBMLtg"&gt;Higgins has not replied to a request for comment. A representative for the book’s publisher pointed to Higgins’ Twitter feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9HdbE"&gt;Shortly after tweeting that he has never met Cook, Musk tweeted in support of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22454959/epic-apple-trial-recap-video-tim-cook-xbox-playstation-business"&gt;Epic’s fight against Apple and its rules on the App Store&lt;/a&gt;. “Apple app store fees are a de facto global tax on the Internet,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1421152540394143746"&gt;Musk said&lt;/a&gt;. “Epic is right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6C7Y6P"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 30th, 3:47PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added response from the book’s publisher.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is facing a subpoena for millions of documents in Google’s antitrust case</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q2Mk6w1XOp2h85tl1TBikvV0bgc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69656859/acastro_210121_1777_google_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7bYHJu"&gt;The sweeping federal antitrust case against Google has given rise to a significant fight over data held by Microsoft, and the company is now facing a subpoena for millions of documents that could shed light on its attempts to compete with Google’s search engine. Having initially cooperated with prosecutors in building an antitrust case against Google, Microsoft could be obligated to produce millions more documents at the request of Google’s defense team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FwFB3H"&gt;At a status hearing on Friday morning, Judge Amit Mehta heard arguments from both Google and Microsoft on the issue, but ultimately found more information was required before the court could give guidance as to how much internal data Microsoft would be required to produce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OtQ38e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“No third party is more central to this litigation than Microsoft”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M62YXy"&gt;“These are hard issues for any judge to resolve in a way that’s objective and meaningful,” Mehta told attorneys, “and that’s particularly so given that, with respect to the additional custodians, I don’t have any sense of the volume that would produce … or what that volume would mean for the timing of production.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bZTnd6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-monopolist-google-violating-antitrust-laws"&gt;Filed in October 2020&lt;/a&gt;, the Department of Justice’s antitrust case against Google focuses on anti-competitive behavior in search and search advertising, alleging among other claims that the company’s exclusivity agreements on Android and iOS shut out competing search engines. Separate antitrust cases against Google have also been filed focusing on the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333848/google-antitrust-lawsuit-texas-complaint-chrome-privacy"&gt;browser privacy settings&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22186994/google-search-antitrust-lawsuit-colorado-nebraska-state-ags"&gt;alleged manipulation of search results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2J1V9J"&gt;In advance of the Department of Justice filing charges, Microsoft provided more than 400,000 documents to civil investigative demands from prosecutors. In a filing before today’s hearing, Google &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21020163-google-microsoft-subpoena-compliance"&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; that participation entitles the company to a similar range of documents that might be helpful to its defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zdCpz4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“These executives cover issues at the core of the case,” says Google&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x3Ii7K"&gt;“No third party is more central to this litigation than Microsoft. The DOJ and Colorado Complaints refer to it or its products dozens of times,” Google’s filing reads. “Having so obviously pressed for and cooperated in the preparation of the present Complaints to be filed against Google, Microsoft cannot credibly avoid significant discovery in these cases.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ki2vR7"&gt;Google first issued a subpoena to Microsoft in April, seeking “older documents that will shed light on whether Microsoft was actually restrained from competing with Google, or whether it simply failed to compete successfully on the merits.” But Microsoft agreed to only eight of the 27 executives to be searched, and drastically limited the search strings to which they would be subject. Google is now asking for a more powerful court order to compel the production of documents from Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nQP43v"&gt;In an appendix to its filing, Google listed 19 current and former Microsoft executives who may hold communications relevant to the case, including former Windows Phone chief Andrew Lees and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/12/4515830/terry-myerson-microsoft-windows-reorganization"&gt;former Windows head Terry Myerson&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kmcIXV"&gt;“These executives cover issues at the core of the case: the development and distribution of Microsoft’s various search engines, Microsoft’s search advertising business, and Microsoft’s effort to market devices that would give it yet more search access points beyond the ever-present Windows desktop,” the filing reads. “Google simply seeks discovery commensurate with Plaintiffs’ allegations, which reach back two decades.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Drctt9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/18552824/169/united-states-of-america-v-google-llc/"&gt;In its own filing&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft pushed back against this logic, arguing Google is filing unnecessarily broad requests in an effort to additionally delay the case. “In the past nine days, in fact, Google has proposed seventeen&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;additional custodians,” Microsoft’s filing claims, “including nine on July 19, five on July 26, and three today, July 27. Google has not explained why it believes searching these additional twenty-eight custodians ... is necessary.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KVYq9s"&gt;Weighing the two arguments, the court seemed to slightly favor Google’s side of the case, but ultimately asked for more data on the burden required to produce the documents. “The description of the people [Google has] identified as additional custodians certainly struck me as not reaching,” Judge Mehta said, “and I haven’t heard Microsoft say today that there’s minimal chance that they’re likely to have records at all that are responsive and relevant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JT7QOM"&gt;However, the court ultimately found there was insufficient information about the burden posed by production, and the dispute is likely to continue at least until August 20th, the deadline set for further filings on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1kh5UE"&gt;“The best I can do for you today is to give you a deadline by which to get back to me with concrete information,” Judge Mehta told the parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iRUtgj"&gt;The finding is one more turn in what is likely to be a long and contentious discovery period for the antitrust case. Microsoft says it believes the first phase of its own document production will last until at least October of this year. Trial proceedings for &lt;em&gt;US v. Google&lt;/em&gt; are scheduled to begin on September 12th, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hCBFsH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Government denies Blue Origin’s challenge to NASA’s lunar lander program</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Blue Origin Founder Jeff Bezos Makes Announcement At Satellite 2019 Conference In DC" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JkETxgEPwxS6SXCGoljeDWEei6w=/0x25:1270x872/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69656764/1148070239.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bbrulx"&gt;The Government Accountability Office squashed Blue Origin’s protest over NASA’s decision to pick a single lunar lander contractor, the agency said Friday, also denying a similar protest from Dynetics. The GAO’s decision keeps Blue Origin’s rival, Elon Musk’s SpaceX, the sole winner of NASA’s lucrative Moon lander program and hands a loss to Jeff Bezos, whose space company waged a months-long fight to win the same funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BIsuxy"&gt;In formal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404528/nasa-bezo-blue-origin-protest-spacex-contract"&gt;protests&lt;/a&gt; filed in April, Bezos’ Blue Origin and defense contractor Dynetics accused NASA of running afoul of contracting law when the agency shelved their proposals and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387887/elon-musk-spacex-win-nasa-lunar-lander-contract-artemis"&gt;gave Musk’s SpaceX&lt;/a&gt; a lone $2.9 billion contract to build the country’s first human lunar lander in decades and land a crew on the Moon by 2024. NASA had said it could award up to two companies for the contract, but never committed to that number, and went with SpaceX’s Starship proposal. The GAO found that NASA “reserved the right to make multiple awards, a single award, or no award at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ni91Fo"&gt;Musk responded to the news by tweeting “GAO” with a flexing bicep emoji.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Vif1gO"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;GAO  &lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1421155803223011333?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9mCex1"&gt;In picking only SpaceX, NASA said it did what it could with the funding it had from Congress. Lawmakers gave NASA a quarter of the roughly $3 billion it requested for its astronaut Moon lander program. In its protest, Blue Origin said NASA should’ve called off the program or retooled it when the agency realized it wouldn’t have had enough money to fund two contractors. But the GAO rejected that argument, saying “there was no requirement for NASA to engage in discussions, amend, or cancel the announcement as a result of the amount of funding available for the program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJATLC"&gt;Blue Origin and Dynetics’ loss at the GAO lifts &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22412771/nasa-spacex-hls-moon-lander-blue-origin-protest"&gt;the three-month procedural hold&lt;/a&gt; on SpaceX’s contract, which was put in place as the GAO adjudicated Blue Origin’s protest. That’s good news for NASA’s fast-paced Artemis program, which still calls for landing a crew of astronauts on the Moon by 2024, with several crewed missions after that. NASA has said it plans to open up future lunar transportation contract programs that other companies, including those who lost to SpaceX, can compete for. But Blue Origin has said that SpaceX, as the sole winner of the first contract, would have an unfair advantage over other potential bidders for those future awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QfpJp3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The Human Landing System program needs to have competition now instead of later”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0IzTIv"&gt;“We stand firm in our belief that there were fundamental issues with NASA’s decision, but the GAO wasn’t able to address them due to their limited jurisdiction,” a Blue Origin spokesperson said in a statement. If it decides to, the company could bring its grievances to the US Court of Federal Claims, the only other legal arena for bid disputes. “We’ll continue to advocate for two immediate providers as we believe it is the right solution... The Human Landing System program needs to have competition now instead of later – that’s the best solution for NASA and the best solution for our country,” the spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos gives an update on their progress and share their vision of going to space to benefit Earth." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VOwEFJd95gadHpUXrBag7fmE9Rc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22751419/1142506904.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hb3DDo"&gt;Blue Origin’s proposal for the NASA program was for its $6 billion Blue Moon lunar lander, which the company is building with a “National Team” of subcontractors that includes Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin. On Monday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594038/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-nasa-lunar-lander-2-billion"&gt;Bezos personally offered&lt;/a&gt; to discount the cost of the Blue Moon lander by up to $2 billion. He said in an open letter to NASA administrator Bill Nelson that such an offer would “bridge the HLS budgetary funding shortfall” and “get the program back on track right now.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R6QVg6"&gt;That offer still stands, a Blue Origin spokesperson said, adding: “We’re talking with NASA about next steps and appropriate actions.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The special effects behind Loki’s doomed planet of Lamentis</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3MrvmiO2Djk8NzyAFyADQTu1eaA=/714x0:3126x1608/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69656723/LMT2640_103_comp_v031_20210609_r709.1068_R_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;How the team at Digital Domain destroyed a world&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="p3n7Ok"&gt;When special effects studio Digital Domain was approached by Marvel to work on an episode of &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/564546/9358?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fseries%2Floki%2F6pARMvILBGzF&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeLokiSpecialEffects073021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; there was one sequence in particular that was exciting: the chance to destroy an entire planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H6onOR"&gt;The third episode of the series is set on the moon of a planet called Lamentis, which is about to collapse on itself, taking the moon with it. As Loki and Sylvie wander the desolate, purple landscape, meteors pound the ground around them. This all leads up to a crescendo when they reach a small town, which is battered by debris as the planet rips apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oAmVl1"&gt;Even before he had any idea about the rest of the show, or how the story would play out, VFX supervisor Jean-Luc Dinsdale knew that this would be an important moment for &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;. “It was pretty clear from the start that this was a huge sequence and a big milestone for the series,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Technically, it’s a really challenging sequence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MHD7Lg"&gt;Prior to that point, most of &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; was set inside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22574400/loki-retro-hardware-tempad-kasra-farahani-interview-marvel-disney-plus"&gt;the retrofuturistic hallways of the Time Variance Authority&lt;/a&gt;, which made the shift to Lamentis all the more jarring. When Loki and Sylvie first step outside on the moon, viewers are greeted to a grim, dirty landscape that looks like nothing else on the show — though that wasn’t always the plan. According to Dinsdale, the teams at Marvel Studios and Digital Domain played around with a few ideas for the planet and its moon, including a lush world covered in greenery, and another dominated by massive oceans. At one point they considered having a planet with a molten core that would create quite the spectacle when it finally imploded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5khVfu"&gt;“We explored that for a bit, but after a while the decision was made to make it more of a dead planet, a planet that had been mined to a crazy extent and basically had died through all of the exploitation,” Dinsdale explains. “So we ended up literally with this dead husk of a planet, that, as you can see in the final footage, has mining holes all over it and has really been ravaged to the point that there’s nothing left to it. Which I think explains why it imploded; the core of the planet got mined, and there’s no structural integrity so it falls apart.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gINiwQ94OhJmuzyMrCQ06eOGvyI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22750966/ARC_103_10587_R_copy.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vBavPAql711-YAAOcP_O77xJdqY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22750961/ARC_103_09262_R2_copy.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iPn8R0"&gt;That decision ties into the way Dinsdale likes to approach VFX, which is to base them in reality. Sure, none of us have ever seen a planet explode and take a populated moon with it, but the idea is that, with a grounding in real physics, this outlandish visual can be more believable. In addition to looking at lots of reference material, the team used software called Houdini to simulate how the explosion would happen, right down to the amount of dust and debris that would appear. “In my experience, the best way to approach visual effects is to base it on reality,” says Dinsdale. “What is the reason for this planet to be exploding? We always walk this fine line of what makes sense and what looks really cool.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="yIVkyj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10677788"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NucFsJ"&gt;This also ties into some of the world-building going on in the episode. The purple-hued moon of Lamentis is not a very welcoming place, and viewers learn this largely through the visuals. The miners left on the planet wear shabby clothes, and the few buildings look weathered and beaten. The team at Digital Domain was able to expand on this not just through the landscape, which is largely barren, but also the equipment seen in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IvcdI"&gt;“The production [team] really wanted to give the sense that they had been mining for a while,” says Dinsdale. “The mining equipment on this planet is dilapidated, it’s been used for a very long time, and it’s not like it’s super high-tech. To me it was similar to James Cameron’s &lt;em&gt;Aliens&lt;/em&gt;, the design aesthetic where there’s nothing fancy about this planet, therefore it’s dirty and used and dusty.” Much of this involved the labor-intensive process of adding lots of extra detail to everything, whether it’s dents in a spaceship or layers of dirt on some mining equipment. “You don’t necessarily see all of those individual details, but just this buildup of detail creates the sense that this thing looks real.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dq7jM6"&gt;The effects studio worked on the show for about a year and a half, and eventually contributed more than 300 VFX shots. One of the challenges was that, despite lasting just 43 minutes, the episode cycles through many different and varied tones. At the beginning it’s like a chase sequence, as Loki and Sylvie run to escape the meteors raining down on the surface. Later, things are much more subdued as the pair have quiet, heartfelt conversations while the world is crumbling around them. This all culminates in that big final sequence when the town is destroyed. And all of these moments required something different in terms of special effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid c-image-grid__odd c-image-grid__odd-first-wide"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YSkBvvcdW3oUF_5HZ2oI_hFzdjU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22750973/LSU2900_103_comp_v097.1099_C_copy.jpg"&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8117T4wMzSGDvK0e20RQ7kp_tSE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22750983/LTR7020_103_comp_v073.1103_copy.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IT52Or"&gt;“We need the meteors to be scary, we need them to have a lot of velocity and huge impacts, debris flying everywhere, to create that sense of jeopardy,” Dinsdale says of that early chase sequence. “But later on in the show, as they’re walking towards the mining town, the filmmakers wanted the threat of the meteors to still be there, that’s why you’re always seeing them in the background. But a different look was created to give the sense that, yes the meteors are always there, there’s always a bit of jeopardy, but it’s not the big Michael Bay moment where they’re about to be crushed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xZlJV8"&gt;These sections also proved to be challenging from the VFX side because of how they were filmed. During the action sequences, real debris was thrown around on set in order to give the actors something to respond to. It made for more true-to-life acting, but as Dinsdale explains, “that makes work for us a lot harder, because we have to go in and remove the stuff that was dropped on set, replace the backgrounds, and then layer back in debris to bring that sense of danger back. Even though it’s more work for us on the backend, the results are much more satisfactory. You end up with a pretty amazing look.” He adds that “the amount of cleaning up that had to be done to the footage was extensive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="wMad0B"&gt;The amount of work involved was similar to that of a feature-length film, and the result is arguably the most visually striking of &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;’s six episodes. From its harsh color scheme to its desolate vibe, Lamentis really doesn’t look like anything else in the series — which is what makes it so memorable. “We basically got to create our own little world separate from the rest of the show,” says Dinsdale.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Normally $50 a pop, BuyDig is offering a trio of Google Nest Minis for nearly 60 percent off. | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mrCmsy"&gt;Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, the Google Nest Mini is a miniature take on the larger smart speakers that came before it. The compact device doesn’t boast the same sound quality as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21501300/google-nest-audio-assistant-smart-speaker-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Nest Audio&lt;/a&gt;, but it's impressive for its size, especially when mounted to a wall or placed in a smaller room. What’s more, it packs backlit volume buttons and many of the same features that have come to define the category, including the ability to answer voice queries, control your smart home, and play music, adding to its overall versatility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gvIwq9"&gt;If you’re already tapped into the Google ecosystem or are looking for an inexpensive way to strew audio throughout your home, BuyDig is currently offering a three-pack of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F334087468632%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26customid%3DVergeDeals073021%26toolid%3D10001%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F7%2F30%2F22600005%2Fgoogle-nest-mini-smart-speaker-apple-magsafe-charger-macbook-air-m1-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Nest Minis on eBay for $64&lt;/a&gt;, significantly less than if you were to pay per Mini. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20921173/google-nest-mini-echo-dot-assistant-smart-speaker-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="lJFfNl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588777/apple-magsafe-battery-review-size-iphone-12-mini"&gt;Apple’s MagSafe Battery Pack&lt;/a&gt; has officially arrived, however, if you’re looking for a cheaper means for charging your iPhone 12, 12 Pro, or an older device that supports Qi charging, there’s always Apple’s MagSafe Charger. The simple, wired accessory attaches magnetically to the latest iPhone 12 models and allows for 15-watt charging speeds when paired with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-20W-USB-C-Power-Adapter/dp/B08L5M9BTJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;20-watt power brick&lt;/a&gt; (sold separately). And while far slower than a traditional USB-C cable — it takes about an hour to charge an iPhone 12 to 40 percent — it’s also more convenient, especially given that it can charge AirPods models with a wireless charging case and older Qi-compatible accessories. Normally $40, Apple’s MagSafe Charger is currently &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13527013?sid=VergeDeals072921&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-magsafe-charger-2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Woot for $30&lt;/a&gt;, matching its best-ever price.&lt;/p&gt;

To take advantage of the deal before it expires on August 1st, you need to log in or sign up for a free My Best Buy account and enroll in the Student Deals program, a move that takes an additional $100 off the $850 sale price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5wvXJY"&gt;If you’re unfamiliar with the latest MacBook Air, it’s currently one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best laptops&lt;/a&gt; you can buy. The 2020 model boasts excellent battery life, impressive performance, and a well-built design.

    <title>Tesla agrees to pay $1.5 million to settle battery throttling lawsuit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uqgT5nkQefNjFAYNf66IKXsQoYQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69656244/sokane_181116_3101_fremont_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GieOUA"&gt;Tesla agreed to pay $1.5 million to settle a lawsuit alleging the company used a software update to reduce the maximum battery voltage for some of its Model S sedans, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-agrees-pay-15-mln-settle-claims-over-temporary-battery-voltage-reduction-2021-07-29/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BNihWo"&gt;The software update, which was released in 2019, resulted in slower charging speed and diminished range for around 1,743 vehicles, the plaintiffs alleged. As a result of the settlement, Tesla agreed to pay $625 to each of the affected vehicle owners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5YGEYM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tesla agreed to pay $625 to each of the affected vehicle owners&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bRHx1G"&gt;“This amount is many times the prorated value of the temporarily reduced maximum voltage, and thus represents an excellent and efficient result for the Settlement Class,” the court document reads. “In return, the Settlement Class will release claims related to the software updates that imposed and then restored the batteries’ maximum voltage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ze74f3"&gt;Lawyers for the owners said they conducted an investigation that found that “voltage limitation was temporary, with a 10% reduction lasting about 3 months, and a smaller 7% reduction lasting another 7 months before the corrective update was released in March 2020. Following that second update, the vehicles’ voltage showed steady restoration over time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FdNCLq"&gt;It’s not immediately clear how the plaintiffs will receive their payment from Tesla. A US district court judge will convene a hearing on the proposed settlement on December 9th. A spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment; Tesla dissolved its PR department in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J7wFs4"&gt;This isn’t the first time Tesla has been forced to pay its customers for throttling their vehicle batteries. Last May, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451101/tesla-fine-norway-throttle-battery-charging-speed"&gt;the company was ordered to pay&lt;/a&gt; 136,000 kroner ($16,000) each to thousands of customers in Norway for slowing down charging speeds. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Lawmakers cling to flawed evidence while restricting care for trans youth&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="co53IH"&gt;Conservative legislators and special interest groups are using scientific studies as a cudgel in their attempts to limit children’s access to gender affirming healthcare. One of the biggest battles is taking place in Arkansas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P0rhd0"&gt;“We can’t act like these studies don’t matter,” Arkansas state Senator Alan Clark said on March 29th, arguing in support of &lt;a href="https://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/Bills/Detail?id=HB1570&amp;amp;ddBienniumSession=2021%2F2021R"&gt;HB 1570&lt;/a&gt;, a ban on gender affirming healthcare for minors in Arkansas. Clark was referring to cherry-picked research that depicted various treatments as dangerous, experimental, and unsafe for children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VgqgvF"&gt;After a vote, Arkansas became the first state to pass such a bill into law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gl8cHD"&gt;The ACLU &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/lgbtq-rights/were-suing-arkansas-over-its-ban-on-health-care-for-trans-youth/"&gt;filed a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against Arkansas in May challenging the constitutionality of the law. A judge &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/judge-blocks-arkansas-ban-gender-affirming-care-transgender-minors-rcna1477"&gt;temporarily blocked&lt;/a&gt; the ban on July 21st, days before it was set to go into effect. “We were able to show that these laws are irrational,” said ACLU attorney Chase Strangio at a press conference, “we’re going to keep arguing that up through the court system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tIDOSh"&gt;Arkansas is &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/legislation-affecting-lgbt-rights-across-country"&gt;one of 20 states&lt;/a&gt; to attempt bans on gender affirming medical care for young people in the last year. All of the bills try to weaponize science — in the form of questionable, outdated, or misinterpreted research — against trans children and their parents while willfully ignoring both the experiences of trans people and the expert opinion of many groups of scientists, scholars, and doctors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FjMdmx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;They’re saying they’re doing science, but they’re ignoring what all the scientific associations are saying,” says Florence Ashley, a transfeminine jurist and bioethicist who studies the ways science and legal systems affect trans youth. The &lt;a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/health-care-advocacy/advocacy-update/march-26-2021-state-advocacy-update"&gt;American Medical Association&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/newsroom/news-releases/frontline-physicians-oppose-legislation-that-interferes-in-or-criminalizes-patient-care"&gt;American Psychological Association&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.aappublications.org/news/2021/03/09/transgender-legislation-030921"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Latest_News/AACAP_Statement_Responding_to_Efforts-to_ban_Evidence-Based_Care_for_Transgender_and_Gender_Diverse.aspx"&gt;American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.endocrine.org/news-and-advocacy/news-room/2019/transgender-custody-statement"&gt;Endocrine Society&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.wpath.org/media/cms/Documents/Public%20Policies/2020/FINAL%20Joint%20Statement%20Opposing%20Anti%20Trans%20Legislation%20Jan%2028%202020.pdf?_t=1580243903"&gt;World Professional Association for Transgender Health&lt;/a&gt; (WPATH), and others have consistently opposed the bills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K0PRwy"&gt;HB 1570 shares nearly identical language with proposed trans healthcare bans that are making their way through legislature in other states. That’s because they’re &lt;a href="https://19thnews.org/2021/03/anti-lgbtq-orgs-drafting-anti-trans-bills-policymakers/"&gt;copy-paste bills based on “model legislature”&lt;/a&gt; from a coalition backed by anti-LGBTQ hate groups. Here’s a breakdown of why the arguments presented in these bills don’t hold up to scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Su9wwl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HB 1570&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;“For the small percentage of children who are gender nonconforming or experience distress at identifying with their biological sex, studies consistently demonstrate that the majority come to identify with their biological sex in adolescence or adulthood, thereby rendering most physiological interventions unnecessary.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="B1at2J"&gt;The idea that many trans kids will grow out of it is referred to in research as desistance. The term comes from criminology, where it describes the process of ceasing criminal behavior. The concept of desistance is often used to remove children’s agency in discussions of their own identities, painting them as confused or going through a phase. It’s also used to advocate for “reparative” conversion therapies, which, unlike gender affirming care, are &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/transgender-conversion-therapy-associated-severe-psychological-distress-n1052416"&gt;unethical and dangerous&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0k6hTd"&gt;The most frequently cited desistance statistic is that around 80 percent of kids who experience gender dysphoria will go on to be cisgender adults. This percentage is usually attributed to four studies, published from 2008 to 2013, which looked at young children at gender identity clinics in Canada and the Netherlands. There are a number of problems with how those studies were carried out and how their findings were interpreted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b9uTOW"&gt;All of the studies included children who had not actually expressed gender dysphoria and had instead been deemed gender-nonconforming by their parents. Labeling those children as desistant drastically inflates the percentage. In three of the studies, participants who didn’t follow up with the researchers in adolescence or adulthood were assumed to be desistant, again inaccurately raising the desistance percentage. The methodological issues are further discussed in an article &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5951646/"&gt;by researchers&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href="https://juliaserano.medium.com/detransition-desistance-and-disinformation-a-guide-for-understanding-transgender-children-993b7342946e"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://juliaserano.medium.com/reframing-transgender-desistance-debates-68648a4fd01a"&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt; by trans writer and biologist Julia Serano. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H0Et2F"&gt;The desistance myth is also beside the point because it refers to children younger than those who would be eligible for the physiological interventions listed in the bills. “It’s just not relevant,” says Ashley. “This is a prepubertal population. It’s not the group that’s being offered puberty blockers. Those being offered puberty blockers are the ones that have already not desisted.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="qRvIqE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HB 1570&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;“Even among people who have undergone inpatient gender reassignment procedures, suicide rates, psychiatric morbidities, and mortality rates remain markedly elevated above the background population.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="EDK1Ih"&gt;This line is likely referencing &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016885"&gt;a 2011 study conducted in Sweden&lt;/a&gt;, which sponsors of the bill have mentioned specifically in their arguments. That study did find that adult trans participants had higher rates of mental illness, suicide attempts, and death by suicide than cisgender people of the same age. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmpwEV"&gt;What the senators failed to mention is that the researchers &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; acknowledged that gender affirming surgeries alleviate gender dysphoria, and that their findings should inspire better care for trans people after surgery. The researchers state explicitly that their results should not be interpreted to say that gender affirming surgeries increase mortality. The study is also limited in several ways; most notably, its focus was trans people who were treated in the 1970s and ‘80s, and significant improvements in treatment, from mental health care to surgical techniques, have been made since then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l27dh4"&gt;Avery Everhart, a trans medical and legal geographer who studies trans healthcare access, points out another issue with these kinds of studies — it’s difficult to directly compare the mental health of cis and trans kids because there are so many variables to take into account. “It’s not ideal to compare to cisgender, mentally healthy, well-adjusted, youth of the same age, instead you should be comparing to other youth who also experience comorbid issues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qW54OV"&gt;Trans youth aren’t more predisposed to mental illness and other problems simply by nature of being trans, Everhart says. Living in a transphobic society, where children may not have family support and lawmakers are trying to restrict their rights, is bound to have negative effects on mental health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KgNG3W"&gt;“In biomedical research, in general, there’s an assumption that it is better to pathologize the individual,” says Everhart, “as opposed to diagnosing the society that gave them suicidality, that caused them to be depressed, that may have led them to have substance abuse issues.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="wtCIDZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HB 1570&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;“The prescribing of puberty-blocking drugs is being done despite the lack of long-term longitudinal studies evaluating the risks and benefits of using these drugs for the treatment of such distress or gender transition.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="CXPV6y"&gt;“Puberty blockers have been around a long time, and weren’t invented for trans children,” says Jules Gill-Peterson, trans historian and author of &lt;em&gt;Histories of the Transgender Child&lt;/em&gt;. There’s plenty of evidence that they do what they’re supposed to do: delay puberty. They’ve been prescribed for decades &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/epnzjk/no-one-had-a-problem-with-puberty-blockers-when-only-cis-kids-took-them"&gt;for cis children&lt;/a&gt; who enter puberty at particularly young ages, and are approved by the FDA for that use. The blockers used for trans and cis children are the same, are only used temporarily, and their effects are reversible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L0luOK"&gt;A lack of long-term studies doesn’t equate to a lack of knowledge about puberty blockers’ risks or benefits for trans children. The use of puberty blockers for trans children is in line with the WPATH &lt;a href="https://www.wpath.org/publications/soc"&gt;Standards of Care&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/102/11/3869/4157558?login=true#99603316"&gt;Endocrine Society’s guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(17)30099-2/fulltext"&gt;2017 review&lt;/a&gt; of available evidence determined that puberty suppression is reasonably safe and is associated with improved psychological health. Preliminary results from a &lt;a href="https://ijpeonline.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13633-020-00078-2"&gt;longitudinal study in the US&lt;/a&gt; suggest lowered depression and suicidal ideation in trans youth on hormone treatments, including puberty blockers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ECRCgD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HB 1570&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;em&gt; “Healthcare providers are also prescribing cross-sex hormones for children who experience distress at identifying with their biological sex, despite the fact that no randomized clinical trials have been conducted on the efficacy or safety of the use of cross-sex hormones in adults or children for the purpose of treating such distress or gender transition.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4q5xSe"&gt;The lack of randomized clinical trials isn’t really a smoking gun here. It would be unethical to run studies where hormones were given to some people and withheld from others. Like puberty blockers, hormone therapies are prescribed to cisgender people for a variety of reasons. For example, anti-estrogen drugs are recommended for &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6166145/"&gt;teen cisgender boys with persistent gynecomastia&lt;/a&gt; (breast enlargement) who experience psychological distress, though they’re not approved by the FDA for that use. There are no randomized clinical trials for such treatments for cis children. Lawmakers seemingly have no objections to hormone therapies unless they’re used for trans children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jIyhrd"&gt;Minors are prescribed hormones after careful consideration and discussion between healthcare providers, children, and their caregivers. There are plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1054139X16000963"&gt;barriers and gatekeeping&lt;/a&gt; to gender affirming care, and &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11673-020-10086-9#Abs1"&gt;researchers argue&lt;/a&gt; that young teens are often capable of making their own decisions about when to start hormones. WPATH, the Endocrine Society, and other medical associations consider hormone therapy safe and beneficial for trans youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="u8pQtw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HB 1570&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;“It is of grave concern to the General Assembly that the medical community is allowing individuals who experience distress at identifying with their biological sex to be subjects of irreversible and drastic nongenital gender reassignment surgery and irreversible, permanently sterilizing genital gender reassignment surgery, despite the lack of studies showing the benefits of such interventions outweigh the risks.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="tfoe26"&gt;Very few minors undergo gender affirming surgeries of any kind, especially genital surgeries. Those who do are usually at least 16 years old and have already been socially and medically transitioning for some time with the guidance of healthcare providers. The WPATH Standards of Care recommend waiting until the age of majority, and having been on hormones for at least a year. It’s also worth noting that the use of puberty blockers can prevent trans children from needing many surgeries later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CyDPOT"&gt;The vast majority of trans youth do not get any surgeries until they’re over 18, but there is growing evidence that there are benefits to having certain procedures done at a younger age. &lt;a href="https://www.jsm.jsexmed.org/article/S1743-6095(17)30108-X/fulltext"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; noted that transfeminine patients were more likely to keep up with vaginoplasty aftercare while at home with family members, as opposed to recovering while away at college. &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/2674039?utm_source=TrendMD&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_campaign=JAMA_Pediatrics_TrendMD_1"&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt; of transmasculine people who had chest surgery earlier in life found very low rates of regret, as well as significantly lower dysphoria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wcNFXC"&gt;People who oppose trans healthcare rely on fear-mongering language around gender affirming surgeries, using words like “irreversible” and “sterilizing” and making comparisons to mutilation. But bodies go through irreversible changes all the time, from puberty and aging to appendectomies and tonsillectomies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AxRSEW"&gt;“It’s a fantasy that the cis body is some sort of organic, naturally developing body that just perfectly unfolds according to nature’s plan, and never undergoes any sorts of significant changes,” says Gill-Peterson. “The human body is fundamentally biologically plastic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kab9Ue"&gt;“Irreversibility makes a couple of assumptions when we see it talked about this way, that it’s a zero sum that something either is or is not reversible, as opposed to on a spectrum,” says Everhart, “some things will return to their previous state, but maybe not fully, others will totally reverse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="yfPGQU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HB 1570&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;“Gender transition procedures” do not include: (i) Services to persons born with a medically verifiable disorder of sex development including a person with external biological sex characteristics that are irresolvably ambiguous [...] (ii) Services provided when a physician has otherwise diagnosed a disorder of sexual development that the physician has determined through genetic or biochemical testing [...]”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="dKuYhL"&gt;The bill bans surgeries for trans youth, but specifies that the ban doesn’t apply to procedures on intersex people. This exception leaves room for healthcare providers to continue the traumatizing practice of operating on intersex children of all ages without their consent or knowledge. “They’re going to force intersex people to endure the things that they’re withholding from trans people,” says Gill-Peterson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QAif7U"&gt;Unlike medical treatments that trans youth seek out to affirm their identities, procedures done on intersex children, often during infancy, do cause irreversible physical and psychological harm. Medical opinion has &lt;a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/09/17/us-medical-association-stands-against-unnecessary-intersex-surgeries"&gt;shifted away&lt;/a&gt; from promoting intersex surgeries as medically necessary, and intersex activists are still &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/nicolang/lurie-childrens-hospital-intersex-surgery"&gt;calling on hospitals&lt;/a&gt; across the country to stop performing them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="pfDkzh"&gt;“That’s the tell. That’s how you know none of these bills have anything to do with science and are purely ideological,” says Gill-Peterson. “[It’s] all the same medicine for cis, trans, and intersex people. They’re just treated entirely differently now under the law, and I think that’s really, really disturbing.” &lt;/p&gt;
