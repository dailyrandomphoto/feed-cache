    <title>Fortnite is planning skins for LeBron James and The Rock, documents show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An Epic promo doc presents “Zion vs. Lebron” Fortnite Party Royale featuring Zion Williamson and Lebron James" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xssk4blUV4xmnIKX6clwBeDo370=/131x0:1393x841/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69228755/Screen_Shot_2021_05_03_at_12.53.37_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;An internal Epic document from June 2020 shows plans to “announce the first-ever sports event in Party Royale”&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AlcFH2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20696855-epic-games-presentation-on-2021-plans"&gt;An internal presentation at Epic Games&lt;/a&gt; showed ambitious promotional plans for the game, including a basketball mini-game and a planned “Party Royale” featuring Zion Williamson and LeBron James. Made public as part of the ongoing &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial, the document comes from a quarterly business review performed in June 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CfSJp2"&gt;In addition to detailing the game’s revenue and promotional outlook, the presentation lays out a new kind of “experimental” venture to be built inside of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, including plans to implement a basketball mini-game as part of a broader NBA partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SeHEQ7"&gt;One slide describes the project as “a Fortnite version of arcade basketball,” which would allow players to take to the courts as an alternative to the traditional Battle Royale. A subsequent slide teases the release of themed emotes, playoff events, and potential NBA post-game shows inside the game.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A slide detailing the planned basketball mini-game, including the text “Create arcade style basketball mini games to showcase entirely new play. We move past the simply toy functionality and into a Fortnite version of arcade basketball”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tB36rVlWZP4aUzqba-LhSTlGimU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22488695/Screen_Shot_2021_05_03_at_1.16.43_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A slide detailing the planned basketball mini-game.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="R7YhTx"&gt;Notably, rumors have circulated that Season 6 of the game might include a skin of LeBron James, beloved basketball player, driven by &lt;a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/esports/lebron-james-skin-soon-arrive-fortnite-season-6-suggests-new-leak"&gt;close analysis of recent update packages&lt;/a&gt;. Zion Williamson’s participation is less clear; the document makes no reference to him outside of the graphic above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uHOJUJ"&gt;Epic Games declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U2pRJU"&gt;Many of the events detailed in the presentation have already taken place, including an extensive Marvel crossover and the skin partnerships with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/25/22399880/fortnite-neymar-skin"&gt;Brazilian soccer star Neymar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://fortniteintel.com/how-to-get-the-lazarbeam-fortnite-skin-set-for-free/37816/"&gt;popular streamer LazarBeam&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ux18tD"&gt;The presentation also suggests Epic is working on a themed skin with Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson as part of the game’s Icon series, timed for the first quarter of 2021. No official partnership has been announced yet, but there have been significant rumors around some kind of crossover, driven by &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/fortnite/22340070/fortnite-the-rock-foundation-instagram-skin-outfit"&gt;unusual visual similarities&lt;/a&gt; between Johnson and a mysterious Season 6 character, as well as a cryptic Instagram post from the star.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony is working to integrate Discord into PlayStation consoles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ndmFwAzqe7q2ztl83q_PbdxThQM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69228687/acastro_200318_1777_discord_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XcrQsk"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sie.com/en/blog/announcing-playstations-new-partnership-with-discord/"&gt;PlayStation is now partnering with Discord&lt;/a&gt;, the popular online communication service, with a promise to “bring the Discord and PlayStation experiences closer together on console and mobile starting early next year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g9EPNQ"&gt;Details on what that would actually entail are slim, and Sony’s announcement just says that the two companies are “hard at work connecting Discord with your social and gaming experience on PlayStation Network.” Whether that means a full-fledged Discord app coming to PlayStation consoles or a more limited integration (like connecting PSN and Discord accounts to more easily chat with friends off platform) has yet to be announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nbYymI"&gt;As part of the new partnership, Sony is also investing an unspecified amount of money into Discord as part of its Series H investment round as a minority investor. Discord is one of the biggest online communities, especially for gaming enthusiasts, with over 140 million active users &lt;a href="https://blog.discord.com/discord-transparency-report-july-dec-2020-34087f9f45fb?gi=1fa4df39aa19"&gt;as of December 2020&lt;/a&gt;. The company was reportedly in talks to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22345792/microsoft-discord-acquisition-report-10-billion"&gt;acquired by Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; in a $10 billion deal earlier this year, but those talks appear to have ended, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394106/discord-no-sale-microsoft"&gt;with Discord deciding to stay as an independent company&lt;/a&gt; instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DEMW5r"&gt;More information on how Sony is working to integrate Discord into its PlayStation products should be arriving in the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter will now let anyone with 600 or more followers host its audio Spaces on mobile</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zI5f4nhwgXapy-XcqzJhzTYKvEI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69228469/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xrsXaV"&gt;Beginning Monday, Twitter will bring the ability for accounts with 600 or more followers to host Spaces, its Clubhouse-like social audio rooms, &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/spaces-is-here.html"&gt;the company announced&lt;/a&gt;. Although this is a bit later than the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323767/twitter-spaces-april-release-date-plan"&gt;hoped-for April launch&lt;/a&gt;, users on iOS and Android devices will be included in the update. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H1ktRo"&gt;The company said it landed on the 600 followers number after feedback from readers and what it’s learned since it &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1339639767089238019?s=20"&gt;introduced Spaces late last year&lt;/a&gt;. “These accounts are likely to have a good experience hosting live conversations because of their existing audience,” the company said in a blog post announcing the changes. “Before bringing the ability to create a Space to everyone, we’re focused on learning more, making it easier to discover Spaces, and helping people enjoy them with a great audience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJbYHt"&gt;If you’ve used &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22362980/clubhouse-social-audio-facebook-twitter-android"&gt;Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22356682/discord-stage-channels-clubhouse-like-feature-voice"&gt;Discord’s Stage Channels&lt;/a&gt;, or another social audio product, you should feel right at home in a space, which is designed to let groups of people talk among themselves as others listen in. The format is very good for things like interviews or panel discussions, but on Clubhouse, social audio rooms have also been used as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22380290/clubhouse-social-audio-twitter-facebook-platforms"&gt;comedy venues, pitch rooms, and more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1DzTCA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Twitter will also offer ticketed Spaces&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8QYf6F"&gt;Twitter also revealed a feature that Clubhouse doesn’t have: Twitter plans to offer a way for users to monetize Spaces through ticketing. The company says hosts will be able to set ticket prices and the number of tickets sold, which could let people create exclusive events and earn some money for their efforts. (Twitter says it will take “a small amount” of revenue from ticket sales.) The feature will be available to “a limited group” in the coming months, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HGnKV1"&gt;Clubhouse offers a way to earn money on its platform, too, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22368929/clubhouse-direct-payments-creators-stripe"&gt;through direct payments&lt;/a&gt;, though the ability to &lt;em&gt;receive&lt;/em&gt; payments is only available to a small test group at the moment. With ticketed Spaces, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301375/twitter-super-follows-communities-paid-followers"&gt;forthcoming Super Follows&lt;/a&gt; that will let you charge for extra content, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22399984/twitter-tip-button-jar-great-tweets-profiles"&gt;a rumored “tip jar” for profiles and Spaces&lt;/a&gt;, it seems Twitter is ramping up its efforts to let people monetize their followings right from its platform instead of pushing people to places like Clubhouse, Substack, and Patreon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="qcplJd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Twitter is reinventing itself","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22319527/twitter-kayvon-beykpour-interview-consumer-product-decoder"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="DWgQgr"&gt;Twitter also announced that scheduled Spaces and co-hosting are in the works, though the company didn’t provide a timeline for when those features might become available. We also asked Twitter when Spaces will launch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22363221/twitter-spaces-desktop-web-browsers-clubhouse"&gt;on the web&lt;/a&gt;, and while a spokesperson confirmed the feature is still in the works, they didn’t say when it may roll out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z4VoLi"&gt;One big advantage Spaces already has over Clubhouse is live captioning, which will also get an upgrade soon. Twitter plans to add the ability to pause captions, scroll back, and customize fonts. To date, Clubhouse has no captioning options, and the company didn’t respond to an email asking if the feature would be added to future updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IAzKI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft adds FPS Boost to 74 more games on Xbox Series X / S</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cy9Njp_wkv3sjAA4N_ON0wu3BgE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69228179/acastro_190530_1777_xbox_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KC919o"&gt;Microsoft is enabling its Xbox FPS Boost mode on 74 more games today, bringing the total up to 97 games. Titles getting an FPS Boost include &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Unity&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Deus Ex Mankind Divided&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Wasteland 3, &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Far Cry 5&lt;/em&gt; all moving to 60fps. You can find the full list at &lt;a href="https://majornelson.com/fpsboost/"&gt;Microsoft’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBabuT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287001/microsoft-xbox-series-x-s-fps-boost-feature-games"&gt;The FPS Boost feature&lt;/a&gt; for Xbox Series X and Series S consoles is designed to make existing games run better. Microsoft has improved frame rates with some backward-compatible games, but the FPS Boost feature improves older games without developers having to make changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SPteZT"&gt;The updates come just weeks after Microsoft also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397722/xbox-fps-boost-mode-ea-games-series-x"&gt;added FPS Boost mode to 13 EA games&lt;/a&gt;, with 12 of them adding support for up to 120fps. Microsoft also added FPS Boost to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22328089/microsoft-xbox-series-x-bethesda-frame-rate-boost-game-pass"&gt;number of Bethesda games&lt;/a&gt; back in March. Both of these previous additions bumped the total of number to 23 games in total with FPS Boost, but Microsoft’s updates today brings that all the way up to 97.	&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Epic Games v. Apple trial kicks off with kids screaming ‘free Fortnite’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L7wa3FDneNnOI_kP3nNJJGGeh9U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69228061/vpavic_180607_2652_0045.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Dwl5W8"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22412899/epic-apple-trial-rules-investment-app-payment"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epic Games v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial&lt;/a&gt; is starting today, and it has begun with a court conference call full of kids screaming for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; to return to mobile. The public call line allows anyone to dial in and listen to today’s proceedings, but the court didn’t manage to properly mute all participants for more than 20 minutes. The result was what sounded like a chaotic Discord call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWplnd"&gt;More than 200 participants were dialed into the public line, with many screaming “free &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;” or “bring back &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on mobile please judge.” Others played Travis Scott tunes, chatted away, or advertised their YouTube channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AFcNzB"&gt;The trial was supposed to begin at 11:15AM ET, and court clerks could be heard attempting to mute participants multiple times unsuccessfully. At 11:30AM ET, silence finally fell on the line in preparation for the court to hear Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HENwGj"&gt;For a brief period, though, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; fans were pleading for the return of the game on the iPhone and iPad. Over the next few weeks, we’ll find out whether that’s likely to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DJI Mini 2 drone getting firmware update to address battery charging issue</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4MiNVkP6xp17X5JuY4g5tCH_lhM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69228007/vpavic_201118_4405_0348.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qoddNw"&gt;Dronemaker DJI says a firmware update is coming to fix a battery discharge issue in its DJI Mini 2 drone. &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/dji-admits-dji-mini-2-has-battery-issue-and-says-a-fix-is-coming"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the company says the update will “initiate auto-discharge when batteries are in the drone or charging hub and have not been used recently.” It’s a relatively minor issue that mainly affects the battery’s longevity; lithium polymer batteries like the one in the DJI Mini 2 have a longer lifespan if they can discharge slowly when left at a full charge for a long period of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zkoKOK"&gt;Unlike its Intelligent Flight Batteries, the batteries in the DJI Mini 2 “use a minute amount of charge to maintain vital functions and do not initiate auto-discharge,” the company told &lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt;. DJI recommends that batteries in the DJI Mini 2 be removed from the drone or charging hub — regardless of whether the drone has received the firmware update — if the drone will be idle for a while. The timing of the firmware update is still to be determined; we’ve reached out to DJI for more details and will update when we hear back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E6kao4"&gt;The DJI Mini 2 was released in November 2020, and our reviewer called it the best drone under $500, with a decent camera that helps make it “a perfect package for a content creator on the go.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>G4’s newest host is virtual streamer CodeMiko</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WCaIDI7j5vwjDoLJyG-RwPrHRno=/21x0:2340x1546/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69227911/Miko_Headshot_Full__1_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3TMgMo"&gt;G4’s newest host looks a little different from the rest of its lineup: it’s hired CodeMiko — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22370260/codemiko-twitch-interview-stream-technician"&gt;one of the biggest virtual streamers on Twitch&lt;/a&gt; — to bring her eccentric interviews to the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gTUmRK"&gt;CodeMiko, unlike the typical G4 host, is not human — or at least, not entirely. CodeMiko is a Vtuber (“virtual YouTuber,” though they’re often &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22408078/netflix-vtuber-anime-n-ko-youtube"&gt;found elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;), who uses motion capture tech to broadcast herself as a 3D character who can change her appearance on a whim. Since getting started about a year ago, CodeMiko has blown up, with more than 680,000 followers on Twitch and an average audience of more than 6,000 viewers at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="xDAsSk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Chatting with CodeMiko, Twitch’s newest virtual talk show star","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22370260/codemiko-twitch-interview-stream-technician"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Z6mdKw"&gt;On G4, CodeMiko will be interviewing “some of the most notable names in gaming and entertainment” and chatting with other network hosts, including Kevin Pereira and Adam Sessler. “CodeMiko will bring her revolutionary interview experience to G4 and help the network push the boundaries of gaming entertainment,” Kevin Sabbe, G4’s head of content, said in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QgQh80"&gt;If you haven’t seen CodeMiko’s interviews, you should check them out. They’re oddly aggressive and often take advantage of her virtual nature to put CodeMiko into different outfits and environments to match the conversation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="BLTXga"&gt;As you might imagine, she’s also walked the line of what’s acceptable on Twitch and has already been banned a couple of times. Hosting on G4 (off of Twitch, at least) could give CodeMiko a way to maintain her wilder material without the constant fear of a ban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fmlCuP"&gt;G4 plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22254953/g4b4-revival-twitch-youtube-attack-of-the-show-x-play"&gt;relaunch later this year&lt;/a&gt;. The network shut down in 2014, but it’s now being revived by a Comcast-owned gaming brand. For the moment, the network exists on YouTube and Twitch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the accessories you’ll need for your PlayStation 5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tKR_P301-r_RAX5aYlCy2lUGo0Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67755669/vpavic_4278_20201030_0345.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8EKGm6"&gt;Sony’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21314187"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; is still incredibly difficult to find. Whether you got lucky with a launch unit, or are still trying to snag one for yourself, picking up additional accessories to ensure you get the most out of your brand new console (whenever you get one) isn’t a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvceaC"&gt;First, there’s the controller. Every new PS5 includes one DualSense controller. Unlike the DualShock controllers, the DualSense has a two-color scheme and a more ergonomic design. The controller also features adaptive triggers, a built-in microphone, and haptic feedback, with some games taking advantage of the controller’s features to provide more immersion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gZ6VYl"&gt;In addition to working with the PS5, the DualSense can connect to Android and iOS devices wirelessly. The controller will also connect wirelessly to a PC if your computer supports Bluetooth. If not, you can connect the DualSense to a PC using a USB cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6AKJDv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Get the best price on a subscription to PS Plus right here","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22348957/best-video-game-subscription-playstation-plus-xbox-game-pass-nintendo-switch-online-deals-price-sale"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/baxSt-AgeiT2dmO0HH0MHNVDjLQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22015299/vpavic_4278_20201030_0150.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s DualSense controller.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9EdKyu"&gt;The controller is usually $70, but sometimes you can find it for $60. The DualSense is a good successor to the PS4’s controller, given all the improvements that come with it. If you already owned a PS4 or own a DualShock 4, you can still use the controller on the PS5, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352382/sony-ps5-playstation-4-controllers-new-ps4-support-games"&gt;but it will only work while playing PS4 games&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="X3xDOS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562878"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CY-qzhaX_QwRRse0Tvyuzi7oFy4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22469171/DSCF3674.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HOnGkH"&gt;Looking for a new 4K TV that can take full advantage of the PS5’s capabilities? &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"&gt;My colleague Chris Welch has you covered with a range of TVs from TCL, LG, and Samsung&lt;/a&gt;. They’re all different sizes and prices, but working well with the PS5 is something they each have in common.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FslBNnGNynU4jLrAtku1DjZfL44=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20030776/Screen_Shot_2020_06_11_at_5.28.58_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3ZGE2U"&gt;If you are interested in using your PS5 to live-stream video games or broadcast your gameplay with friends, you’ll want to pick up the PS5 HD Camera, which is $60. It includes dual 1080p lenses and is a successor to the PS4 camera. The camera also allows you to remove the background of your camera’s feed and replace it with something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UH1Lgq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562900"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JP9QkN"&gt;Sony’s Pulse 3D wireless gaming headset is worth the $100 price tag if you want a wireless model that can let the audio in some PS5-exclusive games shine. It sounds fantastic in games like &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Miles Morales&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt;, and more. Like the console, this headset has been a little tough to find, but it’s coming back in stock more frequently these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4VdxYT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10420564"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="mBEDB8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are some other great wired and wireless headset recommendations","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21549510/best-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/opFmXFF_qtR-LDnVobxe4mPdHjs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21979441/blog_playstation_com_PS5_Media_Remote_featured_image.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PS5 media remote includes four dedicated launch buttons for Disney Plus, Netflix, Spotify, and YouTube.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cS7G5C"&gt;Shifting back to accessories, the PS5 also has its own media remote. The PS5 can double as a device to stream movies and videos, or if you buy the PS5 with a disc drive, you can watch Blu-ray discs. The PS5 will have a ton of streaming apps available at launch, including Apple TV Plus, Crunchyroll, and Hulu, so if you plan to watch movies and shows on your device, the PS5 media remote would be a smart thing to buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rkTa1q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562948" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uClkY4"&gt;With the console’s SSD space limited and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551165/sony-ps5-playstation-5-no-m2-ssd-expansion-launch"&gt;no signs of SSD expansion support&lt;/a&gt; coming in the near future, using an external hard drive as a way to store older PS4 games is not a bad idea. Just note that you won’t be able to use it to play next-gen PS5 titles, though a recent update allows you to store them on a hard drive like this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="izStMf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562978"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5ycg0i"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 3rd, 11:15AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added a link to Chris Welch’s guide to buying the best 4K TV for the PS5, as well as links for the Pulse 3D headset and a resource to help you find the best deal on a PS Plus subscription.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Upgrades to the US Army’s night vision technology make darkness into a video game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0e_GHDGriMcZsgDmOtayPUgZhZU=/191x0:2689x1665/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69227888/Screen_Shot_2021_05_03_at_11.00.46_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new tech improves contrast.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Lancer Brigade&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y47Gh0"&gt;The US Army’s Lancer Brigade showed footage of the world as seen through the latest in night vision technology, and it’s a major improvement on the familiar blurry green visuals. By swapping the standard green tubes for white (along with other tweaks), the new Enhanced Night Vision Goggle-Binoculars (ENVG-B) clearly show people and objects outlined in a glowing light, almost like a video game objective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IaMB5D"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;New Equipment!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enhanced Night Vision Goggle-Binoculars continue the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/USArmy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@USArmy&lt;/a&gt;’s effort to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/modernize?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#modernize&lt;/a&gt; our fighting force!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You have never seen night vision like this! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/readynow?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#readynow&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/QuietProfessionals?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#QuietProfessionals&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/3TCPtnno1r"&gt;pic.twitter.com/3TCPtnno1r&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Lancer Brigade (@lancer_brigade) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lancer_brigade/status/1385318416106475522?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m1SG6n"&gt;Night vision technology was first developed in the 1930s to help military forces see during low-light conditions. The standard tech people think of around night vision uses a strategy called image enhancement, and it &lt;a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/ask-smithsonian-how-does-night-vision-work-180956656/"&gt;works similarly&lt;/a&gt; to old televisions and computers. The device picks up any ambient light in an environment (like from the Moon) and passes it through a photocathode, a device that transforms photons (the light) into electrons. Those electrons then hit a tube covered in the fluorescent substance phosphor, creating the image. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2mV7a"&gt;Usually, the tube contains green phosphor; the human eye is particularly sensitive to wavelengths of light in that color, and early &lt;a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/31061/why-does-everything-look-green-through-night-vision-goggles"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; found that people could easily distinguish images that use it. But the new ENVG-B tech uses white phosphor tubes, which the Army’s Acquisition Support Center says offer &lt;a href="https://asc.army.mil/web/portfolio-item/enhanced-night-vision-goggle-envg-b/"&gt;better contrast&lt;/a&gt;. The result is a visual field that clearly outlines people, their equipment, and weapons, distinguishing them from the background. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jxhRvt"&gt;The new device also is designed as a set of binoculars to improve depth perception, and they integrate an augmented reality system. They can also let soldiers look through the scope of a weapon remotely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IvKVV8"&gt;This type of night vision isn’t available to civilians, but like other military-grade tech, it could eventually trickle down for the general public. Night vision products are already marketed to hunters. The devices available are &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/night-vision-gear_n_59f38cf2e4b03cd20b8196bf"&gt;largely unregulated&lt;/a&gt;, despite concerns that they could be used for domestic terrorism or exported, where they may be national security threats. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The League of Legends animated series is coming to Netflix this fall</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tKFvomXkTTUo3Reyt1MwHcVNjiM=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69227718/Group_Shot.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LDcwZ5"&gt;The long-awaited &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; animated series is coming to Netflix. The streaming service confirmed today that the show, called &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt;, will be available later this fall. The show was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20915338/league-of-legends-animated-series-fighting-game-cards-arcane-runeterra-project-l-trailers"&gt;first announced back in 2019&lt;/a&gt; as part of a &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; 10th anniversary celebration event; last year, &lt;a href="https://eune.leagueoflegends.com/en-pl/news/dev/an-update-on-arcane/"&gt;developer Riot announced&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt; would be delayed to 2021 due to the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="g0PjDb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The world of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LeagueOfLegends?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@LeagueofLegends&lt;/a&gt; is coming to Netflix.&lt;br&gt;Arcane drops this Fall. &lt;a href="https://t.co/7DJgqHpODM"&gt;pic.twitter.com/7DJgqHpODM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix Geeked (@NetflixGeeked) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1389218281706254336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="klTlhZ"&gt;We still don’t know much about the show (you can get an all-too-brief taste in the teaser above), but it’s part of a big push from Riot to expand &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; beyond just the core strategy game. So far, that’s included comic books, a digital card game, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358213/league-of-legends-wild-rift-iphone-android-preview"&gt;a mobile spinoff&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21408504/league-of-legends-tellstones-board-game-spinoff"&gt;an ancient board game&lt;/a&gt;. An animated series also makes sense given &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/24/21336218/league-of-legends-yone-anime-cinematic-riot-games"&gt;Riot’s long history with short cinematics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WQ9fLf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt; also fits into Netflix’s recent strategy of tapping into the worlds of video games for new shows and movies. Outside of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21026537/the-witcher-netflix-review-henry-cavill"&gt;the blockbuster success of &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, there’s also a new season of &lt;em&gt;Castlevania&lt;/em&gt; coming later this month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252386/netflix-tomb-raider-kong-skull-island-anime"&gt;an upcoming &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; anime&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt;’s biggest rival, &lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22346867/dota-dragons-blood-netflix-anime-review"&gt;has its own show&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
