    <title>Microsoft to acquire Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GPn8nhQwINtr12Z1va1qMEa6UCM=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70402797/header_jan18_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ScZIsQ"&gt;Microsoft is acquiring Activision, the troubled publisher of &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt;. The deal will value Activision at $68.7 billion, far in excess of the $26 billion Microsoft paid to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/8/13882622/microsoft-linkedin-acquisition-finalized"&gt;acquire LinkedIn in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. It’s Microsoft’s biggest push into gaming, and the company says it will be the “third-largest gaming company by revenue, behind Tencent and Sony” once the deal closes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iaPJb7"&gt;Microsoft plans to add many of Activision’s games to Xbox Game Pass once the deal closes. With the acquisition of Activision, Microsoft will soon publish franchises like &lt;em&gt;Warcraft&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt;. “Upon close, we will offer as many Activision Blizzard games as we can within Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass, both new titles and games from Activision Blizzard’s incredible catalog,” says Xbox chief Phil Spencer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kZX6Pt"&gt;Xbox Game Pass now has 25 million subscribers, as Microsoft continues to acquire studios to boost the subscription service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1K8xI4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6z2MxN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best free apps for video calling</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fQj6r0bHP5nOrtxHEULCvRhhAGc=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66922524/VRG_ILL_4947_Zoom_secure_call.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Samar Haddad / Photo by Becca Farsace&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Jz5xAw"&gt;Remember last summer, when things were starting to open up and Omicron was just a Greek letter you found in crossword puzzles? Yeah, me too. But now, many of us are still relying on video calls to keep in touch with work colleagues, family, and friends. And for most of us — especially those who are facing financial difficulties — free is best. Zoom continues to top the list of videoconferencing apps, but there are a bunch of applications out there that will allow you to meet others online for free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBifoi"&gt;We’ve listed a few of the best known videoconferencing apps, along with a couple of popular text chat apps that include video calling features. While most of these already have free versions, some are offering access to additional features for those who are currently working from home or who want to check up on friends and relatives online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bCcs6d"&gt;There are a number of apps we have not included, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, and FaceTime, that allow you to do video chats. We’ve left them out because they require that all participants be members of a specific social network (Facebook, WhatsApp) or that you use a specific type of device (FaceTime, which is Apple-only). We’ve also tried to concentrate on applications that allow you to participate without having to download the app (unless you’re the host), and that allow at least 10 or more participants on their free version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F8yIwt"&gt;A good idea is to try one or two out for yourself to see how well they fit in with your style and that of your friends. This list is a good place to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6libON"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fzoom.us%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21286781%2Fbest-video-call-apps-free" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zoom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="LQuFKh"&gt;The most popular video meeting app&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Zoom is one of the most widely used video meeting apps." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t5zsGsMM_zzRUfccXF_2EdkoflI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22491368/Screen_Shot_2021_05_04_at_1.20.14_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zoom is one of the most widely used video meeting apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CYiJpA"&gt;Zoom has become one of the most well-known videoconferencing apps — in fact, its name is quickly becoming synonymous with video meetings. Before the pandemic hit, the company pushed Zoom mostly for corporate use, but it also provides a free basic version for individuals. At first, because Zoom didn’t expect its sudden popularity among non-business users, there were several missteps involving privacy and security; the company quickly instituted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230962/zoom-update-security-privacy-features-improvements-download"&gt;a number of changes and updates&lt;/a&gt; to address these issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="66nndg"&gt;The free version of Zoom allows up to 100 users to meet, but there is a 40-minute limit on meetings of more than two people, which can be pretty limiting. At the time of publication, Zoom was not offering any special deals for those now working at home, but it does have a page &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fzoom.us%2Fdocs%2Fen-us%2Fcovid19.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21286781%2Fbest-video-call-apps-free" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offering help and advice&lt;/a&gt; to new users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="BYNFVw"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="RHNl6l"&gt;Maximum participants: 100&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="b91yn2"&gt;One-on-one meetings: 30-hour time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JIlwSK"&gt;Group meetings: 40-minute time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XpI4G1"&gt;Screen sharing: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kF9xF4"&gt;Record meetings: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="81FqBb"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.skype.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21286781%2Fbest-video-call-apps-free" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Skype&lt;/a&gt; Meet Now&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id="StW6sf"&gt;A longtime go-to for online calls&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Skype’s Meet Now feature supports up to 50 people with a four-hour time limit. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DjOAVSTCxLE9SAzc8jmS5cISMQQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22489407/Screen_Shot_2021_05_03_at_2.42.55_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skype’s Meet Now feature supports up to 50 people with a four-hour time limit. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WfOsT4"&gt;Skype has been the go-to platform for one-on-one conversations since its beta was released in 2003. Its Meet Now feature (accessed by choosing the “Meet Now” button on the left side of the app) allows for videoconferencing; up to 100 people (including you) can meet with a generous 24-hour time limit on meetings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JB02lU"&gt;There is also a separate page that lets you &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.skype.com%2Fen%2Ffree-conference-call%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21286781%2Fbest-video-call-apps-free" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;create a free video meeting&lt;/a&gt; without having to actually sign up for the service. However, you get more features using the app, so if you’re okay with registering for a free account, you’re better off doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="FQrF4L"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="lgPZGp"&gt;Maximum participants: 100&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PS5plA"&gt;One-on-one meetings: 24-hour time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3x7cKx"&gt;Group meetings: 24-hour time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="z1x7zH"&gt;Screen sharing: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sDu0pA"&gt;Record meetings: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5SlZUs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webex.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21286781%2Fbest-video-call-apps-free" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Cisco Webex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4k2CRu"&gt;A corporate app with a solid freemium version&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Webex, a videoconferencing app that has been around since the ‘90s, has a useful free version." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ah3jKqqaHJRvvLdrj0b-aTaTz0U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22489405/Screen_Shot_2021_05_03_at_2.49.49_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Webex, a videoconferencing app that has been around since the ‘90s, has a useful free version.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XcIFOJ"&gt;Webex is a videoconferencing app that has been around since the ’90s, and was acquired by Cisco in 2007. While it’s been mainly known as a business application and continues to focus on serving companies, it does have a &lt;a href="https://cart.webex.com/sign-up-webex?experienceType=Unified&amp;amp;ft=selfsignup"&gt;fairly generous free version&lt;/a&gt; that’s worth checking out. During the current pandemic, it has widened the features of the freemium version from 50 to 100 participants, and you can meet for up to 50 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="iVgdLr"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="B6FO7y"&gt;Maximum participants: 100&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZhF2Xh"&gt;One-on-one meetings: 50-minute time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gTTnlh"&gt;Group meetings: 50-minute time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ruv0bm"&gt;Screen sharing: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3aAMO5"&gt;Record meetings: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7pIZFI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://meet.google.com/"&gt;Google Meet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="5QusdH"&gt;Now featured on your Gmail page&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A7O1n6NkE0ge6ERXOwjV7S5TmVE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22489403/Screen_Shot_2021_05_03_at_2.52.53_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Meet is a video calling option that requires Google accounts to use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="msl2WU"&gt;Meet offers a very simple and efficient way to video chat with colleagues, friends, and family — assuming they all have Google accounts, which is a requirement for both hosts and participants. In fact, Google is not only pushing people to use &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21265533/google-meet-gmail-hide-video-call-email-shortcut"&gt;its Meet videoconferencing app&lt;/a&gt; instead of Zoom, but also instead of its own previously pushed Google Hangouts app. You can find a Meet link in the Gmail app and in every appointment you make using Google Calendar. And Meet has some neat features, including real-time captions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="v1Sc5Q"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ndFlQU"&gt;Maximum participants: 100&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9l2AqB"&gt;One-on-one meetings: 24-hour time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4Vykzc"&gt;Group meetings: 60-minute time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="a6cOEo"&gt;Screen sharing: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JUU1Sr"&gt;Record meetings: No&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="h4bFcC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Fmicrosoft-teams%2Fteams-for-home" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Teams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0gleS7"&gt;Not just for business&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e6cKl0CUoE2ruyM1Bb3kGununBU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22489400/Screen_Shot_2021_05_03_at_2.58.33_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="celGBu"&gt;Microsoft Teams was built as a competitor to Slack and is an especially good idea if you’re part of the Office ecosystem. While the application is mainly focused on business use, Microsoft has stepped out of its three-piece suit and unveiled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21349783/microsoft-teams-texting-calls-videoconferencing-how-to"&gt;a free personal version of Teams&lt;/a&gt;, which lets anyone chat, talk, or have video meetings — you just have to create an account with Microsoft in order to use it. You can have up to 100 participants for a maximum of 60 minutes per meeting; you also get 5GB of OneDrive storage for files and photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="z7fDpG"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="VPM1Xz"&gt;Maximum participants: Normally 100; extended to 300 during pandemic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3OY8iA"&gt;One-on-one meetings: Normally 60-minute limit; extended to 24 hours during pandemic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MaDoxu"&gt;Group meetings: Normally 60-minute limit; extended to 24 hours during pandemic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OU4H3U"&gt;Screen sharing: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lqJ1wZ"&gt;Record meetings: No&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZdqxTy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://duo.google.com/about/"&gt;Google Duo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kdg4C0"&gt;A mobile app best suited to one-to-ones&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ycUHduEC2TCTGPyGnIbxdxIf4Ew=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22489396/Screen_Shot_2021_05_03_at_3.01.40_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="S0KN9x"&gt;You don’t really expect Google to only offer one simple videoconferencing app, do you? Besides Google Meet, Google also has its mobile app Duo, which was built as a consumer app (whereas Meet was originally designed as a business app). While Duo was first touted as the app to use for one-to-one conversations and could only be used on phones, it now allows you to create groups of up to 32 participants and includes a web app. All participants must have Google accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hrdSff"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="aqu3zn"&gt;Maximum participants: 32&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="k4gNud"&gt;One-on-one meetings: No time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Rd9Yef"&gt;Group meetings: No time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3Tah4o"&gt;Screen sharing: Mobile only&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bdHECg"&gt;Record meetings: No&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dSGznj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.starleaf.com/resources/remote-working-hub/"&gt;StarLeaf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="05W8yJ"&gt;A corporate meeting app with a free basic version&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_xVXExpwfdFlYEda9IYnq6kfTQM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22489394/Screen_Shot_2021_05_03_at_3.08.31_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XSzst4"&gt;If you’re not a company, you may not have heard of StarLeaf. It’s really a platform for companies rather than individuals; its lowest-cost paid plan starts with one to nine licenses, suitable for a small business. But it also offers a basic video and messaging product free of charge for those trying to keep in touch during the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="PWyY2P"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="W5dlgk"&gt;Maximum participants: 20&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0hGcJD"&gt;One-on-one meetings: No time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Gtv4JL"&gt;Group meetings: 45-minute time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uPfKjn"&gt;Screen sharing: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gxuvie"&gt;Record meetings: No&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TzLjf1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://meet.jit.si/"&gt;Jitsi Meet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4Zxxcw"&gt;Open source with plenty of features&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3MVwxTZMGAegmePx6edtBU9gdi0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22489390/Screen_Shot_2021_05_03_at_3.11.38_PM__1_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YYifcw"&gt;Another “you probably haven’t heard of it” videoconference app, Jitsi Meet is an open-source platform that lets you easily meet online by simply going to the site and clicking on “Start meeting.” If you’re a developer, you can build your own conferencing app via &lt;a href="https://jitsi.org/jitsi-videobridge/"&gt;Jitsi Videobridge&lt;/a&gt;, but most people will be happy with the quick web version, which offers many features found in more well-known apps, such as fake backgrounds, chat, session recording (to Dropbox), and the ability to “kick out” unruly participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="VhdHjO"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="JlbkKB"&gt;Maximum participants: 100&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bN9uN0"&gt;One-on-one meetings: No time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3n0cX0"&gt;Group meetings: No time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GpB4PM"&gt;Screen sharing: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wCwVWj"&gt;Record meetings: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GEZRsM"&gt;&lt;a href="https://whereby.com/"&gt;Whereby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0tRyD7"&gt;Single meeting rooms with up to 50 participants&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/47xmn6lLGej9EWf2brZ_EXrP7f0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22489313/Screen_Shot_2021_05_03_at_3.13.49_PM__1_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Yb3ZHs"&gt;Whereby’s free version gives you the use of a single meeting room with up to 50 participants, along with the ability to lock rooms (participants have to “knock” to gain entrance). Each room has its own URL that you get to choose, which is great — assuming that nobody else has already taken that name. (For example, I first tried &lt;a href="http://whereby.com/testroom"&gt;whereby.com/testroom&lt;/a&gt; and found it was already taken.) But it also has a chat function, lets you share a screen, allows you to mute or eject users, and offers breakout groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="NQQ6g6"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AYVdrv"&gt;RingCentral mainly sells business communications services, but also offers a free video meeting app called RingCentral Video Pro. The app includes a nice range of features, including 24 hours of meeting time, screen sharing, recordings (up to 10 hours and stored up to seven days), chat, and virtual backgrounds, among others. It even offers closed captions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="d0yA3C"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id="FU8i90"&gt;A simple web-based system&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="C5n46v"&gt;Spike, an expanding email service, offers paid group videoconferencing to its subscribers, but it has also made a basic video meeting web app available to anyone who wants it. It’s quick and easy to use: just go to &lt;a href="https://video.spike.chat/"&gt;video.spike.chat&lt;/a&gt;, type in a name, and click on “Join Video Chat Meeting.” Spike generates a unique URL for the chat and even lets you share your screen. And unlike most of the other services listed here, there is no maximum for participants.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Telegram has introduced group video chats.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AbKf3x"&gt;Telegram is a messaging chat app that offers video group chats also. It’s well set up for that: the app already has a feature that lets you create groups with up to 200,000 members, and you can have either private or public groups. For now, video chats are limited to 30 people (although up to 1,000 can watch); still, this was a welcome add-on for Telegram users.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Signal offers basic video meetings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FMWRLA"&gt;Signal is a communications app known for its emphasis on secure messaging via end-to-end encryption. Until recently, it only allowed a maximum of five participants in its video calls; however, it &lt;a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360052977792-Group-Calling-Voice-or-Video-with-Screen-Sharing#group_call_requirements"&gt;now allows up to 40 people&lt;/a&gt; to take part via &lt;a href="https://signal.org/blog/how-to-build-encrypted-group-calls/"&gt;its own open source Signal Calling Service&lt;/a&gt;. Signal is mainly meant for mobile devices; to use it on a desktop, you have to link it to an existing mobile app. Still, if you already use Signal messaging, you now have the option to use it as a meeting app as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4F9yiH"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="aGh2XW"&gt;Maximum participants: 40 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="I4bZd6"&gt;One-on-one meetings: No time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="J6DYhj"&gt;Group meetings: No time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8M4KCt"&gt;Screen sharing: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3qKjX4"&gt;Record meetings: No&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cL6ktK"&gt;More alternatives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oQsh6Y"&gt;There is a wide range of other Zoom alternatives out there, including &lt;a href="https://www.remotehq.com/"&gt;RemoteHQ&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://talky.io/"&gt;Talky&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.8x8.com/"&gt;8x8&lt;/a&gt; (which acquired Jitsi in 2018). Some of these don’t have a free version, or the number of participants who can use the free version is limited. For example, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bluejeans.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21286781%2Fbest-video-call-apps-free" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BlueJeans&lt;/a&gt; starts at $9.99 per month for unlimited-time meetings with up to 100 participants, while the free version of &lt;a href="https://www.zoho.com/meeting/"&gt;Zoho Meeting&lt;/a&gt; only permits a maximum of two participants (and up to 10 webinar attendees), and &lt;a href="https://www.intermedia.com/anymeeting-video-conferencing"&gt;Intermedia AnyMeeting&lt;/a&gt; allows four.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nhBhm"&gt;Other apps offer some video meeting ability as an added feature. &lt;a href="https://slack.com/"&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; is mainly set up for text chat, but it does give you the ability to make voice and video calls as well. If you’re on the free version of Slack, you can make a video call to an individual. But if you want to host a meeting between several people, as opposed to a one-on-one conversation, and want to do it for free, you’ll need to look for an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d0ADE9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 4th, 2021, 2:40PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was originally published on June 11th, 2020. Since then, all entries have been updated; in addition, two apps have been dropped (Hangouts and Spike) and Glip Pro has been added.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3fBE0Q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 5th, 2021, 9:15AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to reflect the fact that Whereby’s breakout groups feature is out of beta and to add Signal to the list of alternatives.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hd3p07"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 6th, 2021, 4PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to add Spike back to the main list.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ngMfAf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 28th, 2021, 2:45PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to add Telegram.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7JpuW0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 19th, 2021, 3:40PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to change Meet’s time limit and to reflect the change of Glip Pro to RingCentral Video Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U7ADwy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 18th, 2021, 8:30AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The introduction and some entries were updated, Signal was added to the main list, and Houseparty was removed from the alternatives.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Garmin adds touchscreen and flashlight to its best multisport watch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nLdnRacV40A7O9k-e-_m0EBlfRs=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70402549/47433_FENIX.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Garmin’s new Fenix 7 series &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Garmin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="71XQB9"&gt;Despite being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/19/22845465/garmin-fenix-7-smartwatch-leak"&gt;leaked to hell and back&lt;/a&gt;, the Garmin Fenix 7 series was a no-show at CES 2022. That’s because Garmin decided to wait until today to separately announce its revamped multisport GPS smartwatches. On top of an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.garmin.com%2Fen-US%2Fp%2F735520&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F18%2F22883556%2Fgarmin-fenix-7-epix-gps-smartwatches-outdoors-fitness" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;updated flagship Fenix 7 lineup&lt;/a&gt;, Garmin is also launching the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.garmin.com%2Fen-US%2Fp%2F760778&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F18%2F22883556%2Fgarmin-fenix-7-epix-gps-smartwatches-outdoors-fitness" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Epix&lt;/a&gt; — a rugged outdoors smartwatch with an always-on color display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r4TG33"&gt;Some things with the new Fenix 7 smartwatches will be familiar to Garmin fans. There are still three sizes: the 42mm Fenix 7S, the 47mm Fenix 7, and the whopping 51mm Fenix 7X. The Fenix 7S and 7 will come in “regular” versions made of fiber-reinforced polymer, but there are also Solar Editions and Sapphire Solar Editions for all three models. Additionally, the Sapphire Solar Editions upgrade the materials to titanium and a sapphire display for extra durability.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3W2VNt"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LGQqO9yukME?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lU202x"&gt;As the names suggest, Garmin is also adding solar charging capabilities to all three sizes. Garmin says that compared to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/8/29/20838081/garmin-fenix-6-solar-price-date"&gt;Fenix 6X Pro&lt;/a&gt;, these watches have 54 percent more solar surface area — and that purportedly translates to longer battery life. With GPS enabled, Garmin says the max battery for the 7S is 90 hours and 162 hours with solar charging. The numbers jump up for the 7 from 136 hours to 289 hours with solar. For the 7X, Garmin says you’ll get 213 hours or 578 hours with solar. Of course, these are all estimates, and what you actually get will heavily depend on your individual usage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mkr57Q"&gt;The Fenix 7 watches will all support every major satellite system but also add the L5 frequency range for better accuracy in “challenging GPS environments.” L5 is one of three “modernized” GPS signals for civilian use that, according to &lt;a href="https://www.gps.gov/systems/gps/modernization/civilsignals/"&gt;the US government&lt;/a&gt;, have “higher power, greater bandwidth, and advanced signal design.” The lineup also gets touchscreen capabilities — but don’t worry, Garmin isn’t getting rid of button controls. (In fact, it’s actually adding button guards to the start and stop button to minimize accidental presses.) The idea is to offer multiple ways of navigating through menus, such as scrolling through your settings or zooming in on GPS maps. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vVCfXIRb-fusJPGdngyzDKt8fsg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23168926/fenix7X_Solar_HR_1007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Garmin&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can also opt for a red light, and a “strobe mode” that matches a runner’s cadence.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TkZq7l"&gt;The 7X also has a shiny new hands-free LED flashlight feature with adjustable red or white light to help multisport athletes see, and be seen, during nighttime activities. Garmin says it’s activated via a double-tap and works for both left-handed and right-handed users. It has an optional strobe mode, where the flashlight matches a runner’s cadence, too. Basically, it’ll flash red when your arm swings down and white when it swings up. Garmin says it functions like head and tail lights on cars so that others have a better sense of which direction a person is headed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OvmPYs"&gt;For software, Garmin’s adding a Real-Time Stamina tool to help you compare the potential stamina you’d have at moderate intensity versus your stamina at your current effort level. The company’s also adding a new mapping feature called Up Ahead, which tells users the location of aid stations, elevation climbs, water, and other points of interest on a particular course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="c514f4"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JYDXEh07VzQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XZ0dpY"&gt;Meanwhile, Garmin’s finally refreshing its Epix smartwatch, seven years after it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/5/7486787/garmin-fenix-3-epix-vivoactive-smartwatch-connect-iq-ces-2015"&gt;first introduced in 2015&lt;/a&gt;. The new Epix is basically what you’d get if you took the Fenix 7 and asked, “What if I swapped out the transflective screen for a 1.3-inch always-on OLED display?” It comes in three 47mm models and includes many of the same features as the Fenix 7 like buttons, touchscreens, and Real-Time Stamina. The main difference between the two lineups is the Epix doesn’t have the new LED flashlight or support solar charging. As for battery life, Garmin claims the Epix can last up to 16 days on a single charge — and an impressive six days with the always-on display enabled. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fxldcJRFVV-q5J6D9LRGlLBF09c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23168929/47433_EPIX_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Garmin&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Epix lineup adds a 1.3-inch, always-on color touchscreen display&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0KpwxB"&gt;Both smartwatch lineups also support push notifications, Garmin Pay, music storage, and safety features. They also come with the usual Garmin health features, like heart rate monitoring, respiration, stress tracking, body battery, fitness age, and sleep tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="adr0LX"&gt;The Fenix 7 series cost a pretty penny, but that’s par for the course for Garmin’s flagship GPS smartwatches. While it depends on which materials and models you opt for, the Garmin Fenix 7S and 7 start at $699.99 and go up to $899.99. Meanwhile, the 7X models range from $899.99 to $999.99. The Epix is similarly priced, as Garmin considers it a premium multisport GPS watch. It costs $899.99 for the slate and steel model and $999.99 for the white and black titanium models. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite’s next update adds adorable monsters and brings back Tilted Towers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3jqTd0Renz5Tasec8ePg2M9pjSs=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70402447/19BR_Klombos.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2wGScA"&gt;The next big update for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; brings back something old and adds something new. As fans have long expected, the snow on the battle royale island has slowly melted, revealing the return of Tilted Towers, an iconic urban area that dates back to &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s first island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jIupE2"&gt;Elsewhere in the &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/fortnite-battle-royale-v19-10-update-battle-atop-tilted-towers-and-klombos"&gt;v19.10 update&lt;/a&gt; is the addition of a new kind of creature: a giant, adorable monster called a Klombo. It looks like something ripped out of &lt;em&gt;How to Train Your Dragon&lt;/em&gt;, and developer Epic says that they’re mostly gentle and they appear to add a new way of getting around the map. “Ascend their tails to get to the blowhole on their heads, then get launched a great distance upwards to escape a tricky situation,” Epic wrote in a blog post. There’s also a new item, a colorful kind of berry, that can be used to feed them and lure them around the map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OON6d0"&gt;Between these monsters and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/5/22817392/fortnite-chapter-3-season-1-spider-man-new-island"&gt;other chapter 3 additions&lt;/a&gt; like sliding, swinging around like Spider-Man, and unpredictable weather including destructive tornadoes and lightning storms, this might be the most hectic &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; has ever been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TdNML1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10982502"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jZwv1H"&gt;Aside from the gameplay additions, Epic also announced a new collaboration with street artist Kaws — &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1451971688250454016"&gt;who previously designed a character for the game&lt;/a&gt; — and London-based gallery Serpentine. The two are launching a virtual version of Kaws’ “&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CYzCoI6pmNi/"&gt;New Fiction&lt;/a&gt;” exhibition, which will also be featured at the IRL gallery. The virtual recreation was built by BeyondCreative and Alliance Studios inside of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; Creative, and will be available to check out from January 18th at 10 AM ET until January 25th. (Players can access it using the island code 9441-7852-6686.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RNSXcc"&gt;This isn’t the first time the art world has come to &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; Creative. In 2020 the Manchester International Festival debuted “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21308391/fortnite-creative-manchester-international-festival-art-exhibition-laturbo-avedon"&gt;Your Progress Will Be Saved&lt;/a&gt;,” which featured interactive exhibits from artists like LaTurbo Avedon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US airlines warn of ‘catastrophic disruption’ on Wednesday due to 5G activation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;United Airlines was among those to issue a warning.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Daniel Karmann/picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g0Fg5n"&gt;CEOs from major US airlines including American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, and Southwest Airlines have warned that the impending deployment of new 5G spectrum on Wednesday could cause “catastrophic disruption” for flights across the country starting tomorrow. The warning, which was also signed by shipping companies including UPS Airlines and FedEx Express, was issued in a letter from the CEOs &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-major-us-airline-ceos-urge-action-avoid-catastrophic-5g-flight-2022-01-17/"&gt;seen by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which said that both commercial and cargo flights could be affected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IAWxrF"&gt;The letter was sent to Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel, FAA Administrator Steve Dickson, and White House National Economic Council director Brian Deese, &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="emfBTu"&gt;The 5G spectrum in question is known as C-band, and AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon’s deployments are due to go live on Wednesday, January 19th after suffering multiple previous delays. At the core of the issue are fears that these new C-band airwaves could interfere with sensitive radar altimeters on certain aircraft, my colleague Russell Brandom &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867221/att-verizon-5g-midband-spectrum-faa-air-safety-delay-cband"&gt;explained earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;. Altimeters are critical for landings especially when visibility is limited, and failures in this system were linked to a fatal &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Airlines_Flight_1951"&gt;2009 Turkish Airlines crash&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ej6Pz6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon are feuding with the US government over a last-minute delay to 5G","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867221/att-verizon-5g-midband-spectrum-faa-air-safety-delay-cband"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="kxZjie"&gt;“Airplane manufacturers have informed us that there are huge swaths of the operating fleet that may need to be indefinitely grounded” as a result of the new 5G deployments, the airlines wrote in their letter. “Immediate intervention is needed to avoid significant operational disruption to air passengers, shippers, supply chain and delivery of needed medical supplies,” that could cause “chaos” and strand “tens of thousands of Americans overseas.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WDyc9K"&gt;“When deployed next to runways, the 5G signals could interfere with the key safety equipment that pilots rely on to take off and land in inclement weather,” United Airlines said in its own statement sent to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Without more safeguards, the rollout of this 5G spectrum could “result in significant restrictions on 787s, 777s, 737s and regional aircraft in major cities” and cause “hundreds of thousands of flight cancellations and disruptions for customers across the industry in 2022, [and] also the suspension of cargo flights into these locations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CjG21s"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“When deployed next to runways, the 5G signals could interfere with the key safety equipment”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kq9xgz"&gt;Although there’s technically 220MHz of clearance between the spectrum used by the plane’s equipment and the new 5G spectrum, airlines are worried that the older equipment found in some planes might still be affected. Air safety concerns have already delayed the rollout of C-band from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763502/verizon-att-cband-5g-faa-delay-safety-aircraft"&gt;last December&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22866098/faa-dot-verizon-fcc-att-5g-c-band-delay-airplane-safety"&gt;to this week&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glSd7F"&gt;United is calling for 5G to be implemented “everywhere in the country on Jan. 19, except within approximately 2 miles of airport runways at affected airports.” It indicates the size of this buffer could be reduced after further analysis by the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA). On January 3rd, Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T previously agreed to take steps to mitigate the potential effect on aviation, including placing buffer zones around 50 airports for six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="msu3ya"&gt;C-band spectrum has already been rolled out in &lt;a href="https://www.5gandaviation.com"&gt;nearly 40 countries&lt;/a&gt; without causing altimeter failures according to one tech trade group, and United says the right government policies could allow for a safe deployment in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VJ1rql"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon have a lot riding on this new spectrum, which they paid $65 billion for in an auction last year. Both need the extra spectrum to handle the traffic demands of 5G, especially given AT&amp;amp;T’s plans to shut down its 3G network next month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nSAvPz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Logitech’s Pen is a durable stylus made for Chromebooks in the classroom</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Logitech Pen" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v_FW146VRm80nfHVu6Gev67FvJg=/0x0:5180x3453/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70402369/logitech_pen_hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Logitech Pen doesn’t requiring pairing, thanks to its USI support. But, it won’t work on every Chromebook released.&lt;/em&gt; | Logitech&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fKVHJ3"&gt;Logitech has announced a new stylus called Pen, and it’s aimed at being the best option available for classrooms full of Chromebooks. Unlike many rubber-tipped styli, the Pen is an active stylus that supports the Universal Stylus Initiative (USI) standard, effectively guaranteeing one thing: it’ll work out of the box on a number of recent Chromebooks — no pairing required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iRZOAN"&gt;If a Chromebook is mentioned &lt;a href="https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/usi-enabled-devices"&gt;on this list&lt;/a&gt;, the Pen will work with it. Logitech says that more Chromebook manufacturers have been moving forward with the USI standard, so expect to see more models added to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cuKZbq"&gt;The Pen can recharge via a USB-C port located where you’d find the eraser on a traditional pencil, and Logitech says it can last for up to 15 days of regular school use, though that claim assumes your student is using it for about 2.5 hours a day with its smart sleep and wake feature enabled. If it dies, Logitech claims that a 30-second charge can yield 30 minutes of use, and it can be used while recharging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="oznDfe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Chromebooks that you can buy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="k9bwii"&gt;Logitech’s Pen isn’t a consumer-facing device, so don’t expect to find it in stores. Instead, it’s just for education, and IT managers in your districts will be able to inquire through Logitech’s site and other education tech resellers about orders starting today, with shipping kicking off in April 2022. Logitech shared that each Pen costs $64.99, but it isn’t allowing piecemeal purchases yet. You’ll have to place a larger order.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F3azF7D-ySIuYj3teR3XIg2o8lk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23174973/logitech_logi_pen_USI_stylus_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The USB-C port on the back of the Pen makes it easy to charge it with the same charger that comes with most Chromebooks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yeqvOr"&gt;It’s true that Logitech isn’t the first company to release a USI-compatible stylus, nor is its Pen the most affordable or the most capable. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Faccessories-and-software%2Fstylus-pens-and-supplies%2Fstylus-pens-%26-supplies_pens%2F4x80z49662&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F18%2F22879874%2Flogitech-pen-usi-made-for-chromebook-stylus-education" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lenovo’s $34.99 USI Pen that’s available for purchase here&lt;/a&gt;, just to name one example of many, offers the same 4,096 levels of pressure and support for the USI standard. But Logitech’s angle for the Pen is to be more of a staple for the classroom with its design. Its yellow splashes of color are meant to be reminiscent of a pencil, and there’s even a Pen loop that can be adhered to the lid of a Chromebook display for easy storage. The Pen features a silicon grip to make holding it feel comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oGTKS4"&gt;We had a chance to test the Pen on an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;, a higher-end Chromebook that’s compatible with the USI standard. The Pen worked very similarly to the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09JCCW94F?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Penoval USI stylus&lt;/a&gt; in terms of lag and writing dynamics and its larger, triangle-shaped design might be easier for younger hands to grip. It lacks any buttons or even an eraser tip on the top, which is compatible with some, but not all, USI Chromebooks. It’s clear Logitech prioritized simplicity over an abundance of features here.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OHx6I1HSNENIkO7eTJyb_EVG3Ck=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23174978/logitech_logi_pen_USI_stylus_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pen’s triangular shape and rubberized texture are designed to make it easier for small hands to hold it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7aWX25"&gt;Logitech says the Pen meets the MIL-STD-810G spec for durability and is able to survive up to four-foot drops. It’s also spill-resistant. Additionally, Logitech built its Pen tip in such a way that students who fidget shouldn’t easily be able to pull it out (though it can be removed with needle-nosed pliers). Logitech is backing each stylus with a three-year warranty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rGkEor"&gt;Given that several other USI-supporting styli are widely available to consumers, it’d be great if Logitech made this one available to more than just educators. The company didn’t even hint at an eventual widening of its availability. Though, perhaps that might change once it launches in April 2022. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung announces first smartphone chip with AMD ray tracing GPU</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JdgzfFADNMneGsNwEeisOZ1I6K4=/50x0:1400x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70401999/exynos.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YlSgCH"&gt;Samsung has announced the Exynos 2200, its new in-house mobile processor for smartphones. It’s the first mobile system-on-a-chip to include a GPU with AMD’s RDNA 2 graphics architecture, enabling features like hardware-accelerated ray tracing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NfvFJq"&gt;The collaboration with AMD has been long in the making. The two companies first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/6/4/18651894/amd-radeon-samsung-graphics-soc-chipset-exynos-smartphones"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a licensing deal in 2019, then AMD &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22462678/samsung-amd-exynos-ray-tracing-mobile-soc"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; last year that Samsung’s “next flagship mobile SoC” would use RDNA 2. Samsung recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22860530/samsung-exynos-2200-amd-rdna-2-graphics-gpu-january-11th-teaser-chip"&gt;teased&lt;/a&gt; an announcement event for the Exynos 2200 that was supposed to take place on January 11th, but it was mysteriously delayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YMfCZL"&gt;The Exynos 2200 is manufactured on Samsung’s 4nm EUV process. Samsung is branding this GPU as “Xclipse,” and AMD’s SVP of Radeon GPU tech David Wang says in a &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-introduces-game-changing-exynos-2200-processor-with-xclipse-gpu-powered-by-amd-rdna-2-architecture"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; that it’s “the first result of multiple planned generations of AMD RDNA graphics in Exynos SoCs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="uTOS3w"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung Galaxy S21 FE review: just off the mark","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22880297/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-review-screen-battery-specs-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="lyx7H9"&gt;On the CPU side, the Exynoss 2200 uses Armv9 cores: one high-powered Cortex-X2 “flagship core,” three Cortex-A710 cores for balanced performance, and four more efficient Cortex-A510 cores. There’s also an upgraded NPU that Samsung says offers twice the performance of its predecessor, and the ISP architecture is designed to support camera sensors of up to 200 megapixels, one of which Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22653558/samsung-isocell-hp1-gn5-200-megapixel-camera-sensor-announced"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="THNPMt"&gt;Samsung’s highest end Exynos chips usually make their way into the company’s flagship Galaxy S phone series, although models sold in the US and certain other markets use Qualcomm’s Snapdragon SoCs. Other phone makers like Vivo occasionally use Exynos chips in their own devices, but we’ll likely have to wait until the presumptive Galaxy S22 is in our hands to find out if AMD’s technology translates into a meaningful leap forward in mobile GPU performance.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Wikitrivia is a web game that challenges your knowledge of historical dates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VSQjRiycwl-xaNDG0HB0maQzBjI=/134x0:2459x1550/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70401405/Screen_Shot_2022_01_17_at_13.23.48.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this game you put events from Wikipedia in a timeline.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lCNSZN"&gt;If you’re a history buff, or are looking for a new web game to play, &lt;a href="https://wikitrivia.tomjwatson.com"&gt;Wikitrivia may be worth your time&lt;/a&gt;. The game’s creator, Tom Watson, &lt;a href="https://tomjwatson.com"&gt;describes it&lt;/a&gt; on his site as “Wikidata as a trivia card game,” and the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/v21/status/1483174863191818244"&gt;tweet that brought it to our attention&lt;/a&gt; called it an “online clone of the card game Timeline.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nHEAYc"&gt;Playing it is simple: it gives you a card that represents something that has a date, which is pulled from &lt;a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page"&gt;Wikidata&lt;/a&gt;; some examples I saw asked me to pin down when the Bastille was built, when the Foo Fighters were formed, and when the October Revolution ended (unfortunately, it was looking for a year, not a month). You then have to put the card on the correct place in the timeline. You’re allowed three mistakes, which are represented by hearts, and you’ll lose one if you put a card in the wrong place. Losing all your hearts will will end your streak and force you to restart with a new timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6ADQH7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Okay, I promise that last one was a slip of the mouse. &lt;a href="https://t.co/9rhO1ztm1K"&gt;pic.twitter.com/9rhO1ztm1K&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mitchell (@strawberrywell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/strawberrywell/status/1483213042208804867?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 17, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G5ggyL"&gt;Wikitrivia isn’t flawless. While the action of moving cards onto the timeline actually works almost flawlessly on my phone, I wouldn’t say the game is much fun to play on mobile; the concept really benefits from as wide a screen as possible, in my opinion. Also, as some players have noticed, some of the titles can act as a giveaway — while I was playing I got at least one that had a year in the title, making it pretty easy to place. I also got this card:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Image of a card asking when the first millennium BC ended." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qsXG4uEOfLdfNpEm8vmE0mwY6Hw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23175304/Screen_Shot_2022_01_17_at_14.01.43.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gee, it is a mystery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xysR6I"&gt;There’s also the possibility of data being wrong. I didn’t notice any instances where that was the case (though keep in mind that I’m not a history buff; you could tell me that the Roman Empire ended in the 1900s and I’d probably think “eh, that could be right”), but Watson does have &lt;a href="https://github.com/tom-james-watson/wikitrivia/discussions/2"&gt;a thread started on Github&lt;/a&gt; where people can report incorrect cards or data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bzsEpo"&gt;The page also calls on users to make any necessary corrections to Wikipedia or Wikidata itself, which could end up making answers across the web more accurate — for example, Google sometimes pulls data from Wikipedia for its knowledge panels, so errors may end up being reflected there unless they’re fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;As far as I’m aware this answer appears to be correct, but I’ve come across inaccurate info from the web in one of these boxes before.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;p id="hKvhfs"&gt;For those who like saying “wow, I never realized that was so recent / long ago,” (or anyone looking for something to do after finishing &lt;a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/"&gt;today’s Wordle puzzle&lt;/a&gt;), Wikitrivia may be a great way to spend some time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google changed the Assistant’s white noise sound, and many aren’t happy about it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rKIz1R4GJ1DJVhXh5Xftc4Xkxrg=/0x0:4990x3327/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70401323/dseifert-nest-audio-4225-9.0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some Nest customers are unhappy with Google’s changes.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iZglav"&gt;Google offers many &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/5/16973646/google-home-white-noise-ambient-sounds-how-to"&gt;ambient sounds from the Google Assistant&lt;/a&gt;, including one for white noise that might help block out noise to make it easier to sleep or study. But the company seemingly changed its white noise sound last week, and many have expressed frustration with the update, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/01/15/google-home-white-noise/"&gt;as reported by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LpYAqk"&gt;The change has been disruptive for a lot of people, as documented in &lt;a href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Speakers-and-Displays/White-Noise-ambient-sound-has-changed-is-there-a-way-to-change/m-p/84041"&gt;this Google Nest community thread&lt;/a&gt; with more than 150 replies. Some described the new white noise as &lt;a href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Speakers-and-Displays/White-Noise-ambient-sound-has-changed-is-there-a-way-to-change/m-p/82562/highlight/true#M15135"&gt;quieter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Speakers-and-Displays/White-Noise-ambient-sound-has-changed-is-there-a-way-to-change/m-p/83999/highlight/true#M15354"&gt;sounding muffled&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Speakers-and-Displays/White-Noise-ambient-sound-has-changed-is-there-a-way-to-change/m-p/82584/highlight/true#M15143"&gt;One person said&lt;/a&gt; their child has asked to use another white noise generator instead of a Google Nest Hub. &lt;a href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Speakers-and-Displays/White-Noise-ambient-sound-has-changed-is-there-a-way-to-change/m-p/84826/highlight/true#M15628"&gt;Another said&lt;/a&gt; their toddler has observed the change and wakes up during the night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aunzbh"&gt;Google didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. It’s unclear if the company plans to adjust the white noise sound in some way to address complaints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ornHRI"&gt;If you want the old white noise sound back right now, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/s4b30o/white_noise_ambient_sound_has_changed/"&gt;a user on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; has uploaded a one-hour track of &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iqUdzp2fNZq_A0zrbeI1dUFVOgQegNt9"&gt;original one and longer versions of it to Google Drive&lt;/a&gt; that you could theoretically use as workarounds. Alternatively, you might want to try the other ambient sounds Google has available, such as forest sounds and rain sounds; &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/7364558?hl=en"&gt;you can see the full list here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jared Kushner floated the idea of a federal cryptocurrency, documents reveal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="ISRAEL-US-POLITICS-DIPLOMACY" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sgu5tbjh7DDhBuD6DePXnirWqfM=/0x0:3406x2271/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70401105/1235817873.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kushner acted as a presidential advisor in the Trump administration.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by AHMAD GHARABLI/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qjJTDr"&gt;Jared Kushner, former President Donald Trump’s son-in-law who acted as a senior advisor during Trump’s time in the White House, was apparently interested in the idea of whether the federal government should make a cryptocurrency in 2018. In an email to then-US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Kushner asked if he could have a group of people “brainstorm” about the government creating its own digital currency, as revealed &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/01/11/the-mnuchin-files-new-documents-shed-light-on-trump-era-crypto-policy/"&gt;by a Freedom Of Information Act request from &lt;em&gt;CoinDesk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2mbvOJ"&gt;While we haven’t seen the idea come to fruition, it’s interesting that someone who &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/6/13/21265067/jared-kushner-trump-white-house-andrea-bernstein"&gt;had a lot of status in the White House&lt;/a&gt; (and also acted &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/5/18/15660486/trump-top-aides-met-republican-lawmakers-modernize-government-kushner-american-innovation"&gt;as the director for the Office of American Innovation&lt;/a&gt;) was thinking about it years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8rEix8"&gt;Here’s the email in full:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xeghSX"&gt;Steven —&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fcxi8P"&gt;Would you be open to me bringing a small group of people to have a brainstorm about this topic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="penh5u"&gt;http://blog.samaltman.com/us-digital-currency&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ly18rz"&gt;My sense is it could make sense and also be something that could ultimately change the way we pay out&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zR29Rf"&gt;entitlements as well saving us a ton in waste fraud and also in transaction costs...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pRAyee"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Kushner links to a blog post discussing how the US should make a crypto coin that could act as legal tender&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="brffQT"&gt;The link included by Kushner goes to &lt;a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/us-digital-currency"&gt;a 2018 blog post titled “US Digital Currency,”&lt;/a&gt; which was written by Sam Altman, a former president of startup incubator Y Combinator and currently the CEO of OpenAI. The post discusses how the US should create a cryptocurrency and make it legal tender in the country. (While it suggests naming the coin USDC, for US Digital Currency, there actually is &lt;a href="https://www.circle.com/en/usdc"&gt;currently a stablecoin named USDC&lt;/a&gt;, short for US Dollar Coin, but that it wasn’t created by the government.) Altman’s post suggests that the US cryptocurrency could have taxes built-in and that building it could help give America “some power over a worldwide currency.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p60j8s"&gt;For his part, Kushner suggests it could be a way to cut down on waste, fraud, and transaction costs when paying out entitlements. The outcome of his request is unclear — the emails don’t show whether Mnuchin ever responded, or if there was ever a meeting about the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="imgJmA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;While there isn’t an AmericaCoin, the US government hasn’t been ignoring crypto&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cYFzWM"&gt;The government hasn’t been ignoring cryptocurrency in the time since Kushner sent the email. The IRS and the treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network have been active in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728765/us-treasury-ransomware-payout-numbers-reports-2021-first-half-cybercrime"&gt;monitoring the crypto space&lt;/a&gt;, as well as trying to get legislation passed on crypto &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22524705/irs-congress-cryptocurrency-exchanges"&gt;data collection&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195834/cryptocurrency-fincen-regulations-private-wallets"&gt;regulation&lt;/a&gt;. Mnuchin’s emails also reveal that the US Treasury had meetings with executives from several companies that deal in cryptocurrency, including Coinbase, Jack Dorsey’s Square (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22812752/square-changing-name-block-jack-dorsey-cash-app-tidal-crypto-spiral"&gt;now Block&lt;/a&gt;), and Xapo Bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oUGHBk"&gt;While the US doesn’t have an official digital currency, there are other countries that do. Bitcoin is now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22660457/el-salvador-bitcoin-legal-tender-currency-cryptocurrency-chivo-wallet"&gt;an official currency in El Salvador&lt;/a&gt;, alongside the US dollar, and China has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866757/china-digital-currency-yuan-iphone-android-apps"&gt;introduced a digital yuan&lt;/a&gt;, though it’s not based on the blockchain. Venezuela established its own cryptocurrency &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/20/17031720/venezuela-cryptocurrency-petro-oil-reserves-diamonds-inflation"&gt;called the Petro in 2018&lt;/a&gt; (in 2019, Mnuchin emailed two other Treasury secretaries, saying they should discuss the country’s &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-30/maduro-says-venezuela-to-activate-crypto-payment-method-soon"&gt;plans to use crypto for international commerce&lt;/a&gt;), though the currency &lt;a href="https://www.france24.com/en/20200114-maduro-bids-to-revive-venezuela-s-petro-cryptocurrency"&gt;doesn’t seem to have been particularly successful&lt;/a&gt;, and Trump &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/19/17139892/trump-bans-venezuela-nicolas-maduro-national-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-petro"&gt;banned Americans from buying it&lt;/a&gt; during his tenure as president. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="4oDmFM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Mnuchin’s inbox also seemed to have some crypto spam&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r6oyNK"&gt;While it doesn’t seem like we’ll be getting an official US cryptocurrency anytime soon, there was one last thing I noticed while reading through the trove of emails that Coinbase obtained; Mnuchin got some truly eyebrow-raising spam about crypto while heading the treasury (that may be one of the few things I have in common with him). My favorite was one from someone who... I think was claiming to represent all of humanity? The subject line reads “Bitcoin Is Unrecognized By The Central Government Of The World (On Which We Live): The True Creator Of Bitcoin (In The Said World) Can Be Known.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="31F4JO"&gt;The documents don’t show if Mnuchin ever responded to that one. You can read the full cache of emails &lt;em&gt;CoinDesk&lt;/em&gt; obtained &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fdocument%2F552227428%2FThe-Mnuchin-Files&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F17%2F22888225%2Fjared-kushner-us-treasury-mnuchin-government-federal-cryptocurrency-trump-white-house" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;, if you’re so inclined.&lt;/p&gt;
