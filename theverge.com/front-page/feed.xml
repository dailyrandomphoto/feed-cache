    <title>Volvo confident it can get its ‘unsupervised’ highway driving mode approved in California</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mZ4tsg0xgvL--NGUu3MizFe7PYw=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70351052/ahawkins_201221_4352_6501.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PBoqAM"&gt;Volvo announced a new advanced driver assist system called Ride Pilot system, in which its vehicles drive themselves on certain highways without any human supervision. Ride Pilot will be available as a subscription service to customers in California, the company announced at the 2022 Consumer Electronics Show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HJXQJr"&gt;It’s an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21248415/volvo-luminar-lidar-self-driving-highway-pilot-spa2"&gt;ambitious plan that carries its own risks&lt;/a&gt; and sets Volvo apart from its competitors, many of which are planning to launch self-driving technology as part of a robotaxi service rather than production cars for personal ownership. But Volvo believes that by limiting the operational domain — or conditions under which the car can drive autonomously — to just highways, it is creating vehicle technology that is not only safer but less costly as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hzdKxu"&gt;“We will not require hands on the steering wheel and we will not require eyes on the road,” Henrik Green, the automaker’s chief technology officer, said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. But when asked whether drivers will be able to take a nap in the car with Ride Pilot active, Green demurred. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="03ajZ8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re still being very purposely non-distinct in the wakeup time that we require”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pX9fBH"&gt;“We’re still being very purposely non-distinct in the wake-up time that we require,” he said. “Taking a nap requires a wake-up time, so let’s see how far and when we can get there. You need to be able to assume control in a certain time and take back the driving responsibility.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U7A047"&gt;Pending regulatory approval, the new feature will only be available to customers in California at first. Green described the state as a “good geographic location in terms of weather conditions: it’s sunny, it’s got good road conditions.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M3o8WM"&gt;Volvo’s forthcoming (and unnamed) electric SUV, which will be announced later this year, will be the first vehicle to feature Ride Pilot. Volvo’s Concept Recharge, which was revealed last summer, is meant to preview that SUV, as well as how the new driver assist system will be presented with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22547453/volvo-lidar-standard-autonomous-luminar-xc90-2022"&gt;fully integrated roof lidar from supplier Luminar&lt;/a&gt;. The design of the Concept Recharge will likely be similar to that of the electric XC90 successor due to arrive later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yg9jqK"&gt;In addition to Luminar’s lidar, Volvo’s Ride Pilot system will be powered by software developed by Zenseact, a subsidiary of Volvo which worked alongside the automaker’s own team of engineers. Luminar, which is based in Florida, has worked closely with Zenseact’s team in Sweden on a full-stack autonomous driving software for series production vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jy835h8k_YPt92U7CNqUC7H5P5Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144365/283690_Volvo_Concept_Recharge.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Volvo’s Concept Recharge electric SUV, first revealed in the summer of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZryeUW"&gt;Green wouldn’t say when it plans on officially activating Ride Pilot, but he noted that it will almost certainly be sometime after 2022. “What is still not super clear is obviously the timeline both from our confidence and our validation that we are good to go, and [the regulations] need to be in place,” Green said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxnwI7"&gt;Ride Pilot is what the Society of Automotive Engineers would define as a Level 3 autonomous system, in which the driver’s supervision is not required in a highly controlled setting, like on certain mapped highways. But in Level 3 systems, the driver still needs to be ready to take control at a moment’s notice, leaving it somewhat in a nebulous zone between Level 2 advanced driver assist systems, like Tesla’s Autopilot, and fully driverless vehicles, like Waymo’s autonomous taxi service in Phoenix, Arizona. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tguxRd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Green wouldn’t say when it plans on officially activating Ride Pilot&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gmfQNk"&gt;California’s Department of Motor Vehicles oversees the largest autonomous vehicle testing program in the country, with over 60 companies permitted to operate test vehicles on public roads. Only a handful are approved to operate fully autonomous vehicles without safety drivers at the wheel, and even fewer have been approved to deploy vehicles for commercial purposes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SlACu8"&gt;But what Volvo is seeking to do is a bit different. The automaker is applying for a permit to test autonomous vehicles on public roads through the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles. Rather than deploy its vehicles as part of a taxi or delivery fleet, Volvo wants California’s approval to offer its Level 3 autonomous system to customers as a part of a subscription service — something the state has yet to do for any company. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1EcGVYXuX5km5EXkP22PFxRd60w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146040/292922_Volvo_Cars_Concept_Recharge_with_Luminar_s_Iris_LiDAR_on.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Volvo&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="F9mFs3"&gt;According to the DMV, a company wishing to deploy Level 3 capable vehicles on public roads must obtain authorization from the state before making their technology available to customers. Volvo has not applied for a deployment permit yet, a spokesperson for the agency said in an email. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bMXjGk"&gt;Offering Ride Pilot as a subscription presents a lower hurdle to consumers, Green said, given the large percentages of people who lease their vehicles rather than own them. “Not everybody sits on a big amount of cash available,” he said. “Subscription is a very low hurdle you can try out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ek7AVD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Other automakers have been tripped up by the promise of Level 3 driving&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bgyxFH"&gt;Most AV companies, including Waymo and Cruise, have said they are skipping Level 3 and working exclusively on Level 4 technology. The reason is that Level 3 is seen as being potentially dangerous, given the likelihood that drivers will be confused about when they need to takeover control of the vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CazJmR"&gt;Other automakers have been tripped up by the promise of Level 3 driving. In 2018, Audi said its A8 sedan would come with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/11/15952510/audi-a8-level-3-autonomous-driving-self-parking"&gt;a feature called Traffic Jam Assist&lt;/a&gt; that, when active, would relieve human drivers of the need to pay attention during stop-and-go traffic. &lt;a href="https://www.autonews.com/shift/why-level-3-automated-technology-has-failed-take-hold"&gt;But the feature was contingent on approval from local authorities&lt;/a&gt;, and Traffic Jam Assist remains dormant in most markets around the world. Audi has no plans to activate the feature, and Level 3 automation remains a morass of legal, regulatory, and business-related challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TYbri7PED-FssOQfbx_3-3HGLlY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146041/292920_Volvo_Cars_Concept_Recharge_safety_illustration.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2pNidc"&gt;Another potential hurdle is the potential for misuse by customers. A good example is Tesla’s Level 2 “Full Self-Driving” beta software that, despite its misleading name, still requires drivers to be vigilant while in use. Tesla’s customers often ignore the company’s warnings and misuse Autopilot to record themselves performing dangerous stunts. This type of rule-breaking is to be expected, especially in a society where clout-chasing has become a way of life for many people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWTeF3"&gt;Green says it’s a communications and a technology challenge for Volvo to ensure its customers know when they need to take over and when they are misusing the system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VpogGf"&gt;“It needs to be clear in the communication to the consumer,” he said. “It needs to be clear inside the vehicle while you are operating it. So a very important area.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IphrQp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s new Zephyr Pro mask has the voice amp feature we wanted all along</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Zephyr Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uJoAC5-NhfhVniYY_Nbkt2TWahI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70350952/zephyrprofronthero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Zephyr Pro features two speaker grilles near the bottom replaceable filter, along with a voice amp button near one of its intakes.&lt;/em&gt; | Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0VKT0j"&gt;In case you were disappointed that Razer axed the voice amp feature from its Zephyr mask that promised to amplify your voice through speakers, don’t worry. Razer plans to upsell you on its Zephyr Pro mask that has been announced at CES 2022. While it looks virtually identical to the Zephyr, it has two speaker grilles that flank its bottom, replaceable filter. Also, one of the Chroma RGB-lined intakes features a new button that can turn voice amplification on or off. Razer says that the feature can pipe out your voice at 60 decibels at a range of one meter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C9tzEL"&gt;The Zephyr Pro will cost $149.99 when it releases sometime in 2022, compared to the $99.99 starting price for the standard Zephyr mask. You’ll someday be able to purchase a starter pack that includes the Zephyr Pro and 99 days’ worth of N95-grade filters for $199.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g9aiL4"&gt;The voice amp was a feature that Razer initially intended to include in the Zephyr mask at CES 2021 when it was referred to as Project Hazel. Once it jumped from concept to an actual product, though, Razer removed it due to weight and battery concerns. Yet, Razer says that the Zephyr Pro may have a similar weight and battery life to the regular Zephyr.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Zephyr Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L_d_r3Q0yUnVPyw7kkQT5yHqghU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23132599/zephyrproside.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ikfRcv"&gt;Razer told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that with its pre-production units of the Zephyr Pro, it’s targeting the same 206.1-gram weight of the Zephyr. To achieve that, Will Powers, Razer’s US PR lead says “the reduction in mass from the laser milling of the speaker grills should almost cancel out the addition of weight from voice amplification microphone and speakers.” As for battery life, Razer says that it’s aiming for the same five- to six-hour battery life target of the original with fans on, but only if you get in the habit of turning on the voice amp feature when you’re conversing, then shut it off when you’re done talking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F8VWf4"&gt;It might seem like Razer deserves some credit for achieving what it didn’t think was possible a year ago. But I won’t try to hide my disappointment here. Razer, like many companies, tends to follow up its standard-tier products with a “Pro” version that has more features and a higher price. Taking that route is excusable and almost expected for consumer products, but it’s the wrong move for a mask which people may opt to buy to feel a little more safe during a pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Zephyr" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EVZVCCv2KuHAbJGZEwqOaDxw6kE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22942600/zephyrfilter.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Zephyr utilizes three N95-grade filters (one at each intake, and one near the bottom of the mask) that can last up to three days each.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BexEJv"&gt;And yet, I’m glad that Razer is, at least, committed to delivering fully on the concept that it unveiled in January 2021. Many people will benefit from a mask that can amplify your voice, if they’re willing to accept that the Zephyr will definitely make you stick out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r2clFn"&gt;My colleague Nicole Wetsman and I spoke with Razer about the Zephyr at our On The Verge event in October 2021. You can watch that panel below.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android will finally get AirPod-style auto-switching in 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Fast Pairing Bluetooth headphones on Google TV" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/umyDPy7blt35oOjRW4AwHud_rno=/0x0:1080x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70350972/2a._Fast_Pair_Android_TV_OS.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fast Pairing Bluetooth headphones on Google TV&lt;/em&gt; | Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M6Yqnz"&gt;Google plans to spend the next few months beefing up the Bluetooth headphone capabilities on Android phones. It plans to update its Fast Pair technology to include features that iPhone and AirPod users have long enjoyed. With supported headphones (which presumably are forthcoming in 2022 but have not yet been announced), audio sources including Android phones, Chromebooks, Android TV, and select Windows PCs will be auto-switching. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EIU1ln"&gt;Google will also begin supporting full head tracking for spatial audio on Android, adapting sound based on your head movements. It already supports basic spatial audio for a few music services right now. Unfortunately, that’s all the detail the company is providing on spatial audio right now — which means details ranging from supported music streaming services, supported headphones, and supported versions of Android are still unknown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nrmUXZ"&gt;Auto-switching and spatial audio are just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22628933"&gt;two of many Fast Pair features set to arrive&lt;/a&gt; “in the coming months” and, in a few cases, “in the coming weeks.” Fast Pair is Google’s system for more seamlessly pairing Bluetooth devices together, using a little pop-up window instead of requiring users to go spelunking in the system settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l0mnAb"&gt;As with Apple’s system, it’s also meant to pair your headphones to multiple devices attached to your account. Unlike Apple’s system, Google’s Fast Pair feature set is still unfinished and a little confounding. In both cases, however, the core idea is to build a system on top of regular Bluetooth to make it easier for users to manage their devices — and perhaps to create a little lock-in as a result. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LXXdtX"&gt;Samsung has a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22627099/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-apple-airpods-pro-ecosystem-lock-in-features-companion-app"&gt;lock-in ecosystem of its own with Samsung devices and Samsung headphones&lt;/a&gt;, supporting some of the features that Google is hoping to roll out more generally this year. Google’s Fast Pair, however, are open to more manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Auto-switching Bluetooth headphones from an Android tablet to an Android phone when a call comes in" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kF46maEmrvg38Yi4oR1qBvcpSCs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23141721/auto_switch.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Auto-switching Bluetooth headphones from an Android tablet to an Android phone when a call comes in&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="173hSB"&gt;Alongside those two marquee Fast Pair features, a smattering of others are coming in 2022. Google will enable Fast Pairing on Google TV and “other Android TV OS” devices as well as Chromebooks. More interestingly, Google is partnering with Acer and HP to begin bringing some of its Fast Pair technologies to Windows PCs, as well as bringing support for Nearby Share and text message sync.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="euxKym"&gt;These audio features are part of Google’s larger set of CES 2022 announcements — all of which are also set to arrive sometime in 2022. Google’s “Better Together” branding is extending to include text message sync for any app with Chromebooks, using the Fast Pair UI to set up smart home gadgets, building Chromecast into Bose speakers and soundbars, and even unlocking Android phones with Wear OS 3 smartwatches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t187N4"&gt;In all, these announcements are Google’s attempt to bring Android users many of the ecosystem benefits that Apple users enjoy. But since it’s Google and Android, expect the rollout to take some time and be a little haphazard. Google does say that many of these features won’t require a full Android OS update, at least. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google will spend 2022 trying to match Apple’s ecosystem integrations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2eAkiySsvHkOmRJJ0Gtwb9rKXk0=/124x0:1477x902/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70350951/0a._Multi_device_experiences_2.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="11sJp9"&gt;Google is announcing no fewer than 13 different new software features at CES 2022, ranging from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22627791"&gt;AirPods-like fast switching&lt;/a&gt; to promised software that will mirror your Android text apps on a Chromebook. It’s part of an initiative that Google calls “Better Together” but that the rest of the industry is more likely to refer to as “catching up to Apple’s ecosystem.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3GdwQE"&gt;The biggest updates come to Google’s “Fast Pair” framework, an Android UI designed to make pairing Bluetooth headphones easier. This year, Google will extend it to support auto-switching between devices, faster pairing to Android TV and Google TV, and more. It will also adopt the Fast Pair framework for installing new smart home devices using the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22787729/matter-smart-home-standard-apple-amazon-google"&gt;upcoming Matter standard&lt;/a&gt;, which should mean that getting a new smart lightbulb or door lock going will be a lot easier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WypZZA"&gt;Google will also enable smartwatches running Wear OS 3 to unlock paired Android phones or Chromebooks, much in the same way an Apple Watch can unlock an iPhone. That feature will arrive “in the coming months,” and hopefully, there will be more Wear OS 3 watches available when it launches. Right now, the only major smartwatch running the new OS is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22629459/galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-bixby-google-wearos"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 4&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Wear OS 3 will have on-wrist detection, so if the watch is unlocked it can be used to unlock an Android phone." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_7PfMES9xyZy9pFVLXpJwZbi540=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142173/3._Wear_OS_unlock_Android.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wear OS 3 will have on-wrist detection, so if the watch is unlocked, it can be used to unlock an Android phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QVahyK"&gt;All of the features Google is announcing today are planned to arrive later this year, in timespans ranging from “in the coming weeks” to “in the coming months” to “later this year.” They will hit Android phones via software updates (that may not require full OS updates), Chromebooks, Android TV, Bluetooth headphones, and even some Windows laptops from Acer and HP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O4F9cS"&gt;That last detail may turn out to be one of the more important announcements from Google: HP, Acer, and Intel are partnering with Google to support some of its Better Together features on their laptops. Users will be able to use Fast Pair, sync text messages, and use Android’s Nearby Share feature to share files to their upcoming Windows PCs. Alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22827037/google-android-games-windows-pc-google-play-games"&gt;Google’s announced plans to bring Google Play games to Windows&lt;/a&gt;, it’s another sign that the company won’t cede Android integrations on Windows entirely to Microsoft’s software and partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OPY9Sz"&gt;The Windows integrations are notable, but there are, of course, more planned features for Chromebooks beyond Fast Pair. Google says it will create a system so that any messaging app on your phone can be mirrored on a Chromebook, allowing users to directly use their messaging apps. It will also add a feature called “Camera Roll on Phone Hub” that will make it easier to move photos from your phone to your Chromebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jwtE0Z"&gt;Chromebooks will also be getting a new setup flow if you have an Android phone — pair them during setup, and some settings and account information will be transferred over automatically. They’ll also be unlockable via Wear OS watches.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android will use Google’s Fast Pair UI to speed up smart home gadget setup." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6PZM9swNyJ5ajt1I9KyC0hRnUz0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142231/2._Fast_Pair_Matter_enabled_devices.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android will use Google’s Fast Pair UI to speed up smart home gadget setup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3ebqLJ"&gt;Finally, there are a few smaller announcements. On the audio side, Bose speakers and soundbars will begin supporting Chromecast in the coming weeks, and spatial audio with head tracking is coming for Android. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="38ukOv"&gt;Google is also still working on adding support for unlocking cars via UWB (currently available on Samsung phones and the Pixel 6 Pro), and as always with these car locking announcements, the first partner will be BMW. Volvo, which uses Android Auto as its native system for running the dashboard computer, will integrate with the Google Assistant so you can use your smart speaker for functions like remote start. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XF8iQG"&gt;Stepping back and looking at the features as a whole, it’s difficult not to draw nearly one-to-one parallels to Apple ecosystem features. Headphones are extending Bluetooth to support auto-switching and head-tracking spatial audio, just like AirPods. iPhone users with Mac have long had their default texting experience fully synced. Nearby Share is very similar to AirDrop. Unlocking with a smartwatch is also a big Apple ecosystem benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1SYCrc"&gt;Normally at CES, Google has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/11/16880594/ces-2018-google-exhibit-booth-tour-photo-essay"&gt;emphasized the power of the Google Assistant&lt;/a&gt;. This year, it’s hoping to get you to believe that Android can work better with your other devices. The challenge for Google is to actually get lots of different devices and manufacturers to support all of these features. That will be no easy task — and it’s likely one of the main reasons there are no firm dates or even specific hardware products attached to any of these announcements.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Motorola MA1 is a dongle for wireless Android Auto</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-cz6igtBNuvsgb4FICvWPNPnmTI=/0x80:1584x1136/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70350953/Screen_Shot_2022_01_03_at_10.21.21.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: SGW Global&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MlvxYC"&gt;If you’re a fan of Android Auto but hate having to plug in your phone, the &lt;a href="https://www.motorolasound.com/audio-products/android-auto/ma1"&gt;Motorola MA1&lt;/a&gt; could be worth a look — it’s a USB dongle that turns your wired Android Auto-equipped car into one that can connect to your phone wirelessly. The MA1, which is available for $90 starting today, pairs with your phone using Bluetooth and then transmits data over 5Ghz Wi-Fi. Given that &lt;a href="https://www.cars.com/articles/wireless-apple-carplay-and-android-auto-where-are-they-now-407297/"&gt;only a few cars support wireless Android Auto from the factory&lt;/a&gt; (especially compared to the ones &lt;a href="https://www.android.com/auto/compatibility/"&gt;that support the wired version&lt;/a&gt;), this gadget could make for a relatively easy and inexpensive upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3OzrD"&gt;Of course, wireless Android Auto does have its drawbacks — since it’s not plugged in, your phone won’t be charging as you navigate with maps or listen to music using your car’s screen. While that may not be ideal for road trips, the convenience factor that comes with the MA1’s automatic pairing is hard to argue with for everyday errands and commutes. It’s designed to look a bit like a Chromecast, so it shouldn’t be too obtrusive, even if your USB ports aren’t hidden away in a center console. It also comes with a sticky mounting pad if you don’t want it rattling around.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P5JRSeOFFAV0j5SrzBY7IA9ezk8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142563/Screen_Shot_2022_01_03_at_11.44.12.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: SGW Global&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s not a huge device that’ll take up all the room meant for sunglasses or receipts. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VaXcAM"&gt;It’s worth noting that the company behind this product isn’t actually the Motorola that made any permutations of the Razr flip phone or your old dial-up modem. Instead, the MA1 is from SGW Global, also known as Meizhou Guo Wei Electronics Co., Ltd, which describes itself as a “Motorola Strategic Brand Partner.” Basically, it’s a company that licenses the Motorola name. (Though the MA1 would be interesting regardless of the name slapped on it.) There aren’t a ton of options for turning your wired Android Auto head unit into a wireless one, so the MA1 could be a nifty gadget for Android users — if it’s good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8LhXRW"&gt;SGW Global says that you’ll be able to use the MA1 with phones running Android 11 or higher and that your phone will have to have an active data plan. And, obviously, your car or aftermarket head unit will still have to support wired Android Auto. Still, if you want to upgrade your car with wireless Android Auto, this could be a good way to do it. Though we won’t know for sure until we get to check it out and put it through its paces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UuAiaV"&gt;PS: If you, like me, thought, “Wait, Android 11 and up? I heard Google was getting rid of Android Auto with Android 12,” never fear. While it is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22633755/google-android-auto-for-phone-screens-shutting-down-android-12-google-assistant-driving-mode"&gt;replacing the version that runs on your phone screen with Google Assistant driving mode&lt;/a&gt;, the company says the experience will be the same if you’re using it on your car’s screen.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s Project Sophia concept turns your desk into a modular computer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g7fjL_YACqJlLKHB8dbmnv79GgI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70350955/Project_Sophia_Key_Visual_08.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zXZvLD"&gt;Razer is no stranger to wild CES prototypes, and CES 2022 is no exception: the company revealed its new Project Sophia concept, which aims to build an entire modular desktop computer into a desk that looks like a &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; LCARS console come to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gz2kOF"&gt;Razer has had modular computer aspirations before. There was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/7/5285130/razer-reveals-project-christine-the-concept-gaming-pc-even-a-toddler"&gt;2014’s Project Christine&lt;/a&gt;, a precursor to Project Sophia that imagined a desktop tower that was built out of easily swappable Jenga-like bricks. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21054602/razer-tomahawk-desktop-gaming-pc-intel-nuc-element-design-specs-ces-2020"&gt;2020’s Tomahawk&lt;/a&gt; took a more practical approach to that concept, based on Intel’s Element NUC designs. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fx57jvDsijRwki0AwUVfx4W14ks=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23147397/Project_Sophia_Key_Visual_02.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="31OTcX"&gt;But Project Sophia feels like Razer’s conceptual tendencies turned to 11. The desk is designed to feature 13 different swappable module slots, where users can add in a wide array of different pieces: temperature readouts, touchscreen application launchers, dedicated chat and calendar displays, wireless Qi chargers, a mug heater, pen tablets, audio mixers, CPU and GPU monitors, and more. Razer imagines that the modular nature of its computer desk would allow users to customize it to their specific needs and use cases. A streamer, for example, would be able to easily snap on more powerful speakers, microphones, and cameras for streaming, with extra displays to monitor their followers chatting, while a video editor could add sound mixing and editing modules for focusing on work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="234Nof"&gt;As for the actual “PC” part, Razer’s concept imagines that built into the desk, too, in a custom-built, magnetically attacked chassis that can be easily removed so that users can swap out parts when they get a new CPU or GPU. The whole thing is attached to a massive OLED panel (either 65-inch or 77-inch) to display your games in the best possible quality. And of course, there’s plenty of Razer’s RGB Chroma lighting — it’s still a gaming PC, after all, even if it looks like a desk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fT7v5H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10962881"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T9VYX9"&gt;Of course, Razer’s history of flashy CES prototypes has typically been just that: a series of fanciful, one-off projects shown off annually as an example of the potential of future gaming PCs or accessories which almost never turn into real products. And looking at the flashy Project Sophia renders, it’s hard to imagine any other fate for the idea than Razer’s product graveyard alongside previous showcases like 2014’s modular Project Christine, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/ces/2017/1/5/14112686/razer-project-valerie-multi-monitor-gaming-laptop-concept"&gt;2017’s triple-screened Project Valerie&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/1/9/16866206/razer-project-linda-phone-laptop-dock-touchpad-prototype-android-concept-ces-2018"&gt;2018’s phone-docking Project Linda&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2nJgBF"&gt;Modular computing devices are hard. Even the fairly standardized world of ordinary PC building is rife with different specs for SSDs, motherboard sockets, and RAM. &lt;em&gt;Proprietary&lt;/em&gt; systems are even harder — remember &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/2/12775922/google-project-ara-modular-phone-suspended-confirm"&gt;Google’s ill-fated modular Ara smartphone project&lt;/a&gt;? The only way something like Project Sophia would exist is if Razer is willing to build all the modules and accessories itself. And even if it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; willing to do that, it’s hard to imagine that the cost would be anything less than astronomical, especially when compared to the perfectly functional alternative of “buying normal accessories and having them sit on a normal desk.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rr76jl"&gt;Still, as is the case with most of Razer’s CES concepts, it’s still cool to see that the company is willing to explore fanciful ideas like the futuristic Project Sophia desk. Even in the likely case that the computer-desk concept never sees the commercial light of day, it shows that Razer is still willing to think outside the box when it comes to new designs and ideas. And who knows? Maybe the future of computing really is built into a desk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qN9dti"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s Enki Pro HyperSense can jig to the beat of your games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="EMB 1/5 1pm et" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b4LSfury2lZ5CDFLi3vK0p4j99g=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70350990/enkiprohypersense3.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;EMB 1/5 1pm et | Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jGvwpu"&gt;Razer’s lineup of gaming chairs is expanding into new territory with the Enki Pro HyperSense, a chair that can vibrate and wobble to the action happening in your games and movies. This model houses a haptic engine near the wheels that should deliver jolts of haptic feedback through the chair. Additionally, the Enki Pro HyperSense should tilt backward or lift you vertically by 1.5 inches with around 1G of force. It’s all done with up to a 5ms response time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKETWY"&gt;If this sounds familiar, what Razer’s going for is similar to &lt;a href="https://www.d-box.com/en/products/movie-theater/"&gt;D-Box’s movie theater seats&lt;/a&gt; that can rumble and move. In fact, Razer collaborated with D-Box to incorporate the haptics and movements into the Enki Pro HyperSense. Razer’s seems to differ in one key way: it’s on wheels. The Enki Pro HyperSense is still very much a computer chair but with some extra features, to put it lightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mqm0xE"&gt;The big question with this chair is compatibility, which is a funny sentence to write. Razer says that over 2,200 games, movies, and music tracks offer native support. That seems like a lot, but in terms of games, Razer only shared &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;, and&lt;em&gt; F1 2021&lt;/em&gt; as a couple of examples that will work. As it turns out, Razer’s mostly quoting games that are listed on &lt;a href="https://catalogue.d-box.com/en/video-games/"&gt;D-Box’s page of compatible games&lt;/a&gt;. If Razer is leaving it up to D-Box, adding support for more games might be out of its control.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Enki Pro HyperSense" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tVPiGq3qyNCldhxDxlQUgzKx5mU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23147049/enkiprohypersense2pic.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A look at the haptics engine inside of the Enki Pro HyperSense. What’s not shown are the wires you’ll need to power it and connect to your PC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JS9pkz"&gt;To that end, it’s unclear whether Razer will ask owners of the Enki Pro HyperSense to download &lt;a href="https://www.d-box.com/en/software-downloads"&gt;D-Box’s Game Center software&lt;/a&gt;, which can add specific motion codes to supported games to make them work with D-Box chairs or if it’s incorporating these features into its Synapse PC software. We’ve reached out for clarification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G6YpLX"&gt;The somewhat good news for PC gamers, though, is that the Enki Pro HyperSense can at least guarantee haptic feedback and movement via Direct Input haptics, “where controller, keyboard and mouse inputs will generate physical feedback when used.” The video demo that we saw showed the chair tilting forward while pressing the W key, to the left with the A key, and back with the S key. Seems fun, though potentially less immersive than having the chair responding to, say, explosions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1AS8Gj"&gt;This chair was announced alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22629603"&gt;Project Sophia&lt;/a&gt;, Razer’s CES 2022 concept that envisions a gaming desk that has a PC built into it, complete with a big screen attached to it. Razer didn’t share a price for the Enki Pro HyperSense as a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it’s technically still a concept product, but compared to Project Sophia, it sure seems a &lt;em&gt;lot &lt;/em&gt;more real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfhoAy"&gt;Razer isn’t the only gaming computer with skin in the vibrating chair game, though. Cooler Master teased a D-Box collaboration a few months back, but it’s yet to do a full reveal as Razer has at CES 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Some Volvos will get a YouTube app and Google Assistant-controlled AC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bTGf0-0q-53-YoIfewl_eCkcrog=/0x0:2500x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70350962/YouTube_in_Volvo_C40_Recharge.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not that a vertical screen is the best for YouTube.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Eu3axt"&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/android/ces2022-androidforcars/"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; that cars with its services built-in will be getting the ability to play YouTube videos while parked later this year, starting with Volvo. For those with a V90, XC40 Recharge, or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.volvocars.com%2Fintl%2Fv%2Fconnectivity%2Finfotainment-page&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F5%2F22868608%2Fvolvo-google-android-automotive-climate-control-youtube-lyft" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;other supported cars&lt;/a&gt;, this should make waiting in a parking lot more bearable since you’ll be able to see videos on your car’s built-in screen, which is probably going to be slightly larger and more ergonomic than a phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VAoF0u"&gt;Google also seems to leave the door open for other video apps as well, so it’s possible other developers could let you access their content from your car’s infotainment system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oY5XFb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Hey Google, warm up my car.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WA85eR"&gt;You’ll also be able to control some Volvo cars using Google Assistant from outside the car — in a video embedded in its blog, Google shows the example of someone using a Nest Audio to turn on their car’s heat without having to brave the snow outside. The blog also says the Assistant will be able to lock or unlock the car and tell you its battery status. While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/7/17325550/android-auto-volvo-maps-assistant-google-io-2018"&gt;some Volvos have had in-car control with Assistant&lt;/a&gt; for a while, it’s nice to get some functionality that won’t require you to make the journey out to the garage or parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="287nc1"&gt;Google says it’s also expanding what you’ll be able to do with your voice inside the car as well — this spring, Volvos with Android Automotive will let you access things like lane-keeping assist and service information with the Assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6h4eAM"&gt;Google details more car-related features coming in its blog post. It says that later this year, its digital car key feature will be coming to “even more Android phones and vehicles” (it’s currently only supported on Pixel 6 and Galaxy S21 handsets). Google also says that the unlock feature will get support for Ultra Wideband later this year, so people won’t have to take their phones out and tap them to their car to unlock with NFC.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kuF03U2yFmX63N5UTZfP2aNJDI4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23147389/Lyft_Driver_app_in_Android_Auto.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google says its partnered with Lyft to add Android Auto support for its driver-focused app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pYvAvt"&gt;Finally, Lyft and Kakao Mobility will be adding Android Auto support to their driver apps, which should let people working for these rideshare apps choose which riders to pick up from their car’s touchscreen.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s new app will put Chroma RGB throughout your home</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This 2018 image for Philips Hue coming to Razer Synapse is so much better than the assets Razer provided for this story.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Philips&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tb98zZ"&gt;Most of Razer’s products live in the entertainment center, or near the PC, but it wants to expand its reach to every corner of your home — or at least, everywhere you use smart lights. At CES 2022, the company announced that it intends to launch a Razer Smart Home app for mobile, which it says is a “simple, yet powerful tool that puts complete, unified control into the user’s hands.” With it, Razer plans to make it easier to set up, customize, and sync all of your lights, regardless of the manufacturer. It plans to share more details &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fchroma&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at this link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kJ6C7j"&gt;Razer has been toying with this idea of tapping into other smart lights before. Currently, gamers who have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/1/8/16866430/razer-chroma-philips-hue-smart-light-sync-partnership-ces-2018"&gt;Razer’s Synapse PC software can sync a Philips Hue Bridge&lt;/a&gt; (and the lights connected to it) to mimic the same lighting settings as the LEDs packed into countless Razer gaming peripherals. But a mobile app, in theory, seems like an easier way to quickly broaden its partners since many lights support both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hSm5ba"&gt;Razer’s using the CES 2022 stage to send an open invite to any company that’s interested in joining its Razer Chrome Smart Home Program. Brands like Nanoleaf, LIFX, Yeelight, Monster, and Twinkly are already in the fold, and Razer says it has more partners coming soon (hopefully Signify’s Philips Hue).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="p1y6No"&gt;Razer shared a lone screenshot of what its smart home app will look like, showing a simple layout that seems to make it easy to switch lights on and off in rooms, as well as change their color. Razer’s app will offer customizable routines, too. The company hasn’t shared what the setup process for each light will look like or what other settings there are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KfvFp8"&gt;There are other crucial details that Razer hasn’t touched on, like whether it intends to branch out beyond lights and into other smart home categories. We also don’t know if its app can handle necessary firmware updates for various smart lights, or if you’ll still need each of your smart bulbs’ original apps installed to handle that. It also hasn’t shared whether the app will be free to use — and remain free to use — and if it intends to allow any automation beyond scheduling routines. We’ve reached out to Razer for clarification on these details.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The makers of MapleStory invest $400 million in a Russo brothers-founded company to expand to film and TV</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nexon wants to expand its game franchises to film and TV.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nexon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GWJ2lz"&gt;Nexon, which develops the popular MMORPG &lt;em&gt;MapleStory&lt;/em&gt;, wants to bring its gaming franchises to film and TV, and it’s investing nearly half a billion dollars — and the potential for more — to do so. The company announced Wednesday that it’s making a minority investment of $400 million in AGBO, a company founded by &lt;em&gt;Avengers&lt;/em&gt; co-directors Anthony and Joe Russo and producer Mike Larocca, and says it will invest up to an additional $100 million in the first half of this year “if requested by AGBO.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="erbmYX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220105005669/en/Games-Pioneer-Nexon-Makes-Significant-Minority-Investment-in-Russo-Brothers%E2%80%99-AGBO-to-Drive-Expansion-of-Nexon%E2%80%99s-Global-Intellectual-Property-in-Film-and-Television/"&gt;According to a press release&lt;/a&gt;, “the agreement is intended to accelerate the global expansion of Nexon’s existing and new franchise intellectual property (IP) in film and television and to further support AGBO’s development, production, and ownership of tent pole-led entertainment universes appealing to worldwide audiences, including via games and Virtual World experiences.” It’s unclear at the moment what any of that will look like in reality or which franchises might be first to get some sort of adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nfqImC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More gaming franchises are making the jump to film and TV&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O3yrTh"&gt;Nexon signaled it was serious about bringing its games to other mediums in July when it launched &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210715005819/en/Global-Entertainment-Veteran-Nick-van-Dyk-Joins-Nexon-as-Chief-Strategy-Officer-And-President-of-Nexon-Film-Television"&gt;a film and television division&lt;/a&gt; headed up by Nick van Dyk, who led Activision Blizzard’s film and TV arm from 2014 to 2019 and worked at Disney for 10 years. van Dyk and a Nexon SVP will join AGBO’s board of directors as part of the deal, and Nexon’s investment means it will own at least 38 percent of AGBO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kL3pSX"&gt;In recent years, many game franchises have made the jump to movies and TV shows; Netflix has seen big success with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22826460/witcher-season-2-review-netflix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; series and the &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;-based show &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22763818/netflix-league-of-legends-arcane-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and this year, we have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867861/uncharted-movie-tom-holland-plane-fight-scene"&gt;Sony’s &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; movie&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690607/chris-pratt-mario-nintendo-illumination-animated-movie-december-2022-release-date-cast"&gt;Chris Pratt-led Mario movie&lt;/a&gt; to look forward to. With Nexon’s huge investment in AGBO, perhaps we’ll see an adaptation of &lt;em&gt;MapleStory&lt;/em&gt; in the future, too.&lt;/p&gt;
