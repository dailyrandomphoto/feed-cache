    <title>The new Moto G Pure is a $159.99 4G phone with a MediaTek chip</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DQFr149R1ALHaMj-uBuZw-WzQLU=/0x71:3508x2410/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69963420/moto_g_pure_key_visual_horizontal.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto G Pure (2021) is a 4G phone that shares many of the same specs as the Moto G Play, but is $10 cheaper.&lt;/em&gt; | Motorola&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p3mI5W"&gt;Just in time for the holiday shopping season, Motorola is squeezing in one more budget-friendly phone into its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218732/motorola-moto-g-stylus-power-play-2021-one-5g-ace-specs-price-release-date-budget"&gt;2021 Moto G lineup&lt;/a&gt; — the Moto G Pure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o1SsMd"&gt;At $159.99, the Moto G Pure is the least expensive member of Motorola’s lineup, with the already-released Moto G Play only costing about $10 more at $169 (before discounts). Both the Moto G Power and the G Stylus, on the other hand, cost significantly more at $199 and $299, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2aWltE"&gt;The biggest difference between the Moto G Pure and the G Play is in their processors. The G Pure uses the MediaTek Helio G25, while the G Play uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon 460 chip from 2020. Based on processor comparison data from &lt;a href="http://Nanoreview.net"&gt;Nanoreview.net&lt;/a&gt;, the Snapdragon 460 is the faster and more energy-efficient octa-core processor of the two. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22408041/motorola-moto-g-play-2021-review-price-screen-specs"&gt;our review of the Qualcomm-powered Moto G Play&lt;/a&gt; already noted how under-powered that phone felt, so keep your expectations low for the MediaTek chip’s performance on the Moto G Pure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4kchl5"&gt;Like its more expensive sibling, the Moto G Pure also has 3GB RAM to support its processor, 32GB of internal storage that is expandable with a microSD card, and a 6.5-inch display at 720p that is a bit low-resolution for 2021. Other features that are unique to the G Pure: it is water repellent against light rain (IP52) and has a 4000mAh battery that Motorola claims can last up to two days, depending on use. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CMjnMKFDa1Iz8O2aVFG1g5Uj8gg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22904847/moto_g_pure_deep_indigo_combo.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Motorola&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto G Pure is water repellent (IP52), has an audio jack, as well as a radio antenna.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EyntJS"&gt;The G Pure’s camera system is similar to the G Play’s, but its 13-megapixel main camera has a slightly smaller f/2.2 aperture. There’s also a 2-megapixel depth sensor and a 5-megapixel front camera. Since Motorola is known for its fun photo software and smart AI, you can experiment with photography features like Spot Color, Auto Smile Capture, and Smart Compose on this phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TzYygv"&gt;The Moto G Pure is compatible with all the North American 4G LTE bands — from Verizon to Telus, but it doesn’t support any 5G networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rK2ZN2"&gt;If you want to get your hands on this Moto G Pure as soon as possible, you’ll need to pre-order the unlocked version on October 14th, which retails for $159.99. It’ll be available from Best Buy, Walmart, B&amp;amp;H Photo, Amazon and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2FMotorola.com&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F7%2F22709569%2Fmotorola-moto-g-pure-mediatek-4g-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Motorola.com&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X9PgEp"&gt;If you’re looking for carrier deals, Verizon will be offering this phone for “free” when you sign up for a new line with a 24–30-month payment plan (for $149.99 in value), starting October 14th. Metro by T-Mobile will also be offering a similar deal in the near future, but no timeline has been shared. Otherwise, you’ll need to hang tight for this phone to land in other carriers in both countries — within the next few months, according to the press release.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Surface Go 3 review: left behind</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The tradeoffs aren’t worth it anymore&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="fnJwjb"&gt;From what I can tell, Microsoft intends the Surface Go 3 to be sold to two kinds of customers: kids and IT professionals who need a tiny computer when they’re out in the field. I’m in the third category of potential customers: people who love tiny computers. For all three groups, the Surface Go 3 is a bummer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xKSISD"&gt;The Surface Go 3 is Microsoft’s smaller-sized Surface tablet. It has a 10.5-inch screen and one fewer port than its larger Pro sibling, but otherwise looks very much the same. That means it offers the same excellent build quality and overall premium design as full-sized Surface tablets. It is a great-looking device that’s often a pleasure to use — so long as you don’t use it to do too much or need it to last very long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="rWMkMz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Microsoft Surface Pro 8 review: the best of both worlds","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22709876/microsoft-surface-pro-8-review"},{"title":"Windows 11 review: a familiar home that’s still being renovated","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22708762/microsoft-windows-11-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="ELh3V1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10794418"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xid7aw"&gt;Once upon a time, if you could only spend a limited amount of money on a computer, you had to accept that it would be slow. Those times are behind us: you can get a Chromebook, an iPad, and even some Windows laptops for under $500 that will run circles around the Surface Go 3, even the higher-spec model that I’m testing with a Core i3 processor that costs $759.98 with the fancier Alcantara Type Cover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Pydw2"&gt;The Go 3 starts at $399.99 with a Y-series processor and a paltry 64GB of slower eMMC storage and 4GB of RAM. I can’t imagine anybody using that edition for anything more than light web browsing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Go 3 looks just like a tiny Surface Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3eNuDizdu8B0rm7vCqr7Pp1U4_4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22892211/vpavic_210930_4784_0028_Edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Go 3 looks just like a tiny Surface Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It works with Surface Pens, but doesn’t support the haptics on the newer pen" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T96SRgguUiRzqavdmlo8Q08ZTc0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22892219/vpavic_210930_4784_0073.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It works with Surface Pens but not haptics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MrarTl"&gt;I’ve always said the Surface Go is a fine little computer if you understand its limitations and are willing to work within them. But by the third generation, you’d think Microsoft would have found a way to either remove more of those limits or provide better tradeoffs for them. Unfortunately, neither of those things have happened this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eddVqV"&gt;The long and (especially) short of this review is simply this: four and a half hours. That’s the longest I was able to keep the Surface Go 3 running in active use. One of the apps I was running was power hungry (that’d be Slack), but the only other app was the Edge browser with somewhere around a dozen tabs. That’s it. When I took the Go 3 outside and needed to crank the brightness up, that battery life dropped to three. I’m not sure where Microsoft gets its 11-hour estimate, but it’s far from reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uVN2XM"&gt;If the battery life were better, my old advice about working within this computer’s limitations would still apply. It has Windows 11 by default — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708762/microsoft-windows-11-review"&gt;read Tom Warren’s full review here&lt;/a&gt; — and though the edges are rough, the interface overall feels really nice and usable on this smaller, 10.5-inch touchscreen. Snap Assist for tiling windows is especially useful with this smaller screen, since it’s harder to get windows to the arrangement I’m used to on bigger displays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b9kYF0"&gt;Windows 11 has an advantage over iPadOS in that it actually supports multiple users. And compared to ChromeOS, it can run many more useful apps (though not yet Android apps). But it’s possible to get all those Windows benefits without making all the compromises the Go 3 demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Windows 11 works nicely on the Go 3, albeit not quickly." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZM393CtPANRxBK8TApD_TjnNcMM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22892215/vpavic_210930_4784_0054.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 11 works nicely on the Go 3, albeit not quickly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The keyboard cover isn’t sturdy enough." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8wmX4kKzxK8F_ymO2REGNqWiaVg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22892210/vpavic_210930_4784_0023.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The keyboard cover isn’t sturdy enough.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Eo86RS"&gt;The overall physical design is unchanged — a bummer since the Surface Pro 8 got such a big update this year. It still works with the older Surface Pen design if you have one of those, but it doesn’t support haptics from the newer pen. The Type Cover still has a nice keyboard but a flimsy keyboard deck. It’s so flimsy that I often accidentally click the mouse simply by resting my hands on the palm rests when it’s on my lap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="toYwTr"&gt;Perhaps the most baffling part of the Surface Go 3 is that it isn’t using an Arm-based processor, like the Surface Pro X. If it did, I have to imagine it would get the benefits of longer battery life without taking too much of a speed hit (even the Core i3 version can’t be described as “fast”). Perhaps those aforementioned IT pros wouldn’t be able to run the apps they need on Arm — or perhaps Microsoft simply didn’t want to spend the R&amp;amp;D budget necessary to redesign the Surface Go 3 around a new chip.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A tiny computer that’s still easy to love, but hard to use." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L6xWDV6M5K452V29Q9JYtbAQQy0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22892218/vpavic_210930_4784_0069.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A tiny computer that’s still easy to love but hard to use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JbHNDR"&gt;Last year, I said the Surface Go 2 was easy to love and hard to live with. And despite everything, there are times I really do love using the Surface Go 3. There is something wonderful about having such a tiny, light device that theoretically can do anything a bigger Windows computer can do — albeit more slowly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cwFiPb"&gt;Unless having a tiny Windows tablet is an absolute necessity, there are better options. If you don’t need Windows, ChromeOS and iPad devices can be this small and last longer on a charge. If you do need Windows, there are plenty of computers that are just slightly larger but offer way better value. In fact, at this price I’d recommend tracking down a used or refurbished Surface Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="EqLsUA"&gt;The Surface Go 3 is always a joy to carry and often a joy to use, but I wish I could use it for longer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="28o5Hw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10790097"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Pixel 6’s rumored 23W wireless charging stand and more details leak early</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iAEtmEQqo6bq6jnMSFekIe1fvTQ=/0x0:660x440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69963141/FBE7SLCXsAIyNeO.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Pixel 6 handset on its rumored wireless charging stand.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1446002228410658816" target="_blank"&gt;EVLeaks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rvgrvH"&gt;Leaked images of Google’s upcoming Pixel 6 have given us our best look yet at new features coming to the search giant’s next flagship smartphone. The images, which were leaked by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1446002191110639616"&gt;Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt;, reveal shots of a second generation Pixel Stand wireless charger, user interface details, and camera specs, and include a mention of face unlock biometric security. They’ve arrived a little under two weeks before the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are due to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22691850/google-pixel-6-event-2021-fall-announcement"&gt;officially announced on October 19th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LuaWIg"&gt;There’s not much in these pictures that hasn’t already leaked, but what they offer is a better look at the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro’s rumored features. The beefy new Pixel Stand, for example, is believed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22651097/google-pixel-6-pro-stand-23w-wireless-charging"&gt;support 23W fast charging&lt;/a&gt; according to an August leak, which is more than double what was offered by Google’s first-generation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/9/17941176/google-pixel-stand-wireless-charger-announcement-price-release-date"&gt;10w wireless charger introduced with the Pixel 3&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VcJ2np"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/wrmq5KfUPE"&gt;pic.twitter.com/wrmq5KfUPE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— E (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1446002208793845765?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U7kR5z"&gt;The wireless changing stand was previously reported to have a &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-dp3-hidden-features/#android12dp3wirelesschargingfan"&gt;built-in fan for cooling&lt;/a&gt;, and these images suggest you’ll be able to switch the wireless charger between “Performance mode” and “Quiet mode” depending on whether you prioritize a faster charge or silence. The photos also show the wireless charging interface with shortcuts to media playback and smart home controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k1BAS4"&gt;Less has been reported about the phones’ face unlock functionality, which appears in one image on a settings page titled “Security.” Google previously included face unlock on the Pixel 4, but the feature was entirely absent from the Pixel 5 lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="byDGJL"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/k52z1kuU2g"&gt;pic.twitter.com/k52z1kuU2g&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— E (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1446002222777737221?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qYxTpK"&gt;There’s also a shot of the rear of the Pixel 6 Pro, showing off its three-camera setup. Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml#:~:text=It%20has%20three,the%20telephoto%20camera."&gt;previously confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that the 6 Pro will have an ultrawide and a telephoto flanking the main camera, but this image confirms &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pixel-6-camera-features-revealed/"&gt;rumors&lt;/a&gt; that they’ll use 12-megapixel, 48-megapixel, and 50-megapixel sensors, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jR1DLD"&gt;Other shots include a look at the phone’s charging brick, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628702/google-pixel-6-charger-not-included"&gt;which won’t be included in the box&lt;/a&gt;, as well as photos of the phone splashed with water, suggesting it’ll have an IP-rating for dust and water resistance. The latter isn’t particularly surprising, since even Google’s mid-range &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;Pixel 5A&lt;/a&gt; includes an IP67 rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMz3Vm"&gt;The main feature the images aren’t able to offer any more details on is the Pixel 6’s&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676099/google-pixel-6-tensor-processor-rumor-arm-cortex-x1-core-mystery-strange"&gt; custom-designed Tensor processor&lt;/a&gt;, which Google says will improve the phones’ machine learning capabilities. For those details, we’ll have to wait until the Pixel 6’s official launch later this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B6EE9F"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Kinect is back, thanks to Sky’s new all-in-one TVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g4-csRzDFwuhaR6QYqSukNmFj9Y=/171x0:2010x1226/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69962968/skyglasscamera.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sky Glass camera looks like a Kinect.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sky&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TGUqX6"&gt;Sky is resurrecting the original dream of Microsoft’s Kinect accessory next year. The British satellite broadcaster &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714076/sky-glass-tv-streaming-service-uk-pricing-release-date"&gt;announced its new Sky Glass TVs&lt;/a&gt; this morning, and the company has built a separate 4K camera that includes motion controls and gestures support. It even works across games, and has a social TV sharing feature built in partnership with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ya2N3k"&gt;“Working with Microsoft we’re also building a fantastic feature that lets us watch TV together even if we’re miles apart,” explains Fraser Stirling, Sky’s chief product officer. “It syncs your TV with other households, with integrated video and chat on-screen, and you can choose content from the biggest channels — including Premier League matches, movies, and all your favorite entertainment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bIwPSf"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Sky Kinect|104260" data-volume-uuid="54ac06370" data-volume-id="104260" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-279" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="chorus"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sky’s new watch together feature is a partnership with Microsoft.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SPPVU5"&gt;The social TV feature is exactly what Microsoft tried and failed to do with its Kinect accessory in 2013. The Xbox One launched with Kinect, and the console included a HDMI-in port to access TV satellite providers like Sky and cable boxes. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/8/5075216/xbox-one-tv-microsofts-plan-to-take-over-the-living-room"&gt;Microsoft had some big plans for TV on Xbox&lt;/a&gt;, and even experimented with social features allowing Xbox owners to watch TV together. Ultimately, the Kinect bundling failed and the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/28/12049584/first-click-the-xbox-one-isnt-my-cord-cutting-dream-anymore"&gt;walked back all of its bold TV plans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IPkify"&gt;Sky’s watch together feature, built in partnership with Microsoft, will allow people to see each other’s reactions instantly. You can also pause, skip, and replay as you watch together. Where this camera gets really interesting is the motion controls and gesture support for gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v6wMIE"&gt;Games will be available on Sky Glass TVs that specifically support this new camera, including a Paw Patrol-branded title and &lt;em&gt;Fruit Ninja. &lt;/em&gt;The camera will enable multiplayer games, too. “Pick your opponent, either at home or another household and play through your body movement or gesture control,” says Stirling. “Family games are never going to be the same again.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AZWjzMPHBZfzaybIdyODPl16CKc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22907065/skyglasscamera.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sky&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sky Glass camera will support motion controls for games.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Fd1VMD"&gt;Sky is also investing heavily into voice controls on its Sky Glass TVs. “Hello, Sky” activates Sky’s voice commands, much like a digital assistant, and you’ll even be able to use it to switch HDMI ports by saying “Sky, Xbox” to switch to an Xbox console if you have one connected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r4HiTM"&gt;It all sounds and looks very much like Kinect. Microsoft dreamed big about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/8/5075216/xbox-one-tv-microsofts-plan-to-take-over-the-living-room"&gt;taking over the living room&lt;/a&gt; with smart cameras and voice controls, and now Sky is trying to keep that dream alive.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Anker’s new Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro earbuds support high-quality LDAC audio</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EJY-96XnjA31RFr171h-JJMWEfQ=/0x27:1399x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69962872/F85E02CD_CC42_4CC2_86EB_2FF0ADB218EC.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Anker&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bl6ETq"&gt;Anker’s Soundcore brand is today refreshing its flagship true wireless earbuds with the new $169.99 Liberty 3 Pros. Both the earbuds and their slider-style charging case look very similar to the Liberty 2 Pros, though the buds are 30 percent smaller and have an “air pressure relief structure” in their wingtips for added comfort. Anker has made more significant improvements to the features they offer: the new earbuds have active noise cancellation — you’d hope for as much at this price — and the “HearID ANC” system is optimized for efficiency and comfort. Anker says it monitors outside ambient noise while also taking in-ear pressure into account, so the level of ANC automatically adapts to the environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iGatIW"&gt;The dual-driver acoustic architecture of the Liberty 3 Pros has been refined, and these earbuds join Sony’s WF-1000XM4s in offering upgraded audio quality thanks to their support for the LDAC codec. There aren’t many wireless earbuds out there that offer LDAC (though aptX HD is more common), so hopefully, this will be the start of a trend. AAC and SBC codecs are also supported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTf8GG"&gt;The charging case charge features wireless charging, and Anker says the earbuds can hit up to six hours of continuous playback with ANC enabled or eight with it off. The case stores an additional 24 or 32 hours, respectively. Anker says its fast charge capabilities can give you three hours of playback if you plug in and charge the earbuds over USB-C for just 15 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="due9HN"&gt;Anker will offer the Liberty 3 Pros in four different colors: black, white, silver, gray, and purple. They’re rated IPX4 for water and sweat resistance and have three different transparency modes for when you do need some environmental awareness. You can order the new buds starting today. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22323748/anker-liberty-air-2-pro-review-wireless-headphone-price"&gt;Becca reviewed the Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Pros&lt;/a&gt;, which have a more AirPods-esque design and are priced at $130. As is often the case with Anker, they’re a very competitive product for the asking price. But with the Liberty 3 Pros priced a good bit higher, Anker will be facing off with plenty of worthy alternatives. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snap is taking action to address fentanyl dealing on Snapchat</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WuGqcuw-1OGdDzXHxYwHrIcFuGE=/0x0:911x607/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69962866/Heads_Up_Triptych___cropped.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Users will be directed to an educational portal if they search for certain keywords.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Snapchat&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gjFI6O"&gt;Snapchat has announced a series of measures it’s taking to counter drug dealing on its platform, and to educate users about the dangers of fentanyl and other drugs. When users search for drug-related keywords like “fentanyl,” Snap says it will direct them to a new educational portal called Heads Up. It’s also ramping up actions against drug dealers on its platform, including improved in-app reporting tools and proactive detection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cfb0Vq"&gt;The announcements follow a recent &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/pills-bought-on-snapchat-deadly/index.html"&gt;investigation by &lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; into a spate of deaths involving teens and young adults who were suspected of having bought fentanyl-laced drugs through the social network. The report alleged that drug dealers are able to use Snapchat to find buyers, and that the platform isn’t doing enough to remove their accounts and keep them off the platform. The social network was also accused of taking too long to provide information to law enforcement. However, Snap says the initiatives have been in development for months, and that today’s announcement would have happened regardless of the &lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt; report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kY0FoM"&gt;Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that’s complicit in an alarming increase in deaths in the United States in recent years. In 2019, nearly 50,000 people in the US are believed to have died from overdoses involving opioids, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/drug-topics/opioids/opioid-overdose-crisis"&gt;National Institute on Drug Abuse&lt;/a&gt;. According to Snap, drug dealers include fentanyl in counterfeit Vicodin or Xanax prescription pills, which are then bought by unwitting customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LJj34P"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A new Heads Up portal will direct users to educational content&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xMP1Sy"&gt;In its blog post, Snapchat stresses that it’s taking more enforcement action against dealers on its platform. It says that enforcement rates have more than doubled in the first half of 2021, and that its systems have proactively detected 260 percent more material than it did previously. It says that nearly two-thirds of drug-related content is proactively discovered by its artificial intelligence systems and adds that it’s improved its response time to valid law enforcement requests by 85 percent year over year. Nevertheless, Snap admits it still has more work to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mK7t5X"&gt;As well as more proactively removing drug dealers from its platform, Snap points towards research its commissioned that suggests some users are unaware of how dangerous fentanyl can be — something its Heads Up portal is designed to address. Snap says it will be promoting the portal, as well as the dangers of fentanyl more generally via a new filter, and that it will also discuss the crisis in upcoming episodes of its Snap Original show &lt;em&gt;Good Luck America&lt;/em&gt;. Expert organizations contributing to Heads Up include Song for Charlie, Shatterproof, and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), with resources from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to be added in the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Obac45"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 7th, 6:51AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated with Snap’s statement that its work on the initiatives predate the report from &lt;/em&gt;NBC News&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sky’s new Glass TVs ditch satellite dishes for Wi-Fi</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Su3sncNLg53FCTLJzGios1cm-ps=/469x0:5532x3375/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69962840/Sky_Glass___Racing_green___Home_page.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sky Glass TVs stream channels over Wi-Fi instead of satellite dishes.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sky&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e5tGLM"&gt;British Satellite broadcaster Sky is moving away from the satellite dishes that have defined its TV service for decades. Sky Glass is launching today, an ambitious effort to sell television sets that stream Sky TV content over Wi-Fi directly to consumers. There’s no external box, no satellite dish, and no need for a soundbar. Sky calls the all-in-one TV “no fuss.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s0yBdX"&gt;Although announced for the UK today, Sky has global aspirations for Glass TV “built on technology borne of the collaboration as part of the Comcast Corporation.” As such, we might be looking at the platform underpinning Comcast’s rumored &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22685538/comcast-xclass-tv-sky-q-smart-tv-hisense-x1-operating-system"&gt;XClass TVs&lt;/a&gt; for the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QHF5Qz"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sky.com%2Fglass&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F7%2F22714076%2Fsky-glass-tv-streaming-service-uk-pricing-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sky Glass TVs&lt;/a&gt; will be available in three sizes: 43-inch, 55-inch, and 65-inch. Each 4K TV will stream Sky’s TV channels, and integrates in voice control (Hello Sky) and 21 apps to access additional content like Netflix, Spotify, or Disney Plus. Sky hasn’t named the TV manufacturer it partnered with yet, but the full specifications include a UHD Quantum Dot display, support for Dolby Vision, HDR 10, HLG, three HDMI 2.1 ports, and a single USB-C port. The rather chubby TV fits six speakers for up to 215W of Dolby Atmos surround sound: 3 outward firing speakers, 2 upward, and 1 central subwoofer. There will also be five color options: white, pink, green, blue, and black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y6_dvhGot_6yiby9aHrRZEhz1xo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22907030/skyglasstvs.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sky&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sky Glass TVs come in three sizes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KzZP5itoxFwj8Uf9GmLwobvJEKk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22907031/Sky_Glass_Voice_remote___lifestyle__TV_in_action.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sky&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s voice support or the usual TV remote.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fc6eVy"&gt;The price of a Sky Glass TV is designed to be baked into a monthly subscription to Sky’s TV service, known as Sky Ultimate TV, but you can also pay for the TV upfront if you want to lower the monthly costs. Sky Ultimate TV includes access to Netflix and some basic Sky channels, but Sky Sports and Sky Cinema are separate add-ons. What you pay will depend on the size of TV and whether you want to spread payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z8Tk1U"&gt;The smallest 43-inch model is £649 upfront, or you can spread the payments at £13 per month over 48 months, or £26 per month over 24 months. The 55-inch model works out at £849 upfront, or £17 per month over 48 months, and £34 per month over 24 months. The largest 65-inch Sky Glass TV is £1,049 upfront, or £21 per month over 48 months, and £42 per month over 24 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ugTPH"&gt;That means the cheapest option for a Sky Glass TV is £39 per month for the smaller 43-inch model, unless you’re willing to pay for it upfront and pay the £26 per month subscription separately. Sky has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sky.com%2Fglass%2Ftechnical-specifications%2F43inch%3Fcontract%3D48months%26irct%3DglassHome-glass-techSpecs&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F7%2F22714076%2Fsky-glass-tv-streaming-service-uk-pricing-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;full pricing options here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wzJWrF0mVbrhU2sGKW5zEG1QFPY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22907039/skyglasspucksandremote.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sky&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sky Stream pucks also let you stream Sky channels to existing TVs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qJO7JG"&gt;Sky is also offering Sky Stream pucks at £50 each upfront, which you can use in other rooms of your house to stream Sky content to existing TVs. These appear to be offered only as add-ons, much like Sky’s multiscreen offering, so you can’t purchase a Sky Stream puck without a Sky Glass TV. Sky Stream pucks will also require a £10 monthly subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YZugX9"&gt;Sky describes its new Glass TVs as a “voice-first” platform, so while there is a separate remote, the company is pushing voice commands more than ever before. “Hello Sky” activates Sky’s voice commands, much like a digital assistant, and you’ll even be able to use it to switch HDMI ports by saying “Sky, Xbox” to switch to an Xbox console if you have one connected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k0IInO"&gt;Sky is also working on a 4K smart camera that will attach to its Sky Glass TVs and will launch in 2022. It looks a lot like Microsoft’s Kinect camera, and it even includes body tracking and motion controls just like Kinect. Sky boldly claims it will “transform how we chat, play games, workout, and share entertainment at home.” It will support apps like Zoom, and includes noise-cancellation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oW_pW3SfiX2feqEPrMTmO2vSwT4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22907038/skyglasscamera.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sky&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sky Glass 4K webcam looks like a Kinect.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DlRlSJ"&gt;The most interesting aspect of the camera is Sky’s collaboration with Microsoft to watch TV together with others. Sky demonstrated a software experience that allows you to watch TV channels with others, and see each other’s reactions to sport in real time. This is something Microsoft always wanted to deliver through its Kinect work, so it’s interesting to see the company with Sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HDUlQS"&gt;This camera includes motion controls, allowing Sky Glass owners to access “family games” and control them with their body. This was always the dream of Kinect on Xbox, and it looks like Sky is trying to resurrect it with Sky Glass TVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="peBibH"&gt;While Sky has detailed its hardware today, we’re still waiting to hear more on how the company is streaming its content over the web. TV providers have struggled to stream live TV without a delay over the internet, which is particularly jarring when you’re watching live sport and neighbors cheer or you see the score on Twitter before it happens on your screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNJi7n"&gt;Sky says you’ll need a minimum connection of 10Mbps to stream HD content through a Sky Glass TV, or 25Mbps for 4K. That’s identical to the minimums for Netflix, but Sky hasn’t detailed what bitrates and streaming protocols it’s using yet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vE7wNVg5KKQN2B2nf8Im3Ill8Nk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22907034/white3.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sky&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;It’s not the thinnest of TVs.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nwjjKD"&gt;Sky also says it will be the first TV manufacturer in the world to have a swap program, allowing customers to swap old Sky Glass TVs for newer models when they’re available. It’s not immediately clear how that will work, but it will likely only be offered to those who spread the cost in Sky’s monthly subscriptions instead of buying the TV upfront.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VO1fIG"&gt;Sky Glass won’t be limited to the UK, either. Sky has built these TVs so other telcos and television operators can launch Sky Glass TVs, too. Australia’s Foxtel Group will launch Sky Glass at some point in the future, and Sky says this is the “first of many collaborations as Sky Glass is scaled across the globe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CSQ1Vc"&gt;Sky Glass TVs could also form the basis of Comcast’s XClass TVs, as Sky notes its TVs are “built on technology borne of the collaboration as part of the Comcast Corporation.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22685538/comcast-xclass-tv-sky-q-smart-tv-hisense-x1-operating-system"&gt;Rumors suggest&lt;/a&gt; Comcast’s upcoming TVs will run Comcast’s X1 OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cDqK6t"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Comcast is an investor in Vox Media, The Verge’s parent company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox Cloud Gaming is now fully powered by faster Xbox Series X hardware</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D9AzVTO8-NlHpWbmmzgiyxot1v0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69962830/acastro_210429_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1m9G7M"&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox Cloud Gaming service (xCloud) is now fully powered by custom Xbox Series X hardware. Microsoft tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it recently completed the upgrade, which improves both framerates and game load times for players streaming Xbox games over the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gHNjNb"&gt;While Microsoft has moved Xbox Cloud Gaming to 1080p and 60fps streams in recent months, the company has yet to unlock the full potential of custom Xbox Series X hardware to deliver 4K streams. It’s not clear when this will be available, but Microsoft has been moving towards delivering Xbox Cloud Gaming beyond just mobile devices and browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1WkLc"&gt;Microsoft is currently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527420/microsoft-xbox-tv-app-streaming-stick-xcloud"&gt;working on a dedicated Xbox app for TVs&lt;/a&gt; that will allow Xbox players to stream games without a console. Standalone streaming devices that you can plug into a TV or monitor are also planned, and it’s reasonable to assume there could be further upgrades to the Xbox Cloud Gaming resolution to match this TV push.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xbox Game Pass is getting integrated into the Xbox dashboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="R4iVxE"&gt;Xbox Cloud Gaming started off as a way to play games on mobile devices, but with its upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22698101/microsoft-xcloud-xbox-cloud-gaming-console-integration"&gt;integration into the Xbox dashboard&lt;/a&gt; and TVs, it’s already becoming a lot more than just a mobile offering. Microsoft is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710708/microsoft-xbox-web-store-xcloud-cloud-gaming-wishlists-features"&gt;integrating Xbox Cloud Gaming into its new Xbox web store&lt;/a&gt; that’s starting to rollout, and we’re still waiting to hear more about its plans to bring its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299032/microsoft-mixer-closing-facebook-gaming-partnership-xcloud-features"&gt;xCloud technology to Facebook Gaming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ubqJ95"&gt;Microsoft also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22701912/xbox-cloud-gaming-xcloud-australia-brazil-mexico-japan-launch-october"&gt;recently expanded Xbox Cloud Gaming&lt;/a&gt; to Australia, Brazil, Mexico, and Japan, shortly after completing its custom Xbox Series X hardware upgrade for the service. Microsoft’s xCloud tech is now available in 26 countries, and the company has previously hinted at “new subscription offerings for Xbox Game Pass,” so we could see additional tiers that provide access to Xbox Cloud Gaming soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A text message routing company suffered a five-year-long breach</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VMwX3ELU5_8o28rq6RFFI7PHSqE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69962056/acastro_170621_1777_0006_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n692sJ"&gt;Syniverse, a telecom company that helps carriers like Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT&amp;amp;T route messages between each other and other carriers abroad, disclosed last week that it was the subject of a possible five year long hack. If the name Syniverse sounds familiar, the company was also responsible for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/7/20953422/text-messages-delayed-received-overnight-valentines-day-delay"&gt;the disappearance of a swath of Valentine’s Day text messages&lt;/a&gt; in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rGv9U2"&gt;The hack in question was brought to light &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1839175/000119312521284329/d234831dprem14a.htm#toc234831_9"&gt;in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Syniverse published last week&lt;/a&gt;. In it, Syniverse shares that in May 2021 it “became aware of unauthorized access to its operational and information technology systems by an unknown individual or organization.” The company did its due diligence notifying law enforcement and conducting an internal investigation, resulting in the discovery that the security breach first started in May 2016. That’s five years of (possibly) unfettered access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KDq6Uq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The hack went back as far as 2016&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FEMyp9"&gt;The hackers “gained unauthorized access to databases within its network on several occasions, and that login information allowing access to or from its Electronic Data Transfer (EDT) environment was compromised for approximately 235 of its customers,” the filing reads. That could include access to call records, and metadata like phone numbers, locations, and the content of text messages, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3xpm8/company-that-routes-billions-of-text-messages-quietly-says-it-was-hacked"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Motherboard’&lt;/em&gt;s sources&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ioWW2R"&gt;Syniverse’s SEC filing says the company notified anyone caught up in the breach, and reset credentials were appropriate. Additionally, “Syniverse did not observe any evidence of intent to disrupt its operations or those of its customers and there was no attempt to monetize the unauthorized activity,” the filing states. Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T, and Syniverse did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, while T-Mobile referred questions to the CTIA. &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/10/company-that-routes-sms-for-all-major-us-carriers-was-hacked-for-five-years/"&gt;T-Mobile did tell &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it was “aware of a security incident” with Syniverse but there is “no indication that any personal information, call record details or text message content of T-Mobile customers were impacted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BL1hwg"&gt;Syniverse’s security breach was revealed as the company &lt;a href="https://www.syniverse.com/news-and-events/syniverse-merger-with-m3-brigade-acquisition-ii-corp"&gt;is trying to go public&lt;/a&gt; through a merger with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;special purpose acquisition company (SPAC)&lt;/a&gt;, but it seems like it was a target in the first place because of the company’s size. Syniverse has spent the last decade becoming a quasi-gatekeeper for multiple US carriers through acquisitions, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20974692/valentines-day-text-message-delay-explanation-sms-syniverse-carriers"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s earlier reporting found&lt;/a&gt;. Size matters in business, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22248631/solarwinds-hack-cybersecurity-us-menn-decoder-podcast"&gt;but as with the SolarWinds hack&lt;/a&gt;, it matters even more when something goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix will edit phone numbers out of Squid Game following prank calls </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B-RomZEPDqE-pFX037-1-FkvpKo=/253x0:2271x1345/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69962040/Screen_Shot_2021_10_06_at_4.12.41_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Fh69lb"&gt;Netflix’s immensely popular &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt; is getting an edit after phone numbers shown in the series dialed real numbers, leading to what the company described as “unfortunate” prank dials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kjTnsa"&gt;The Korean drama about a sadistic “game,” in which players find themselves with no option but to participate in a series of twisted challenges, contains visible phone numbers in multiple scenes (a phone number is also clearly visible in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/1/22704313/sk-broadband-netflix-suing-for-payment-squid-game"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; trailer). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DQklFG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/netflix-edit-squid-game-phone-number-after-woman-inundated-with-calls-2021-10-06/"&gt;earlier reported&lt;/a&gt; the news, cited Netflix and production company Siren Pictures as saying they purposefully did not include a complete number and weren’t aware the number shown would reach a real line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MkKXoY"&gt;Netflix confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the numbers that appear in &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt; will be edited, adding that it hopes that the change will end the prank calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SVUJFd"&gt;A man who &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/entertainment/article/3150377/after-man-phone-number-netflixs-squid-game-bombarded-calls"&gt;claims to be the owner&lt;/a&gt; of the number told a local media outlet that he’d been “bombarded” with messages and calls, adding that they had made it difficult to live his life normally. However, it appears as though &lt;a href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2021/10/688_316564.html?fl"&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/netflix-edit-squid-game-phone-number-after-woman-inundated-with-calls-2021-10-06/"&gt;individuals&lt;/a&gt; may have received calls from enthusiast &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt; viewers. Netflix did not immediately return a request for clarification about whether the series had impacted one or multiple local numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WdHwnX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt; has been a massive success for Netflix, becoming the streaming service’s &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-korea-the-story-so-far"&gt;top title in the US&lt;/a&gt; as of last week — it remained a top title as of this week as well — the first Korean series to claim that top spot, according to Netflix. That’s great for the show’s creators and certainly a win for Netflix. It’s probably safe to assume the poor individual(s) receiving prank calls from random &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt; devotees feel differently, though.&lt;/p&gt;
