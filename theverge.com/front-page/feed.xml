    <title>Waymo plans fleet of self-driving, all-electric robotaxis with Chinese automaker Geely</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O_5a0BBsHgobCyHwwUXp0YGCqVE=/240x0:2832x1728/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70326005/Waymo_Geely_Exterior_Studio.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flat floors, low entry, and B-pillarless design — Waymo’s concept art of the coming cars. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Waymo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1qOdwy"&gt;Alphabet’s self-driving car company Waymo is &lt;a href="https://blog.waymo.com/2021/12/expanding-our-waymo-one-fleet-with.html"&gt;partnering with Chinese automaker Geely&lt;/a&gt; to create a fleet of all-electric, self-driving robotaxis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O4M5cL"&gt;The cars will be designed in Sweden (where Geely owns Swedish carmaker Volvo) and will be adapted from Geely’s all-electric five-door Zeekr. Waymo will then outfit the cars with the hardware and software necessary for autonomous driving. Waymo &lt;a href="https://blog.waymo.com/2021/12/expanding-our-waymo-one-fleet-with.html"&gt;said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; that it plans to deploy the vehicles in the US as part of its existing fleet of self-driving robotaxis some time “in the years to come.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hfppvz"&gt;Concept images of finished vehicle shared by Waymo show a car that is designed specifically for autonomous ride-hailing trips. It has a flat floor, low step-in height, and B-pillarless design for easy entry and exit, as well as sliding doors, reclining seats, and plenty of headroom. Waymo says future models will have an interior without steering wheel or pedals — just a screen (presumably to let riders check on the progress of their journey). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YOjbZv2nea9QR1pwNF3S1bHXgIk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23131845/Waymo_Geely_SF_Exterior.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Waymo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Concept images show a minivan-like vehicle designed for riders, not drivers. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0GMWWHpsgWALDAifN8JqPjiQxNs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23131846/_For_blog_only__Waymo_Geely_Interior_No_Disclaimer.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Waymo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The car’s interiors will have no steering wheel or pedals — just a screen. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0DfS42"&gt;These are just concept images, though, and might not necessarily reflect the finished vehicles Geely and Waymo will eventually put on the roads. It’s notable that Waymo’s concepts make the car look much more like a minivan, while &lt;a href="https://www.topgear.com/car-news/electric/zeekr-001-has-gone-production"&gt;Geely’s Zeekr 001&lt;/a&gt; has a design that’s more like a cross between a station wagon, a shooting brake, and an SUV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wHnEXZ"&gt;News of the deal between Geely and Waymo is another demonstration of just how busy the auto world is with partnerships and collaborations as self-driving and electric tech shakes up old incumbents. Waymo has partnered with Stellantis and Jaguar Land Rover to deploy and develop its autonomous capabilities, while Geely plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708804/volvo-ipo-value-geely-polestar-electric-cars"&gt;take Volvo public&lt;/a&gt; as an all-electric company, after doing the same with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696139/polestar-spac-public-value-ev-startup-volvo-geely"&gt;new Polestar brand&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG says next-generation OLED EX technology delivers improved brightness and accuracy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kwv4wrbtv7o9YyVNA2djqHalcto=/17x0:944x618/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70325922/110411_57576_1754.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG will be incorporating OLED EX technology into its TVs from the second quarter of 2022. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: LG Display&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6xamTz"&gt;LG is the maker of some of our favorite OLED TVs, so when the company says it’s improved on its basic panel technology, it’s worth paying attention. Today it did just that, with LG Display announcing its next-generation OLED technology — &lt;a href="https://news.lgdisplay.com/global/2021/12/lg-display-unveils-next-generation-oled-tv-display-oled-ex/"&gt;dubbed OLED EX&lt;/a&gt; — which the company says will increase brightness by up to 30 percent, boost picture accuracy, and allow for smaller bezels in finished products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6WiRzw"&gt;These improvements are due to two key changes. The first is the use of an element known as deuterium in the chemical make-up of LG’s OLED panels, and the second is the incorporation of algorithmic image processing. LG says the latter will predict the usage of each individual light emitting diode in your TV based on your personal viewing habits to “precisely [control] the display’s energy input to more accurately express the details and colors of the video content being played.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TdnLN2CqwRlww76nbTz30BEe0XI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23131833/110411_57577_1754.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG Display&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OLED EX panels use new chemical design and predictive algorithms to improve picture quality. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3rnbQ4"&gt;This all sounds well and good, but we’ll have to wait until we see these new panels in person to really judge whether OLED EX is a significant improvement or just an incremental advance with some enthusiastic branding. (On that note, LG helpfully explains that the “EX” in OLED EX comes from the words “evolution” and “experience.” Very ‘90s, I thought.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BV49OZ"&gt;LG’s claims about reduced bezel sizes with OLED EX are a little more concrete at least. The company says that based on calculations involving a 65-inch OLED display, it will be able to reduce bezel thickness from 6mm to 4mm. It’s not a huge change on paper, but given how optimized this technology already is, every little improvement has to be fought for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5zLQ3x"&gt;LG says it plans to start incorporating OLED EX technology into all its OLED panels starting in the second quarter of 2022, though it’s not clear how much longer it might then take for this technology to reach consumers. As well as improving its OLED tech, LG has also been playing with some wilder concepts at this year’s CES conference, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/26/22854293/lg-display-oled-shelf-show-smart-window-transparent"&gt;showing off new transparent displays&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/22/22850959/lg-display-media-chair-virtual-ride-concepts-ces-2022"&gt;reclining, curved OLED thrones&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s new recipe service uses Walmart and Amazon Fresh to deliver ingredients</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_lrR_s4ZXV9g8WmxPuWuXZgSVzA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70325844/New_Kitchen_Duo_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG ThinQ Recipe app features 10,000 one-click shoppable recipes.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D1IACE"&gt;LG just announced its latest lineup of smart kitchen appliances. Fine, but what’s notable this time is a &lt;em&gt;service&lt;/em&gt; that could make life just a little bit easier. LG says the &lt;a href="http://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/12/new-kitchen-duo-from-lg-featuring-thinq-recipe-service-upgrades-the-cooking-experience/"&gt;ThinQ Recipe app and service&lt;/a&gt; is “new for 2022” and will let users seamlessly select from thousands of recipes for delivery directly from Walmart or Amazon Fresh without ever leaving the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kN2o1d"&gt;The LG ThinQ Recipe app is powered by SideChef, which LG has been partnering with since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/2/18/18229232/lg-smart-oven-tovala-partnership-launch"&gt;at least 2019&lt;/a&gt;. According to an LG press release, ThinQ Recipe offers “10,000 one-click shoppable recipes” that can be added to a shopping list within the app for delivery by Walmart or Amazon Fresh. If it’s as seamless as it sounds, the service could take some of the pain out of the weekly grocery shopping experience, especially for large families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KGO2SoFcvPQCHhwJOL5l077qZUg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23131792/New_Kitchen_Duo_7.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Delivery via Amazon Fresh or Walmart.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7_4A9V3QBzZ8dxkFZrsAxM_tzmc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23131791/New_Kitchen_Duo_9.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scan and Cook.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kAyulf"&gt;ThinQ Recipe also integrates the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9L3yeWRBQE"&gt;Scan and Cook feature&lt;/a&gt; developed by Boston-based Foodspace Technology. It works by scanning the UPC bar code on (some) frozen and ready-to-cook meals to automatically send cooking instructions to compatible LG ThinQ ovens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xMyyem"&gt;LG notes in the fine print that the LG ThinQ Recipe app “is applicable for models featuring Scan to Cook.” Applicable, but not &lt;em&gt;restricted&lt;/em&gt;, is how I read that, so hopefully the app and service will be available for owners of any old appliance to try.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LastPass says no passwords were compromised following breach scare</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9UzWr5puJcklk41VehGf4VrPw8c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70324985/acastro_170629_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wP2WR0"&gt;LastPass says there’s no evidence of a data breach following users’ reports that they were notified of unauthorized login attempts, as reported by &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/12/28/lastpass-master-passwords-may-have-been-compromised"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AppleInsider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The password manager maintains that it was never compromised, and users’ accounts haven’t been accessed by bad actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOm8Gi"&gt;Nikolett Bacso-Albaum, the senior director of LogMeIn Global PR initially told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that the alerts users received were related “to fairly common bot-related activity,” involving malicious attempts to log in to LastPass accounts using email addresses and passwords that bad actors sourced from past breaches of third-party services (i.e. not LastPass).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UwdDiB"&gt;“It’s important to note that we do not have any indication that accounts were successfully accessed or that the LastPass service was otherwise compromised by an unauthorized party,” Basco-Albaum said. “We regularly monitor for this type of activity and will continue to take steps designed to ensure that LastPass, its users, and their data remain protected and secure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m0vJju"&gt;However, late Tuesday night LastPass vice president of product management Dan DeMichele released a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;with a more detailed explanation, that says at least some of the alerts were “likely triggered in error,” due to an issue that LastPass has now resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="OfqXBh"&gt;As previously stated, LastPass is aware of and has been investigating recent reports of users receiving e-mails alerting them to blocked login attempts.&lt;br&gt;We quickly worked to investigate this activity and at this time we have no indication that any LastPass accounts were compromised by an unauthorized third-party as a result of this credential stuffing, nor have we found any indication that user’s LastPass credentials were harvested by malware, rogue browser extensions or phishing campaigns. &lt;br&gt;However, out of an abundance of caution, we continued to investigate in an effort to determine what was causing the automated security alert e-mails to be triggered from our systems. &lt;br&gt;Our investigation has since found that some of these security alerts, which were sent to a limited subset of LastPass users, were likely triggered in error. As a result, we have adjusted our security alert systems and this issue has since been resolved. &lt;br&gt;These alerts were triggered due to LastPass’s ongoing efforts to defend its customers from bad actors and credential stuffing attempts. It is also important to reiterate that LastPass’ zero-knowledge security model means that at no time does LastPass store, have knowledge of, or have access to a users’ Master Password(s).   &lt;br&gt;We will continue to regularly monitor for unusual or malicious activity and will, as necessary, continue to take steps designed to ensure that LastPass, its users and their data remain protected and secure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="tpWln3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Something very strange and bad is happening to a lot of people's &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LastPass?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@LastPass&lt;/a&gt; accounts. I posted this to Hacker News and it gathered 192 comments, including 7 separate reports of master password breaches &amp;amp; login attempts from the same Brazil IP range. Uhh. &lt;a href="https://t.co/tcM0aFdavv"&gt;https://t.co/tcM0aFdavv&lt;/a&gt;`&lt;/p&gt;— Greg Technology (@technology_greg) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/technology_greg/status/1475600580521381889?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fWXLR8"&gt;Reports started cropping up on the &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29705957"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hacker News&lt;/em&gt; forum&lt;/a&gt; after a LastPass user created a post to highlight the issue. He claims that LastPass warned him of a login attempt from Brazil using his master password. Other users quickly responded to the post, noting that they experienced something similar. As the original poster (@technology_greg) points out in a tweet, some were also alerted of an attempt from Brazil, while other attempts were traced back to different countries. This, understandably, raised concerns that a breach took place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8FL8wk"&gt;Even if LastPass wasn’t actually compromised, it’s still a good idea to fortify your account with &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lastpass.com%2Fproducts%2Fmultifactor-authentication&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F28%2F22857485%2Flastpass-compromised-breach-scare" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;multifactor authentication&lt;/a&gt;, which uses outside sources to verify your identity before you log in to your account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qcsjGI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 29th, 12:20AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt; Added new statement from LastPass&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FCC win clears the way for a massive Wi-Fi 6E upgrade</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-JwJhJQ39rrF6yczVUtfK-PduFs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70325565/acastro__171016_1777_0001_v6.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustrator by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vFk4dU"&gt;A ruling (&lt;a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/7658F4CE919568A7852587B900589344/%24file/20-1190-1928330.pdf"&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt;) on Tuesday by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has backed up an &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-opens-6-ghz-band-wi-fi-and-other-unlicensed-uses"&gt;April 2020 decision&lt;/a&gt; by the FCC to open up 1,200MHz of spectrum in the 6GHz band for unlicensed use. Unlicensed means anyone can use it, as long as they do so responsibly, covering uses like your future Wi-Fi 6E home network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SSMctO"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/21/18232026/wi-fi-6-speed-explained-router-wifi-how-does-work"&gt;Wi-Fi 6 connections make more reliable and efficient use of the same spectrum&lt;/a&gt; that’s been in use for the last couple of decades, especially when multiple devices are connected, Wi-Fi 6E routers will work at 2.4GHz and 5GHz plus the new 6GHz band. That has enough room for up to seven maximum capacity Wi-Fi streams to broadcast in the same area at once without interfering with each other or using any existing spectrum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;
&lt;aside id="SU5GQZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Wi-Fi is getting its biggest upgrade in 20 years ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231623/6ghz-wifi-6e-explained-speed-availability-fcc-approval"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="vkbMZI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:3630921"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FedYPO"&gt;Beyond that, there’s already work on a future standard, known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11be"&gt;IEEE 802.11be&lt;/a&gt; or Wi-Fi 7. That could further optimize the use of the new band with even larger 320MHz channels, 46 Gbps maximum transfer rates, and more, but it’s not scheduled to be complete until 2024 (&lt;a href="https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/pdf/wi-fi-7-and-beyond.pdf"&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3HwbN4"&gt;In the immediate future, while 6GHz Wi-Fi has the same theoretical top speed as 5GHz Wi-Fi, the extra space means that instead of getting so much interference from other devices and nearby networks, you’ll have a faster, more consistent connection. Last year a representative for the Wi-Fi Alliance told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that this should enable 1–2 Gbps connections over Wi-Fi, similar to what you see now with mmWave 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7BfK2w"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T argued against the FCC’s plan, saying the commission failed to identify and address possible interference with “tens of thousands of microwave links critical to maintaining network infrastructure,” talking about the &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/5g/atandt-takes-fcc-to-court-over-5g-backhaul/d/d-id/772166"&gt;wireless tech that keeps many cell sites connected to the wider internet&lt;/a&gt;. In one filing spotted by &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/5g/atandt-takes-fcc-to-court-over-5g-backhaul/d/d-id/772166"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Light Reading&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, AT&amp;amp;T said, “The 6GHz FS [fixed service] band is the only band suitable for long distance transmission, routinely supporting paths between 10-50 miles and, in cases, even longer distances.” Mobile carriers preferred a plan where the FCC would auction off a chunk of the 6GHz bandwidth for use solely by their 5G networks. The FCC said that low-power indoor use protects licensed 6GHz tech like AT&amp;amp;T’s microwave links and TV broadcasts from interference, while “standard power” devices used indoors and outdoors could include automated frequency control to prevent interference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="C7xt62"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The FCC’s 6GHz decision could help your 5G connections too&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JUAm3P"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T did not have a comment today on the outcome. However, at the same time this case is being decided, a similar objection by the FAA is being used against the FCC to pause its ability to start using C-Band spectrum for 5G. As an FAA spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, “Landings during periods of low visibility could be limited due to concerns that the 5G signal could interfere with the accuracy of an airplane’s radio altimeter, without other mitigations in place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="L2E9sG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FCC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@FCC&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t have to show no potential for harmful interference ever. FCC does not need to protect against wildly unlikely scenarios. Instead, FCC balances all factors to conclude whether harmful interference is unlikely enough to be negligible risk. /3&lt;/p&gt;— (((haroldfeld))) (@haroldfeld) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/haroldfeld/status/1475906524807634955?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YsJ4sJ"&gt;Harold Feld, senior vice president of the advocacy group &lt;a href="https://publicknowledge.org/public-knowledge-applauds-d-c-circuit-court-ruling-affirming-fcc-rules-for-gigabit-wi-fi/"&gt;Public Knowledge&lt;/a&gt; says, “the D.C. Circuit reaffirmed that it will not second-guess the technical expertise of the FCC when the agency balances the needs of both legacy licensed users and new innovations in Wi-Fi.” FCC commissioner Brendan Carr agrees, as his statement mentioned, “Today’s opinion also underscores the FCC’s role as the nation’s lead spectrum regulator. It does so by once again affirming the FCC’s assessment of the risks of harmful interference to existing operations. U.S. leadership in wireless depends on stakeholders continuing to abide by Congress’s long-standing decision to place these determinations squarely within the FCC’s expertise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kCmgG9"&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231623/6ghz-wifi-6e-explained-speed-availability-fcc-approval"&gt;as we noted in our Wi-Fi 6E explainer last year&lt;/a&gt; when the FCC made this decision, opening up the spectrum for unlicensed use doesn’t reserve it exclusively for Wi-Fi. It could be used by other devices and connections, like 5G. Sometimes mobile carriers use unlicensed spectrum to augment their licensed spectrum with technology that helps speed up connections, and it could come into play again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="Wqmceh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Big news! Today the DC Circuit unanimously upheld the FCC's decision to free up the 6 GHz band for more unlicensed use. This decision = more Wi-Fi in more places and it matters because it comes at a time when being connected is more important than ever. &lt;a href="https://t.co/jjN4G8ALzA"&gt;https://t.co/jjN4G8ALzA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jessica Rosenworcel (@JRosenworcel) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JRosenworcel/status/1475915000862715916?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZaOi6B"&gt;New FCC chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel has continued to back this measure that was decided under her predecessor, Trump appointee Ajit Pai. She &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/chairwoman-rosenworcel-court-victory-dc-circuit"&gt;says in a statement&lt;/a&gt; that “Today’s decision is an important step in clearing the way for next generation Wi-Fi access at a time when it is needed most. In this pandemic so much of modern life has migrated online. 6GHz Wi-Fi will help us address this challenge by offering more access in more places, faster speeds, and better performance from our Wi-Fi networks. It will also help us in our mission to connect everyone, everywhere...It is encouraging to read the Court’s strong approval of this work and we look forward to addressing on remand the narrow issue that the court identified.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NgcSrS"&gt;That narrow issue she mentions is a concern raised by the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) about interference in the 2.4GHz spectrum that the FCC didn’t directly address, but backers of the plan appear confident it will be overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="etTQAh"&gt;WifiForward, an industry group representing companies like Amazon, Google, Comcast, and Arris, &lt;a href="http://wififorward.org/news/wififorward-statement-dc-circuit-court-affirms-fccs-6-ghz-order/"&gt;praised today’s decision&lt;/a&gt;, saying, “The Commission’s decision was smart, well-researched, unanimous and bipartisan. We look forward to consumers getting faster, lower latency Wi-Fi operations in the band, which will include Wi-Fi 6E and eventually next-generation Wi-Fi 7.” The Wi-Fi Alliance that helps establish and roll out the new standards had a similar reaction, &lt;a href="https://www.wi-fi.org/news-events/newsroom/wi-fi-alliance-statement-on-us-court-of-appeals-for-the-dc-circuit-decision"&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt;, “Today’s court decision removes the regulatory uncertainty surrounding use of the 6 GHz band, allowing Wi-Fi Alliance and our members to expedite delivery of urgently needed Wi-Fi 6E broadband connectivity solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Another T-Mobile cyberattack reportedly exposed customer info and SIMs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QSH0QlUPFQHvbkGa28e81UPZDZ8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70325030/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pj5stH"&gt;T-Mobile has suffered another cyberattack after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/28/22646439/t-mobile-data-breach-ceo-security-mandiant-kpmg"&gt;being rocked by a massive data breach in August&lt;/a&gt;. This time around, attackers accessed “a small number of” customers’ accounts,  according to &lt;a href="https://tmo.report/2021/12/t-mobile-has-suffered-yet-another-data-breach/"&gt;documents posted by &lt;em&gt;The T-Mo Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ggOMKY"&gt;According to the report, customers either fell victim to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702544/fcc-rules-sim-swapping-port-out-fraud-cell-phone-carrier"&gt;SIM swapping attack&lt;/a&gt; (which could allow someone to bypass SMS-powered two-factor authentication), had personal plan information exposed, or both. The document shows that the customer proprietary network information that was viewed could’ve included customers’ billing account name, phone and account number, and info about their plan, including how many lines were attached to their account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fIswvB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The person who took credit for the summer hack called T-Mobile’s security “awful”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ystDXu"&gt;This summer, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630446/t-mobile-47-million-data-breach-ssn-pin-pii"&gt;carrier confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that a data breach exposed almost 50 million customers’ data, with the attacker accessing social security numbers, names, and dates of birth. (A person who claimed to be the hacker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643277/t-mobile-hacker-data-leak-claims-responsibility-criticizes-security"&gt;went on to call the company’s security practices “awful.”&lt;/a&gt;) The information reportedly exposed in December’s breach is less sensitive (and the documents say the customers who had their SIMs swapped have regained access), and is likely not as large in scope. We weren’t able to find widespread reports from customers that said they’d received notification letters. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CES 2022 in-person exhibitor list continues to shrink as AMD and MSI drop out</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="CES-2016-stock-verge-10" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nzy-55ovp8FaapQCSdd_t8_Ar7M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70304211/CES-2016-stock-verge-10.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zjBRnX"&gt;CES, the world’s largest technology show, is pressing on, but with fewer major exhibitors appearing in-person than expected due to rising COVID-19 cases in the United States. On December 22nd, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lenovonews/status/1473824084018360321?s=21"&gt;exhibitor Lenovo announced&lt;/a&gt; that it would “suspend all on-site activity in Las Vegas,” following announcements from T-Mobile, Amazon, Meta, and others that they’d be ditching as well and despite CES organizers’ statements that the show would go on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="CFpmOw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Intel says it will move to a “digital-first” experience with minimal on-site staff&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NgTirG"&gt;T-Mobile was the most prominent exhibitor to bail early that week. CEO Mike Sievert, one of the Consumer Electronics Show’s featured speakers, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MikeSievert/status/1473445847173976065"&gt;publicly announced on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; that he would no longer be doing a keynote and would “significantly limit our in-person participation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6jiJmu"&gt;Amazon decided not to attend the show in-person entirely, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1473486307657539584?s=21"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Gurman&lt;/a&gt;, and AT&amp;amp;T also dropped out on Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/inafried/status/1473755300092002304"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Axios’ &lt;/em&gt;Ina Fried&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AL1S9o"&gt;Hisense typically has a large press conference and significant presence in the LVCC’s central hall, but on Thursday morning, Hisense announced it decided to make its January 4th press conference fully virtual “to ensure the health and safety of our team.” The company still plans to have a booth at the show, with in-person walkthroughs for those attending and virtual ones for those covering it from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ixYeKu"&gt;It was followed closely later in the day by Waymo, as Alphabet’s self-driving car company &lt;a href="https://blog.waymo.com/2021/12/meet-waymo-at-ces-2022.html"&gt;updated its blog post&lt;/a&gt; to explain the decision. “Based on quickly rising COVID-19 infection rates, Waymo has made the difficult decision not to participate in person at CES 2022. We are aiming to still virtually participate in some CES-related events. In particular, as part of our Self-Driven Women series, our co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana and our Global Head of Public Policy Michelle Peacock will speak at several virtual panel discussions with the Female Quotient, the official equality partner of CES 2022.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="txgm6L"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google: “we have decided to withhold from having a presence on the show floor of CES 2022.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lEQ22e"&gt;Chipmaking giant Intel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/23/22852045/ces-2022-intel-skipping-show-covid-19'"&gt;said on Thursday afternoon&lt;/a&gt; that “[after] consulting with health officials and in the spirit of Intel’s safety policy, our plans for CES will move to a digital-first, live experience, with minimal on-site staff.” Gaming accessory maker HyperX also said it’s pivoting away from in-person plans and will support conversations and activities virtually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9GlLye"&gt;The dominoes continued to fall on Thursday, as General Motors announced its presence will be all-digital. Less than a day ago, GM confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it still planned to attend CES, where CEO Mary Barra &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712710/general-motors-investor-day-chevy-silverado-ev-2022-consumer-electronics-show"&gt;was scheduled as a keynote speaker, and it planned to debut an electric version of the Chevrolet Silverado&lt;/a&gt;, but now that has changed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xr5Yi4"&gt;A statement from the company says, “We have decided to move to an all-digital approach with our activation at CES 2022 in January. CES is an important technology platform, and we are continuing with our plans on January 5 to share our significant company news including the reveal of the Chevrolet Silverado EV.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cHR3zT"&gt;GM was closely followed out the door by Google, which has frequently used CES to host larger and more extravagant showcases for its new hardware. It had planned to have a booth at the event, but &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reporter Mark Gurman &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1474130973923033117"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday that, like its corporate sibling Waymo, it is backing out of the in-person event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eyortL"&gt;In a statement given to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Google communications manager Ivy Hunt says, “After careful consideration we have decided to withhold from having a presence on the show floor of CES 2022. We’ve been closely monitoring the development of the Omicron variant, and have decided that this is the best choice for the health and safety of our teams. We will continue to collaborate closely with both CTA and our partners to identify and support virtual opportunities, and we look forward to sharing the latest Google innovations with you all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wUKJbt"&gt;With just a few days left before the show begins, the list of dropouts continues to grow. AMD had previously said it was still planning to appear, but on December 28th (via &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/msi-cancels-ces-2022-attendance"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) it issued the following statement: “AMD has decided to cancel our in-person presence at CES 2022 in Las Vegas and will instead transition to a virtual experience. While the AMD 2022 Product Premiere was always planned as a digital-only livestream, our in-person engagements will now transition to virtual in the best interest of the health and safety of our employees, partners and communities. We look forward to sharing all our exciting news as scheduled on January 4th.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDsNQ3"&gt;Another late scratch is MSI. The computer maker &lt;a href="https://www.msi.com/news/detail/MSI-Canceled-the-Physical-Presence-at-2022-CES122948"&gt;says in a post on its website&lt;/a&gt; that “Since December, the rapidly spreading Omicron variant has brought the USA a surge of COVID-19 cases. The health and well-being of our employees, customers and fans are our top priority. Hence, we have decided not to participate in-person at CES 2022 and will join the show virtually with our online product launch.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fgEruz"&gt;OnePlus was not an official exhibitor at the show, but it says it has canceled an event that was planned to coincide with it in Las Vegas. &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/28/more-companies-bow-out-of-in-person-ces-presence/?"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; notes that Proctor &amp;amp; Gamble, the parent company of Gillette and Oral-B, which have used CES to debut new technology, is also skipping the in-person event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I’m sorry we’ll miss seeing everyone at CES this year, but we are prioritizing the safety of our team and other attendees.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our statement here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/WAIkFYMzc7"&gt;https://t.co/WAIkFYMzc7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mike Sievert (@MikeSievert) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MikeSievert/status/1473445847173976065?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p id="Yqsd2L"&gt;Lenovo typically has a medium-sized presence at CES, typically making an array of announcements, though most of its activity generally happens on the Las Vegas Strip and in private meeting rooms rather than a public booth on the show floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bmVmpc"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T, by comparison, had a seemingly tiny presence at this year’s show. While the company’s “AT&amp;amp;T Business” division is listed as a featured exhibitor, the company was not expected to have a keynote. AT&amp;amp;T Business also only appears &lt;a href="https://ces22.mapyourshow.com/8_0/floorplan/?st=keyword&amp;amp;sv=at%26t&amp;amp;hallID=A"&gt;to have one very small booth&lt;/a&gt; in the Health and Wellness section of the Las Vegas Convention Center’s North Hall, with no booths for AT&amp;amp;T in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eq0giq"&gt;Other companies that might make a sizable impact if they ditched CES 2022 include Samsung, which has a featured keynote like T-Mobile, and companies that generally rent a lot of prominent space on the show floor, like LG, Panasonic, and Sony. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="4jdF50"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Companies like Samsung, GM, Intel, LG, Panasonic, Sony, Nikon, Canon are the likely tipping point&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MwuYQr"&gt;We’ve asked some key companies if they’re still committed; a Sony rep suggested to us that the company still plans to attend, and LG said that “Unless CTA says otherwise,” it’s “still on board.” CES maps show that LG has a very large booth at CES, but the company’s said it’s taking a hybrid approach, making use of QR codes and AR to show off its wares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jHHS0K"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-21/meta-twitter-scrap-plans-for-ces-in-las-vegas-after-covid-surge?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; last week that AMD (now out) and Samsung were still planning a limited presence, Nvidia will have a virtual-only keynote, and that Qualcomm, OnePlus, and HTC still plan to attend. Sony and Samsung have said they are “monitoring local conditions,” which could be read as a meaningless platitude but also gives those companies an easy out if they decide the conditions have changed (as it has already been for companies like Google and GM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWcwdj"&gt;On December 21st, the Consumer Technology Association, which runs CES, stated that it still plans to host an in-person show. “At this point, we’re very much focused on having this show and doing it safely and putting the right protocols in place to ensure that people feel comfortable with it,” &lt;a href="https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/ces-plans-to-push-forward-with-an-in-person-conference-despite-omicron-concerns/"&gt;a CTA exec told &lt;em&gt;Adweek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eRyNeA"&gt;The day after that, the CTA said it’s received 42 exhibitor cancellations but has also added 60 new exhibitors in that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cnjIMB"&gt;Here is the CTA’s full statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; from Jean Foster, head of marketing and communications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="X8c2Bw"&gt;CES will be in person on January 5-8 in Las Vegas with strong safety measures in place, and our digital access is also available for people that don’t wish to, or can’t travel to Las Vegas. Our mission remains to convene the industry and give those who cannot attend in person the ability to experience the magic of CES digitally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pLnfPt"&gt;While we recently received 42 exhibitor cancellations (less than 7% of our exhibit floor), since last Thursday, we’ve added 60 new exhibitors for our in person event. Registrations for both our digital access and our Las Vegas event are continuing to show strong momentum, with thousands more registrations in the last few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H1X0BM"&gt;CES 2022 will go forward as important innovation for world health and safety, mobility and solving problems will be exhibited. Furthermore&lt;s&gt;,&lt;/s&gt; thousands of smaller and medium sized companies rely on CES for their business. We have increased our official count to over 2200 exhibitors and as &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.ces.tech_News_Press-2DReleases_CES-2DPress-2DRelease.aspx-3FNodeID-3D5c6782e3-2D7c62-2D4028-2D8e2a-2D827a1c58cba6&amp;amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;amp;c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&amp;amp;r=XbPQjtdhJg1hC5-IccTkDxSrqhL0VWnmU2huSyK6TFc&amp;amp;m=dQ0shU35BhNLRgThHTf0QckcsMkcwMRMPdLqg7ETJTibsQxGxH9RNCOVK5RsfJwX&amp;amp;s=J4H1QKA0t9EvNmzUV1I4ySVKFQ2D9X0nI2yoJ60Bq0I&amp;amp;e="&gt;announced yesterday&lt;/a&gt; many of our top elected officials from both political parties will be at CES.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tctO7m"&gt;Given CES’ comprehensive health measures — vaccination requirement, masking and availability of COVID-19 tests — coupled with lower attendance and social distancing measures, we are confident that attendees and exhibitors can have a socially distanced but worthwhile and productive event in Las Vegas, as well as a rewarding experience on our digital access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4Y3xVw"&gt;In the recent past, we’ve seen the question of “will they or won’t they cancel due to COVID” take a while to resolve. Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, the first big tech show to go on after the COVID-19 pandemic initially hit, held out for quite some time even as partners continued to cancel. Eventually, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21127754/mwc-2020-canceled-coronavirus-trade-show-phone-mobile-world-congress-gsma-statement"&gt;organizers did have to cancel MWC 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Major tech companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430649/samsung-mobile-world-congress-mwc-barcelona-remote-covid"&gt;ditched the in-person version of MWC 2021&lt;/a&gt; as well. CES 2021, on the other hand, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21344977/ces-2021-online-cta-las-vegas-conference-coronavirus-pandemic-covid-19"&gt;was all virtual&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ykL0Nr"&gt;As far as why “CES will and must go on,” CTA president and CEO Gary Shapiro &lt;a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/commentary-ces-will-and-must-go-on-in-las-vegas-2502202/"&gt;published a Christmas Day op-ed in the&lt;em&gt; Las Vegas Review-Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that says, among other things, “ CES 2022 will kick off 2022 in messy fashion, but it will be chock full of innovation and full of entrepreneurs and businesses. We will all be taking risks. But without risk there is no innovation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tDMUvY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 8:41 PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added additional company replies via Bloomberg.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rivian’s 400-mile electric vehicles delayed to 2023</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dJ4_9jnmUsxRt_EyWM90KJdNphM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70324694/mclark_210923_4776_0019.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Mitchell Clark / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xVgPHZ"&gt;Rivian is telling customers that it won’t be building R1T pickup trucks with the “Max pack” battery option until 2023, as it’ll be prioritizing ones with the standard “large” battery pack for production throughout next year (&lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/12/28/rivian-delays-bigger-battery-pack-electric-pickup-2023/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). In an email attributed to CEO RJ Scaringe, the company says it will work on orders for the higher-trim “Adventure Package” trucks with the regular battery first, and that the lower-end “Explorer Package” and bigger battery will come later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nU0aEw"&gt;When the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/26/18111782/rivian-r1t-electric-pickup-price-specs-la-auto-show-2018"&gt;debuted its truck&lt;/a&gt; in 2018, the 400-mile estimated range afforded by the 180kWh Max pack was a big selling point. The “large” battery pack that comes standard with the trucks gets an EPA estimated range of 314 miles, but for the adventurous, off-road crowd Rivian markets to, every additional mile counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvM2Y9"&gt;According to the email, about 20 percent of the preorders are for vehicles with the $10,000 Max pack option. Given the 71,000 preorders cited by the letter, that’s around 14,200 vehicles affected by the delay. It’s not the first time the company has had to push back its timeline — the original plan was to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580293/rivian-delay-september-deliveries-electric-pickup-r1t-amazon"&gt;start shipping its electric trucks and SUVs in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, but the R1T didn’t start arriving until September 2021. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22840111/rivian-factory-georgia-5-billion-electric-amazon"&gt;has plans to build a second production facility&lt;/a&gt; (which should come with more battery manufacturing capacity), but doesn’t expect to start producing vehicles there until 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HPBrKL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Rivian preorderes aren’t the company’s only customers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d8TgvB"&gt;While Rivian’s consumer vehicles are the flashiest (and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2021/9/28/22697309/rivian-r1t-electric-truck-test-drive-off-roading-camp-tested"&gt;the most fun to drive up a mountain&lt;/a&gt;), Rivian also has obligations to corporate customers. Amazon (which owns &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22711196/rivian-s-1-ipo-amazon-ford-r1t-electric-pickup-truck"&gt;at least a 20 percent stake in the company&lt;/a&gt;, as revealed in the S-1 that preceded &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774403/rivian-ipo-debut-evs-12-billion-amazon-tesla-valuation"&gt;Rivian’s blockbuster IPO&lt;/a&gt;) has pledged to purchase 100,000 delivery vans from the company by 2024. Rivian &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22765853/rivian-fleet-sales-amazon-exclusivity-van-r1t-r1s"&gt;also plans to start selling&lt;/a&gt; those vans and fleet versions of the R1S and R1T to non-Amazon companies in 2023. That means that Rivian’s attention, manufacturing capacity, and materials (including &lt;a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/2021/07/16/rivian-delays-production-start-september-cites-chip-shortage/7992998002/"&gt;ever-scarce computer chips&lt;/a&gt;) are divided between customers and business contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eomOZE"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;, people who want to get their vehicles sooner will be able to change the configurations they’ve ordered. Whether they’ll want to will likely depend on the customer’s needs and patience. &lt;a href="https://insideevs.com/news/557502/rivian-max-pack-delayed-2023/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;InsideEVs&lt;/em&gt; posted the full letter&lt;/a&gt;, which thanks people who placed preorders for Max pack-equipped trucks in 2018 and 2019 for their “loyalty and commitment.” The email says that people who hadn’t already received their estimated delivery window should get it later on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alexa told a child to do potentially lethal ‘challenge’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mmE9AXJyBCLtzmpIJ6uvaTE3Mgk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70323607/cwelch_191016_3738_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VMnoaX"&gt;Amazon’s Alexa told a child to touch a penny to the exposed prongs of a phone charger plugged into the wall, according to one parent who &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/klivdahl/status/1475220450598924297?s=20"&gt;posted screenshots of their Alexa activity history&lt;/a&gt; showing the interaction (&lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/technology/amazon-alexa-slammed-for-giving-lethal-challenge-to-10-year-old-girl/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The device seemingly pulled the idea for the challenge from an article describing it as dangerous, citing news reports about an alleged challenge trending on TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JiGHUtOeWO7tT3bHCjpJ6_Oiz3k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23130884/klivdahl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/klivdahl/status/1475220450598924297?s=20" target="_blank"&gt;@klivdahl/Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4babCT"&gt;According to Kristin Livdahl’s screenshot, the Echo responded to “tell me a challenge to do” with “Here’s something I found on the web. According to ourcommunitynow.com: The challenge is simple: plug in a phone charger about halfway into a wall outlet, then touch a penny to the exposed prongs.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5vVjJ6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59810383"&gt;In a statement to the BBC&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon confirmed Alexa’s behavior, saying, “As soon as we became aware of this error, we took swift action to fix it.” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/klivdahl/status/1475616003996459016?s=20"&gt;Livdahl tweeted yesterday&lt;/a&gt; that asking for a challenge was no longer working. Testing the prompt with Alexa, we weren’t able to get a similar result today, and even asking for a challenge from the web prompted no response or pulled from a very limited pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alexa’s response to requests for a challenge on December 28th, after Amazon fixed this particular answer." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kTiZKNjnwnjo7GzH-YTZCh17z_o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23130939/alexa_challenges.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alexa’s response to requests for a challenge on December 28th, after Amazon fixed this particular answer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kh42SI"&gt;Amazon isn’t the only company to run into issues trying to parse the web for content. In October, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/soft/status/1449406390976409600"&gt;a user reported&lt;/a&gt; that Google displayed potentially dangerous advice in one of its featured snippets if you Googled “had a seizure now what” — the info it showed was from the section of a webpage describing what &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to do when someone was having a seizure. At the time, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; confirmed the user’s report, but it appears to have been fixed based on tests we did today (no snippet appears when Googling “had a seizure now what”). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DozykA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The Google search summary vs the actual page &lt;a href="https://t.co/OJxt1FrBqh"&gt;pic.twitter.com/OJxt1FrBqh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— ウィアブー リンデン (@soft) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/soft/status/1449406390976409600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OXtS70"&gt;Users have reported other similar problems, though, including &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/amyhoy/status/1445514300345307142/photo/1"&gt;one user who said&lt;/a&gt; Google gave results for orthostatic hyp&lt;strong&gt;o&lt;/strong&gt;tension when searching for orthostatic hyp&lt;strong&gt;er&lt;/strong&gt;tension, and another who &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lilsinnsitive/status/1472629416853389316"&gt;posted a screenshot&lt;/a&gt; of Google displaying terrible advice for consoling someone who’s grieving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6vUS4G"&gt;We’ve also seen warnings about dangerous behavior amplified to make the problem bigger than it originally was — earlier this month, some US school districts closed after self-perpetuating &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22840621/tiktok-december-17-school-threats-district-cancellations-alleged-shootings"&gt;reports about shooting threats being made on TikTok&lt;/a&gt;. It turned out that the social media firestorm was overwhelmingly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/17/22841370/why-tiktok-school-shooting-warnings-went-viral-december-17"&gt;caused by people talking about threats&lt;/a&gt;, far more than any threats that may have existed. In the case of Alexa, an algorithm picked out the descriptive part of a warning and amplified it without the original context. While the parent was there to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/klivdahl/status/1475609607724806150?s=20"&gt;immediately intervene&lt;/a&gt;, it’s easy to imagine a situation where that isn’t the case or where the answer shared by Alexa isn’t so obviously dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Hiogt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/klivdahl/status/1475594121163194376?s=20"&gt;Livdahl tweets&lt;/a&gt; that she used the opportunity to “go through internet safety and not trusting things you read without research and verification” with her child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vgTgnC"&gt;Amazon didn’t immediately reply to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c9Gr3q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 28th, 4:37PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added additional information on Alexa’s response to the same query now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="QMINpm"&gt;The Quest Store is offering a lot of VR games and experiences at a discount for its New Year’s sale, which lasts until January 2nd, 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5EsneO"&gt;Some of my personal favorite titles like &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2F3235570703151406" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Job Simulator&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2F2190353671014400" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arizona Sunshine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2F3349689215139117" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gorn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have their prices slashed by up to 35 percent. &lt;em&gt;Job Simulator&lt;/em&gt; is a place where you can do your job as horribly as you want without any real consequences, while &lt;em&gt;Arizona Sunshine&lt;/em&gt; is a zombie shooter with a surprisingly decent story, and &lt;em&gt;Gorn &lt;/em&gt;lets you take your anger out gladiator style, complete with mace-swinging. I find all of them to be pretty therapeutic (although they aren’t the newest games to come out for the Quest).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gdkc5i"&gt;There are also a number of themed game bundles for sale, such as the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2F333983248234243%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Thrilling Adventures Pack&lt;/a&gt;, which includes &lt;em&gt;I Expect You to Die 2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;A Township Tale&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Stride&lt;/em&gt; at a sale price of $39.99 instead of $49.97. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2F2131467090352833%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The Challenge Yourself Pack&lt;/a&gt; also contains three games — &lt;em&gt;Pistol Whip&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Real VR Fishing&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;In Death: Unchained — &lt;/em&gt;at a discounted price of $59.99, compared to the original $75.97 price tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qgo9e7"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2F863449390989977%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Must-Play Friendly Challenges&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2F439172594588067%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Must-Play Party Games&lt;/a&gt; packs are both offered at a 19 percent discount. While the Must-Play Friendly Challenges bundle comes with &lt;em&gt;Clash of Chefs VR&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mini Motor Racing X &lt;/em&gt;for $27.99, the Must-Play Party Games bundle includes &lt;em&gt;Chess Club&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Skyword: Kingdom Brawl&lt;/em&gt; for $19.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SwUfj1"&gt;Purchasing a pack, especially when it’s at a discount, could come in handy if you’re in need of games for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;new Quest 2&lt;/a&gt;. If you happen to own one of the games in the bundle you’re purchasing, that price will automatically be docked from your total order, so you won’t be paying for the same game twice. You can also choose to gift a game to a friend by hitting “Buy for a Friend” and entering your recipient's email during checkout.&lt;/p&gt;
