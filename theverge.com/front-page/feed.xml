    <title>Razer’s Kiyo Pro doesn’t deliver all the goods a $200 webcam should</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;This lens-shaped webcam has some tricks up its sleeve, but at a high cost&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="hnEwN4"&gt;Razer has released a swath of products so far during the pandemic, but its new Kiyo Pro might have the widest appeal of them all. It’s a new $199 webcam that looks like a lens ripped off a mirrorless camera, aimed to give Logitech’s Brio some good competition in the specs department. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/2/7/14531452/logitech-brio-4k-pro-webcam"&gt;four-year-old Brio&lt;/a&gt; is still the ideal choice if you value 4K capture and Windows Hello authentication, but the Kiyo Pro is no slouch, capable of streaming or recording 1080p footage at up to 60 frames per second, with an optional HDR mode that displays at 30 frames per second. Razer’s new webcam is a more compact alternative, and it has a few other features that might make it worth considering if you want a high-end webcam for more than just joining Zoom calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j37Vsy"&gt;The Kiyo Pro is being positioned as a good choice both for jumping into a meeting and for people who have hobbies or careers broadcasting their faces. It’s backing up that claim with a few features that I’ve been able to test over the past few days. One of them is its adjustable field of view (FOV), letting you swap between 80 degrees for a tighter crop of your face, a midrange 90-degree shot, or up to a super-wide 103 degrees. The latter option is nice if more than one person is in the shot or if you want to show off your living space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xh8I4C"&gt;You can adjust these settings and more from within Razer’s Synapse, though annoyingly, that software didn’t always reflect changes I made to the settings in the camera preview. Strangely, I had to join a Zoom call to see changes take effect. I understand there are people who don’t want to fuss with software, and so you know, this is a plug-and-play device for Windows 10 and macOS. That said, it’ll be at a fixed FOV, and the suite of settings that I detail below won’t be available to you unless you get Razer’s software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IoKnK4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10355570"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j3XFFf"&gt;This webcam features a 2.1-megapixel CMOS IMX327 autofocusing sensor with an f/2.0 aperture, covered in a sheet of Gorilla Glass 3, which is admittedly an odd feature for a camera that doesn’t move. It utilizes Sony’s Starvis technology, typically used in security cams, that makes it good at picking out details in low light and balancing light sources for a true-to-life picture. I was impressed with its ability to automatically make the dreadful lighting in my basement studio apartment look alright, with a few small tweaks by me in the brightness and saturation departments). So, I imagine people with ideal lighting will fare even better and possibly not have to adjust settings at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PoiAjt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Noticeably smoother and more detailed than any laptop webcam&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aiFIRQ"&gt;During some Zoom calls with the Kiyo Pro, none of the participants were blown away by the visual fidelity. They did, however, remark that it’s noticeably smoother and more detailed in terms of color accuracy than any laptop webcam, and especially given my apartment’s lighting situation (almost all artificial lights, with little natural light coming in), my picture looked lively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xBmDYt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10359311"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OYIDfk"&gt;Even with a bright window behind me that usually gets over-exposed by just about any laptop’s webcam, this camera balanced my apartment’s lighting without blowing out the background or dropping off in terms of detail. If you’re a game streamer with a vibrant set of colorful LEDs set up around your rig, this feature should be beneficial to you, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="afQNKp"&gt;The autofocus works relatively quickly, and it didn’t have to spend long clearing up the shot when I held an object close to the sensor, then pulled it away so it could refocus on my face. However, the autofocus tends to jump around a lot, hunting for a clearer shot even if I’m barely moving. This was perhaps the most annoying part of the experience for me, but it’s a small consolation that Synapse lets you set it to manual focus if you don’t plan to move all that much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wpJWJp"&gt;This webcam features omnidirectional microphones, though I highly recommend using a dedicated microphone or a headset equipped with one instead. What’s built into the Kiyo Pro is good in a pinch, and there’s a good amount of bass and clarity in my voice, but it’s a little quiet and echo-y by default. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Kiyo Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N8bca6H4ql71R6eQMT4B48MpnuY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22319959/cfaulkner_210219_4432_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resist the urge to twist the Kiyo Pro like a traditional camera lens. It’s unfortunately just for show.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oYxWKH"&gt;Razer’s Kiyo Pro is a competent webcam with a few unique traits. At $200, it obviously can’t compete with the fidelity of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21244380/webcam-camera-how-to-dslr-mirrorless-capture-card-usb-hdmi"&gt;DSLR or mirrorless camera that’s been repurposed as a webcam&lt;/a&gt; or even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21281765/webcam-phone-tablet-android-ios-pc-mac-how-to"&gt;a modern smartphone with webcam apps installed&lt;/a&gt;. But for the cost, it should stack up better than it does to Logitech’s Brio released in 2017. Instead, Razer made an equally pricey webcam with fewer features. If webcams ever become as tough to find in stock as they were in early 2020, it’ll be nice to have another option on the market. But presently, it’s tough to recommend this model outright.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Johnson &amp; Johnson’s single-shot vaccine is effective, FDA confirms</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Two Johnson &amp;amp;amp; Johnson vaccine vials on a surface." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QluIinvMNpV0wEUBhCn7eTsUbhs=/0x1:3500x2334/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68867491/1231237368.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine vials at the Klerksdorp Hospital in South Africa.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Phill Magakoe / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5Zaqwv"&gt;The one-dose COVID-19 vaccine made by Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson protects against severe disease and has no serious safety concerns, according to a new analysis &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/146217/download"&gt;published today&lt;/a&gt; by the US Food and Drug Administration. The report takes the vaccine one step closer to authorization by the agency, meaning the United States could have a third shot available in a matter of days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aLvTo8"&gt;The FDA has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22267984/covid-vaccine-johnson-fda-one-dose-review"&gt;spent the last three weeks&lt;/a&gt; reviewing data submitted by Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson. The company ran its clinical trial in the United States, South Africa, and Latin America. The vaccine was over 80 percent effective at preventing severe cases of COVID-19 in both South Africa and the United States. No one who was 28 days out from their dose of the vaccine was hospitalized with or died from COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Jl1vk"&gt;In the United States, the FDA found that the vaccine was 72 percent effective at preventing both severe and milder cases of the disease 28 days after the shot. That dropped to 64 percent in South Africa, where a variant form of the coronavirus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22255198/covid-vaccine-variant-update-mutation-south-africa-moderna"&gt;is circulating&lt;/a&gt;. COVID-19 vaccines don’t work as well against that variant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tAdU8G"&gt;Even though that drop is worrying, the FDA’s analysis of the South Africa data is actually more encouraging than the initial results released by Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson at the end of January. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22255968/johnson-and-johnson-covid-19-vaccine-single-shot-coronavirus"&gt;At that point&lt;/a&gt;, the vaccine appeared to be only 58 percent effective in the South Africa trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="96E2M7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Janssen/J&amp;amp;J vaccine data now posted. Consistent with other COVID vaccines, divergence in rates around 14 days and lower hospitalization rates.  &lt;a href="https://t.co/8HXOZDQSHZ"&gt;https://t.co/8HXOZDQSHZ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/5pDDByWFz8"&gt;pic.twitter.com/5pDDByWFz8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Nick Bennett (@nbennett04) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nbennett04/status/1364564588528734216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="taML6S"&gt;New data released by Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/146219/download"&gt;hinted&lt;/a&gt; that the vaccine could also protect people from asymptomatic infections (cases where people have the virus but never develop any symptoms). The company tested nearly 1,000 people in the clinical trial 71 days after they received a shot to check if they had antibodies against the coronavirus. If they had antibodies, that was a sign that they’d been infected with the virus (even if they never felt sick). Only two people who received the vaccine had antibodies, compared to 16 people who received a placebo shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nAXlKM"&gt;It’s a promising sign, even though the data is extremely limited. “Definitive conclusions cannot be drawn at this time,” the FDA wrote in its briefing document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PC4NtT"&gt;It’s difficult to compare the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine to those made by Pfizer / BioNTech and Moderna. Although those two vaccines appeared to be more effective against all cases of COVID-19 where people reported symptoms (around 95 percent), they were tested before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22255198/covid-vaccine-variant-update-mutation-south-africa-moderna"&gt;coronavirus variants&lt;/a&gt; were circulating widely. And even if it’s slightly less effective against mild and moderate disease, the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson shot only takes one dose and can be stored in refrigerators. The logistical benefits may counteract a slight drop in efficacy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B1ramu"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson is asking the FDA to authorize its vaccine for people 18 years of age and older. An independent advisory committee to the agency will meet on February 26th to review the data. The committee will decide if it thinks the FDA should authorize the vaccine, and if all goes well, that authorization could come as early as February 27th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RnLQgm"&gt;You can read the FDA’s full report &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/146217/download"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cult classic Star Wars: Republic Commando is getting remastered for the PS4 and Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/opHgIFh1lHAM3dG9pQ-NHuVZRuU=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68867443/PS4_Commando_Assault_SS.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Aspyr Media&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IqRSiz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Republic Commando&lt;/em&gt;, the mid-2000s cult classic tactical first-person shooter, will get a new life on modern consoles when an HD remaster releases on April 6th for PS4 and Switch for $14.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jwGG8y"&gt;Aspyr Media is handling the new version. The studio previously released a remaster for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21301436/star-wars-episode-1-racer-ps4-switch-release-price"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars Episode 1: Racer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the PS4 and Switch and is also working on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22280459/stubbs-the-zombie-remaster-release-date-pc-playstation-switch-xbox"&gt;remaster&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Stubbs the Zombie in Rebel Without a Pulse&lt;/em&gt;, which is set to launch on March 16th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jk4JK3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Republic Commando&lt;/em&gt; was originally released on the Xbox and PC in early 2005 and was developed and published by Lucasfilm Games, then known as LucasArts. Set during the Clone Wars, players assume the role of a squad leader consisting of four elite clone troopers as the squad travels to various planets completing missions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PqivSc"&gt;While the remaster is not coming to Xbox consoles, both Xbox One and Xbox Series X / S owners do have an opportunity to play the game on modern Microsoft gaming hardware. In 2018, Microsoft added &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Republic Commando&lt;/em&gt; as one of many Xbox original titles that were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/10/17220090/microsoft-xbox-backwards-compatibility-original-list-2018"&gt;playable via backwards compatibility&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Diablo IV’s art director on the gritty tone: ‘Darkness does not mean bleakness’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pYo3CTqXiB0etvdL2AAYIbB9AnY=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68867427/Diablo_IV_Rogue_Key_Art.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tAY8OC"&gt;When &lt;em&gt;Diablo II&lt;/em&gt; launched in 2000, it was praised for its grittiness, injecting a sense of realism into an otherwise dark, fantastical realm. With &lt;em&gt;Diablo III,&lt;/em&gt; things went in a more expressive direction, with a style that art director John Mueller describes as “painterly.” Now, with the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/em&gt;, Mueller says the goal is to blend those two approaches. “With technology the way it is now,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, “we can have the best of both worlds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zqkHmf"&gt;One of the challenges with a game like this is creating a world that feels dark and foreboding, yet also one that players want to spend hours and hours exploring. &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt; games are the kind that players typically lose themselves in, scouring dungeons for the best loot and teaming up with friends to explore the more perilous regions. In &lt;em&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/em&gt;, Mueller says one of the key features is the new open world, which lets the team create lots of different kinds of moments and feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="diablo 4" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RyXEX6kmhDsqykCszvA-PkoghcM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22325412/D4_Rogue_Group_InTown.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CliYA1"&gt;“When you’re in the world, you come across a lot of beautiful vistas,” he explains. “The world of &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt; is a medieval world, which means you’re either going through the countryside or the desert or the mountains. And while there are harsh storms and rain and there’s this living world aspect to it, there’s still day and night. It’s beautiful in the morning — even though you may have just killed a few goatmen in that field.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6q4mP6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I don’t think anything in the world of Diablo is pretty.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T0Uvkn"&gt;One of the main inspirations behind &lt;em&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/em&gt;’s look is the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_River_School"&gt;Hudson River School&lt;/a&gt; of painting, a mid-19th century movement that took landscapes and infused them with a Romantic Era vibe. It’s that same mix of beauty and darkness that Mueller and his team were aiming for in the next &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt; — albeit with a few more demons and skeleton warriors thrown in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VEVydI"&gt;“They had a darkness to them,” Mueller says of the Hudson River movement. “They weren’t pretty. And I don’t think anything in the world of &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt; is pretty. It’s like when you see a morning with mists in the field, it’s hard not to appreciate the beauty of it, but it’s not necessarily like, ‘Oh, that’s pretty, like a rainbow and sunshine.’ All of the regions in the world have a lot of natural beauty to them, and then when you go in the dungeons, that’s where we get kind of gruesome.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="diablo 4" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wDYy8PbQxp825fDVFvlOU21VTPI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22325415/D4_Rogue_Abilities_Caltrops.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ann9Cp"&gt;That new open world is also being used as a storytelling tool. Mueller and lead game designer Joe Shely say they’ve used this space to make Sanctuary, the setting of the &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt; franchise, into a more fully realized place. Different regions have their own unique cultures, which extends to the weapons and items you’ll collect as well as the characters you’ll talk to. “It’s great to have this persistent space where we can invest like that,” says Mueller. “It’s something that’s new to the franchise.” Shely adds, “One of the things that’s exciting about &lt;em&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/em&gt; is being able to see more of the world than ever before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJcTV4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/em&gt; still doesn’t have a release date — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22267131/diablo-4-overwatch-2-release-date-2022-activision-blizzard-earnings"&gt;Blizzard says not to expect it this year&lt;/a&gt; — but it’s coming during a busy period for the franchise. &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt; is expanding to mobile with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22180377/diablo-immortal-iphone-android-technical-alpha-preview"&gt;the upcoming spinoff &lt;em&gt;Immortal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and this year will also see the launch of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291766/diablo-2-resurrected-remaster-blizzcon-2021"&gt;the much-anticipated remaster of &lt;em&gt;Diablo II&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. With all that going on, it’s particularly important that the flagship title has its own distinct flavor. And in the case of &lt;em&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/em&gt;, it’s flavor built on balance. “Darkness does not mean bleakness,” says Mueller.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Foxconn will build a new electric vehicle for Fisker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CA7l7-m6WCnd4cdhEICcABiRYZ4=/0x0:2880x1920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68867352/Fisker_Ocean_Unveil_CES_and_Los_Angeles.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Fisker Inc.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m6BOyh"&gt;iPhone-maker Foxconn has agreed to build electric vehicles for Fisker Inc., the eponymous EV startup of automotive designer Henrik Fisker. In a memorandum of understanding &lt;a href="https://investors.fiskerinc.com/news/news-details/2021/Fisker-and-Foxconn-Set-to-Collaborate-on-Electric-Vehicle-Project/default.aspx"&gt;announced Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;, the two companies say Foxconn will build Fisker Inc.’s second vehicle, which has yet to be announced and is due out in late 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KLYk8N"&gt;Fisker &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/foxconn-to-build-cars-for-electric-vehicle-startup-fisker-11614169530?mod=pls_whats_news_us_business_f"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the companies are considering building the car in the US and that there’s a “very good chance” it may happen at Foxconn’s factory in Wisconsin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3QJsR"&gt;That factory, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump"&gt;former president Donald Trump called the “eighth wonder of the world” at the 2018 groundbreaking event&lt;/a&gt;, was originally supposed to be used to build LCD panels. Foxconn had promised a $10 billion investment that would result in a 20 million-square-foot facility and 13,000 jobs. But the company has invested a mere 3 percent of that total to date, and the biggest structure it has built on the site is a 1 million-square-foot building that was recently reclassified in official documents as a storage facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="qvWKLZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Inside Foxconn’s empty buildings, empty factories, and empty promises in Wisconsin","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="3ow27b"&gt;The companies claim they could eventually make 250,000 vehicles or more annually, half of Tesla’s current output. A more formal partnership is expected to be signed later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vtcGSD"&gt;Fisker Inc. is not due to start production on its first vehicle, the Ocean SUV, until the end of 2022. It has 12,000 reservations for the Ocean so far. That car will be built by automotive supplier Magna, which has its own electric vehicle program and assembles the I-Pace electric SUV for Jaguar Land Rover. Fisker Inc. had originally planned to partner up with Volkswagen to build the Ocean SUV and subsequent vehicles — the prototype of the Ocean was built on VW’s electric vehicle platform by a design subsidiary of the German automaker — but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349464/fisker-volkswagen-vw-ev-platform-deal-spaq-spac-spartan"&gt;those negotiations ultimately stalled&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PCcIwL"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I’m super excited about our collaboration with Foxconn! This vehicle is so revolutionary that we HAVE to keep is secret until the launch in end of 2023! It might be too futuristic for some!

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="60rt9m"&gt;Fisker joins a growing list of companies that Foxconn is working with on electric vehicles following the Taiwanese conglomerate’s announcement &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/iphone-to-electric-cars-foxconn-reveals-ev-platform-promises-battery-breakthroughs/"&gt;last year that it was entering the industry&lt;/a&gt;. Already this year, Foxconn announced it will build cars with Geely, China’s largest private automaker, as well as with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212994/byton-foxconn-electric-vehicles-china-shutdown-extended"&gt;floundering Chinese startup Byton&lt;/a&gt;. Geely has said that it &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sokane1/status/1354946644949807105?s=21"&gt;may leverage its partnership with Foxconn&lt;/a&gt; to help build cars for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22247942/faraday-future-spac-merger-public-psac-property-solutions-nasdaq"&gt;rebounding EV startup Faraday Future&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvVlqa"&gt;Foxconn also announced in January 2020 that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21069288/foxconn-fiat-chrysler-electric-vehicles-china-joint-venture"&gt;plans to make electric vehicles with Fiat Chrysler&lt;/a&gt;, which has since merged with France’s PSA Group to become a new automaker called Stellantis. The status of that joint venture is unclear; Foxconn has not responded to multiple requests for comment on the project over the last year, and a spokesperson for Fiat Chrysler repeatedly declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4T11pA"&gt;Interest in electric vehicles has skyrocketed in the last year in the wake of Tesla’s rising valuation. A number of startups, Fisker Inc. among them, have gone public and collectively raised billions of dollars. The boom has attracted big companies from other industries, too, like Foxconn. Chinese search giant Baidu announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218903/china-baidu-geely-electric-cars-partnership-tech"&gt;it will work with Geely to make EVs&lt;/a&gt;. Alibaba formed a joint venture with SAIC, which is China’s largest carmaker, to develop electric vehicles. Ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570016/didi-chuxing-byd-electric-car-ride-hailing-china"&gt;working with major Chinese automaker BYD to make&lt;/a&gt; EVs. Phonemaker Xiaomi &lt;a href="https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202102/1216030.shtml"&gt;is also reportedly getting into electric vehicles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3orfbv"&gt;Perhaps most famously, Apple is exploring an entry into EVs and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/14/22283574/nissan-apple-car-discussions-report-denial-hyundai"&gt;has been in talks with automakers around the globe&lt;/a&gt; in hopes of finding the right manufacturing partner. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>E-bikes are expensive, but this congressman wants to make them more affordable</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An Electric Bike Store As Sales Jump During Coronavirus" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z7rOHgKbXKLjw-eYKaC3Shj_Hl0=/1x0:5016x3343/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68867293/1212203103.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fkRYu4"&gt;Electric bikes can transform the way we live by replacing car trips, encouraging cities to improve their infrastructure, and decreasing the amount of carbon we emit into the atmosphere. But e-bikes will be transformational only if people can afford them — and as of today, most e-bikes are prohibitively expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4WlWEQ"&gt;Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-OR) wants to change this. The 72-year-old congressman from Portland has introduced a bill to help make e-bikes cheaper, and thus more accessible. Along with Rep. Jimmy Panetta (D-CA), Blumenauer helped author the Electric Bicycle Incentive Kickstart for the Environment (E-BIKE) Act, which would give a refundable tax credit of 30 percent on the purchase of a new e-bike. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M1hRjS"&gt;“The bottom line here is to fully capitalize on the power of bicycles to really transform the mobility landscape for metropolitan areas,” Blumenauer told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It’s important to have the full range [of transportation modes], and the e-bike is one that really has captured some people’s imagination and has enabled more people to participate.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EcA9RMtdoV205sJKU08TYeBXJBw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22321071/Bike_Commute_Portland.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rep. Earl Blumenauer is the co-author of a bill that would incentive e-bike purchases.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="J8FENA"&gt;The credit, which would be capped at $1,500, is only applicable on purchases of a new e-bike that costs less than $8,000. (There are a few luxury cargo bikes that exceed that amount but not many.) All three e-bike classes would be eligible for the tax credit, but bikes with motors more powerful than 750W would not. The credit would also be fully refundable, which the congressman argues would allow lower-income individuals to claim the credit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EZuhv6"&gt;You can only get the tax credit once every three years as an individual or twice for a joint-return couple buying two. The bill also requires the IRS to submit a report after two years to understand the distribution of the credit by income tax bracket and adjust for equity in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ho7rTy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The e-bike is one that really has captured some people’s imagination”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qE9mBP"&gt;Blumenauer is an unsurprising advocate for this legislation. He founded Congress’ informal Bike Caucus in 1996; since then, it’s grown to over 100 members. The homepage for the Bike Caucus features the congressman in a nerdy ensemble of shorts, knee-high socks, a long-sleeved oxford and bowtie, and a bike helmet. But while he doesn’t own an e-bike himself, he does frequently commute to work on a non-electric Trek road bike. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YbjfcH"&gt;The E-BIKE Act may seem as if it was inspired by the bike boom that emerged from the coronavirus pandemic and ensuing lockdowns, but Blumenauer said it was in the works before COVID-19 upended everything. During the lockdown, people looking for new ways to exercise or for a new way to get around that wasn’t public transportation flocked to bicycles, with sales in the US reaching record levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aSqLyn"&gt;Blumenauer said he’s thrilled so many people have discovered cycling but that policy changes will be needed to ensure that people don’t ditch their two-wheeled vehicles for four-wheeled ones as soon as the pandemic begins to dissipate.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xvqZSw"&gt;“The federal government has not done a good enough job investing in the safety, not just of cyclists but pedestrians as well,” he said. “Far disproportionate injuries and deaths by cyclists and pedestrians in large measure is the result of not having the appropriate infrastructure, having bike paths, having pedestrian access, and making streets safe for people, not just mini speedways for cars.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IktxVX"&gt;The impetus for the legislation is about shifting people away from cars to more sustainable forms of transportation, Blumenauer said. A recent study found that if 15 percent of car trips were made by e-bike, &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.bicycling.com_news_a33798099_e-2Dbikes-2Dcan-2Dreduce-2Dcarbon-2Demissions-2Dstudy_-23-3A-7E-3Atext-3DTake-2520an-2520E-252DBike-2520to-2Cemissions-2520would-2520drop-252012-2520percent.-26text-3DResearch-2520from-2520a-2520recent-2520study-2Creducing-2520carbon-2520emissions-2520in-2520cities.&amp;amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;amp;c=L93KkjKsAC98uTvC4KvQDdTDRzAeWDDRmG6S3YXllH0&amp;amp;r=Kaw85Xe8TfA6OxCjbhxHHlKZN2OTQje-DKAJWPsTvmQ&amp;amp;m=TGIC8E3VcNB9fNV9rlqspnybSAaSvRDYUI4CaLwl9B4&amp;amp;s=pn6j7tb5RRf9wPkw9K3jBBueYbBKOGZTr8pdj7KdhkQ&amp;amp;e="&gt;carbon emissions would drop by 12 percent&lt;/a&gt;. Nearly 50 percent of e-bike commute trips replaced automobile commute trips, &lt;a href="https://www.calbike.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/A-North-American-Survey-of-Electric-Bicycle-Owners.pdf"&gt;according to a recent North American survey&lt;/a&gt;, and a more thorough review of European studies &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965856415301865"&gt;showed that e-bike trips replaced car trips 47 to 76 percent of the time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7D6Nk4"&gt;With Democrats in control of the House, Senate, and White House, Blumenauer expects his bill will gain enough support to pass. The shift in Washington has also influenced him to introduce a more generous version of a bike commuter bill that would make available pre-tax commuter benefits similar to those who drive or take public transportation to work. A previous version of the bill failed to get through the House Ways and Means Committee. But Blumenauer said he’s confident both bills will get a hearing this time around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fVjygy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“These are things that have really ripened and taken hold.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zwPNrj"&gt;“These are things that have really ripened and taken hold,” said Blumenauer, citing the number of bike-share systems that have added e-bikes to their fleets. Those systems should be designated as mass transit, making them eligible for federal funding, he added. “We have more support from the public and more and more support in Congress.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="usmge8"&gt;A smart move may be to wrap Blumenauer’s bill in with President Joe Biden’s Build Back Better infrastructure proposal, which the president hopes to address after the approval of a new COVID-19 rescue package. The Oregon Democrat said he sees the new administration as a natural ally for his bike bills: Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg speaks openly about the need to make the roads safe for vulnerable road users, like bicyclists and pedestrians, and Biden is an avid cyclist himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EVJLmb"&gt;“When is the last time you saw Donald Trump on a bike,” Blumenauer laughs.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wThTk5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile has 5G leverage and isn’t afraid to use it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OVKcu2qMlEhiNYS9VyX_VG9hVg4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68867161/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="azC2BE"&gt;T-Mobile created a lot of buzz this week when it announced it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295466/t-mobile-magenta-max-unlimited-data-5g-4k-video-announced"&gt;bringing back an unlimited plan&lt;/a&gt; without data throttling. In the age of data caps and deprioritization, that seems like a pretty nice deal — and it might be. But as always, there’s more at play here than T-Mobile just offering a better unlimited plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FRP5Eu"&gt;T-Mobile says its new plan, Magenta Max, is truly unlimited. It includes 4K video streaming and high-speed data without deprioritization, where all other “unlimited” plans impose slowdowns once a user hits certain thresholds. T-Mobile chief marketing officer Matt Staneff confirmed in a call with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; yesterday that there are no strings attached to the deprioritization bit — it’s all-you-can-eat 5G data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RISIqI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;T-Mobile says its new plan, Magenta Max, is truly unlimited&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zTYmnm"&gt;There is one string to be aware of, though. There is a 40GB cap on tethering, after which customers will get 3G data. But T-Mobile insists there’s no other funny business. For example, there are no limits on 4K video streaming, provided the streaming service you’re using offers it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M9wdiI"&gt;That’s notable because, according to the carriers, data deprioritization was imposed out of necessity to maintain network performance. Verizon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/12/14592822/verizon-unlimited-data-plan-announced-2017"&gt;reintroduced unlimited data plans&lt;/a&gt; in 2017, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/22/16181362/verizon-new-unlimited-data-plan-video-throttling-net-neutrality"&gt;shortly after, it imposed&lt;/a&gt; video quality limits and data deprioritization. In so many words, Verizon claimed this move was necessary because the network couldn’t handle the added congestion of unlimited subscribers. It wasn’t alone: throttling and reduced streaming video quality were standard practices across all major carriers at that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="T8uDjG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Let’s remember why T-Mobile has all of that sweet, sweet mid-band spectrum: Sprint&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GOrgtW"&gt;So how can T-Mobile afford to offer truly unlimited data now? According to the company, the difference is 5G. Specifically, the mid-band frequencies that T-Mobile uses for much of its 5G network allow for higher data capacities than 4G and are more robust than the narrow low-band frequencies Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T rely on for their nationwide 5G coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wLE3N8"&gt;But let’s remember why T-Mobile has all of that sweet, sweet mid-band spectrum: Sprint. The acquisition gave T-Mobile access to Sprint’s network, but it also effectively cut major wireless carrier options in the US from four to three. A federal judge &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21132924/tmobile-sprint-merger-approved-federal-court-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;allowed T-Mobile to go ahead with the deal&lt;/a&gt;, but under certain terms, that would help boost competition and (hopefully) consumer choice in other ways. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sprint / T-Mobile" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-InIUQ-LGioMTtAPRzCh4DYJ40w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9568273/IMG_20171025_120004_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;T-Mobile’s strong 5G network is due to its acquisition of Sprint last year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Izcydv"&gt;T-Mobile’s follow-through on those conditions has been a mixed bag. It did as promised by spinning off Sprint’s prepaid Boost Mobile business and selling it to Dish Network. Dish was allowed to lease T-Mobile’s network as an MVNO while it builds its own 5G offerings, another part of the deal. The good news is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295777/dish-network-5g-q3-2021"&gt;Dish looks to be serious&lt;/a&gt; about bringing its network online soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0uj08h"&gt;The bad news is Dish’s current wireless business &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/financial/dish-sheds-363k-wireless-subs-warns-t-mobile-3g-shutdown"&gt;looks a little shaky right now&lt;/a&gt; and could face further setbacks if T-Mobile moves ahead with its 3G CDMA shutdown early next year, which many of Dish’s customers currently use. While that doesn’t technically violate the terms of the agreement, Dish chairman and co-founder Charlie Ergen &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/open-ran/dish-to-launch-5g-in-major-city-by-end-of-q3-/d/d-id/767565"&gt;called it an “anti-competitive” move&lt;/a&gt; that would clearly benefit T-Mobile and harm Dish’s efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cTaUYh"&gt;So while T-Mobile’s unlimited plan is undoubtedly good for customers who sign up for it, the deal that made it possible might have weakened the US cellular industry as a whole. It’s possible, though, that we may see other benefits from T-Mobile offering this plan as it might put pressure on Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T to follow suit. It wouldn’t be the first time the self-named Uncarrier pushed the more established companies to expand their offerings. (See also: the return of unlimited plans several years ago.) We’ve asked AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon for comment and will update this article if we receive information from them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TMDSOq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;T-Mobile has extra incentive to attract new customers in the short term&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Dv6Dk0"&gt;Another reason T-Mobile may be offering this plan now is to take advantage of its comparatively strong 5G performance before AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon get their hands on more mid-band spectrum as a result of the &lt;a href="https://auctiondata.fcc.gov/public/projects/auction107"&gt;recently concluded C-band auction&lt;/a&gt;. It won’t be until the end of this year or early 2022 that their customers will start seeing the benefits of the additional frequencies, so T-Mobile has extra incentive to attract new customers in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UdPax2"&gt;It’s also likely that the specifics of the plan will shift as the market and networks change. Wireless plans are notoriously complicated, and carriers will continue to change them when it makes good business sense to do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AON4wV"&gt;So what’s a phone plan shopper to do? The best bet might be to jump on a good deal like this while it’s around if it makes sense for you and / or your family. Existing subscribers are often grandfathered in when plans inevitably change and may get to hang on to some of the benefits. Carriers are going to look out for their bottom line, so it’s a good idea to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTixTZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5nPYd3"&gt;YouTube is announcing “supervised experiences,” a new set of restrictions that allows parents to better control what content their children can access on the streaming video platform. According to a &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/supervised-experiences-for-families-on-youtube"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, YouTube hopes the filters will help parents slowly introduce their older children to age-appropriate content and features outside of the YouTube Kids app. The program will launch first with an early beta, with a wider beta rolling out “in the coming months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="psHndH"&gt;Parents have three levels of strictness to choose from, which determines the content a child is allowed to view on their account. There’s the “Explore” level, which YouTube says is “generally suitable” for kids nine and up’ “Explore More,” which is meant for kids 13 and up; and “Most of YouTube,” which is pretty much everything except age-restricted content. In the US, &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1350409#zippy="&gt;and most other countries&lt;/a&gt;, people over the age of 13 can make their own unsupervised YouTube accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h0p8OAQ5nQ_TrCUvkoYNedOn8XM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22324445/Supervised_Experiences_Content_settings.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Parents choose a content level for their children’s account.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EpUbXH"&gt;It isn’t clear exactly what content will be allowed at which levels, but YouTube says the “Explore” level will have “vlogs, tutorials, gaming videos, music clips, news, educational content and more.” As the name suggests, the “Explore More” level will have a wider range of videos, as well as live streams for the aforementioned “Explore” categories. The company says that “Most of YouTube” will contain “sensitive topics that may only be appropriate for older teens.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9lClh"&gt;For all its promise, YouTube’s supervised experiences is still a system that relies on user input, human review, and machine learning. YouTube knows it won’t be perfect, admitting that it “will make mistakes,” which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/culture/2017/11/21/16685874/kids-youtube-video-elsagate-creepiness-psychology"&gt;we’ve seen happen with the Kids app&lt;/a&gt;. As such, parents shouldn’t think of it as a “set it and forget it” solution. They’ll still need to remain vigilant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EmQEq9"&gt;Nevertheless, the new content options should help parents with children who feel too confined by the Kids app (which YouTube still recommends for younger kids) but are too impressionable to be exposed to the full YouTube experience. YouTube can be a dangerous place full of misinformation and conspiracy, so it’s good to see Google giving parents tools to help ease their children into it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ring’s new Video Doorbell Pro 2 captures a taller image and has enhanced motion detection</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zrbI4rsqudgtwZfu9Zn77VuHzzc=/132x0:1770x1092/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68867093/Ring_Video_Doorbell_Pro_2_intro_desktop_1456x546_2x.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ring Video Doorbell Pro 2.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Ring&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RyNQEl"&gt;Ring has announced the latest model in its line of video doorbells, the Video Doorbell Pro 2. The Pro 2 is a new top-of-the-line model that comes with a number of enhancements over its predecessor, including a taller field of view and enhanced motion detection capabilities. It is available to preorder for $249.99 starting today, with shipments expected to begin on March 31st, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5wwPOU"&gt;The most significant update for the Pro 2 is its new square video capture. First popularized by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/3/17312166/nest-hello-yale-lock-smart-home-review"&gt;Google’s Nest Hello&lt;/a&gt; and adopted by many other video doorbells, this field of view makes it possible to see who is at your door from head to toe. It also makes it possible to see when packages are left on the ground in front of the doorbell. The Pro 2 captures a 1536 x 1536 pixel image and is the first Ring model to not use the traditional 16:9 wide view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CbeAwA"&gt;The second big upgrade is in the Pro 2’s motion detection. Ring is calling this new feature “3D Motion Detection” and says it allows you to “pin point the location and time a motion event begins.” In addition, a new Bird’s Eye View shows you a top-down image of the motion detected, letting you see where someone traversed your property from above. Ring says it’s possible to customize the specific point where the new motion detection and video recording begins, thanks to new radar sensors on the Pro 2. You can also customize other motion and privacy zones, much like you can do with Ring’s other cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FHDBOgFOEw9-aCe7C9nhYd1h4WE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22324548/ring_video_doorbell_wired_pro_head_to_toe_desktop_715x883_2x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ring&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Video Doorbell Pro 2 captures a square video image, allowing you to see someone head to toe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NHTqH-liv8YBvpftqUbjJSKS3c8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22324552/card_app_timeline_doorbell_pro2_469x469_2x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ring&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pro 2 has a new motion detection system that gives you a top-down view of detected motion events.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0P1ZCY"&gt;Ring also says the Pro 2’s audio features have been improved with an array microphone, and new preset replies can be set for when you’re not home. Those who subscribe to a Ring Protect Plan can utilize &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22279020/alexa-ring-doorbell-greeting-quick-replies"&gt;Alexa Greetings&lt;/a&gt;, which offers a more advanced answering machine service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kvxvIy"&gt;Like the prior Video Doorbell Pro, the Pro 2 is a wired model and does not use a battery. That means you need to have doorbell wiring in place or be willing to wire power to it if you want to install it at your door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8iOFJ2"&gt;Competition in the video doorbell space has heated up a bit in the past few years, with a number of new entrants bringing innovative features to the space. Ring, which can be credited with popularizing the idea of a video doorbell, has mostly been criticized for its privacy policies and police partnerships over the past few years. That hasn’t stopped it from being the most common video doorbell and the de facto brand when people think of this product category. The Pro 2 is Ring’s answer to a lot of those new competitors, and it will be interesting to see how it performs once we’re able to give it a test.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HP is buying gaming accessory brand HyperX for $425 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q1M6Wly11Dc6tj33nCDS-g3M6a0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68866993/cfaulkner_201016_4245_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3O5w1x"&gt;HP has announced that it is &lt;a href="https://press.hp.com/us/en/press-releases/2021/hp-inc-to-acquire-hyperx.html"&gt;acquiring gaming peripheral company HyperX&lt;/a&gt; for $425 million. The purchase will give HP a major foothold in the gaming accessory market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S2Sna6"&gt;This transaction will result in HP buying the HyperX brand from Kingston, the current owner, but HP notes in the announcement post that “Kingston will retain the DRAM, flash, and SSD products for gamers and enthusiasts.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FdivnM"&gt;HP has been making strides to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/2/21274815/hp-omen-gaming-mice-vector-essential-x1000-wireless-pc-ps4-headset"&gt;enter the gaming peripheral space&lt;/a&gt; for the last several years under the Omen brand, but it has not gained much traction compared to competitors such as Corsair, Logitech, and Razer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G95xbb"&gt;HP told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the Ngenuity companion app used for some HyperX accessories will continue to exist and will not be rolled into the Omen Control Center software used at this time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M2BHrb"&gt;HyperX is one of the most notable brands in this market, with gaming accessories including its line of &lt;a href="https://www.hyperxgaming.com/unitedstates/us/headsets"&gt;Cloud headsets&lt;/a&gt;, which are among the bestselling gaming headsets right now. Gaming headsets aside, HyperX’s portfolio has a variety of gaming accessories from gaming keyboards to microphones. Most recently, HyperX announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22203383/hyperx-alloy-origins-60-percent-mechanical-gaming-keyboard-price-release-date"&gt;first 60 percent mechanical gaming keyboard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
