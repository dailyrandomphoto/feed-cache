    <title>Active Pack accessories prepare your Oculus Quest 2 for sweaty VR workouts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kFenxBtPkeByiLWL2mHM5cpzugg=/367x0:2326x1306/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70058029/Screen_Shot_2021_10_28_at_10.29.10.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uTRitL"&gt;Facebook has announced the Active Pack, a set of fitness-focused accessories for the Oculus Quest 2 that are designed to help turn the VR headset into a piece of gym equipment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IwCRDn"&gt;Included in the Active Pack are a set of grips designed to keep the Touch controllers from flying out of your hands when you’re, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746070/supernatural-vr-workout-app-adds-boxing-oculus-quest"&gt;doing a boxing workout in Supernatural&lt;/a&gt;. There’s also an easy-to-clean face pad, so you don’t have to gunk up your normal foam one if you use your Quest 2 for both exercise and entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6XEe1W"&gt;The Active Pack will ship “next year,” according to Facebook. While Facebook is clearly making it for those who have been turning to VR for their workouts during the pandemic, it’s also easy to imagine this could be popular with businesses and gyms once shared VR headsets become acceptable and safe again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MEZxVY"&gt;If a gym offered in-person VR classes, or a museum offered a VR experience, I’d feel much better trying it out if I knew that the surfaces touching my hands and face were meant to be easily cleaned.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mercedes-Benz cars are getting Dolby Atmos in 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WpVxK_Cb_8yVJ5hYaRHkmnjX04c=/544x0:6418x3916/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70057979/405297_Dolby_Atmos_16zu9_0cdd0f_original_1635406513.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Daimler AG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1M1hNF"&gt;Mercedes-Benz is the latest car company looking to bolster its audio systems with Dolby Atmos. The luxury vehicle company is planning to add support for the 3D sound standard through its optional Burmester stereo add-on for high-end models starting in summer 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nFgEP"&gt;Mercedes-Benz isn’t the first car company to offer Atmos; that honor goes to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336339/lucid-air-electric-car-dolby-atmos-sxsw"&gt;the Lucid Air electric sedan&lt;/a&gt;, which just started shipping and is the first car to support Dolby Atmos thanks to its 21 speaker “Surreal Sound” system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="w2EKjn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The cheapest S-Class with Atmos will start at $117,580&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mftvQf"&gt;But Mercedes-Benz’s implementation of Atmos looks to go even further, with a whopping 31 speakers scattered around the car (a list that includes six 3D speakers above passengers, four “near-ear” speakers for the two front seats, and an 18.5-liter subwoofer). Each seat also features two hidden &lt;a href="https://www.daytonaudio.com/topic/excitersbuyerguide"&gt;exciters&lt;/a&gt; apiece (for a total of eight in the car), and everything is powered by two amplifiers with a total of 1,750 watts of power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SkCVou"&gt;To start, Mercedes is offering Atmos in its top-of-the-line Maybach model, followed later by its S-Class cars featuring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21316700/mercedes-benz-mbux-second-generation-infotainment-system-touchscreen-hey-mercedes"&gt;its new MBUX infotainment system&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, given the price of both the Mercedes Maybach and S-Class cars, having the hardware to get the full Atmos experience won’t be cheap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lq4bcA"&gt;The entry-level S-Class vehicle, a 2021 S 500 4Matic sedan, starts at $110,850, and the Burmester 4D surround sound add-on that’s necessary for Atmos is an additional $6,730. Customers of the top-of-the-line Maybach model won’t have to worry, though — the upgraded sound system is already included in the base $185,950 price tag. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oculus users are getting a new metaverse home</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Horizon Home in an Oculus VR headset" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AEcGHAWuXtTIVtKjHBK5PBAPgRA=/499x0:2827x1552/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70057957/Screen_Shot_2021_10_28_at_12.11.35_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yHLWqo"&gt;Facebook is announcing a new, “more social” home space for Oculus users. Called Horizon Home, it looks a lot like the virtual home that people already have in their virtual reality headsets. But users will be able to invite friends to hang out and watch videos or start multiplayer games together, and they’ll eventually be able to customize their space, although that’s “a little further out.” Horizon Home will launch in an Oculus update soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1wofn8"&gt;Home joins Horizon Worlds and Horizon Workrooms — as well as events app Horizon Venues, previously known as Venues — as part of Facebook’s “metaverse” hub. A video shows users getting pop-up messages inside VR games, as well as on their phones outside VR, then popping into the same virtual space. In addition to the Home update, Facebook is adding Messenger audio calls to VR, supplementing the text-only option it started supporting earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Slack and Dropbox are coming to Oculus Quest</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Oculus Quest 2D Apps" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dKhEJ-Ra8RycDCTd1Pnhzlwlb_I=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70057955/2D_apps_in_Home.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook Reality Labs&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eovF8M"&gt;Facebook is adding 2D apps from third-party developers to its Oculus Quest virtual reality platform. The new feature is aimed at giving people more tools to work in VR using the Progressive Web App (PWA) framework. It’s starting with Facebook, Instagram, collaboration app Smartsheet, and email client Spike, then adding Dropbox, Monday.com, Mural, My5, Pluto TV, and Slack in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8k7MTi"&gt;Oculus has supported a 2D browser (which opens as a flat window in virtual space) for some time, and you could sideload 2D apps on the Quest, which runs a version of Android. Some Oculus apps also blur the line between VR and 2D apps: Horizon Workrooms, for instance, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Fzoom-meets-virtual-reality-announcing-zooms-collaboration-with-horizon-workrooms%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;will support Zoom calls in the future&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook Messenger &lt;a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/oculus-quest-2-update-facebook-messenger/"&gt;launched on Quest&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. This update marks a larger-scale rollout of non-VR apps inside the headset. The PWA-based framework means developers don’t need to build fully custom VR versions of an app, although it looks like they’ll still need to go through the normal Oculus developer channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JAuYoN"&gt;These 2D apps are launching on the Oculus Store alongside a larger revamp of Facebook’s VR work strategy. Where earlier Oculus Quest business headsets were a distinct product, Facebook is now introducing a suite of apps called Quest for Business that will run on ordinary Quest hardware. This means companies can use Quest headsets to run consumer-focused apps as well, while users will log in with a new system called Work Accounts that’s administered by businesses instead of a personal Facebook account. Corporate IT departments will be able to manage the devices remotely, with support for Microsoft Intune, VMware Workspace ONE, and Ivanti UEM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qxSYF9"&gt;Facebook will begin testing Quest for Business and Work Accounts in a closed beta later this year, aiming to launch a full version in 2023. It will wind down the existing Oculus for Business program later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7wMEQu"&gt;Work is a key part of Facebook’s vision for a VR and AR-oriented “metaverse” internet. While much of that involves creating a sense that you’re physically in a workspace with your colleagues, it also requires incorporating the tools people already use — even if they’re in 2D.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is adding a mixed reality platform to Oculus Quest</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An example of Passthrough API" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PSVlBRZ6VOF7f446xPLhpefJ7W0=/277x0:2494x1478/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70057953/passthrough_api_facebook.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zGMtRF"&gt;At this year’s &lt;a href="https://www.facebookconnect.com/en-us/"&gt;Facebook Connect&lt;/a&gt;, the platform revealed something called the Presence Platform, a new way for developers to create mixed reality experiences for the Oculus Quest virtual reality headset. It includes a suite of AI tools for developers that makes the mixed reality experience more immersive, helping to combine the virtual world with physical reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lc8MzY"&gt;The system includes three main tool sets: Insight SDK, Interaction SDK, and Voice SDK. Insight, which builds on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590794/oculus-mixed-reality-api-quest-2-development-kit-unity"&gt;the Passthrough API&lt;/a&gt; that launched this summer, lets developers overlay virtual objects on the Oculus Quest’s passthrough video feed. Facebook is also adding a system called Spatial Anchors that will let developers “lock” a virtual object to a specific physical area so that object will maintain its position in the world. While the Passthrough API launched as an Oculus Quest 2 exclusive, Facebook tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the new platform will support both generations of Quest headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TYZatA"&gt;Scene Understanding is the final piece of Insight SDK, which allows developers to build virtual reality experiences that match the scale of the player’s room. Facebook notes that as an example, “you can attach a virtual screen to the user’s wall or have a virtual character navigate on the floor with realistic occlusion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oF6Q70"&gt;The second tool set, Interaction SDK, is supposed to make it easier for developers to integrate controller and hand-centric interactions. Facebook is making the Unity library available to developers next year, and as a part of it, developers will be able to incorporate ready-made interactive elements, such as “grab,” “poke,” “select,” and “target.” It offers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/18/21260554/oculus-quest-anniversary-hand-tracking-third-party-games-beat-saber-tracks"&gt;improved hand tracking&lt;/a&gt; and gives developers the ability to create their own gestures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s7nanX"&gt;Lastly, Voice SDK Experimental is a tool set powered by Facebook’s Wit.ai natural language platform. This can give users a hands-free virtual experience. It lets developers create Voice Navigation &amp;amp; Search functions, as well as a Voice FAQ that players can access by asking a question. Voice-Drive Gameplay could even give users the ability to utilize their voice while playing a game, such as when talking with an avatar or casting a voice-activated spell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oNJd9b"&gt;There’s been a lot of talk about the metaverse lately, considering that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22735612/facebook-change-company-name-metaverse"&gt;Facebook wants to change its name&lt;/a&gt; so it can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview"&gt;properly become “a metaverse company.”&lt;/a&gt; And according to Facebook, the Presence Platform “will be key to feeling connected in the metaverse” — by letting developers blend virtual content with the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4kEqCs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apex Legends: Escape takes the battle royale shooter on vacation at the perfect time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LdThKgGDSKYMsaNhYfBq0tSlNMU=/156x0:1844x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70057855/Screenshot_11_2000.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: EA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iyKP8D"&gt;In the years since Respawn and EA launched &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;, the shooter has carved out its place among a crowded field of contenders. Other games have tried to enter the market and failed to make much impact alongside the other battle royale titans like &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. Still, despite a healthy player base and competitive scene, a new update, &lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/escape"&gt;dubbed Escape&lt;/a&gt;, arrives following one of the roughest seasons &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/4/18209895/fortnite-apex-legends-respawn-ea-battle-royale-free-release-date-hands-on"&gt;since the debut&lt;/a&gt;, and it might be exactly what the game needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7u6v8n"&gt;Last season’s new character, Seer, drew criticism from many players until Respawn nerfed his special abilities. Then that change led to its own controversy, as players accused the developers of intentionally releasing heroes with overpowered abilities to coax more money out of participants in this “free” game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TQSEY4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Respawn’s team says it is “doubling down” on efforts to deal with connection problems&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5LpJsf"&gt;And all of that happened before the servers started to act up. While disconnections have always been an issue with &lt;em&gt;Apex&lt;/em&gt;, recently, it’s felt like more rounds of the game started with one or more of my teammates disconnected than not. Frequently, I was the one dropped at the beginning of a game, restarting it only to find we’d dropped into a raging firefight or that my teammates had already died or left. Speaking to the developers, they addressed the issues upfront, saying they’re doubling down on efforts to deal with connection problems and lag, as well as ways to make the game use less bandwidth.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MlEfiI"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CetTZ9cYPd4?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=1&amp;amp;start=1" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6HzBBE"&gt;This all brings us to the Escape update, which adds a new island map and a new character on November 2nd, albeit one that players are familiar with. Ash is the game’s first playable character to make the jump directly from &lt;em&gt;Titanfall 2&lt;/em&gt;, although she has made appearances in the game’s associated lore of comics and special events for several seasons and even served as an announcer for the game’s Arenas mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uTlb4r"&gt;Ash is a simulacrum with a background that splits the difference between the game’s other mechanical characters, Revenant and Pathfinder. A look at her character trailer, as well as that of a previously added legend, Horizon, will explain her backstory, but the most interesting thing about her is the abilities she adds to the battlefield. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Ash’s ultimate ability Phase Breach tears a hole in reality that you can teleport through" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YyioNM0x4-FVdVe_RVc-dkkuQmw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22963623/Apex_Legends_2021_10_20_13_22_07.mp4_snapshot_10.10.561.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Ash’s ultimate ability Phase Breach tears a hole in reality that you can teleport through&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DFJf6K"&gt;While her teleportation ability is similar to what players have seen since season one with Wraith, it operates on a line of sight, and in some hands-on time, I found it a lot easier to use as a shortcut into or out of a firefight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y2pdpP"&gt;She’s also the first character who can take advantage of the death boxes fallen enemies leave laying around full of any stuff players have collected. She shoves a data knife into the box and pings the location of any living teammates. Her tactical ability is the one I had the hardest time getting used to, as she fires an arc tether that shocks enemies and pins them to the ground temporarily, limiting their movement. It’s a versatile bundle of tracking, stun / crowd control, and movement that is fun to play when you get it right and didn’t feel overpowered.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8GxTBMvzdcBDlVJ8TrWMIpjBKuU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22963610/Apex_Legends_2021_10_20_13_22_07.mp4_snapshot_00.07.005.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="X9ezi1"&gt;Versatility is a theme in the new season, as the new map Storm Point is the biggest one we’ve seen so far, with so many areas I didn’t get a chance to visit all of them. Like Ash, the C.A.R. SMG is a weapon adding another Titanfall transfer to the game, but with the unique ability to switch between light and heavy ammunition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z5URCI"&gt;In my time playing with some creators and media members, it felt like the map was designed to deal with some of the issues players have complained about, like constant third-partying, by adding more area combined with structures that keep sounds from echoing across open space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bg0bxy"&gt;One of the things the team has been thinking about is how to balance the game across experienced players who have been dropping in for years and new players trying to adjust. In a conversation with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, developers said they’re looking at ways to improve the new player experience and give them a better experience for their first few times playing the game.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gXexkBkPLlxtxAUYXh2_6j_aq_w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22963691/Screenshot_17.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: EA&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yo0ien"&gt;The new map is intended to both reset players’ experience and expectations and allow room for evolution going forward. The first two &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends &lt;/em&gt;maps, World’s Edge and King’s Canyon, were created before the game launched, and while they’ve changed over time, this one is built knowing changes will come, so they don’t need to destroy familiar locations just to fit new places in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rsrRkk"&gt;Is all of that enough to satisfy a player base that stretches from complete casuals to pro-level streamers to the esports elite? I think it has a good shot at restoring some of the joy to this game — the first time being I fought off an attack by spiders just before a late ring was more amazing than infuriating — but none of the new additions will matter if the servers don’t work. &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends: Escape&lt;/em&gt; will go live across the game’s various platforms on November 2nd.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Fi is getting end-to-end encrypted phone calls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UT20AjhGfYCnHCVpvZVCGFj89H0=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70057819/Outgoing_Call_UI.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A lock icon will appear in the Phone app when a call is end-to-end encrypted.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WjP4pu"&gt;In the coming weeks, Google is rolling out end-to-end encrypted phone calls on its Google Fi MVNO, the &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/google-fi/google-fi-end-to-end-encrypted-calls/"&gt;search giant announced today&lt;/a&gt;. When enabled, the feature means that no one, not even Google, can listen in on the contents of a call. Although it’s possible to have end-to-end encrypted audio calls through services like FaceTime and WhatsApp, Google Fi’s new feature makes it the default for regular phone calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hdGuyY"&gt;The feature is a little limited in its current form. Google’s end-to-end encryption will only kick in for calls between two Android phones, where both users are Google Fi subscribers. So, for now, at least, iPhone Google Fi subscribers won’t benefit. Google says you’ll know when a call is end-to-end encrypted because it’ll play a “unique dial tone” before it connects. There’ll also be a lock icon shown on screen if you’re making a call using Google’s Phone app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="a7QZRH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Rolling out in the coming weeks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="axz64X"&gt;A couple of other things to note: calls made via the Messages by Google app won’t be end-to-end encrypted, and it only works on one-on-one calls (so no conference calls). Leaving a voicemail is also not covered. The feature works over both Wi-Fi and cellular connections of LTE or greater, although somewhat confusingly, you turn it off by disabling the “Wi-Fi calling” option in the Google Fi app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IWZuqT"&gt;Over the years, Google has made privacy and security a core part of its pitch for Google Fi. In addition to the encrypted phone calls being announced today, the company also offers a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/13/18089834/project-fi-enhanced-network-vpn-privacy-google-announcement"&gt;built-in VPN for Fi users&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/fi/answer/9016293"&gt;attempts to block spam calls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Metroid Dread’s new demo lets you try one of the best games of the year for free</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4DwoXSVRoKp6rFtf7ryX8UNusK8=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70057556/screenshot01.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wbewcM"&gt;Nintendo is now offering a free demo of &lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt;, meaning you can try one of the best games of the year at no cost before plunking down the cash to buy the full game. You can grab the demo from &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/metroid-dread-switch/"&gt;Nintendo’s website&lt;/a&gt; (click the “Download Demo” link) or on the eShop on your Switch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yDNggp"&gt;If you’re on the fence about &lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt;, I really recommend you download the demo to give the game a shot. If you’ve played a 2D &lt;em&gt;Metroid&lt;/em&gt;, you’ll probably feel right at home, as &lt;em&gt;Dread&lt;/em&gt; is an excellent evolution of action and exploration the games are known for. But the game mixes up the formula a bit with tense chase sequences where you’re fleeing from powerful robots called E.M.M.I. The boss fights are also quite good, though there are a few too many of them, which can slow down the game’s pace. Check out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22710468/metroid-dread-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt; if you want to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to buy the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t6O_8_WhCd5DAKdSh1bdXxl0zUk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70016186/bfarsace_211014_4802_0013.10.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can now buy Google’s newest Pixels, pending availability.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p512wU"&gt;Google’s new Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22713338/google-pixel-6-event-top-announcements-tensor-processor-snapchat-pass"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22514428"&gt;reviewed&lt;/a&gt;, and are now up for order. These Pixels promise new designs, new cameras, a uniquely designed Google Tensor CPU, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="57DFat"&gt;This year’s Pixel phones come in two sizes: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;the standard Pixel 6 and the larger, triple-camera equipped Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. The base Pixel 6, with 128GB of storage, starts at $599, while the Pixel 6 Pro runs $899 and up if you prefer to go above the base 128GB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="samX3I"&gt;What’s new&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jTBVbQ"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;Pixel 6 and 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; look mostly nothing like prior iterations, with a metal-and-glass design highlighted by a rear camera bar that is slightly reminiscent of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/20/9571535/nexus-6p-review"&gt;classic Nexus 6P&lt;/a&gt;. The smaller Pixel 6, which cannot truly be considered small by any stretch of the imagination, has a 6.4-inch, 2400 x 1080 OLED display with a 90Hz refresh rate. The larger Pixel 6 Pro stretches its legs with a 6.7-inch, 120Hz LTPO OLED display with 3120 x 1440 resolution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzGN0n"&gt;On the inside, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22710844/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-ai-speed-specs-details"&gt;Google’s brand-new Tensor processor&lt;/a&gt; powers both, while the Pixel 6 gets 8GB of RAM and the 6 Pro has 12GB. The new chips have a lot to prove for Google, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22727944/google-pixel-6-pro-cameras-computational-photography-features"&gt;just as the new camera systems do&lt;/a&gt;, with the Pixel 6 housing a dual-camera setup and the 6 Pro adding a third camera and lens to its rear bar. The phones match each other with 50MP main cameras and a 12MP ultrawide, but only the Pro counterpart gets a 48MP sensor complete with telephoto 4x optical zoom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kpMCfQ"&gt;Time will tell if all this hardware and new camera software brings the Pixels back to the top of the pack, but in the meantime, let’s look at how the Pixel 6 phones are configured and made available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="x26RG3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here’s how the Pixel 6 compares to the Pixel 6 Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22724481/google-pixel-6-pro-specs-comparison-price"},{"title":"Sundar Pichai and Rick Osterloh think the Pixel 6 is Google’s breakout phone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22733159/sundar-pichai-rick-osterloh-google-pixel-6-interview-podcast"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="af9xF5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10816444"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qoPTwM"&gt;Where to buy the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3iYB8E"&gt;&lt;a href="https://store.google.com/category/phones?hl=en-US"&gt;Google kicked off orders first on its own store&lt;/a&gt;, right as the phone became official. Now we’ve reached the launch date for the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, though, like most phone launches these days, there are some shipping delays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="In20xd"&gt;Currently, &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/category/phones?hl=en-US"&gt;Google’s store&lt;/a&gt; indicates that some models of the Pixel 6 Pro are out of stock or have long delivery times. This seems to affect the unlocked model the most, which is listed as out of stock with only an option to be added to a waitlist for some configurations. There are some Verizon and Google Fi models available in the Google Store, and the current stock shortage is not yet affecting the regular Pixel 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZO9lWc"&gt;We will update this post as more options become available, but we can immediately see how some models are not available everywhere — if a 512GB Pixel 6 Pro is your jam, your only option is to purchase an unlocked one from Google once it’s in stock. As far as general availability at retailers, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfO5wFAh05o" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-5g-unlocked-128gb%2F-%2FA-84683612%3Fpreselect%3D83607398%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergepixel6preorders" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1665071-REG%2Fgoogle_ga02900_us_pixel_6_dual_sim_128gb.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22734748%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-pro-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt; all have some Pixel 6 availability, but Pixel 6 Pros are mostly unavailable or sold out. Unlocked models seem to have the greatest scarcity, with better chances of getting a carrier-locked version. The carrier stores seem to have higher stock levels, so if you want to get the phone as soon as possible, it might be your best chance — particularly if you want the Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FfBJXi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10815891"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="ZBa1GT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10815902"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gHSBMR"&gt;Carrier deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qBhCBk"&gt;If you’re not shopping for an unlocked phone and prefer to utilize promos and payment plans from your carrier, there are some offers from the likes of AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile, Verizon, and Google’s own Fi service. Bear in mind that carriers give discounts as bill credits over time, attempting to rope you into service for 36 months or more. The Pixel 6 models offered from &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13610485?sid=vergepixel6preorder&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fphones%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-128gb-stormy-black.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-11365093?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsmartphones%2Fgoogle-pixel-6%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt; (including Verizon models bought on Google’s store) have radios for mmWave 5G, which cost upward of $100 more and still may not give you faster speeds depending on where you live and use the phone. Pixel 6 Pro phones, unlocked or bought through a carrier, work with mmWave 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="bskHg6"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="fwxgST"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T is offering up to $700 off the &lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836598-13610485?sid=vergepixel6preorder&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fphones%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-pro-128gb-cloudy-white.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; with a qualifying trade-in for new and existing customers, and 50 percent off of any Google-branded accessories purchased simultaneously. The base &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13610485?sid=vergepixel6preorder&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fphones%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-128gb-stormy-black.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt; 128GB model costs $15 per month over 36 months without a trade-in, but keep in mind that the mmWave-equipped model AT&amp;amp;T is selling is fully priced at $740 and not the base $599 of unlocked models using only Sub-6 5G. The $15 per month over 36 months will result in a total price of $540, reflecting the $200 AT&amp;amp;T will discount over time via bill credits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="X9W7Oc"&gt;Verizon&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="pPtJqr"&gt;Verizon’s offers are similar promo, with up to $700 off a &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-11365093?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsmartphones%2Fgoogle-pixel-6%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8836598-11365093?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsmartphones%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-pro%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; with a trade-in— though this is limited to new customers switching over. Existing customers can get up to $350 off when trading in a phone and upgrading a line. If you’re shopping for more than one Pixel device, you can buy one and get a second Pixel 6 or 6 Pro for up to $700 off (given to you in billing credits over time; you’ll pay in full upfront) with eligible unlimited plans. The base Pixel 6 on a payment plan from Verizon will run $23.33 per month for 30 months, totaling $700 and a one-time $35 activation fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="74YwEQ"&gt;If you want to buy a Pixel 6 for Verizon’s network &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/pixel_6?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;direct from Google&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll also receive up to $100 in Google store credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="O5sVYL"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="hVohEb"&gt;T-Mobile is advertising the base &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcell-phone%2Fgoogle-pixel-6%3Fsku%3D810029932646&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22734748%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-pro-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt; as free with a trade-in on its Magenta Max plan and the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcell-phone%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-pro%3Fsku%3D810029931533&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22734748%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-pro-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; up to $900 off under the same terms. Once again, these promotions involve buying the device as a Magenta Max subscriber or purchasing that service, paying the sales tax, trading in a qualifying phone that T-Mobile will offer a value on, and then receiving the allotted money back as monthly bill credits over 24 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bpnx5n"&gt;Note that T-Mobile’s offerings for the Pixel 6 does not have a mmWave radio, only Sub-6 5G, and is thus the respective $599 base price as Google advertised. T-Mobile’s price for the Pixel 6 Pro also matches Google’s $899.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro review: finally, more than just good cameras</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The new Pixels are the best phones Google has ever made&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="1M4A8y"&gt;It’s rare that a new smartphone feels all that &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt;. The common refrain is that smartphones are all a “mature” technology and today’s new phone is only incrementally different from the prior one. There’s a lot of truth in that — Apple’s made 15 generations of iPhones! — and the newness you gain from plunking down hundreds of dollars every couple of years to upgrade rarely changes your day to day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EBaQCn"&gt;Google’s new Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, however, are a bit more new than the typical phone, even though they don’t fold in half or have especially unique designs. They come with new cameras, new materials, new hardware, new software, and new thoughts on what a smartphone should be able to do for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ADueEq"&gt;But a lot of this is new &lt;em&gt;for Google&lt;/em&gt; and not necessarily different from what you can get from a litany of other smartphone makers right now. The $599 Pixel 6 and $899 6 Pro are a reset for Google’s smartphone ambitions, a fresh start for the company that has slogged through five generations of Pixel phones without so much as a dent in the smartphone world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9YgXao"&gt;As a result, the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro are not perfectly refined devices, nor do they do everything Google claims as well as you might expect. But that doesn’t stop them from being among the best phones available and perhaps the best Android phones to buy right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WiVH9P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10832253"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The most distinctive part of the new Pixel 6 design is the camera bar on the back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="r91XGl"&gt;The design of the new Pixel phones is a change of pace for Google and follows the conventions of other popular Android phone makers for the past few years. Instead of quirky textured finishes with fun pops of color, they are the typical glass and metal sandwich slabs with aluminum frames and slippery backs. There’s less whimsy and character to their details than prior Pixel phones, something I miss. And if you look closely, they aren’t quite as polished as the best from Apple and Samsung at this point — it’s easy to find a rough edge or two along the seams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="djgaYO"&gt;The front of both phones is hard to distinguish from lots of other big Android phones on the market; they mostly resemble a Samsung Galaxy Note 10 or Note 20 to my eye. And while the back has a distinctive bar toward the top that houses the cameras, the whole thing reminds me of a TCL phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="13npwk"&gt;The Pixel 6 is available in three two-tone colors — black, red, or green — while the Pixel 6 Pro is only available in more staid variations of black, white, or gold. The aluminum sides of the regular 6 are chunky and matte black, while the 6 Pro’s sides are thinner and polished to a shine. Between the two, the 6 is certainly more fun, while the 6 Pro doesn’t quite match up to other phones within its price tier in terms of design or fit and finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5kOUDs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;These designs have less character or whimsy than Google’s earlier efforts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RE29Ja"&gt;The most prominent design element is the camera bar that spans the back of each phone. It’s large, sticks out far, and doesn’t quite blend seamlessly into the rest of the phone. On the plus side, it doesn’t cause the phone to rock on a table or desk when you put it down, unlike the camera bumps on other phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4OaFr5"&gt;A lot of these design critiques are purely academic, though, because in reality you’re going to put a case on either phone and cover up any of the rough edges or boring colors. That’s an extremely good idea, too, because both phones are capital-L Large and their smooth glass backs are extremely slippery. I’ve had them slide off my desk, wireless chargers, sofa arms, tables, my lap, you name it, and one of our sample units actually fell hard enough to crack the Gorilla Glass Victus glass panel covering its screen. (Side note: I’ve been testing Google’s translucent recycled plastic cases alongside the Pixel 6 and they are horrible — I recommend checking out third-party options.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kO5iLr"&gt;Really, my main problem with the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro’s design is that they are just too big for my taste. They are challenging to use in one hand, they don’t fit comfortably in a lot of my pants pockets, and they are easy to drop. In prior years, Google offered both small and large versions of its phones, but for this sixth generation it’s big or bigger; the size difference between the two is negligible. These are iPhone Pro Max-size phones, which is fine if you want a big phone but leaves out those of us who aren’t fans of oversized slabs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SZFY2OIMElXN-iNEcQuGV6bNN5w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22934833/bfarsace_211014_4802_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6 and 6 Pro both have big, spacious displays.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gWyOXZ"&gt;The flip side of that is both phones have big, spacious displays. The Pixel 6’s is a 6.4-inch OLED panel with 1080p-wide resolution; the 6 Pro steps up to a 6.7-inch OLED screen with 1440p wide resolution. The Pixel 6’s screen is fully flat, while the 6 Pro has curved sides that taper into the frame. I prefer the flat screen of the 6, but the 6 Pro’s curves didn’t cause any errant touch issues in my testing, something that can make a curved screen difficult to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjytBq"&gt;Both are sharp, vibrant, and colorful, with the 6 Pro being slightly brighter when outdoors in sunlight. Neither have any glaring problems that plagued older Pixel phones, like weird color reproduction or flickering at low brightness levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RnzUBl"&gt;There are some issues if you look closely, like a slight color shift at oblique angles or a noticeable shadow under the curved sides of the 6 Pro when using a light background, things we don’t see on the best phones from Apple or Samsung at this point. If there’s one place where the cheaper price tag of these phones comes through, it’s these displays. They’re good, but not up to the level set by other flagship competitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="1p0VNe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The displays are good, but not quite the best we’ve seen&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O726Vq"&gt;They also have fast refresh rates — 90Hz on the Pixel 6, up to 120Hz on the 6 Pro — that make scrolling and interactions very smooth. Fast refresh screens have become table stakes on premium phones and it’s good to see Google follow suit here. I did not notice a difference between the 90Hz and 120Hz, either, unless I compared the phones side by side— both are smooth in use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RrcBYE"&gt;Less smooth is the fingerprint scanner under the screen. It’s located in a comfortable spot — about a quarter of the way up from the bottom — but it’s much slower than other fingerprint scanners, including the ones on the back of older Pixel phones. Because it’s optical, the screen lights up when you scan a finger, which can be really disruptive in dark rooms. The scanner also misread my finger from time to time, requiring multiple attempts to unlock the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a6TiBM"&gt;Compounding this error is the fact that the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro don’t have any sort of facial recognition unlock — the fingerprint scanner is the only biometric authentication available, and it’s just not very good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p3b7AYz9iBasM0ZPVmyUI3fNSso=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22934841/bfarsace_211014_4802_0054.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even the regular Pixel 6 is still a very large phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="quBj6E"&gt;One of the most important things about the Pixel 6 pair is the processor inside of them, Google’s new Tensor chip. It’s the first custom processor from Google, which is following in Apple’s footsteps and leaving behind off-the-shelf processors from Qualcomm or MediaTek. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IyZqY4"&gt;In addition to powering the phone, the Tensor processor also has a lot of AI-based customization to enhance features in the camera, speech recognition, and gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oikAff"&gt;Google says the new processor is competitive with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 for performance, and in my experience, that’s true. Apps open quickly, it’s easy to switch between them smoothly, and the interface is free of stutters and hang-ups. Twitter was the one app that stuttered on both phones, but it was an outlier. The Tensor chip will not benchmark as highly as Apple’s latest processors, but it’s far ahead of the processor that was in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514312/google-pixel-5-review-camera-speed-processor-fingerprint"&gt;Pixel 5 last year&lt;/a&gt; and right up there with other premium Android phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t1SiKk"&gt;The Pixel 6 has 8GB of RAM, while the 6 Pro is equipped with 12GB. In practical use, the 6’s lesser amount of RAM did not present issues — streaming apps do not aggressively close in the background like they did on older Pixel phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Dnc0I"&gt;There also wasn’t an appreciable difference in battery life between the two phones. Both are easily able to cruise through a full day of use with plenty of juice left in the tank — most nights I went to bed with 35-40 percent battery remaining, even while using the camera a lot and enabling the always-on display feature. Light users can probably stretch this to two days without much effort. A big reason for this stamina is the fact that the batteries are just big — big phones bring big batteries and big battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DznWh20KyWGOdtuMs_kwV9Aw8XY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22934884/bfarsace_211014_4802_0123.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fingerprint scanner is located about a quarter of the way up from the bottom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2YtMAz"&gt;Both models support wireless charging and fast wired charging, but neither come with a charger in the box. Google sells a &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/usb_c_30w_charger?hl=en-US"&gt;$25 30-watt brick&lt;/a&gt; separately and will be releasing a &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_stand_2nd_gen?hl=en-US"&gt;$79 fast wireless charger&lt;/a&gt; in the near future, but I haven’t been able to test that yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l2oSGn"&gt;Even if you do use a powerful enough charger, neither phone charges particularly quickly. Google aggressively slows down charging once it’s past 80 percent to preserve the battery cells’ longevity, and since these batteries are so large, getting to a full charge can take a long time. Fortunately, thanks to the long battery life, you will likely only have to charge when you’re sleeping anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="02eeNC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google nailed the haptic feedback in the Pixel 6 — it’s clicky, but subtle, with just the right amount of feedback&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HwjiZ1"&gt;Another area that the Pixels excel is in their haptic feedback. Bad, buzzy haptics can ruin a phone experience for me, but the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro have subtle, clicky responses that provide just the right amount of feedback. It makes typing on the keyboard or interacting with the UI very enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yra4ls"&gt;Both the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro have proper, dual stereo speakers that pump out a satisfactory amount of volume and sound clear for both streaming music or video and taking speakerphone or video calls. Good riddance to the vibrating screen pseudo-speaker Google used in the Pixel 5 last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LgK76L"&gt;Google is advertising 5G connectivity for both the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, but the details around it aren’t quite that straightforward. The unlocked and T-Mobile versions of the Pixel 6 are limited to sub-6 5G, while the Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T models are more expensive and support the faster but very limited millimeter wave (mmWave) 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YhM5Xy"&gt;None of that confusion applies to the Pixel 6 Pro — no matter how you buy it, it will support both sub-6 and mmWave 5G. AT&amp;amp;T’s extra cost for its model relative to the unlocked, T-Mobile, or Verizon versions just buys you the privilege of being an AT&amp;amp;T customer, nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xCyh7F"&gt;I tested unlocked versions of the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro on Google Fi, which uses T-Mobile’s 5G network. Performance was commensurate with other premium phones I’ve used on T-Mobile — I was able to reach speeds of 300 to 400Mbps in certain areas of New York City, which is a lot faster than I get on LTE in the same areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kQrh9lhcFjli9Nu9AT373ed2aQo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957770/akrales_211020_4802_0323.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6 Pro is the first Google phone with a wide, ultrawide, and telephoto camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="XEfWev"&gt;The Pixel 6 and 6 Pro’s camera systems are also wholly new, with new sensors, new lenses, and new capabilities. Google has finally upgraded the camera hardware in the Pixel line for the first time since 2017, and it’s gone big — literally. The new main camera sensor is much larger than the one used in the Pixel 5 and earlier, and the Pixel 6 Pro is the first in the line to have ultrawide, wide, and telephoto cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="denxON"&gt;Both phones have the same main wide camera and ultrawide. The main camera is a 50-megapixel sensor that is hard-coded to produce 12.5-megapixel images behind an optically stabilized f/1.85 lens. That means you can’t actually capture the full 50-megapixel resolution and the images produced aren’t especially sharper or more detailed than other 12-megapixel cameras, including the Pixel 5’s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="MOp3xB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The telephoto camera on the Pixel 6 Pro is the most fun to use&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7vHaSy"&gt;Still, the images are very good in both normal and low light, and very competitive with the best from Apple. I won’t say there’s a clear winner here; some images from the Pixel 6 look better, some images from the iPhone 13 Pro look better, and which you prefer really comes down to your own personal preferences, something we’ve been saying about smartphone cameras for a few years now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TvCow0"&gt;The Pixel 6 images have the classic Pixel look: high contrast, slight overexposure, extreme sharpness, and cooler white balance. You can adjust the white balance easily enough using on-screen sliders in the camera app, but tweaking the sharpness requires a bit more post processing work. Google’s artificial portrait mode is also largely unchanged — it aggressively blurs the background to the point where it almost looks like the subject is a cardboard cutout placed in a diorama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YCQX8d"&gt;One area I would like Google to improve is how long its vaunted night mode takes to capture a shot. It’s incredible how much detail the night mode is able to capture in dark scenes, but it takes quite a few seconds to do so, and oftentimes either the subject or the person taking the photo loses patience and things get blurry. The iPhone’s night mode frequently took half as long to capture night scenes as the Pixel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kAqCcN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10832288"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HcbUgX"&gt;Overall, though, the advancements in image quality from the main camera are not as big as you might expect from new, significantly better hardware. Oftentimes, it’s hard to tell the difference between it and what you could get with older Pixel phones, especially in good lighting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RtNigz"&gt;The Pixel 6’s ultrawide camera is its weakest link — images are soft, it’s not as wide as others, and there’s a noticeable difference in color and processing between it and the main camera. It also lacks the macro focusing abilities available on the iPhone 13 Pro’s ultrawide camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DUuZbc"&gt;On the other hand, the Pixel 6 Pro’s telephoto camera is excellent. It’s the first telephoto on a phone that I’ve actually enjoyed using and might be reason enough to spring for the 6 Pro over the regular 6. The 4x reach is noticeably longer than the 3x telephoto on the iPhone 13 Pro, but it’s much more usable day to day than the 10x zoom on Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwcarS"&gt;On top of that, the telephoto produces sharp, detailed images, with great subject separation that requires much less use of software-based portrait modes. It’s a lot of fun to shoot with and the kind of thing that changes what you can do with your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ciG9v6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Images have the classic Pixel look: high contrast, a little overexposure, and lots of detail&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vc6GtC"&gt;Google says it has upgraded the Pixel 6’s video recording abilities, but it’s still behind the iPhone, which remains the standard. You can shoot 4K 60fps as long as you want without the phone overheating, but there’s still noticeable artifacting and wonkiness with image stabilization, and the video image processing is weirdly different from how the Pixel processes still images. Highly saturated colors, like reds and oranges, are amped up to the extreme in video, almost like how Samsung used to process colors years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wLY2sT"&gt;On the front of the phones, the cameras differ — the Pixel 6 has an 8-megapixel camera with an 84-degree field of view, while the 6 Pro has an 11-megapixel camera with a 94-degree field of view. Not only will you fit more people in the 6 Pro’s frame, the image quality is noticeably better, too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PHozb87stxx869rcwgyj7_CQ6CY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957782/akrales_211022_4802_0839.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Magic Eraser feature in Google Photos makes it easy to remove unwanted people or objects in images, but it can be hit or miss.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="I7my4c"&gt;The Tensor chip in the Pixel enables a couple of special software tricks in the camera and photos app. The new Magic Eraser tool lets you remove unwanted people or items from a captured photo with a single tap, or you can highlight things to remove. It’s very cool, but also hit or miss — it won’t be taking the place of any skilled Photoshop editors anytime soon. You can also accomplish similar things with third-party apps, so it’s not entirely necessary to buy a Pixel for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mzdeVq"&gt;What’s more interesting to me are the new motion capture modes, which let you mimic a panning motion shot or a long exposure with just a single tap of the shutter button. You can make a moving object, like a car, freeze in front of a blurred background, or you can capture traffic light streaks without the need for a tripod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8EcJMb"&gt;These kinds of images typically take years of practice and lots of gear to do with a traditional camera, but the Pixel 6 makes it as easy as snapping a selfie.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_IgMtL_a_VAx4ipur-SOEIqYtJM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957784/akrales_211022_4802_0876.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6 makes capturing a panning shot as easy as snapping a selfie.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KTok65"&gt;Google has also made a big deal about tweaks it made to its image processing algorithm this year to better handle darker skin tones, which it’s calling Real Tone. Bias in image processing is a problem that’s beset the photo industry for decades, dating all the way &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/9/18/9348821/photography-race-bias"&gt;back to film&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s encouraging to see Google address it. Google says the Real Tone processing is baked into the Pixel’s image processing pipeline and it’s not possible to turn it on or off at will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYolzl"&gt;Both Nicole Nguyen &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-built-the-pixel-6-camera-to-better-portray-people-with-darker-skin-tones-does-it-11635177665?st=l805lxv5h4q9ve7&amp;amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter"&gt;at the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Julian Chokkattu &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/review/google-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro/"&gt;at &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were able to test the camera with a range of darker skin tones and their conclusions are interesting; I encourage you to read their respective articles. Looking at all the photos, it’s clear the Pixel is still doing Pixel things: high contrast, with a dose of overexposure to compensate for that, and very sharp details. Some folks might like that look but not everyone will, even if you have darker skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D18tfaBTNzVe-giUTl3StbkE8bQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957781/akrales_211022_4802_0822.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6 and 6 Pro show off Android 12 well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="UeOAsn"&gt;As you’d expect with a new Pixel, the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro run the latest version of Google’s Android, the completely redesigned Android 12. We’ve already done a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"&gt;full review of Android 12&lt;/a&gt; — I’ll just add that it feels like the fun and whimsy that’s missing from the hardware design of the new Pixels was reserved for the software. It’s colorful and easy to read, with a lot of personalization options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ewnmh"&gt;Also unsurprising, there are a number of Pixel-specific software features, including things that are improved by Google’s new Tensor chip. The Pixel 6 has better voice dictation transcription, since it can do it all locally now, and it can translate foreign languages in messages and media faster than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/njVwf8sdV8dg2e4_3OByiOyCz20=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22962441/Screenshot_20211027_175036.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6’s ability to navigate an automated phone tree system is extremely clever but still needs work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XBTwB0"&gt;But the most impressive software features to me are found in the phone app. In addition to the spam routing features Google has had for a few years, the Pixel 6 can now help you with automated phone tree systems and tell you how long the wait time might be when you call a business. It can even wait on hold for you and then notify you when someone picks up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BrG2iA"&gt;The automated phone tree feature will listen in on the call and transcribe the options presented, then give you big tappable buttons to make choices. It’s far easier than trying to listen to every word the system is saying only to miss something critical and have to wait for it to restart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xd3qnx"&gt;But in testing, it’s clear this still needs work — it can’t recognize languages other than English (such as when you’re presented to “press two for Spanish”) and it often misses words and context that prevent it from giving you the right buttons on the screen to press. Still, it’s a novel idea and I hope Google continues to iterate and improve on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5oIPds"&gt;Other additions are the ability to show boarding passes and other useful information right on the lock screen and support for select voice commands to the Assistant without having to say “Hey Google” first. It’s particularly convenient to just mumble “snooze” when an alarm goes off and have the phone obey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gshBVdQBcXY-fsgw38qruMxCe5s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957766/akrales_211020_4802_0082.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="qpBvGh"&gt;One of the biggest questions surrounding the Pixel 6 announcement has been, did Google do it? Has it actually been able to produce a competent, flagship-level smartphone that doesn’t have any show-stopping bugs or big gotchas?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UhsiQo"&gt;And the answer is a resounding yes, the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are excellent phones. They may not be the best in every category, but as a whole, they perform well, have great screens, excellent cameras, and reliably great battery life. The only real hang-up here is the size — if you don’t like large phones, they probably aren’t for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="UXrBhK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Pixel 6 is an incredible phone for $600&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PI9Cff"&gt;Adding to their appeal is how much value is packed in. The Pixel 6 in particular is just a lot of phone for $600 — it’s hard to think of anything on the market that can compete with it at that price. Google is offering a better experience than basically any other Android phone maker in the markets where the Pixel is available, and often doing so for a lower price. It’s even undercutting OnePlus, which built its entire brand on selling premium phones for lower prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Imbs6s"&gt;Does that mean lots of people will actually buy the Pixel 6 or 6 Pro, when Google has long struggled to gain any market share? Frankly, I don’t really care, because those who do buy it will have a great phone at a great price. It’s hard to argue against that.&lt;/p&gt;
