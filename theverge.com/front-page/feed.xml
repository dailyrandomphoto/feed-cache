    <title>The PS5 worked fine with the slowest compatible SSD we could find</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eGpAhB"&gt;If your PS5 is already running out of speedy solid state storage, there’s a fix. Sony’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22664808/ps5-playstation-5-update-m2-ssd-sony-software"&gt;new update for the PS5&lt;/a&gt;, released in full on September 14th, allows you to expand your paltry 667GB of usable space by popping in the same sort of M.2 SSD stick you might slip into your laptop or desktop PC. My colleague Mitchell has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22366087"&gt;a PS5 SSD buying guide right here&lt;/a&gt; that meets all of Sony’s recommendations, such as speeds of at least 5,500MB/s. That might leave you wondering, though: what about slower SSDs? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AJUnow"&gt;That’s why we tracked down an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/XPG-S50-Lite-Internal-AGAMMIXS50L-1T-C/dp/B08HVZWGPP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ADATA XPG Gammix S50 Lite&lt;/a&gt;, one of the slowest compatible PCIe Gen4 drives we could find at 3,900MB/s reads and 3,200MB/s writes, and stuck it into a PS5 in August. And this week, &lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry &lt;/em&gt;corroborated our findings with an even slower 3,200MB/s SSD. The short version: today’s games don’t need all the speed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The PS5 reads 3898.001 megabytes per second in its speed test" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4_5tGJnWAryRays4zRc7ziYw5go=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22759876/IMG_1307.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Yep, that’s a 3900MB/s drive all right.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="v7uWpg"&gt;We compared the S50 Lite against both the PS5’s internal SSD and a 5,000MB/s Sabrent Rocket 500GB in a battery of tests, including load times for games like early PS5 showcases &lt;em&gt;Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Miles Morales.&lt;/em&gt; We also measured how long it takes to back up games to each kind of drive, throwing in a Seagate external HDD for comparison, since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381494/sony-ps5-april-update-games-external-usb-storage-social-features"&gt;Sony now allows you to archive PS5 games and play PS4 games&lt;/a&gt; from an traditional hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dE5QEx"&gt;The verdict? Surprisingly, even the slowest compatible SSD we could find had near-identical load times to the one Sony includes in the box. Sometimes it’s a second slower, sometimes a second or two faster, but basically it’s a total wash. Hopping through dimensions in &lt;em&gt;Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt;, I saw no appreciable difference with the slowest SSD in gameplay, either. Stepping through pocket dimensions was instantaneous, and when there was a slight pause during a boss fight, I saw the same pause on the internal SSD as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qHZe23"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10684101"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zea66Q"&gt;I also didn’t necessarily see a huge difference between the drives when it comes to transferring games back and forth, but there was one big surprise: at least in this beta, it appears that Sony may be throttling the write speed of the PS5’s own internal drive. It took only 2:26 to send &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22274549/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-ps5-update-graphics-expansion"&gt;both PS5 and PS4 copies&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; to the Sabrent SSD, for instance, but 12:47 to go back to the PS5 — over five times longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="59Q8qI"&gt;On average, I saw write speeds of around 1,100MB/s transferring my five test games to either of my add-in M.2 drives, but just around 220MB/s sending those same games back to the PS5. Both of those are far better than the 141MB/s average transfer speeds I saw sending games to the Seagate HDD and the 97MB/s I saw beaming them back — it took over half an hour (31:24) to transfer the &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; games’ 176.5GB back to the internal SSD. But the slower internal SSD write speeds are weird, and Sony didn’t have a comment when I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QT365P"&gt;In late September, &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2021-the-worst-and-best-nvme-ssds-tested-on-playstation-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry &lt;/em&gt;tested an even slower drive&lt;/a&gt;: the 256GB version of Western Digital’s SN750 SE, which is capable of just 3,200MB/sec reads. And yet, the results were the same. Even with a drive that only offers 58 percent of the speeds Sony asks for, there was effectively no difference in today’s games — and Sony appears to be artificially limiting transfers back to the internal drive for some undisclosed reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GSk2nn"&gt;So the big question is this: if not today, will game developers fully optimize tomorrow’s games for the incredible speeds a top-tier SSD can afford? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D718aM"&gt;For instance, take a look at our load times for &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; in our original chart above. Regardless of drive, the PS4 version takes over four times longer to load! It’s the difference between waiting through a loading screen filled with gameplay tips to keep you occupied, and — at 10 seconds flat from the time you leave the PS5’s home screen to the time you can move Cloud Strife in your save game — barely seeing a loading screen at all. The latter is incredible to behold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YlIBe4"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4WZ3pTe61O4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kOH5dC"&gt;Also, see our &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Miles Morales &lt;/em&gt;numbers? The game doesn’t &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; load as quickly as it could. Sometimes, you’ll boot up the game to see Marvel, Insomniac, and PlayStation Studios intros that eat up a whole 26 seconds, making the game take more like 43 seconds to load in total. But other times, it’ll mysteriously bypass those, loading in more like 17 seconds, and I couldn’t figure out why. I’d love to have a toggle to turn off those intros, and here’s hoping more PS5 games skip them as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4F4sa4"&gt;Would I run out and buy the slowest PCIe Gen4 SSD I can buy for my PS5? I’m not so sure, because Sony picked its recommended SSD spec for a reason — even if today’s games and today’s PS5 aren’t taking full advantage, developers may need that additional headroom in the future. They’ve been promised 5,500MB/s to deliver instant game worlds, and I’d hate to find out I bought the wrong drive years down the road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K5sHxD"&gt;Plus, there might already be some moments in &lt;em&gt;Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart &lt;/em&gt;where you’ll notice a difference, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fitzymj/status/1420825603784122371"&gt;says Insomniac technical director Mike Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lXpgVe"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We tried some below-spec Gen4 M.2 drives as well and saw up to 15% slower loading in the most SSD-stressing areas of the game. Not too shabby, but keep a close eye on technical specs if you’re making an SSD purchase, as our game does rely on high-quality storage.  &lt;/p&gt;— Mike Fitzgerald (@fitzymj) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fitzymj/status/1420825603784122371?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jj3Wyt"&gt;Then again, Microsoft also uses an SSD in its Xbox Series X, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/18/21185141/ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-comparison-specs-features-release-date"&gt;but one with sustained raw performance at 2.4GB/s&lt;/a&gt;, compared to the PS5’s listed 5.5GB/s read speeds. So even if developers do take advantage, it’s possible many next-gen games never see the full benefit if they’re targeting both Xbox and PlayStation instead of PS5 specifically. You’ll likely see the most benefit from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432601/sony-playstation-studios-ps5-games-25-new-ip-interview"&gt;Sony’s exclusive PlayStation Studios titles,&lt;/a&gt; though Square Enix’s speedy &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade&lt;/em&gt; load times gives me hope for more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pm1LS1"&gt;Either way, for a list of SSDs that actually meet Sony’s requirements and recommendations, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22602046/best-ps5-m2-ssd-options-buying-guide-which-drives-compatible-playstation-5"&gt;here’s our buying guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UmGd7q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 2:08PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Clarified that we tested Ratchet and Clank gameplay, not just load times, and that the Xbox Series X’s 2.4GB/s is a sustained performance metric.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="paMKk4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, September 21st at 12:55PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added Digital Foundry’s tests with an even slower 3,200MB/sec drive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to put the Windows 11 Start menu back where it belongs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ClCbBuO0Gjyguk3pBcR7RYmAtQE=/8x0:2552x1696/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69889116/twarren__windows11main_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T5Thwy"&gt;When you upgrade from Windows 10 to Windows 11, one of the first things you may do is wonder: where the heck is my Start menu? Traditionally, the Windows Start menu has been in the lower left corner of the screen, but when your new version of Windows appears, you’ll find the Start icon among a group of icons in the center of your taskbar at the bottom of the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Windows 11 Start menu is now a small icon in the center of the taskbar." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UV3BYnWrdkbDe3--xDj1Rmf7YtU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22867032/Screenshot__7_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Windows 11 Start menu is now a small icon in the center of the taskbar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SDCe0H"&gt;Click on the Start menu icon, and things will look very different as well. Instead of the large square Live Tiles that used to pop up, you have a much more modest set of app icons, mostly showing Microsoft-related apps, pinned to the main page. Click on “All apps” on the top right corner (just below the search field) and you get the familiar A-to-Z listing of apps. But no tiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OVPJLr"&gt;Look below the app icons, and you’ll find a “Recommended” section, which offers apps that Microsoft thinks you should try (such as Teams), and if you click on the “More” button, some of the files or apps you may have used recently.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Clicking on the search field offers immediate access to several popular apps." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ReSjcCcMS3g2GEWZxHLRLcTpZqI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22867098/Screenshot__12_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clicking on the search field offers immediate access to several popular apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SJ9dGZ"&gt;By the way, that search field? Click in that, and the Start menu will open up, giving you immediate access to File Explorer, settings, and other apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="20teRv"&gt;While some may appreciate this more puritanical version to the Start menu, others who have gotten used to the more configurable version in Windows 10 may want to know how they can go back to the more familiar, and more personal, version.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can move the Start icon to the left using the Taskbar alignment option in your setup menu." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ARWcH79s26rDxObk_7UdhDSCXWY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22867042/Screenshot__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can move the Start icon to the left using the taskbar alignment option in your setup menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="P3ceG8"&gt;You can get some of the way there by moving the centered apps to the left of the taskbar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="kSbuWv"&gt;Right-click on the taskbar and click on “Taskbar settings”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NEijmh"&gt;Select “Taskbar behaviors”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gsR825"&gt;Look for “Taskbar alignment” and click on the button on the right where it says “Center.” Select “Left” instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1yMLuh"&gt;Close the settings window, and you’ll see that the app icons in the taskbar have moved to the left, with the Start menu icon in the corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Now the Start menu icon is in the left corner, but the menu itself is unchanged." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ehJQnjDhrKnHt7zz_r7OnlJO3BU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22867047/Screenshot__22_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now the Start menu icon is in the left corner, but the menu itself is unchanged.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OFlR5U"&gt;While this will place the Start menu back where you expected it, it will not restore the one you were used to. To get that back, you’re going to have to go to a third-party app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dqasxh"&gt;As this was being written, there was already at least one available. Stardock, a company whose Start10 app allows Windows 10 users to keep their beloved Windows 7 menu UI, has already made available &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22619930/stardock-start11-windows-11-start-menu-beta"&gt;a beta of its Start11 app&lt;/a&gt;, which it says will bring back the classic Windows 10 Start menu. The apps costs $5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qXYrPB"&gt;So far, Start11 is the only app we’ve found that purports to restore the Windows 10 menu system. It is sure not to be the last, though — there were several apps out there that catered to Windows 7 fans when Windows 10 came out, and you can bet that there will soon be other alternatives for the Windows 10 “look” as well. (There are some regedit hacks floating around out there, but most are either very elaborate or &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/windows-11-classic-start-hack-gone"&gt;were made useless somewhere along Microsoft’s beta cycle&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zlu3QV"&gt;If a better solution presents itself, we’ll be sure to let you know.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now preorder the new Kindle Paperwhite</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kZNu61OmL4t3bHBvN6t8mqtMkH8=/168x0:1752x1056/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69889078/MGFhY2EzMDIt._CB641020890_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new e-reader is still waterproof and adds new features for an increased price.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JcOVZW"&gt;Amazon has officially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22684801/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-features-price-release-date"&gt;taken the wraps off&lt;/a&gt; of the 11th-gen Kindle Paperwhite ahead of the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684357/amazon-fall-event-devices-services-features-september-28th-echo-alexa"&gt;fall event on September 28th&lt;/a&gt;, and preorders are now open directly from the retail giant. The new Kindle comes in three flavors: a standard model (with or without ads), a Signature Edition, and one designed for kids. All versions of the 2021 Kindle Paperwhite will launch on October 27th. Preorders are only open at Amazon as of right now, but we’ll update this post with more retailers as they become available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FNpl7P"&gt;The new baseline Kindle Paperwhite is the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KTZ8249?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;11th-gen ad-supported model, which starts at $140&lt;/a&gt;. The price represents a $10 increase over its predecessor, though, the last-gen model has seen some larger discounts in recent months. We will see if the higher price is justified once we do our full review, but improvements like a bigger screen, USB-C charging, longer battery life, adjustable color temperature, and a speedier processor sound appealing on paper. Ditching the lock screen ads will cost you an additional $20, bringing the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N38WQSH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ad-free Paperwhite to $160&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="waVKQq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Kindle deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21539047/best-amazon-kindle-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="BE4ZvB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10765216"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sO5I6W"&gt;The pricier, step-up tier comes in the form of the new Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition. This model offers Qi wireless charging, a massive (for e-books, mind you) 32GB of storage, and a light sensor that automatically adjusts the display illumination in response to ambient lighting conditions, a feature once reserved for the Kindle Oasis. The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08B495319?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ad-free Signature Edition will run you $190&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3HRBkW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10765329"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qDwMtX"&gt;Lastly, Amazon is offering a new Kindle Paperwhite geared toward children. The apt-titled Kindle Paperwhite Kids is the same as the base model but comes with a one-year subscription to Amazon Kids Plus, giving your child access to a trove of kid-friendly books and audiobooks. The Kids model also comes with a two-year warranty and a kid-friendly cover, which is available in three different designs. The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WPB8PW9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Paperwhite Kids costs $160&lt;/a&gt;, the same as a standard Paperwhite model without ads, and it is also not ad-supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mySaO2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10765369"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WhAGjL"&gt;The 21st of September? Buddy, that’s today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8dNXMu"&gt;Lest you forget, comedian Demi Adejuyigbe has returned to memorialize Earth, Wind &amp;amp; Fire Day — more specifically September 21st, subject of the band’s evocative summer anthem “September.” For years, Adejuyigbe has jumped on the opportunity to mark the occasion with elaborate, often outrageous videos that have included everything from aerial banners to a mariachi band.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nauq0I"&gt;The videos have become such a reliable marker of the end of summer that Adejuyigbe was able to hit a goal of $50,000 for charity &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21449277/september-21st-date-demi-adejuyigbe-earth-wind-fire"&gt;in just three hours&lt;/a&gt; last year, with the campaign ultimately generating more than $330,000 over the period of several days (more than $50,000 per charity listed). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBlv5V"&gt;Adejuyigbe’s video for 2021 hit the interwebs not too long after 9:21AM PT. This year, he’s raising money for Imagine Water Works, a disaster relief organization helping with Hurricane Ida relief; the West Fund, a nonprofit for abortion access in Texas; as well as climate advocacy organization the Sunrise Movement. Adejuyigbe is raffling off a painting — September 21st-themed, as expected — that he promises to hand-deliver to the winner, regardless of where they live. Donations of $10 count toward a single raffle ticket. For each $100,000 reached, Adejuyigbe will also raffle off a September 21st jersey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nteekw"&gt;Adejuyigbe said this year’s video will be his last, but added that he hopes “we can use this last video to do some good.” Raffle tickets can be purchased &lt;a href="https://actionnetwork.org/fundraising/september-21stthats-today-by-demi-adejuyigbe"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;. As of 9:45AM PT, the fundraiser had already generated more than $50,000.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A new cybersecurity center wants to protect medical devices against hacks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Close-up of insulin pump with tubing being charged on desktop." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PuPxM2T1hUw_5uuE7IciT1sckAI=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69888965/1235021804.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KxAomE"&gt;It’s been around 10 years since security researcher Jay Radcliffe got up onstage at a conference and demonstrated that he was &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/medtronic-security/medtronic-insulin-pumps-vulnerable-to-hackers-idUSN1E77O1VJ20110826"&gt;able to hack&lt;/a&gt; into his own insulin pump. If he’d wanted, he could have used the pump to deliver a lethal dose of the drug into his system. Instead, he demanded that medical companies take the security threat seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFtjwb"&gt;That presentation and &lt;a href="https://medcitynews.com/2012/03/hacker-shows-off-vulnerabilities-of-wireless-insulin-pumps/"&gt;others like it&lt;/a&gt; were wake-up calls about the potential danger of connecting vulnerable medical devices to the internet, says Mike Johnson, a securities technologies expert at the University of Minnesota’s Technological Leadership Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QqFHkt"&gt;In the decade since, there’s been an explosion in the number of connected medical devices — drug infusion pumps, pacemakers, monitors — that makes the issue even more pressing. There is an average of 10 to 15 internet-connected devices on each hospital bed, security researchers &lt;a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/tech/82-healthcare-organizations-have-experienced-iot-focused-cyber-attack-survey-finds"&gt;estimate&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s just a matter of time,” Johnson says. “There are more devices and more exposure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EslhLs"&gt;That exposure is one reason the University of Minnesota set up a new Center for Medical Device Cybersecurity, which launched at the beginning of September in partnership with medical device companies like Medtronic (which made Radcliffe’s pump) and Boston Scientific. The center will function as a hub to help groups that touch medical devices at every stage in their lifecycle, from their development to their use at a patient’s bedside, understand and manage the cybersecurity risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cdn1Uj"&gt;“We want to bring all of these participants into the process and hopefully give them tools,” says Johnson, who’s involved with the center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2a27zy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; talked with Johnson about the center’s goals and the cybersecurity risks around medical devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zTHutk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wWwQO1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is it important to focus on the security of medical devices?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QyT1tk"&gt;Medical device security has been on the radar of security risk managers for a decade or more. Suddenly, there’s been an explosion in the healthcare arena around connected devices. The numbers today are 10 to 15 devices connected per hospital bed, and that’s a combination of bedside devices and potentially wearable or implanted devices as well. The more things we add to a network, the more chances it can be impacted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QkA8yY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There hasn’t been a really high-profile case of a patient being killed or seriously harmed, but it’s just a matter of time.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6NbIyk"&gt;There hasn’t been a really high-profile case of a patient being killed or seriously harmed, but it’s just a matter of time. We know the criminal element changes. They’re mostly driven by money, but there are other people driven by making a splash, like a terrorist group wanting to kill someone over the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fWAdc9"&gt;As the risk increases, security professionals and device manufacturers and others are saying, “Well, we really need to stay ahead of this.” Healthcare is not waiting for the massive accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYdYPt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18293817/cybersecurity-hospitals-health-care-scan-simulation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ransomware attacks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; on hospitals have been a significant and escalating issue for healthcare in the United States. Does that impact medical devices as well? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dinQ9R"&gt;The most imminent threat is probably from ransomware. We’ve seen it over and over, and we see it potentially impact &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632378/pandemic-ransomware-health-risks"&gt;patient safety&lt;/a&gt;. So you might think, “What does a medical device have to do with ransomware?” But it’s part of the overall ecosystem. An attacker may not take over a device, but if the device is reliant on a single point of connectivity, and ransomware takes over the command server for the devices, all the devices could stop working. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WdtzNO"&gt;We want to understand the device’s security itself, but we also want to understand where the device sits in the ecosystem — what factors are important for it to function? What could happen to it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GdGcaI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical device companies make the products that can get hacked, but doctors and hospitals use them — and those groups often don’t have the same cybersecurity resources or expertise. How are they involved in these conversations? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FUZFAq"&gt;Providers are exposed to a lot of risks, and medical devices are just one of them. A medical device is connected to the network, and so are heating, ventilation and air conditioning. They both have equally important risk issues that need to be addressed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZIRFjS"&gt;When I visualize the spectrum, if you have a device manufacturer on the left, they’re about the nuts and bolts of this piece of equipment. On the right, you have a system like a hospital that has a cybersecurity risk and has something to protect. In the lifecycle of a device, it starts with the manufacturer, and if they do a good job, that’s great — but when they send it out, the security could be reduced because of how it’s deployed at a hospital or health center. That increases the risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjnQNf"&gt;They’re an important part of the system and hopefully a part of the center. There’s a very large health system in Minnesota that we’ve been talking to as we work to expand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BGaOd0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hospitals aren’t the only places with internet-connected medical devices — pacemakers are implanted in people’s bodies, smartwatches can diagnose &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17850660/apple-watch-series-4-ekg-electrocardiogram-health-2018"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;heart problems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and people take their blood pressure through app-connected cuffs at home. Can we protect those, too? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eg4zbe"&gt;The home network can be a scary place for anything important. There aren’t the same resources, and there are all kinds of things that can go wrong. But you have to look at everything in terms of risk and impact. If, say, a blood pressure monitor gets hacked, the results could be manipulated. Still, patients with high blood pressure go to the doctor regularly enough, so they’d be able to double-check those numbers — and maybe it wouldn’t be too dangerous. On the other hand, something like a pacemaker is physically inside the patient. Messing with that would be a different story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jdsVHa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The home network can be a scary place for anything important.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JD8mO7"&gt;If manufacturers know this is going to end up inside someone or in someone’s home, they’d do a risk and threat assessment to understand what could happen and how big a deal it would be. Then, they’d design the security controls with that in mind. We would hope that a manufacturer would design it so even in a poorly secured network, you could have a secure connection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k3HwSE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the first step for the center in helping to improve this ecosystem?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v0jWKe"&gt;We’re really focusing at the beginning here on generating interest, bringing people into the consortium, and providing training opportunities. We have a hackathon coming up that the center is involved in, and we’re starting on our inaugural introductory training course in device cybersecurity. We’re targeting everyone from big players like [medical device company] Abbott to smaller groups. Medical device cybersecurity is pretty specialized. So this is designed for an engineer, or somebody else in the product development cycle, who wants to understand why security is important and how to improve it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nhzRL0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s been around a decade since this emerged as a major issue. How far is there left to go to ensure the whole ecosystem around medical devices is protected?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O1L5YP"&gt;Security isn’t a fixed end state. There’s not going to be an end state. It’s always a process to improve where improvement is needed and protect things that are most critical to protect. We want to prioritize the changes that can make the most difference and raise the bar over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iTcd6P"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DB9Me8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook says it’s spent $13 billion on ‘safety and security’ since 2016</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m192L2nh5OhDyRz5e632-RZf6ZY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69888811/vpavic_160712_1138_0048.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jMEL6o"&gt;Facebook says it’s spent over $13 billion on “safety and security” since 2016 and has 40,000 people dedicated to the area, offering a glimpse at its operations after a week of &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039?mod=bigtop-breadcrumb"&gt;leaks published by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company used the numbers as an example of how it’s addressed problems on Facebook and Instagram, saying the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s stories lacked “important context” about complex issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tpq9U9"&gt;“In the past, we didn’t address safety and security challenges early enough in the product development process,” Facebook &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/our-progress-addressing-challenges-and-innovating-responsibly/"&gt;said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; today. “But we have fundamentally changed that approach. Today, we embed teams focusing specifically on safety and security issues directly into product development teams, allowing us to address these issues during our product development process, not after it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6m7uZX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“In the past, we didn’t address safety and security challenges early enough”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K7d1nW"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Journal &lt;/em&gt;alleged that Facebook knew of serious problems like &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-vaccinated-11631880296?mod=article_inline"&gt;false COVID-19 information&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675130/facebook-instagram-teens-mental-health-damage-internal-research"&gt;negative emotional effects&lt;/a&gt; on users but delayed fixing them in fear of weakening engagement with its platforms. Facebook executive Nick Clegg &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/18/22681056/facebook-vp-disputes-report-wall-street-journal-instagram-teens-clegg"&gt;issued a rebuttal&lt;/a&gt; over the weekend, accusing the paper of “deliberate mischaracterizations of what we are trying to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QfzR1z"&gt;Much of Facebook’s new response recasts allegations from the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; in a more positive light — focusing not on whether it acted too late, but on the ways it ultimately responded, like removing 20 million pieces of false COVID-19 and vaccination content and blocking 3 billion fake accounts in the first half of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fEAbfE"&gt;If accurate, the new safety and security figures do offer an update on some earlier Facebook numbers. The company has apparently quadrupled its staff in that area since 2017, when it employed 10,000 people and promised to double the number within a year. (The figure includes outside contractors.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aB7OJQ"&gt;Meanwhile, the $13 billion number &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-just-learned-the-true-cost-of-fixing-its-problems/"&gt;backs up a 2018 statement&lt;/a&gt; that Facebook would devote “billions of dollars per year” to safety and security, working out to an average of more than $2 billion annually. We don’t know how that money was distributed between 2016 and 2021, but Facebook made high-profile promises about ramping up investment during 2017 and 2018, which saw scrutiny over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/31/16587342/facebook-senate-hearing-russia-google-twitter"&gt;Facebook’s role in election propaganda campaigns&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/10/17165130/facebook-cambridge-analytica-scandal"&gt;Cambridge Analytica privacy controversy&lt;/a&gt; — so it’s likely a lot of the spending came from recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Specialized’s next-generation Turbo e-bikes are basically computers on wheels</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Specialized’s Turbo Vado" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/705fxLyRcGcVoacD9eF7bUzag7I=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69888774/DSC_0704.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Andrew J. Hawkins&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XS289b"&gt;Specialized is launching next-generation versions of two of its most popular electric bikes, the Turbo Vado and Turbo Como, as well as a brand new model, the Turbo Tero. And while the bikes themselves look fantastic, the big story is the upgraded technology operating within. That’s because Specialized has improved these e-bikes to the point where they are basically computers on wheels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="abC1M2"&gt;Specialized is making its e-bikes much smarter with a host of new features on the software side. That includes over-the-air software updates, meaning customers can enjoy new features as Specialized develops them over time. The company’s Mission Control app is designed to digitize the experience, providing a place where customers can receive OTA software updates rather than having to bring their bike into the shop for minor updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AGGCTx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Specialized is making its e-bikes much smarter&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eUGAyW"&gt;“As we learn and continue to develop from a software standpoint, the bike gets better over time,” Ian Kenny, product manager for Specialized’s Turbo lineup, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “That’s a pretty transformational shift in the bike industry, that matches a lot of what customers expect on the electric vehicle side and the advanced technology that they’re used to having in their house.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E8WUXfMWmTTDIQ6f61dHb-Ag5mM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22867110/DSC_0683.JPG"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Specialized’s Turbo Como.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8pk6pZ"&gt;After connecting their bike to their phone through Bluetooth, customers can diagnose minor bugs or other software problems or tune the bike’s power settings to either increase or decrease the amount of assistance. If you want more of a workout while riding, you can decrease the amount of support or vice versa if you feel like arriving at your destination nice and dry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U2gFbE"&gt;Specialized’s Turbo e-bikes all come with anti-theft technology, in which customers can use the app to disable the bike’s motor and activate a motion alarm system. Once locked, the motor cannot be activated by anyone else but the owner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LwLmPg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Perhaps one of the coolest new features is the inclusion of a rear-facing Garmin radar&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ydUqKc"&gt;Perhaps one of the coolest new features is the inclusion of a rear-facing Garmin radar to detect vehicles as they approach from behind as you ride. Garmin says its radar can detect objects from up to 140 meters away, which should provide a comfortable buffer for anyone experiencing (justifiable) anxiety about riding alongside car traffic. Cars appear as yellow dots moving vertically along the left-hand side of the display, so all it takes is a quick glance to determine who’s coming up from behind. Riders can also opt for a haptic alert for approaching vehicles if they want to be extra cautious. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xRu6xL"&gt;All three bikes are speed pedelecs, meaning they are categorized as Class 3 e-bikes with a top speed of 28mph. The Specialized 2.2 motor is rated at 250W of nominal power, can put out 90Nm of torque, and is custom-made by the company in collaboration with Brose, a German company that makes e-bike motors. And the 710Wh battery is fully integrated and non-removable, which, depending on your preference, is either a nice design touch or drag when it comes to charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZKZL4"&gt;Each bike is designed for a different riding experience. The Vado is the “vehicle for everything,” including commuting, working out, running errands, or just a pleasurable ride. The Como is a more laid-back, upright style of riding, with its swept-back handlebars and low-step frame. And the Tero, as an amalgamation of a mountain bike and utility bike, is built for “all-terrain exploration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yqp0ED"&gt;Much like the recently released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360180/specialized-como-sl-ebike-review-price-specs"&gt;Turbo Como SL&lt;/a&gt; (which stands for Super Light), the next-gen Turbo bikes come with Gates carbon belt drives, which are quite popular with e-bike makers these days because they are cleaner and easier to maintain than traditional metal chain transmissions. The 11-gear shifter is powered by an Enviolo automatic shifter, which is fully enclosed, electronically powered, and never needs maintenance. The advantage of the automatic shifter is that the bike is supposed to always feel like it’s in the perfect gear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t887Qf"&gt;The one downside is the price. Specialized makes fantastic e-bikes with top-of-the-line components — and as such, they can be really pricey. That’s certainly the case with the new Turbo bikes, which range from $3,250 up to $5,500. Let’s hope Congress includes that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/24/22590792/ebike-act-senate-brian-schatz-tax-credit-infrastructure"&gt;15 percent tax credit&lt;/a&gt; for new e-bike purchases in the budget reconciliation bill because every little bit helps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m7s6vo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Visions is the most exciting Star Wars has been in a long time</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;“The Ninth Jedi” | Image: Lucasfilm&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Producers at Lucasfilm explain how the anime anthology came about&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="8DYGAt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Visions&lt;/em&gt; is an idea that makes so much sense it’s a wonder it took this long to happen. The anthology takes some of the most talented names in anime — including studios like Production I.G. and Studio Trigger — and hands them the keys to the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; universe, with no concerns about continuity or what is or isn’t canon. The results are inventive and thrilling, from a rock opera set on Tatooine to the story of a droid that dreams of being a Jedi. It’s bold and creative — and the most exciting &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; has been in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VMIEff"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Visions&lt;/em&gt; is a nine-part anthology, with each episode telling a completely original story. They’re all short — the longest is 22 minutes long, and some clock in at just 13 minutes — and, in a rarity for Disney Plus, the entire season is available to stream all at once. The most striking thing about the collection is how different each episode is, both in style and tone. The opening episode, called “The Duel,” is a mostly black-and-white story about dueling Sith warriors, structured like a classic samurai film. Later episodes include “T0-B1,” which looks and feels like a long-lost &lt;em&gt;Astro Boy &lt;/em&gt;episode, and “Lop &amp;amp; Echo,” an action-packed fable about a family torn apart by the Empire, featuring betrayal, intense sword combat, and aliens with giant bunny ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="JWycTd"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lle0NNmvIyU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tJS2Yw"&gt;These episodes play with iconic &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; elements in interesting ways. In “The Twins,” a pair of Sith twins pilot a pair of Star Destroyers that are fused together to create a spacefaring behemoth. “The Ninth Jedi” follows a unique perspective, focusing on a sabersmith at a time when lightsabers and the Jedi who wield them are outlawed. And there are &lt;em&gt;so many&lt;/em&gt; great twists on those series-defining laser swords, from a classic Japanese umbrella-style saber to ones that are curved and sharp like a metal blade. &lt;em&gt;Visions&lt;/em&gt; is a lot of fun just to look at and spot all of the unique details and twists. It takes something many of us know intimately and remixes it in often thrilling and creative ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="yrIJQF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s been a cool recursive cycle, passing back and forth.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QE9s1Z"&gt;This idea of mashing a galaxy far, far away with lots of different forms of storytelling isn’t exactly new. It’s no secret that &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20160104-the-film-star-wars-stole-from"&gt;George Lucas was heavily inspired by the works of Akira Kurosawa&lt;/a&gt;, among others, when he initially conceived of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;. In that way, an anime samurai story featuring Jedi makes a lot of sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z5kIVo"&gt;“It’s this fusion of storytelling inspiring new storytelling,” explains &lt;em&gt;Visions &lt;/em&gt;executive producer James Waugh. “&lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; was already the byproduct of that. I think actually hearing from these studios, what &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; meant to them and how it inspired them on their journey to become creators and storytellers, was really interesting. Because many of these creators — like Production I.G. — their work came back to Lucasfilm and inspired a lot of us. It’s been a cool recursive cycle, passing back and forth.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="star wars visions" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JAb8eCvnSWRX6MZ6M-TxYPaUbJA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865525/2021_08_12_trailer_uhd_r709f_still_03.086899.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lucasfilm&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="ql-cursor"&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The Duel”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Brnu1Y"&gt;According to producer Kanako Shirasaki, the goal was to work with a range of creators in order to build an anthology with lots of variety — one that could show the depth possible in anime. “We wanted to showcase different Japanese studios, not just industry giants,” she says. “We wanted to choose studios with different backgrounds, who wanted to tell different stories in different styles.” Once chosen, the studios were then able to pitch a few ideas, and the team at Lucasfilm went through them “to make sure we didn’t have redundant storytelling,” says Waugh. He adds that “We chose the studios for the types of films they made. They have a point of view already that they’re known for.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WD1B3P"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You wouldn’t get that story if you were trying to fit things into a timeline.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8de9bm"&gt;One of the defining factors of &lt;em&gt;Visions&lt;/em&gt; is that none of the shorts fits into the established timeline. You won’t see familiar faces like Anakin or the Mandalorian — and that’s by design. Instead, the stories play with familiar themes and conventions, like lightsabers and the battle between the light and dark sides of the force. Waugh says the goal was to create shorts that were unlike anything else in the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; canon; he cites the over-the-top action of “The Twins” as a great example. “You wouldn’t get that story if you were trying to fit things into a timeline,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hN7BWv"&gt;That said, while the various tales from &lt;em&gt;Visions&lt;/em&gt; aren’t part of the established canon right now, that doesn’t mean they won’t eventually make their way in. Waugh says that wasn’t part of the original plan, but he notes that it’s the nature of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; that ideas from one place often end up elsewhere. “There’s no intention currently of that type of transfer of ideas. But I always say this of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; in general: great ideas are always mined,” he says, noting the Dark Troopers as an example; they started out as a video game enemy and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22152431/the-mandalorian-season-2-episode-6-star-wars-dark-forces-trooper-baby-yoda-grogu"&gt;eventually turned into a key plot point in &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="rqtU0i"&gt;“The option will always be on the table,” Waugh says. “And I’m sure video game partners everywhere will want that lightsaber umbrella.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8s2Gy"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Star Wars: Visions &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is streaming on&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1154744/9358?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; Disney Plus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; starting on September 22nd.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s how the $329 iPad compares to its last-gen predecessor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M7RUpi_d1NvC6dms8FN9DTfueyo=/35x0:1925x1260/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69888574/Apple_iPad_10_2_inch_Ninth_Gen_09142021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s new iPad launches on September 24th at the same starting price as the last-gen model: $329.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eFnM4H"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666802/iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-apple-camera"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; isn’t the only Apple device launching on September 24th — and we’re not just talking about the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple"&gt;2021 iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt;. The company also announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22672438/ipad-2021-new-price-specs-release-date-apple-a13-chip"&gt;new entry-level iPad&lt;/a&gt; during its recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;“California Streaming” event&lt;/a&gt;, which comes outfitted with a new front-facing camera, a faster processor, and double the base storage. But are the improvements enough to justify an upgrade from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;last year’s iPad&lt;/a&gt;, or even picking it over its predecessor should you find the 2020 model on sale? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FOtWRe"&gt;To answer those questions, we’ve put together a comparison outlining the similarities and differences between the 2020 iPad and the forthcoming model, ahead of our official review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="q5ZEcA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here’s how the new iPad Mini compares to the last-gen model","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22677944/apple-ipad-mini-2019-vs-2021-comparison-upgrade-worthwhile"},{"title":"The Apple rumors were wrong","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676131/apple-2021-rumor-mill-wrong-watch-leaks-airpods"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XZ_LWLoLuu5J6bEtDlAoP8QPgW4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22859056/Apple_iPad_10_2_inch_Connect_09142021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new iPad features a 12MP front camera, which should allow for improved visuals during calls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bRdkia"&gt;What’s improved on the 2021 iPad?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="TjCqm6"&gt;A 12MP ultrawide front-facing camera&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zXb2Or"&gt;Greater storage capacity, with base storage starting at 64GB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="z6T2vb"&gt;The A13 Bionic chip, replacing the A12 Bionic from 2018&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DN1aVS"&gt;A True Tone display that adjusts color temperature to match your environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="QRGUCd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10752834"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TR4t1L"&gt;Undoubtedly, one of the biggest selling points of the new iPad is its front-facing camera, which is a higher resolution than the 1.2MP camera found on the 2020 model. On paper, the this should translate to better video quality, whether for videoconferencing, livestreaming, or other activities. The newer model also provides support for 1080p recording at 25fps and 30fps, while the 2020 version only supports 1080p at 30fps. Additionally, the newer iPad can “follow” the subject as they move around the frame thanks to Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams"&gt;new Center Stage feature&lt;/a&gt;, once reserved for the iPad Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RyVT2g"&gt;There are also some notable improvements when it comes to the display, storage capacity, and performance. Unlike last year’s model, the latest iPad sports twice the capacity at 64GB and 256GB storage variants instead of 32GB and 128GB. In addition, thanks to Apple’s True Tone technology — something Apple introduced in 2016 with the first-gen iPad Pro — the display on the new entry-level tablet can adjust its color temperature to match your environment. If you’re outside, for example, the display will automatically adjust to be easier on your eyes. Finally, the 2021 model features Apple’s A13 Bionic chip, which Apple says is 20 percent faster than the A12 Bionic chip found in the eighth-gen model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="S2BoiQ"&gt;What’s the same on both models?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="i2kFG4"&gt;The 8MP rear camera with f/2.4 aperture and digital zoom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wAQvQz"&gt;Slo-mo video support for 720p at 120fps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="v15Er8"&gt;The overall design — height, width, depth are identical&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VrGhsf"&gt;Lightning connectivity (no USB-C)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Zygx3w"&gt;They both have a headphone jack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="P6YCYp"&gt;The list of compatible accessories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZC34dY"&gt;Battery life, which Apple quotes at nine to 10 hours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8Js4ra"&gt;Wi-Fi 5 and optional LTE connectivity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XAYdAe"&gt;Both run iPadOS 15&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="oxxrXk"&gt;In most other ways, the 2021 iPad is identical to its predecessor. The improved front-facing camera should mean better video calls, but aside from that, the device sports the same 8MP wide camera with an f/2.4 aperture on the rear, support for HDR, and a digital zoom. Both tablets also feature similar video recording capabilities, offering slo-mo video support for 720p at 120fps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9GNifIWvm_UZCunuitsSeh4gspI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22859063/Apple_iPad_10_2_inch_ProCreate_Pencil_09142021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both the 2020 and 2021 iPad feature an LCD display with 2160 x 1620 resolution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iqZB6C"&gt;Design-wise, they’re nearly the same, meaning the newer tablet remains compatible with existing accessories like Apple’s Smart Keyboard and still has a 3.5mm headphone jack, a novelty among Apple’s current device lineup and modern devices in general. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sWgK0z"&gt;Unlike the all-new iPad Mini, however, the 2021 iPad still features a home button with a Touch ID sensor and a Lightning port instead of USB-C, a frustrating liner note that’s also applicable to iPhone 13 models. Both are only compatible with the first-generation Apple Pencil, too, which isn’t nearly as convenient to charge as the second-gen model released in 2018. While the new model charges wirelessly while magnetically docked to the side of the iPad Pro and latest iPad Air and iPad Mini, the last-gen Pencil still relies on the tablet’s Lightning connector and awkwardly juts out the bottom of the device when charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Deycqe"&gt;Both iPads are available in space gray or silver — no gold colorway this time around — with a 10.2-inch display and 2160 x 1620 resolution. They even weigh about the same; only the Wi-Fi version of the new model weighs a little less: 1.07 pounds, as opposed to 1.08.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w74709"&gt;Apple claims battery life is also identical across both devices, with the new iPad offering between nine and 10 hours of battery life, depending upon whether you’re using a cellular connection or Wi-Fi. Meanwhile, the 2021 model boasts twice the storage for the same price. The Wi-Fi-equipped iPad with 64GB of storage now starts at $329 — the same price the last-gen model started at with 32GB of storage. The newer model is also available in a 256GB configuration for $150 more, whereas the 2020 model could only be purchased in either 32GB or 128GB varieties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VEll5t"&gt;As for the operating system, both models are compatible with iPadOS 15. The only difference is that the 2021 iPad comes with it pre-installed — eighth-gen iPad owners will need to download it. That means no matter which model you choose, you’ll be able to make &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522889/apple-facetime-android-windows-web-ios-15-wwdc"&gt;FaceTime calls with Android and Windows users in a pinch&lt;/a&gt;, resize your widgets, filter notifications via &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22579920/how-to-use-focus-modes-apple-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey"&gt;Focus mode&lt;/a&gt;, and make use of a host of new iPadOS 15 features. With the final release of macOS Monterey later in the fall, you’ll also be able to drag and drop content between devices using &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523613/macos-monterey-wwdc-apple-ipad"&gt;Universal Control&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kywy7Z"&gt;Why might you stick with the 2020 iPad?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="RdQj5g"&gt;It’s still a good tablet, likely with years of support ahead of it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wXzWg6"&gt;You really dig the gold colorway or the white bezels on the silver model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="57ijOI"&gt;Unlike the forthcoming iPad Mini, the latest entry-level iPad is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676532/apple-event-iphone-13-incremental-refinement-upgrade-specs"&gt;more of a refinement&lt;/a&gt; than a notable overhaul. It doesn’t feature a USB-C port or compatibility with the second-gen Apple Pencil, nor does it ditch the home button in favor of an edge-to-edge display. It’s still the most economical tablet in Apple’s lineup, however, and even the incremental upgrades are enough to render it an even better value at $329 than it was before. The faster performance afforded by the A13 Bionic is welcome, as is an upgraded 12MP camera at a time when we’re still all connecting virtually more often than we are in person. It even offers double the storage for the same price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWWBw1"&gt;For some people, the subtle improvements will be enough. But for most? Probably not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bU1j6qbU7MsjLoMjDf7M-BCaIkY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22859274/Apple_iPad_10_2_inch_Family_09142021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 2021 iPad (second from the right) remains Apple’s most affordable tablet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p9EaqZ"&gt;If you’re currently in the market for a new tablet and not just to upgrade, though, the choice gets a little easier when you consider availability. Apple officially discontinued the 2020 iPad with the introduction of the ninth-gen model, and though we routinely saw last year’s model discounted to as low as $300 over the past year, it’s recently been unavailable at nearly every retailer. Even if you wanted to pick up the 2020 model, you can’t, making the 2021 iPad the cheapest Apple tablet you can pick up outside of a used or refurbished model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iPFmXm"&gt;If you regularly use your iPad to make video calls or livestream, the new front-facing camera may be enough reason to upgrade — or if you’re really hard-pressed for storage space. Outside that, though, you might be better off waiting for a more substantial refresh to Apple’s entry-level tablet or spending the extra $200 or so on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"&gt;2020 iPad Air&lt;/a&gt;, a tablet equipped with an even faster processor, a larger display, and a USB-C port, along with a host of other improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Treasury sanctions cryptocurrency exchange to fight ransomware attacks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Biden Praises House Adoption Of $3.5 Trillion Budget Plan" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lOlw-FZPFsN32hN4x43ni92EiJw=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69888568/1234862597.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d42SMb"&gt;The Treasury Department &lt;a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0364"&gt;issued its first sanctions&lt;/a&gt; against a cryptocurrency exchange on Tuesday as part of a series of actions targeting the use of digital currencies in ransomware attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IqJqLL"&gt;Tuesday’s sanctions will block all trades involving the cryptocurrency exchange Suex and US entities. According to the Treasury Department, around 40 percent of all Suex transactions involve illegal activities. The department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is also issuing a new advisory warning that it may issue new sanctions against cryptocurrency exchanges, cyber insurance companies, and other financial institutions that facilitate ransomware payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4BN817"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We will continue to crack down on malicious actors”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iOHzN3"&gt;“Ransomware and cyber-attacks are victimizing businesses large and small across America and are a direct threat to our economy,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen &lt;a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0364"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday. “We will continue to crack down on malicious actors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tUefC4"&gt;These new measures are the Biden administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679952/ransomware-cryptocurrency-sanctions-treasury-biden"&gt;most significant move to curb&lt;/a&gt; the wave of ransomware attacks that have only become more frequent over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. In May, one of the US’s largest fuel delivery pipelines, Colonial Pipeline, was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22426158/cyberattack-forces-shutdown-major-us-fuel-colonial-pipeline"&gt;taken offline after a cyberattack&lt;/a&gt; that requested a ransom. Colonial &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443933/colonial-pipeline-ransom-4-million-hack-gas-shortage"&gt;paid more than $4 million&lt;/a&gt; to turn the system back on. That payment was partially recovered by US authorities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h81HYO"&gt;Last year, the Treasury Department issued a pair of advisories warning companies against paying cybercriminals demanding ransoms. The Department reiterated this stance on Tuesday, saying that it would update its ransomware guidance and issue a clear statement opposing ransomware payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wOkIGJ"&gt;“As cyber criminals use increasingly sophisticated methods and technology, we are committed to using the full range of measures, to include sanctions and regulatory tools, to disrupt, deter, and prevent ransomware attacks,” Yellen said in a statement Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
