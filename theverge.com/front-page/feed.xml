    <title>Surface Adaptive Kit makes Microsoft’s laptops more accessible</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ksNMnYVXJCz2Rp4XfPGkKxYlqk8=/120x0:1412x861/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69893264/lcimg_9d52bc5f_f647_4fc1_98c7_6b25e0f43196.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="64DImr"&gt;Microsoft is creating a Surface Adaptive Kit for people with disabilities. The kit makes Microsoft’s range of laptops and tablets more accessible with keycap labels, bump labels, port indicators, and device openers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mr9gyg"&gt;The keycap and bump labels make it easier to identify important keys, or find ports and cables. The opener support includes a pull tab and ring to provide more flexibility for opening a laptop lid or maneuvering a Surface kickstand. Microsoft has created the kit in collaboration with people with disabilities to make sure it covers a wide spectrum of needs. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The full Surface Adaptive Kit will suit a variety of needs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nW5Maj"&gt;The Surface Adaptive Kit will include a set of keycap labels and a keycap applicator, with translucent labels and tactile indicators. The kit also includes three-dimensional bump labels, port indicators that include raised textures to identify ports, and ring and pull tab openers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u0Nvl9"&gt;Microsoft isn’t announcing pricing or availability just yet, but we’re expecting to hear more about those details shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s new Surface Duo 2 has all the features that were missing the first time around</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XeDFNM0qv0l2SksJVDm2pKPpr2c=/120x0:1412x861/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69893260/lcimg_7c571157_2852_4ee8_9799_0284b94a5001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Surface Duo 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QgsWeg"&gt;Microsoft has officially announced the new Surface Duo 2, its second attempt at an Android-powered folding phone. The Duo 2 retains the head-turning design of the first-generation model, but it specifically addresses many of the complaints we had. This time around, Microsoft is putting a legit camera on it, supporting 5G, using a current processor, and is throwing in bigger screens — things that are all quite nice to have on expensive phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tczJZJ"&gt;The Surface Duo 2, which is available in the same white color as the first gen plus a new black option, has two displays connected by a hinge that allows you to open it like a book or prop it up like a tent. Combined, the two displays measure 8.3 inches diagonally and both of them feature a faster 90Hz refresh rate. A slight curve on the screen allows it to be viewed when the Duo 2 is closed, showing you time and missed notifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nmPlcG"&gt;Inside one half of the device is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor — a significant upgrade over the 855 chip that was in the first version. It also supports 5G connectivity, another upgrade from the 4G radio that was in the first Duo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hvqLI8"&gt;The original Surface Duo was laden with a single camera above the right screen, and frankly, it was terrible and one of the weakest points of the hardware. This time around, Microsoft has installed a proper three-camera system on the outside of the Duo 2, with a standard wide, ultrawide, and telephoto camera system. All three cameras have 12 megapixel resolution, with the wide and telephoto lens also featuring optical image stabilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OX9pbn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing… we’re adding more to this post, but you can follow along with our&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22450901"&gt;&lt;em&gt; Surface hardware event live blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get the news even faster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s new Slim Pen 2 uses haptics to mimic the feeling of using a real pen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eaqAUTM5wQ0RHHcSqGXN9G0EDWY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69893216/slimpen.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CKsVLG"&gt;Microsoft has refreshed its Slim Pen to fit in the keyboard that magnetically fits into the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22685923/microsoft-surface-pro-8-specs-price-release-date"&gt;Surface Pro 8&lt;/a&gt;’s keyboard. Notably, the Slim Pen 2 has a custom chip called Microsoft G6 and haptic functionality that aims to make writing and drawing feel more realistic. Microsoft says that it’s extending the haptic tech to work in several apps, and it showcased the stylus being used in Adobe Photoshop. The artist on display claimed that its sharper tip makes it easier to use and more responsive. It can work with every product announced today, including the Surface Pro 8, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22684608/microsoft-surface-go-3-processor-specs-price-features"&gt;Surface Go 3&lt;/a&gt;, the Pro X, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22684814/microsoft-surface-duo-2-price-specs-features-release-date"&gt;Surface Duo 2&lt;/a&gt; via its pen cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lsxoaj"&gt;We’re still waiting to see how much the Slim Pen 2 will cost, when it will release, and what other features it’ll bring. But the brief intro makes it clear that Microsoft has integrated the stylus more deeply into the Surface ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s new mouse has a shell that’s 20 percent recycled ocean plastic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a7o1s9h0NGwdeTAsf89vP17bDp8=/108x0:1892x1189/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69893212/Ocean_Plastic_Mouse___Hero2000.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WBgQiF"&gt;Over the years, we’ve seen many remarkable mice from Microsoft, but the one it’s announcing today focuses on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21353385/microsoft-operations-zero-waste-2030"&gt;recycling and sustainability&lt;/a&gt; instead of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/7/18/3155619/microsoft-intellimouse-status-symbols"&gt;innovative scroll wheel controls&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/28/18642310/microsoft-pro-intellimouse-gaming-mouse-features-pricing-release-date"&gt;high-precision DPI&lt;/a&gt;. The Ocean Plastic Mouse is notable because it has a shell made of 20 percent recycled ocean plastic and packaging that is 100 percent recyclable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="109UQC"&gt;An August 2020 pledge from Microsoft said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21353385/microsoft-operations-zero-waste-2030"&gt;it will pursue a goal of zero-waste operations by 2030 and put an end to the use of single-use plastics in packaging by 2025&lt;/a&gt;. The small box this mouse comes in represents a step toward that future. Microsoft also mentions a free mail-in program so people can send their old mouse for recycling.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mhbnoodq7NnPPKGu_oDcj466YWY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869798/ocean_plastic_mouse.jpg"&gt;

    <title>The Surface Go 3 gets new Intel processors </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D6Wfw-ISS0OlYSN3jKVn3OPPkIs=/120x0:1412x861/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69893188/lcimg_35ec18bd_ab58_4746_9cca_f52dce1b0d7e.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FgUHtg"&gt;Microsoft’s Surface Go 2 is one of the best cheap laptops you can buy, and it’s gotten a sequel today: the new Surface Go 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sw7oHv"&gt;The device looks identical to the Surface Go 2. There’s one significant difference: new Intel processors. Microsoft says the chip bump will make the Surface Go an even more powerful device for out-and-about use — 60 percent faster than its predecessor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RD9zu5"&gt;The device runs Windows 11, and the camera supports Windows Hello facial recognition.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft announces Surface Pro 8 with bigger 13-inch 120Hz display and Thunderbolt</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X6bJxi3_HkzfIGF_PHnXT8NnMYU=/221x0:1625x936/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69893164/surfacepro8no.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zQqPdr"&gt;Microsoft is announcing the Surface Pro 8 today, the biggest upgrade to its Intel-powered Surface Pro lineup since the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/23/5743416/microsoft-surface-pro-3-review"&gt;Surface Pro 3&lt;/a&gt; in 2014. While we’ve seen tweaks to the design of the Surface Pro for seven years, the Surface Pro 8 jumps to a 120Hz display with thinner bezels, Thunderbolt 4 support, and a new keyboard that neatly houses an upgraded Surface Slim Pen 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KrCp4F"&gt;Microsoft’s Surface Pro 8 has taken most of the best parts of the Surface Pro X and paired them with an Intel chip. It’s the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22685535/microsoft-surface-pro-8-design-specs-features-rumors"&gt;Surface Pro we’ve been waiting years for&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CO6P-fLdocwavwDe41BDHGA1cvc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869770/lcimg_4ee701cc_1de4_4ab2_bd08_3a97b858cd8f.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new 13-inch Surface Pro 8 display.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="adld9i"&gt;The 13-inch PixelSense Flow Display, as Microsoft calls it, is larger than the 12.3-inch display found on most other Surface Pro devices, and it has a higher resolution, too. The display also supports Dolby Vision and Adaptive Color Technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmpqnm"&gt;The bigger display helps reduce the bezels on the sides of the Surface Pro 8, making it look closer to the Surface Pro X. But the most important part of the Pro 8’s display is the fact it’s now 120Hz. While it will run at 60Hz by default, the display will jump up to 120Hz dynamically for touch or stylus tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M1TpAR"&gt;Surface Pro 8 will make use of Windows 11’s new Dynamic Refresh Rate feature. Dynamic Refresh Rate operates similar to Apple’s high refresh rate ProMotion displays, allowing the display to fluctuate between different refresh rates depending on tasks. Microsoft is primarily using this new Surface Pro 8 display to boost inking performance on the device and make touch-based scrolling a lot smoother.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kG8G1TiCoS63fmjRxcTepHMMD4g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869771/lcimg_3008b74a_f90d_45e9_b926_90f40439ccbd.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Surface Pro 8 keyboard houses a new Surface Slim Pen 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0BJrlF"&gt;The separate Surface Pro Signature Keyboard also now includes a new Surface Slim Pen 2 that’s similar to the keyboard and stylus combo found on the Surface Pro X. The stylus charges in the keyboard base and includes a built-in haptic motor that attempts to replicate the feeling of writing on paper. This new stylus also has reduced latency and better precision thanks to a redesigned tip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CDLRTo"&gt;Inside is where the Surface Pro 8 gets even more interesting. Microsoft is finally supporting Thunderbolt 4 here, and dropping the aging USB-A port. The Pro 8 will ship with two USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports and the usual Surface Connect port for charging. That means you can connect the Surface Pro 8 to multiple 4K displays, use high-speed external storage, or even connect up to an external GPU to turn this tablet into a gaming PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ls5ozx"&gt;The Surface Pro 8 will also ship with Intel’s 11th Gen quad-core processors, and up to 32GB of RAM. Microsoft has not yet announced pricing or availability, but Windows 11 ships on October 5th so it’s likely to arrive very soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMAtrN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing… we’re adding more to this post, but you can follow along with our&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22450901"&gt;&lt;em&gt; Surface hardware event live blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get the news even faster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tiny electronic fliers could float like seeds on the breeze to monitor the environment</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v6X8nT_byOPqYoV6JEmYkf4PBIM=/0x301:633x723/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69893082/Unknown_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A selection of microfliers imposed on top of their inspiration from nature: a propeller seed, used for dispersal by trees including maple, sycamore, and ash. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: F. Frankel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="60RWb6"&gt;When trees and plants disperse their seeds, they often rely on the wind to carry them to pastures new. Different seeds adopt different methods of flight: some glide through the air, others parachute to the ground, and some spin like helicopters on the breeze. For scientists, these aerodynamics have provided the inspiration for a new sort of airborne sensor — tiny fliers, some smaller than a grain of sand and others electronically equipped, that could, in the future, float into the atmosphere for tasks like environmental monitoring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vxqqd4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microfliers could be dispersed by drone to monitor atmospheric data&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P10yx8"&gt;These fliers, which range in size from around 40mm across (the largest) to 0.4mm across (the smallest), do not move under their own power. Instead, they’ve been designed to linger as long as possible in the air, sustained by their bio-inspired aerodynamic designs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmeUT7"&gt;An international team of scientists led by engineers from Northwestern University developed their shape through physical prototyping and computer simulation. Their best result was a tiny flier that moves at a leisurely&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;maximum speed of 28 cm/sec when falling to the ground (a measure known as terminal velocity). Snowflakes, by comparison, fall at speeds of 250 cm/sec, while the seeds of the ant tree (&lt;em&gt;Triplaris cumingiana&lt;/em&gt;) float at rates of 75 cm/sec. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QZzOlh"&gt;“It was surprising we could do better than seeds in terms of flight dynamics,” John Rogers, a professor of materials science and engineering at Northwestern University who led the development of the fliers, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. He noted that this was likely because nature has to optimize the design of seeds to balance many different considerations, while the scientists could focus on just a few: payload and flight times. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some prototype fliers were equipped with battery-free electronics, like this unit, which has sensors to detect UV rays and a coil antenna to transmit data. It is approximately 40mm in length. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lyt4Mc"&gt;As described in a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03847-y"&gt;paper published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this week, it’s these payloads that set these fliers apart. Rogers and his team developed many different prototypes, including large units about 40mm in length, which are equipped with battery-free electronics to monitor solar light exposure. And smaller models, two millimeters across, were made from special materials that change color in response to environmental factors, like acidity or the presence of certain elements, such as lead or mercury. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pQb1wE"&gt;Their ability to collect data means these fliers could be used as environmental monitoring tools, says Rogers. He imagines that clouds of units could be dispersed via airplane or drone for tasks like monitoring chemical spills or atmospheric pollution. The fliers would collect data as they float to the ground or when they touch down. For the larger units, tiny antennas could send back information wirelessly to a home receiver, or, in the case of the color-changing fliers, aerial photography could be used to snap pictures of the fliers from above to collect the required data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Boh2d8"&gt;But despite Rogers’ ambitious vision for the fliers, there are many unanswered questions about practical, economical, and environmental aspects of the design. Núria Castell, a senior scientist who works on pollution monitoring techniques at the Norwegian Institute for Air Research (NILU), told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that collecting data in the way Rogers’ team envisions would limit the potential applications of this technology. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ddgwENDVbczeVJeQWWg3ka8WDpU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22866720/Screen_Shot_2021_09_21_at_12.19.22_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Northwestern University&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The team fabricated hundreds of prototypes to test how different designs moved through the air. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RyiDLk"&gt;“I was thinking, do we really need this? How is this going to work?” says Castell. She notes that for her own research — measuring air pollution in cities — the fliers offered more problems than solutions. They are too small to carry sensitive equipment; they only collect data from relevant elevation levels for a brief time during their journey to the ground; and they would need to be dispersed again and again to capture data over longer time periods. These are all problems best solved using existing technology, says Castell. “How many of these [fliers] would you need to measure data for even just one week?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LovluW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The fliers might be impractical for many environmental monitoring tasks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tnsYSJ"&gt;The engineering and physics research that has gone into designing the fliers is worthy of praise, says Castell. She adds that although they might not be practical for regular data collection, they might be extremely useful in emergency scenarios. “They could use it for biohazard accidents,” she says. “I’m talking about very serious events where you need an immediate response.” In such an event, a drone could quickly fly out and disperse the fliers over the affected area to gather a quick snapshot of the damage of the accident.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6ydlDWxOhZqJQXE808UsQUP1WKE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22866719/Screen_Shot_2021_09_21_at_12.18.39_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Northwestern University&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fliers varied in size, with some, like this one pictured next to a common ant, approximately two millimeters across. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zMAiFD"&gt;Another potential issue with the fliers is that, as single-use items, they might generate waste. But Rogers says he and his team have been working to eliminate this by pairing the fliers with a new class of &lt;a href="https://bioelectronics.northwestern.edu/research/bioresorbable-electronics.html"&gt;dissolvable electronics&lt;/a&gt; that would minimize their environmental impact. “We considered that problem pretty deeply,” he says. “We have some demonstrations we’ll be publishing soon where all of the electronics just disappear and wash away in rainwater over a period of time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D7s5oV"&gt;Ultimately, though, the fliers are still a preliminary design. The fabrication techniques are well developed, says Rogers, but the fliers themselves have only been tested in controlled environments — not in large-scale deployments in the wild. “It’s still early days,” he says. “But at the same time, we’ve thought pretty deeply about which ideas scale and which don’t, and we’ve focused on concepts that can be scaled and ideas that are practically relevant. We’ll be looking for partnerships to take the technology out of the lab.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why does Amazon make games?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rM1nX9ViZ0OUU2NrVdseVgzN24c=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69893094/ss_59edc8f4cd2c13495538a3c96040cd133cab6555.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New World.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="va59uX"&gt;When Amazon makes a new movie or TV show, the reason is pretty clear: the tech giant needs to build out its streaming service Prime Video. One of the best ways to do that is to make (or buy) exclusive series and films. But when Amazon develops a new video game, the reasons aren’t so clear. The company’s upcoming MMO, &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt;, isn’t exclusive to Amazon’s Luna cloud service or Twitch (which Amazon also owns). It’s a regular PC game you can buy on Steam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zWnsyK"&gt;But according to Amazon Games VP Christoph Hartmann, the reason is pretty simple: if you want to be involved in entertainment in any way, you can’t ignore games. “It’s almost impossible to imagine a world where you have a foot in entertainment without considering games,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ILkAC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt; is far from Amazon’s first foray into gaming. The company has explored &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/23/16189104/amazon-game-studios-breakaway-twitch-broadcasting"&gt;competitive games&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/12/10/7353099/amazon-game-studios-premium-mobile-games"&gt;premium mobile titles&lt;/a&gt; and made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/5/5384820/amazon-buys-video-game-studio-double-helix-games"&gt;some notable acquisitions&lt;/a&gt;. Most of these ventures have failed to gain traction, including the multiplayer shooter &lt;em&gt;Crucible&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21510190/amazon-crucible-canceled-game-studios-closed-beta"&gt;which was cancelled&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308638/amazon-game-studios-crucible-closed-beta-failure-relentless-studio"&gt;a rocky launch that saw it revert back to a closed beta&lt;/a&gt; before ending altogether. Even &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt; has had a tough time, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285810/new-world-amazon-delay-august-2021-release-date"&gt;a handful of delays&lt;/a&gt; on the way to its upcoming launch on September 28th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hQvxPR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Making games is so much more complicated than it seems.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FqwlbJ"&gt;Hartmann, who joined Amazon in 2018 after two decades at Take-Two, says that he isn’t surprised it took the company so long to get going in games. “Just because you’re a great sprinter doesn’t make you a great mountain climber,” he says. “When you, as a company, or a human being, find one formula to be successful, you replicate it again. And we know that one size doesn’t fit all. At the beginning, they tried to replicate the formula which made Amazon great, but making games is so much more complicated than it seems.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tDstBcMREjj7aNsi7XWh0awGBbQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22868249/ss_48edbca73ba970cfcb4798820068e8171bdeb6ac.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New World.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vpge3X"&gt;That rocky history also puts a lot of pressure on &lt;em&gt;New World.&lt;/em&gt; After years of trying, the MMO is poised to become Amazon’s first real hit; a closed beta saw more than 1 million players, and it was a fixture on Twitch over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kyMDxj"&gt;“It should be our breakthrough title for Amazon Games to put us on the map,” says Hartmann. “For me, there’s a lot of pride involved because we have been working very hard, and there hasn’t always been great press. I know it’s easy to say, ‘What’s the point in you making games?’ But there are a lot of people who really care about it. And hopefully, it’s the one we can rally around and take Amazon Games to the next level and make us more attractive for more people to join.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nbeg62"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt; is developed by Amazon’s Orange County studio, and the company also has teams in San Diego (led by John Smedley, best-known for his work on &lt;em&gt;EverQuest&lt;/em&gt;) and, more recently, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346484/amazon-games-montreal-studio-announced-rainbox-six-siege-developers"&gt;Montreal&lt;/a&gt; (led by Alexandre Parizeau, former managing director at Ubisoft Toronto). It’s not clear what either team is working on, though it’s safe to assume they will be large online worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pUo85g"&gt;“My personal goal is to create 2-3 AAA, live-service games, which capture millions of players and stay in the market for 10+ years,” Hartmann says of Amazon’s gaming ambitions. The company is also dabbling in publishing partnerships with smaller teams; most recently, Amazon announced it would be working with Glowmade, a studio made of veterans from franchises like &lt;em&gt;Fable&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;LittleBigPlanet&lt;/em&gt;, on an unannounced project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xJxW3B"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If you have a great game, there are lots of options for what you can do.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s33Sa5"&gt;Despite the fact that Amazon also operates Luna and Twitch, the company isn’t currently making exclusives for either platform. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22663690/amazon-new-world-luna-cloud-gaming"&gt;Amazon has hinted that &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt; may come to Luna in the future&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s not a game designed to push people to the cloud service. “We keep them in mind, but I don’t want to build games around them,” Hartmann says. “We obviously want to include features that serve them well, but my experience is if you have a great game, there are lots of options for what you can do. So I put the great game first, and then, later on, we can figure out how we can support each other.” He adds that Amazon has offered the games teams a lot of freedom when it comes to deciding what to work on. “When it comes to all of the creative decisions, they stay completely out of it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QVMDJF"&gt;Which brings us back to the question of why Amazon is bothering with games in the first place. Luna exclusives may not be part of the roadmap, but for Hartmann, a far-off goal is to build a big new multimedia franchise — and he believes that can start with games, citing the success of the &lt;em&gt;Witcher &lt;/em&gt;as an example. (Though that franchise started as a series of novels, it reached global popularity through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/12/8586515/witcher-3-wild-hunt-review-ps4-xbox-one-game"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and, later, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21026537/the-witcher-netflix-review-henry-cavill"&gt;a live-action Netflix series&lt;/a&gt;.) This is where being part of Amazon, with its various entertainment arms, could be an advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lOIj2n"&gt;“One day, I think the right opportunity will arise, and we will find somewhere where we can partner up with one of the other entertainment or creative groups in the company,” Hartmann says. “But it’s important that it’s right. It never works when it’s forced.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Live blog: Microsoft’s 2021 Surface event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TsaUEeeKr-3uJu-xaJ9V9-cmo9I=/100x0:1179x719/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69893022/microsoft_surface_event_invite.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Surface Go, Surface Book, Surface Duo, Surface Pro X... a lot of Surfaces&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="0Tl5tI"&gt;Microsoft is set to announce a whole bunch of new Surface computers today. At an event starting at 11AM ET / 8AM PT, we are expecting to see a new Surface Pro 8, Surface Book, Surface Go, Surface Pro X, and even the Android-based Surface Duo. That’s a lot of devices for one livestream, so we’ll be live blogging with real-time analysis right here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BdDxfF"&gt;Details of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/19/22682271/surface-pro-8-120hz-display-thunderbolt-support-leak-rumors"&gt;Surface Pro 8 have already leaked&lt;/a&gt;, so we are confident we’ll see a new slate with an Intel 11th Gen processor, 120Hz display, and a switch to Thunderbolt ports — finally. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22683595/microsoft-surface-duo-2-fcc-5g-nfc-wireless-charging-support-features"&gt;The Surface Duo has also been spotted&lt;/a&gt; with a big camera bump, so Microsoft may be addressing one of the biggest problems of the original — and may support some form of wireless charging, though it’s possible that’s simply to charge a Surface Pen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNigrR"&gt;And finally, the Surface Book may ditch the ability to detach its screen like a tablet, in favor of a new kind of hinge. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1439597666992893960"&gt;Leaked renders&lt;/a&gt; that our Microsoft reporter Tom Warren called “surprisingly close to the real thing” suggest an easel-style hinge that can tilt up to a variety of different angles, a bit like the design that Acer’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22430445/acer-conceptd-7-ezel-2021-review"&gt;trying&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/12/20691638/acer-predator-triton-900-review-price-specs-features"&gt;popularize&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/31/4380132/acer-aspire-r7-review"&gt;years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v1OEa6"&gt;Whether those rumors turn out to be true or not, we’ll cover the whole thing from start to finish. It promises to be a big kickoff for a season of computers designed to run Windows 11. Tune in below!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="m2W2Fd"&gt;&lt;div class="live-center-embed" data-src="https://livecenter.norkon.net/frame/voxmedia/16846/vox"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;(function(n){function c(t,i){n[e](h,function(n){var r,u;if(n&amp;&amp;(r=n[n.message?"message":"data"]+"",r&amp;&amp;r.substr&amp;&amp;r.substr(0,3)==="nc:")&amp;&amp;(u=r.split(":"),u[1]===i))switch(u[2]){case"h":t.style.height=u[3]+"px";return;case"scrolltotop":t.scrollIntoView();return}},!1)}for(var t,u,f,i,s,e=n.addEventListener?"addEventListener":"attachEvent",h=e==="attachEvent"?"onmessage":"message",o=n.document.querySelectorAll(".live-center-embed"),r=0;r&lt;o.length;r++)(t=o[r],t.getAttribute("data-rendered"))||(u=t.getAttribute("data-src"),u&amp;&amp;(t.setAttribute("data-rendered","true"),f=n.ncVizCounter||1e3,n.ncVizCounter=f+1,i=f+"",s="nc-frame-c-"+i,t.innerHTML='&lt;div style="position: relative; height: 300px; border: none;" id="'+s+'"&gt;&lt;iframe src="'+u+"?"+i+'" style="position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; fullscreen"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;',c(t.firstChild,i)))})(window);&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Tim Cook says employees who leak memos do not belong at Apple, according to leaked memo</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/41Opj4xCjC4g9vz69eJeot9F-nk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69893014/acastro_170731_1777_0001_v10.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9jxnEY"&gt;Tim Cook sent an email to Apple employees Tuesday evening about an all-hands meeting that leaked to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last week. He said the company is doing “everything in our power to identify those who leaked” and noted that “people who leak confidential information do not belong” at Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jyp52w"&gt;On September 17th, Tim Cook announced during an internal company-wide meeting that Apple would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679772/apple-vaccine-policy-covid-19-testing-unvaccinated"&gt;requiring frequent testing for unvaccinated employees&lt;/a&gt; — but was stopping short of a vaccine mandate. He also said that he was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679724/tim-cook-epic-apple-antitrust-ruling-employee-meeting"&gt;“looking forward to moving forward”&lt;/a&gt; after the Epic v. Apple antitrust case. Shortly after the meeting, both pieces of news leaked to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LyulCs"&gt;Now, Cook is tying the news to product leaks — which the company has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22601564/apple-leak-phone-cases-cease-and-desist-trade-secrets"&gt;historically gone to great lengths to track down&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AL0ZSS"&gt;Read the full transcription of Cook’s email:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ouaDaK"&gt;Dear Team,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yKTVeL"&gt;It was great to connect with you at the global employee meeting on Friday. There was much to celebrate, from our remarkable new product line-up to our values driven work around climate change, racial equity, and privacy. It was a good opportunity to reflect on our many accomplishments and to have a discussion about what’s been on your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dH1oP9"&gt;I’m writing today because I’ve heard from so many of you were were incredibly frustrated to see the contents of the meeting leak to reporters. This comes after a product launch in which most of the details of our announcements were also leaked to the press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4hDqzA"&gt;I want you to know that I share your frustration. These opportunities to connect as a team are really important. But they only work if we can trust that the content will stay within Apple. I want to reassure you that we are doing everything in our power to identify those who leaked. As you know, we do not tolerate disclosures of confidential information, whether it’s product IP or the details of a confidential meeting. We know that the leakers constitute a small number of people. We also know that people who leak confidential information do not belong here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rZuzat"&gt;As we look forward, I want to thank you for all you’ve done to make our products a reality and all you will do to get them into customers’ hands. Yesterday we released iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and watchOS 8, and Friday marks the moment when we share some of our incredible new products with the world. There’s nothing better than that. We’ll continue to measure our contributions in the lives we change, the connections we foster, and the work we do to leave the world a better place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gYdPUg"&gt;Thank you,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVUzUt"&gt;Tim&lt;/p&gt;
