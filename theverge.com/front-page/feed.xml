    <title>Supreme Court sides with Google in Oracle’s API copyright case</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Supreme Court 1 (Verge Stock)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l3KCKmHP4W2wH53eZg47uytvBUQ=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69077168/Supreme_Court_1.1419968930.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Supreme Court 1 (Verge Stock)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ywKdbq"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/18-956_d18f.pdf"&gt;a ruling on Monday&lt;/a&gt;, the Supreme Court found that Google could legally use elements of Oracle’s Java application programming interface (API) code when building Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2D00Dr"&gt;“Google’s copying of the API to reimplement a user interface, taking only what was needed to allow users to put their accrued talents to work in a new and transformative program, constituted a fair use of that material,” the Supreme Court ruled in a 6-2 opinion, with one justice (Amy Coney Barrett) not taking part in the ruling. It overturned an earlier federal decision, which found that Google’s use of the API had constituted infringement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Quezou"&gt;The court’s opinion concludes that APIs — which let programmers access other code — are significantly different from other kinds of computer programs. “As part of an interface, the copied lines are inherently bound together with uncopyrightable ideas ... and the creation of new creative expression,” Justice Stephen Breyer writes in his opinion. Unlike many other computer programs, Breyer wrote, much of the copied lines’ value came from developers being invested in the ecosystem, rather than the actual operations of the program. Google used the API to let Java programmers build Android apps, which the court declared is a fundamentally transformative use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Es5t1p"&gt;“Google copied only what was needed to allow programmers to work in a different computing environment without discarding a portion of a familiar programming language. Google’s purpose was to create a different task-related system for a different computing environment (smartphones) and to create a platform — the Android platform — that would help achieve and popularize that objective.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pdOiZs"&gt;Google and Oracle have been fighting over Android’s Java interoperability for more than 10 years now, spanning three trials and two distinct appeals. The current incarnation of the case turns on whether Oracle can claim a copyright over roughly 11,500 lines of code, representing 37 separate APIs. Google developed the APIs independently, but they’re clearly based on equivalent APIs in the Java code, designed to model and interoperate with the separate language. Oracle claims their “structure, sequence, and organization” is so similar as to violate the company’s copyright on the Java code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VY4K0j"&gt;In 2014, &lt;a href="http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4431835/13-1021.Opinion.5-7-2014.1.pdf"&gt;a federal appeals court ruled&lt;/a&gt; that the APIs could be subject to copyright, in a decision written &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/19/16503076/oracle-vs-google-judge-william-alsup-interview-waymo-uber"&gt;by Judge William Alsup&lt;/a&gt;. (The Supreme Court declined to hear Google’s appeal the following year, letting the appellate ruling stand.) But that decision left open the question of whether Google’s implementation had violated the Java copyright, and Google launched a second phase of the case arguing that the Android APIs constituted fair use. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-27/oracle-wins-revival-of-billion-dollar-case-against-google"&gt;In 2018&lt;/a&gt;, the same appellate court ruled that Google’s was not fair use, opening the company up to $8.8 billion in damages. Today’s decision overturns that ruling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C7quTj"&gt;Notably, then-President Trump’s solicitor general had formally petitioned the Supreme Court to leave the appellate ruling in place, effectively siding with Oracle in the fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kwAkA6"&gt;Oral arguments for the Supreme Court case &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21506172/oracle-google-java-supreme-court-hearings-oral-arguments-metaphors-qwerty"&gt;were held in October&lt;/a&gt;, turning on a variety of florid metaphors for what the APIs represented. In one instance, Justice Stephen Breyer compared the case to instituting a copyright on the QWERTY keyboard, saying, “if you let somebody have a copyright on that now, they would control all typewriters, which really has nothing to do with copyright.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="siWr7f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s QHD gaming monitor is a great upgrade for $300</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bwckG3njvcDm6SRBhmQszwbOPUE=/0x0:1155x770/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69076946/lgultragearlede.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zBMeOs"&gt;If you ask me, $300 for a QHD gaming monitor that has Nvidia’s G-Sync compatibility and a fantastic IPS panel is a great price. That’s how much LG’s UltraGear 27-inch QHD model costs — down $100 from its usual price at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1621994-REG%2Flg_27gn800_b_27_qhd_ips_hdr10.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F4%2F5%2F22367713%2Flg-ultragear-qhd-1440p-nvidia-gsync-gaming-monitor-ips-iottie-airfly-pro" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LLD2QXJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. This monitor has a subtle design and slim bezels, and in terms of features, it has a 144Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and covers 99 percent of the sRGB color spectrum. In terms of ports, it has two HDMI ports, one DisplayPort, and a 3.5mm output for desktop speakers or headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2UFzn5"&gt;For those lucky enough to have gotten a new Nvidia RTX 30-series graphics card, or a powerful AMD GPU for their PC, or who have an Xbox Series X, a 1440p gaming monitor like this is a must-own piece of tech. Games will look better, and everything else will look sharper than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PLVngq"&gt;If you have a car trip coming up and no easy way to keep your phone charged, check out iOttie’s deals at Amazon on Qi wireless charging phone mounts. These are simple dashboard mounts to keep your phone within view, but they pack in a wireless charging coil that seems much easier than fidgeting for a cable while your eyes should be on the road. These normally sell for $55, but they’re $20 off right now. You can either get a dashboard mount &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X4YDKTF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;that sticks on via a suction cup&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X52DJ66?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;mount that hangs on to your car’s CD slot&lt;/a&gt; or air vent.&lt;/p&gt;

This model &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20982261/airpods-in-flight-entertainment-bluetooth-adapter-twelvesouth-airfly-pro-review-price"&gt;got top marks from Dieter Bohn compared to a few other popular transmitters&lt;/a&gt; that make it easier to pair your Bluetooth headphones to, say, in-flight entertainment or tech like a Nintendo Switch. Unlike some others, it features USB-C recharging and long battery life. In addition, its 3.5mm cord is integrated, so you won’t fear losing it. I know most of us still aren’t flying around right now, but this could be a good gadget investment for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to check if you’re part of the Facebook data breach</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J3-r8N_92l9QQADIYqkgUciFza8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69076936/acastro_180806_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ElKllT"&gt;By now, you have probably heard of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22366822/facebook-personal-data-533-million-leaks-online-email-phone-numbers"&gt;the huge Facebook data breach&lt;/a&gt;, in which upwards of 533 million Facebook users from 106 countries had personal data leaked online, including phone numbers, Facebook IDs, birthdates — you name it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KxRycs"&gt;Your first question will be, of course, how to check whether you are part of that breach. There are a couple of places out there where you can find out whether your data has been compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AkMEo3"&gt;One well-known site that tracks data breaches is &lt;a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/"&gt;Have I Been Pwned&lt;/a&gt;. Just follow the link to the site and put in your email address. You will find out not only if you’ve been part of the Facebook breach, but also any other breaches in which your data may have been compromised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tkw7yg"&gt;While as of this writing, you could only do a search using your email address, Troy Hunt, creator of Have I Been Pwned, was considering whether to include a phone number search as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zqQUbx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Should the FB phone numbers be searchable in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/haveibeenpwned?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@haveibeenpwned&lt;/a&gt;? I’m thinking through the pros and cons in terms of the value it adds to impacted people versus the risk presented if it’s used to help resolve numbers to identities (you’d still need the source data to do that).&lt;/p&gt;— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1378503918284460035?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kYiCcI"&gt;If you want to check your phone number against the leaked Facebook database, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/how-to-check-if-your-phone-number-is-in-the-huge-facebo-1846617849"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has suggested a tool created by a site called &lt;a href="https://www.thenewseachday.com/facebook-phone-numbers-us"&gt;The News Each Day&lt;/a&gt;, in which you input your phone number to find out whether it’s part of the breach. However, that site is not as well-known, so until more is known about it, you may want to stick with the more trusted site listed above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C8Ngp9"&gt;And if you do find out that your data has been compromised? Some of the steps you can take are to change the passwords of compromised sites, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311182/best-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password"&gt;use a password manager&lt;/a&gt; so that you can create and track unique passwords for each site (so that if one is compromised, it won’t affect any others), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22215571/factor-authentication-2fa-apple-microsoft-google-how-to"&gt;use two-factor authentication&lt;/a&gt; for additional security, and stay alert for news of any other breaches.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tim Cook says Apple wants to use AR to make conversations better</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XyXtioEn6PU0aevifVg7fblDyMs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69076836/dbohn_170912_1993_2091.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wsz98c"&gt;Apple CEO Tim Cook rarely provides details on unannounced products, but he offered some hints about Apple’s thinking on augmented reality and cars in an interview &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/opinion/is-apples-privacy-push-facebooks-existential-threat.html?"&gt;with Kara Swisher for &lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;this morning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UtLk2O"&gt;When it comes to augmented reality, he agreed with Swisher’s framing that the tech is “critically important” to Apple’s future and said it could be used to enhance conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aob5ZT"&gt;“You and I are having a great conversation right now. Arguably, it could even be better if we were able to augment our discussion with charts or other things to appear,” Cook said. He imagines AR being used in health, education, retail, and gaming. “I’m already seeing AR take off in some of these areas with use of the phone. And I think the promise is even greater in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0sM9yy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You know, I’ve never spoken to Elon.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jVcUXn"&gt;Apple has been rumored for years to be working on an augmented reality headset, and the latest leaks suggested &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346564/apple-mixed-vr-virtual-augmented-reality-headset-light-ming-chi-kuo"&gt;a mixed reality device&lt;/a&gt; could launch next year. Augmented reality features are already available on the iPhone and iPad, but outside of some fun Snapchat filters, augmented reality hasn’t become all that widely used yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HlxGHp"&gt;Cook also talked broadly about Apple’s approach to products during a question about cars. Leaks from Apple have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22194032/apple-car-self-driving-battery-tech"&gt;made it unclear&lt;/a&gt; if the company is developing self-driving tech that it could license to other companies or if Apple plans to develop an entire car by itself. Cook’s latest comments suggest the latter, assuming the project comes to fruition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R4ruuF"&gt;“We love to integrate hardware, software, and services, and find the intersection points of those because we think that’s where the magic occurs,” Cook said. “And so that’s what we love to do. And we love to own the primary technology that’s around that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmCy6m"&gt;Cook referred to “autonomy” as a “core technology” and said there are “lots of things you can do” with it in connection with robots. But he warned that not every Apple project eventually ships. “We investigate so many things internally. Many of them never see the light of day,” Cook said. “I’m not saying that one will not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vtEzfH"&gt;Swisher also asked Cook about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195959/elon-musk-tesla-tim-cook-apple-sale-meeting-acquisition-refused"&gt;Elon Musk’s comments&lt;/a&gt; about a failed attempt to discuss selling Tesla to Apple around 2017. “You know, I’ve never spoken to Elon,” Cook said, “although I have great admiration and respect for the company he’s built.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon retaliated against climate organizers, labor board finds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4UFBGG1a8VOAgs3rOvj-28_N294=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69076740/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0001.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YBIyMl"&gt;The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has determined that Amazon retaliated against two activist employees when it fired them in April of last year, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/technology/amazon-nlrb-activist-workers.html"&gt;as first reported by &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z42Kk2"&gt;The determination is part of the board’s ongoing response to a labor complaint against Amazon, although it’s not a legal ruling in itself. Still, the determination indicates the NLRB is prepared to accuse Amazon of unfair labor practices in connection with the case, and that puts the company under significant pressure to settle the case with the fired employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ESOssk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are on the right side of history and the right side of the law”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IMDXee"&gt;The two employees at the heart of the case, Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa, organized the Amazon Employees for Climate Justice group in 2020 to protest the company’s partnerships with the oil and gas industry. The group went public with &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@amazonemployeesclimatejustice/amazon-employees-share-our-views-on-company-business-f5abcdea849"&gt;an open letter&lt;/a&gt; that January, undersigned by more than 350 employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6IPtH2"&gt;Amazon fired Cunningham and Costa &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/04/13/amazon-workers-fired/"&gt;three months later&lt;/a&gt;, after they used the same Medium account to &lt;a href="https://amazonemployees4climatejustice.medium.com/coronavirus-amazon-log-cfdc9a6f4437"&gt;raise concerns&lt;/a&gt; about coronavirus protections at Amazon warehouses. At the time, Amazon said the women had been fired for “violating internal policies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HJChcM"&gt;It is unclear how the Seattle case will be resolved, but both women are being encouraged to settle with the company by the NLRB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9aBXm9"&gt;“It’s a moral victory,” Cunningham told the &lt;em&gt;Times,&lt;/em&gt; “and really shows that we are on the right side of history and the right side of the law.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TIPsVc"&gt;The new determination is part of a growing pattern of labor violations at Amazon, which has been accused of violating workers’ rights to protest labor conditions in a growing number of cases. In March, the NLRB made a similar determination about retaliation against organizers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22345094/amazon-queens-warehouse-workers-labor-law-covid-19"&gt;at a warehouse in Queens&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a separate retaliation case connected to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22335739/amazon-chicago-nlrb-worker-retaliation-safety-complaint-merit-settlement"&gt;a warehouse in Chicago&lt;/a&gt;. Six Pennsylvania warehouse workers are also &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/amazon-worker-retaliation-coronavirus"&gt;pursuing a retaliation case&lt;/a&gt; against the company in federal court. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/fired-interrogated-disciplined-amazon-warehouse-organizers-allege-year-retaliation-n1262367"&gt;An &lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt; analysis&lt;/a&gt; counted 37 separate labor rights cases against Amazon filed with the NLRB since February 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eCLh69"&gt;Amazon has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356321/amazon-inequality-bezos-democrats-union-sanders-fulfillment"&gt;exacerbated the issue&lt;/a&gt; by publicly feuding with a number of prominent progressive lawmakers, including Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). On Friday, the company &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/policy-news-views/our-recent-response-to-representative-pocan"&gt;publicly apologized&lt;/a&gt; for a series of tweets denying that Amazon drivers are sometimes forced to pee in bottles, a phenomenon subsequently confirmed by &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7amyn/amazon-denies-workers-pee-in-bottles-here-are-the-pee-bottles"&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/akd54e/she-wees-and-plastic-bags-amazons-pee-scandal-is-much-worse-for-women"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x58bRw"&gt;“This was an own-goal,” Amazon said in its apology. “We know that drivers can and do have trouble finding restrooms because of traffic or sometimes rural routes.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG is quitting the smartphone business</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wxQw9UvVgTlqt6MyuZMD5HGOn7E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69075601/cgartenberg_201022_4254_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG’s Wing was a uniquely designed device released last year.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6TTSk0"&gt;LG is exiting the smartphone business, the company confirmed today. The decision will “enable the company to focus resources in growth areas such as electric vehicle components, connected devices, smart homes, robotics, artificial intelligence and business-to-business solutions, as well as platforms and services,” LG said in a &lt;a href="http://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/04/lg-to-close-mobile-phone-business-worldwide/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Xy9US"&gt;Existing phones will remain on sale, and LG says it’ll continue to support its products “for a period of time which will vary by region.” The company hasn’t said anything about possible layoffs except that “details related to employment will be determined at the local level.” LG says it expects to have completed the business’ closure by the end of July this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ueOwC"&gt;The move has been rumored for several months, following the division’s huge losses over the past five years. Once considered a rival to fellow South Korean manufacturer Samsung, LG’s recent high-end smartphones have struggled to compete, while its more affordable handsets have faced stiff competition from Chinese rivals. The company had previously said it hoped to make its smartphone division &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/9/21058238/lg-smartphone-profitable-2021-apple-samsung-ces-mwc"&gt;profitable in 2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="moPpjV"&gt;Today’s news means LG’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436954/lg-extendable-sliding-phone-teaser-explorer-project-wing-mobile"&gt;long-teased rollable phone&lt;/a&gt; is unlikely to ever see the light of day. The last time the company showed off the device was back at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224591/lg-rollable-phone-extending-display-teaser-ces-2021"&gt;this year’s virtual CES&lt;/a&gt; when the company insisted that the device was real and would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226532/lgs-rollable-phone-launch-release-date-ces-2021"&gt;launching later this year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UbwMax"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An attempt to sell the division reportedly failed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bt7zVh"&gt;Reports that LG has been considering exiting smartphones have been around since at least &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22240282/lg-smartphone-business-exit-2021-internal-memo"&gt;the beginning of this year&lt;/a&gt;. Although a company spokesperson branded an earlier report about the company’s potential exit from the smartphone business “&lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/01/15/no-lg-isnt-exiting-the-smartphone-business/"&gt;completely false and without merit,&lt;/a&gt;” an LG official later &lt;a href="http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20210120000992"&gt;confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Korea Herald&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that the&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;company had to make “a cold judgment” about the division. Potential measures could include “sale, withdrawal and downsizing of the smartphone business,” the official said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z7TzZp"&gt;In March, reports emerged that the company had tried to find a buyer for its smartphone business, but that talks had stalled and it could instead shut down the division. &lt;a href="https://www.donga.com/news/article/all/20210321/106003359/1"&gt;Korean outlet &lt;em&gt;DongA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said the company had ceased development of its upcoming phones with rollable displays, and that it had shelved its planned smartphones for the first half of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jdnmaa"&gt;As it lost share to rivals, LG released a series of eye-catching devices with unusual form-factors. There was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536659/lg-wing-review-dual-screen-price-specs-features"&gt;LG Wing&lt;/a&gt;, whose main display rotated to reveal a smaller secondary screen beneath it, or its recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/30/20939655/lg-g8x-thinq-dual-screen-review"&gt;dual screen&lt;/a&gt; devices. LG also tried its hand at a modular smartphone with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/8/11391826/lg-g5-review-friend-modules-android"&gt;LG G5&lt;/a&gt;, only to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/8/11391826/lg-g5-review-friend-modules-android"&gt;abandon the initiative a year later&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VG07jS"&gt;Unfortunately for LG, none of these features were useful enough to turn the phones into mainstream hits, and meanwhile the company’s more traditional handsets fell behind their rivals in core areas like camera performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SEkq67"&gt;LG joins a long list of high-profile device makers to give up on smartphones over the years, although many of the brand names have stuck around on devices made by third-party manufacturers. Nokia’s consumer-facing brand lives on atop handsets made by HMD, while Blackberry’s branding was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/3/21120107/tcl-blackberry-ends-phone-global-rights-date-2020"&gt;initially used by TCL&lt;/a&gt; and is set to return this year on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21375026/5g-blackberry-phone-android-physical-keyboard-2021-release-date"&gt;device made by OnwardMobility&lt;/a&gt;. There’s also HTC, which still sells a few oddball handsets but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/20/16340108/google-htc-smartphone-team-acquisition-announced"&gt;sold most of its IP to Google in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. Who’s next?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Genesis drone show used a record-breaking 3,281 drones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/434xFRBnr7cyme9pdj0DQ49etek=/211x0:2490x1519/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69075245/image1.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Genesis&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="J3hpGc"&gt;Hyundai’s luxury vehicle brand Genesis used 3,281 drones to create its logo over Shanghai’s skyline on March 29th in celebration of the brand’s arrival in China. That number of drones sets a new Guinness World Record for “The Most Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) airborne simultaneously,” &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/genesis-celebrates-launch-in-china-with-dazzling-world-record-breaking-drone-show-over-shanghais-iconic-skyline-301261643.html"&gt;according to a Genesis press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ugoT6E"&gt;You can see a picture of the Genesis logo formation at the top of this post. Genesis also made a video that &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/ead2Efblvxk"&gt;showed off some additional drone formations&lt;/a&gt;, including a hand, two of the company’s cars, and... a double helix? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OCV7cW"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ead2Efblvxk?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KbhfZV"&gt;Genesis’ record edges out the previous one held by Shenzhen Damoda Intelligent Control Technology, which used 3,051 drones in a display on September 20th. &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/44KvHwRHb3A"&gt;Here’s a video of that display&lt;/a&gt;, which I personally think is even more impressive than Genesis’:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nW1IpZ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/44KvHwRHb3A?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M9bKps"&gt;Intel held the record at one point as well, using &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/9/16994638/winter-olympics-2018-intel-drone-show-world-record"&gt;1,218 Shooting Star drones&lt;/a&gt; to create the Olympic rings over Pyeongchang for the 2018 Winter Olympics. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tencent-owned studio behind Call of Duty: Mobile reportedly earned $10 billion in 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i7-0H-GxUrLNW0eqrbK9rbZEA0A=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69075061/Screen_Shot_2021_04_04_at_2.11.26_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Activision&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L4jX9l"&gt;TiMi Studios, the Tencent-owned developer of huge mobile hits &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Mobile&lt;/em&gt; and the MOBA &lt;em&gt;Honor of Kings, &lt;/em&gt;earned a staggering $10 billion in revenue in 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tencent-videogames-exclusive-idUSKBN2BP0FG"&gt;according to an April 1st &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="490xCa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;’ article says those earnings make TiMi the “world’s largest developer,” according to its sources. While it’s unclear exactly what metric that is defining, it’s a undoubtably a huge number. For comparison, Activision Blizzard (which publishes the &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; franchise) &lt;a href="https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/activision-blizzard-announces-fourth-quarter-and-2020-financial"&gt;posted 2020 revenues of $8.09 billion&lt;/a&gt;, nearly $2 billion &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; than TiMi’s reported $10 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1aWxPN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;TiMi’s games are some of the biggest in the world&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UEjgq5"&gt;While TiMi might not be a household name, its games are some of the biggest in the world. &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Mobile&lt;/em&gt; reportedly had the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20906035/call-of-duty-download-number-biggest-launch-ever"&gt;biggest mobile game launch ever&lt;/a&gt; when it released in October 2019, racking up over 100 million downloads worldwide in its first week of availability. And &lt;em&gt;Honor of Kings&lt;/em&gt;, which is only available in China, had an astounding 100 million &lt;em&gt;daily &lt;/em&gt;active users as of November 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tencent-videogames-honorofkings/tencents-honor-of-kings-reports-100-million-daily-users-expands-into-new-genres-idUSKBN27H1HX"&gt;according to Tencent&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L0F4qf"&gt;It doesn’t seem like Tencent and TiMi will be resting on their laurels. TiMi is recruiting for a new AAA game that “resembles the virtual community from the movie &lt;em&gt;Ready Player One&lt;/em&gt;,” &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;reports, which seems to suggest TiMi wants to make its own metaverse-like game in the vein of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22242696/fortnite-predator-marketing-brands-cross-promotion"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21578491/roblox-ipo-announced-dau-increase-pandemic"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Tencent is also building a TiMi studio in Los Angeles, according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bEjDRn"&gt;Tencent has long-standing investments in some US-based gaming companies. It bought a &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2011/02/04/chinas-tencent-acquires-majority-stake-in-online-game-firm-riot-games-for-more-than-350m/"&gt;majority stake&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; developer Riot Games in 2011 and then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/17/10410952/riot-games-league-of-legends-acquired-tencent"&gt;full ownership&lt;/a&gt; in 2015. And Tencent purchased &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/3/21/4131702/tencents-epic-games-stock-acquisition"&gt;40 percent of Epic Games in 2012&lt;/a&gt;, a stake that grown in value significantly following the huge success of Epic’s &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1nYNS4"&gt;Tencent is also&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the owner of the studio Lightspeed &amp;amp; Quantum, which develops &lt;em&gt;PUBG: Mobile. &lt;/em&gt;That game has also been a smash hit and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350782/pubg-mobile-one-billion-downloads-tencent"&gt;just crossed more than 1 billion downloads worldwide&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: Black Widow, Rick and Morty, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O10C9Kvo-F3l9T2KdCdmSSKOL2o=/159x0:1353x796/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69074755/Screen_Shot_2021_04_04_at_11.24.39_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bejVwo"&gt;Hi, it’s Jay, and I’m holding down the fort for Kim today, which means I get to do a trailer roundup. I apparently picked a good week to take this responsibility, as there were &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of good trailers to pick from — it seems like media companies are gearing up for a big year in movies and TV shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CfO4MV"&gt;Let’s get right into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iD007H"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fp9pNPdNwjI?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="40Vuw8"&gt;Black Widow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7bFes4"&gt;My wife and I spent the first part of this year watching the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe, and as we got further along, we couldn’t believe that Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow didn’t have her own movie yet. So as you might expect, we’re very excited to see &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;, especially after &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp9pNPdNwjI"&gt;the new trailer&lt;/a&gt; that came out on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BZv1gD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; will debut &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346947/black-widow-cruella-luca-disney-plus-streaming-premiere-access-marvel-theaters"&gt;on July 9th in theaters and on Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; as a $30 Premiere Access title. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="QI6C0x"&gt;The Suicide Squad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R0oCgB"&gt;Speaking of superhero films (or in this case, I guess antiheroes), Warner Bros. released &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/vBumm7mYT_0"&gt;a second trailer for &lt;em&gt;The Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; less than a week &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22352484/the-suicide-squad-trailer-james-gunn-hbo-max"&gt;after debuting the first one&lt;/a&gt;. The film, helmed by &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; director James Gunn, is packed with an all-star cast, including Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, Idris Elba as Bloodsport, and even Sylvester Stallone as a giant CGI shark-man named King Shark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQ0DMs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt; premieres in theaters and on HBO Max on August 6th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="soTYDz"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F6Zy_mLgSNQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EFkqYs"&gt;Rick and Morty season 5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FpU1NR"&gt;I’m just going to be totally honest here: despite &lt;em&gt;Rick and Morty&lt;/em&gt; being a constant thing on the internet and also being something that looks totally up my alley, I have never seen a single episode and know basically nothing about it. But if you’ve been looking forward to season five, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6Zy_mLgSNQ"&gt;an official trailer hit this week&lt;/a&gt;. The new season premieres on Adult Swim on June 20th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YrNmyk"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BsOmYpP4UDU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="I7hHWJ"&gt;Star Wars: The Bad Batch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1kh2Gy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars: The Bad Batch &lt;/em&gt;is a new animated series heading to Disney Plus. “Members of Bad Batch—a unique squad of clones who vary genetically from their brothers in the Clone Army—each possess a singular exceptional skill that makes them extraordinarily effective soldiers and a formidable crew,” &lt;a href="https://disneyplusoriginals.disney.com/show/star-wars-the-bad-batch"&gt;according to Disney&lt;/a&gt;. It’s executive produced by Dave Filoni, who also executive produced &lt;em&gt;The Clone Wars&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Rebels&lt;/em&gt;, and the &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8UtzsZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars: The Bad Batch&lt;/em&gt; debuts May 4th (aka &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; Day).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="torV0E"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b1WHQTbJ7vE?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZiYr7o"&gt;Shadow and Bone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JPKsKW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shadow and Bone&lt;/em&gt; is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22303005/shadow-and-bone-first-trailer-watch-netflix-darkling-alina-mal-ben-barnes"&gt;new Netflix series&lt;/a&gt; based on the hit young adult novel trilogy. “Dark forces conspire against orphan mapmaker Alina Starkov when she unleashes an extraordinary power that could change the fate of her war-torn world,” &lt;a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80236319"&gt;according to a description by Netflix&lt;/a&gt;. I actually just got the first book in the series from the library, and I’m looking forward to reading it ahead of &lt;em&gt;Shadow and Bone’s&lt;/em&gt; premiere on April 23rd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Gxxb3c"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oYcK1LQl_Fs?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JW03Xj"&gt;Yasuke&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="srCCwU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yasuke&lt;/em&gt; is a new Neflix anime that’s based on a true story of a Black samurai from the 16th century. The main character is voiced by LaKeith Stanfield (&lt;em&gt;Atlanta&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Judas and the Black Messiah&lt;/em&gt;) and the show has a soundtrack from Flying Lotus. It debuts on Netflix on April 29th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="r6yNw1"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/olXYZOsXw_o?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QRgHyp"&gt;Space Jam: A New Legacy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="vydHG9"&gt;Warner Bros. debuted the &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/olXYZOsXw_o"&gt;first trailer&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Space Jam’s&lt;/em&gt; long-awaited sequel on Saturday. &lt;em&gt;Space Jam: A New Legacy&lt;/em&gt; stars LeBron James and the classic Looney Tunes characters, but will also include appearances from iconic Warner Bros. characters like the Iron Giant, King Kong, and even Fred Flintstone. (Warner Bros. multiverse incoming, I guess.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9xtd4P"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Space Jam: A New Legacy &lt;/em&gt;premieres in theaters and on HBO Max on July 16th. (And if you were wondering: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/3/22365635/space-jam-sequel-new-legacy-first-trailer-1996-website"&gt;the old-school 1996 &lt;em&gt;Space Jam&lt;/em&gt; website lives on&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA’s Mars rover drops off Ingenuity helicopter ahead of historic flight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_3JkHOCTrdhrNnEnog65QHs9Y7U=/0x0:926x617/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69074501/EyF2yf7WUAMSUdR.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: NASA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lWnmmf"&gt;NASA’s Perseverance rover, which is currently roaming around Mars, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASAJPL/status/1378513754241961985"&gt;has dropped&lt;/a&gt; off the mini helicopter Ingenuity ahead of the four-pound aircraft’s historic first flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v8lsie"&gt;Ingenuity dropped four inches from the belly of Perseverance to the surface of Mars. While four inches might not seem like a very big drop, getting Ingenuity to successfully stick the landing is still a significant milestone, as the helicopter had to go through a multi-day process of flipping from a horizontal position on the rover to a vertical position before it was set down. (It also had to survive a seven-month trip through space to get to Mars. NBD.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OVQchY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarsHelicopter?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MarsHelicopter&lt;/a&gt; touchdown confirmed! Its 293 million mile (471 million km) journey aboard &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASAPersevere?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@NASAPersevere&lt;/a&gt; ended with the final drop of 4 inches (10 cm) from the rover's belly to the surface of Mars today. Next milestone? Survive the night. &lt;a href="https://t.co/TNCdXWcKWE"&gt;https://t.co/TNCdXWcKWE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/XaBiSNebua"&gt;pic.twitter.com/XaBiSNebua&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NASA JPL (@NASAJPL) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASAJPL/status/1378513754241961985?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6mmMVl"&gt;Now that Ingenuity is separated from Perseverance, it will need to power and heat itself. Ingenuity will draw power from the sun using its onboard solar panels, but its heater will have the tough job of keeping the helicopter warm through the freezing cold nights on Mars, where temperatures can go as low as negative 130 degrees Fahrenheit, &lt;a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/status/288/its-cold-on-mars/"&gt;according to Bob Balaram, Ingenuity’s chief engineer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kpoIl6"&gt;Presuming Ingenuity survives the harsh conditions, the helicopter will aim to take the first powered flight on another planet, which is currently set for “no earlier” than April 11th. NASA outlined the helicopter’s flight zone, which NASA outlined &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346773/nasa-mars-ingenuity-helicopter-perseverance-rover-flight-zone"&gt;on March 23rd&lt;/a&gt;. The plan is for Ingenuity to attempt as many as five test flights within 30 days before settling down on the surface of Mars for eternity. &lt;/p&gt;
