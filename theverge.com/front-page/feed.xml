    <title>If audio is missing from your Instagram Stories, a fix is on the way</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="naTnU7"&gt;Following the release of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"&gt;Apple’s iOS 15 update&lt;/a&gt;, some users &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/psjmqp/anyone_facing_audio_issue_when_phone_is_on_mute/"&gt;have reported strange behavior on Instagram&lt;/a&gt; — when an iPhone’s ringer switch is set to silent mode, stories play without audio. Currently, you can even silence a video while it’s still playing by flipping the switch, even though the switch shouldn’t mute the rest of an iPhone’s sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YVHNp9"&gt;Silent videos might sound like a blessing for friends who love to put every new song Spotify suggests to them in their Instagram Story, but that’s not exactly how the switch is supposed to work. &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/psjmqp/anyone_facing_audio_issue_when_phone_is_on_mute/"&gt;Silent mode is primarily meant to control system sounds&lt;/a&gt; like ringtones and text tones, not the audio you hear inside apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fYb3oH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook is working on a fix&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cpFWyN"&gt;I was able to recreate the behavior on my own iPhone running iOS 15. For some users, the issue popped up even earlier during the public beta of Apple’s software update. It’s not clear if this issue is impacting other users running older versions of iOS, and Facebook didn’t confirm if the issue was specifically related to iOS 15. The company did provide the following statement promising a fix, however:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="dRYHtH"&gt;We’re aware that some people are having trouble hearing their audio in Instagram Stories. We’re working to fix this issue as quickly as possible and apologize for any inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="8KO1BY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reached out for more information about the issue and to see if the company can share a timeline for when the fix could arrive. In the meantime, try and enjoy the peace and quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BChkja"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to pair Bluetooth headphones with your Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Nintendo Switch with OLED screen" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I5Ij1WF8ugksU6zSTiYlIPO2Gx0=/110x0:1330x813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69900290/joy_con_02.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two controllers is the maximum amount you’ll be able to use while Bluetooth headphones are connected.&lt;/em&gt; | Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kVEfGJ"&gt;Setting up a pair of wireless Bluetooth headphones with a Nintendo Switch used to be a multistep — and somewhat costly — process. First, you needed headphones, then you needed a Bluetooth audio transmitter that’d either plug into your Switch’s headphone jack or its bottom-facing USB-C port. Well, after about four years, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674704/nintendo-switch-bluetooth-audio-software-update"&gt;Nintendo surprised us with a system update&lt;/a&gt; that finally enables said feature natively — no accessories required. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MA6x6s"&gt;Some Bluetooth transmitters, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/7/13/17570350/nintendo-switch-wireless-headphones-bluetooth-audio-support-adapter"&gt;Genki’s Switch adapter&lt;/a&gt;, may still be worth investing in if you want to be able to connect multiple headphones simultaneously (the Switch only allows one set of headphones to be paired at once). But if it’s just you and your Switch, the newer process is no more complicated than pairing headphones with your smartphone. That said, there are still a few steps involved, which we’re going to run through below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="11PjQY"&gt;Put your headphones into pairing mode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="moC1ww"&gt;On most pairs of Bluetooth headphones, you can enter pairing mode by pressing and holding the power button down for longer than it takes to turn them on. Most models will make a distinct chime or have LEDs that flash at a faster pace to indicate that pairing mode is active.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pdyKxh9VnW4Z_YhEsN_8TIiLaY0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360993/bfarsace_4467_20210310_0002.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="x2Apdr"&gt;This feature isn’t limited to big over-ear or on-ear headphones, either. You can pair wireless earbuds, too, but the pairing process might be a little different for those. You can easily pair Apple’s AirPods with the Switch, for example, but you’ll need to open the case with the AirPods inside of them and press the pairing button on the side of the case. If all else fails, check your headphones’ instruction manual or look up the process online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Owx0op"&gt;Find the Bluetooth audio setting on your Switch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XNPDTv"&gt;From there, go to the Switch’s main menu where you can select a game and click on the settings icon located beneath the game library. It looks like a gear.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8sKjaBX8x6AX4yv0V97YYrijxvk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22872751/IMG_1032.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iD58mK"&gt;In the next window, scroll down the left-hand pane until you see “Bluetooth Audio.” Click that, at which point your only option will be to click “Pair Device.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SFEDtABXR51bzt5vJyMJfPgAHjw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22872753/IMG_1036.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6LDO6U"&gt;Register your headphones with your Switch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="8wqKDM"&gt;With your headphones in pairing mode (and your Switch now actively looking for them), their model name should populate on the Switch’s screen. When it does, click the model name to begin pairing your headphones or earbuds with your Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWJhs8"&gt;When it’s successful, a window will pop up saying “Connected to Bluetooth audio.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lLoSzuw7wkOciJnAfQ0FVKOVyaY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22872764/IMG_1034.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Wcv3x5"&gt;If you run into issues — like if your Switch suddenly takes 30 seconds or so to wake up from sleep — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675831/nintendo-switch-bluetooth-issue-problem-fix-wake-sleep"&gt;my colleague Sean Hollister has the solution&lt;/a&gt; for you. &lt;a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/55973"&gt;Nintendo has also noted&lt;/a&gt; that by connecting headphones via Bluetooth, your Switch will be able to connect to just two wireless controllers, as opposed to several more under circumstances when you’re not paired. There might also be some audio latency, so what’s happening in the game might not totally line up with what you’re hearing. In my brief experience trying it out, however, it didn’t seem noticeably worse than when I relied on third-party Bluetooth transmitters.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Babies’ poop has way higher levels of microplastic than adults’ </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Baby with cloth diapers" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xF2qG3NdARoDbULZ_Zj5IfESD7c=/83x0:3917x2556/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69900284/1228455901.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gFsoEu"&gt;When it comes to babies, a considerable amount of plastic appears to be both going in one end and out the other, according to new research that involved spatulas, diapers, and poop. In particular, the average&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;concentration of one pervasive type of microplastic in baby stool was a whopping ten times higher than that in adult stool in a small pilot study published this week. The plastic, called&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;PET, or polyethylene terephthalate, is widely used in bottles and polyester textiles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2NHLWa"&gt;The results suggest that infants could be exposed to even higher levels of microplastics than adults, the study authors say. When babies shove toys or clothing in their mouths, they might end up ingesting tiny fibers or pieces of plastic. Then there are plastic food containers, sippy cups, and baby bottles, which can also shed pieces of PET smaller than the diameter of a pencil eraser.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Mixing hot water and formula in a plastic bottle can weaken the plastic and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-020-00171-y"&gt;unleash even more tiny pieces &lt;/a&gt;of it. Crawling babies are also much more likely than walking adults to get a face full of microfibers from polyester carpeting, which they might ingest or inhale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jl8Ryx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Something needs to be done.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7u7p1S"&gt;Scientists are still &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01143-3"&gt;trying to&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;figure out&lt;/a&gt; what that all means for babies’ health. There’s not a lot of research on how the microplastics all around us — and in our bodies — affect human health. But the new study on baby poop, published yesterday in the &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.estlett.1c00559"&gt;journal &lt;em&gt;Environmental Science &amp;amp; Technology Letters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, has some&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;researchers worried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rs2JDz"&gt;“Babies are exposed to high levels of plastics, something needs to be done,” says Kurunthachalam Kannan, co-author and professor of environmental medicine and pediatrics at the New York University School of Medicine. “Early life stages are very vulnerable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="smMB1j"&gt;Scientists used to think that ingested plastics would simply come out the other end, much like other things kids might eat that they shouldn’t have. But &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30641374/"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; published in 2019 suggests that very small pieces of plastic might actually be able to pass through cell membranes to infiltrate the body’s circulatory system. If that’s the case, microplastics could cause more problems. There’s evidence that microplastics in blood circulation could lead to inflammation and cell death, affecting the immune system, Kannan says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5MCkEy"&gt;Plastics also contain myriad chemicals, including &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2021.724989/full"&gt;endocrine disruptors&lt;/a&gt; that could mess with the body’s hormones and have been linked to adverse effects on metabolism and reproductive and neurological health. Babies can be more vulnerable to those effects than adults since their bodies are still growing and developing, and Kannan says the impact could linger into adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LcEzTZ"&gt;Kannan and his colleagues studied stool samples from six different one-year-olds in New York City. They also looked at three newborns’ very first poop. To do that, they scraped samples from diapers using spatulas — careful to avoid anything that was in direct contact with the diaper to avoid counting microplastics that might have come from the diaper and not from the baby. The researchers also decided not to test for plastic typically used in diapers, called polypropylene. Instead, they looked for PET and polycarbonate (another type of plastic commonly used in phone cases) in the poop. They found both types of plastic, but only saw a meaningful difference in PET concentrations between babies and adults. They took stool samples from 10 adults in Albany, New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W7u5tm"&gt;There’s not a lot known about how exposure to microplastics varies across places and populations. So this new study adds to the call for more research. “Our data provide baseline evidence for [microplastic] exposure doses in infants and adults and support the need for further studies with a larger sample size to corroborate and extend our findings,” the study says.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ezahKb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is a very interesting paper with some very worrying numbers.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DfBZ7d"&gt;“This is a very interesting paper with some very worrying numbers,” University of Strathclyde research fellow Deonie Allen, who wasn’t involved in the study, told &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/baby-poop-is-loaded-with-microplastics/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “We need to look at everything a child is exposed to, not just their bottles and toys.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gkmydh"&gt;The prevailing wisdom from twenty or thirty years ago that plastics are harmless is one reason why there hasn’t been much study on the matter since, Kannan says. For that to change, he says, there will need to be more federal support for research because studies that would look at an even wider population are often prohibitively expensive to perform. “You need millions of dollars to conduct a study like that with 1,000 samples,” he says. “Of course it will be a great study, but it needs a lot of resources.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New FTC memo calls for a focus on ‘structural dominance’ from big companies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Senate Commerce, Science And Transportation Committee Holds Confirmation Hearing" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LFBuOoXZPoUtmQmWyBJKbgcIGCo=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69900193/1232440380.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;In a memo to staff, Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan outlined issues she wants to prioritize at the agency | Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JNcm5K"&gt;In a memo to staff this week, FTC Chair Lina Khan outlined her new priorities for the agency: to focus on power imbalance, reduce harms to consumers, and address “rampant consolidation.” Khan wrote that the agency should focus its efforts and adjust its strategic approach to deal with the issues created by “next-generation technologies, innovations, and nascent industries across sectors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IdvsmY"&gt;And without mentioning Amazon, Apple, or Facebook by name, Khan’s list of priorities for the FTC signals that the tech giants are likely to face much closer scrutiny from the agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a6ZJ2o"&gt;First, Khan said, the FTC should take a “holistic” approach to how it considers antitrust violations, which can prove harmful to independent businesses and workers as well as consumers. “Business models that centralize control and profits while outsourcing risk, liability, and costs also warrant particular scrutiny, given that deeply asymmetric relationships between the controlling firm and dependent entities can be ripe for abuse,” Khan wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6XOsEL"&gt;Khan wants the agency’s enforcement efforts focused on root causes of and incentives for unlawful conduct, such as “conflicts of interest, business models, or structural dominance.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8u1paP"&gt;The concept of structural dominance is a familiar theme for Khan. She wrote about it while she was a student at Yale Law School, &lt;a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox"&gt;in a now-famous paper where she argued&lt;/a&gt; that Amazon had managed to skirt monopoly laws to the point that its structural power gives it vast influence across the economy. In that paper, Khan also excoriated the way investors “are willing to fund predatory growth,” citing Uber as an example of a company whose investors braced to endure significant losses with the belief that they would one day recover their losses and then some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="45iDQy"&gt;Khan’s memo this week echoes her earlier argument, calling out “the growing role of private equity and other investment vehicles” in ways that “may distort ordinary incentives” and fuel unfair competition. “Research documents how gatekeepers and dominant middlemen across the economy have been able to use their critical market position to hike fees, dictate terms, and protect and extend their market power,” she writes, adding that “deeply asymmetric relationships between the controlling firm and dependent entities can be ripe for abuse.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2MSVqC"&gt;In addition, Khan wants to find ways for the FTC to strengthen its merger enforcement, “to address rampant consolidation and the dominance that it has enabled across markets,” and examine how contracts can perpetuate “unfair methods of competition or unfair or deceptive practices.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3mole2"&gt;She also named noncompete agreements that can restrict workers from which jobs they can take, and right-to-repair restrictions as examples of unfair contracts. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302664/apple-france-repairability-scores-index-law-right-to-repair"&gt;Apple in particular has been criticized&lt;/a&gt; for the way it limits how much users can repair Apple devices they own, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22587331/right-to-repair-apple-iphone-ftc-lina-khan-open-meeting"&gt;FTC said earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that it would fight such restrictions. “Consumers, workers, franchisees, and other market participants are at a significant disadvantage when they are unable to negotiate freely over terms and conditions,” Khan wrote in the memo. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New York City passes new protections for delivery workers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A black-and-white image of three delivery workers dressed in casual clothing, their bikes visible in the background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KDg55SZjRemXt3JnEv74_y22J-c=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69899816/MontgomeryNYMAG_Deliveristas_Final_010.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photograph by Philip Montgomery&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wwy31Q"&gt;On Thursday, New York’s city council passed a package of six bills establishing new rights and protections for delivery workers, making it the first major city to address the intense working conditions associated with food delivery. Mayor DeBlasio has previously expressed support for the provisions and is expected to sign them into law without delay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vQVPFH"&gt;Passage of the bills was &lt;a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/work/2021/9/22/22687983/nyc-landmark-food-delivery-worker-pay-bathrooms"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;The City&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a local non-profit newsroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x4GCtO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22667600/delivery-workers-seamless-uber-relay-new-york-electric-bikes-apps"&gt;A &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; feature earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; detailed the intense conditions faced by delivery drivers who serve apps like Grubhub and Uber Eats. Wage theft is common, as is physical assault, and pay can fluctuate wildly. Because of the gig work model, there is little security against on-the-job injuries or earnings shortfalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1l7CAX"&gt;The measures passed today don’t address every danger faced by those workers, but they establish many long-sought protections. One measure requires most restaurants to let delivery workers use their bathrooms and institutes fines for bars and restaurants that refuse access. Another will establish minimum per-trip payments, similar to existing protections for Uber and Lyft drivers. Other measures would block apps from charging fees to deliver tips to workers (seen by labor advocates as a form of wage theft) and institute limits on how far a worker can be asked to travel for a delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="65KcXV"&gt;The bills are the result of sustained organizing by Los Deliveristas Unidos, a group organizing delivery workers as part of the Worker’s Justice Project. The group rallied at City Hall in April and has been pushing the mayor and city council for months to take action on these issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2kf9tT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clubhouse launches ‘Wave,’ a new way to pull friends into audio chats</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H0B6hqXjfCL3dctunmC-NBn8kQE=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69899782/clubhousenewlogo.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Clubhouse&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bFc0AK"&gt;After the feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679897/clubhouse-waves-invites-audio-rooms"&gt;was leaked last week&lt;/a&gt;, Clubhouse is officially launching a new way to invite people to audio chats called “Wave.” The company &lt;a href="https://blog.clubhouse.com/wave-clubhouse-new-feature/"&gt;announced the news&lt;/a&gt; at a surprise town hall on Thursday and is enabling the feature today for all users on iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LAJUJg"&gt;With Wave, you can invite friends to a live audio room just by tapping a waving hand emoji. Once they receive their invitation, they can choose to join your call and immediately get added to an audio room. The company’s blog explains in a bit more detail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="YTPZJd"&gt;To send a Wave, swipe right on the Hallway or tap the dots icon at the bottom left of the screen. Then tape the wave button next to the person you’d like to chat with. They’ll get a notification that you said hello, and know that you’re open to chatting. If they are too, they can join a private room with you — open just to the people you waved at. You can keep it to one social circle, introduce friends from different groups to each other, or open the room up more broadly and make it for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f3JyxGcw78sU5mwxmePOw8IpUDQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22872988/Wave_Infographics__4_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Clubhouse&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Each Wave will send a notification that your friends can respond to.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PqGeD0"&gt;If someone doesn’t immediately respond, you can continue to use Clubhouse as you normally would. The company also says, to avoid confusion, if you have the app on in the background, you won’t immediately be pulled into a room if someone responds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ErBo5P"&gt;Clubhouse seems to want to encourage more causal, social, small moments in its app, which as of late has seemed to become associated with professional, appointment-based experiences. The company brought its app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/9/22424399/clubhouse-android-app-release-date-news-features"&gt;to Android in May&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586845/clubhouse-open-beta-invite-access-android-ios"&gt;removed its waitlist in July&lt;/a&gt;, which means there might be more people to casually talk to than when the app first launched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zezSxa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 9/23 3:20PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added image from Clubhouse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California passes law targeting Amazon labor algorithms</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cFtD_77gjad7YgsoneDn_Mo57tg=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69835223/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0001.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JbtOLW"&gt;California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) signed a bill Wednesday that would block Amazon and other companies from punishing warehouse workers who fail to meet certain performance metrics for taking rest or meal breaks. The California Senate approved the measure earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FzGMsr"&gt;The law allows warehouse workers to challenge performance goals that many say discourage them from taking bathroom breaks or other rest breaks throughout the work day. The bill was written in response to high rates of reported injuries at Amazon warehouses where performance quotas are algorithmically enforced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uZZrNl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The bill is the first attempt to create transparency and protections”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KD88R7"&gt;The law does not explicitly name Amazon in its text, but both Republican and Democratic lawmakers recognize that the e-commerce giant would be greatly affected by the enactment of the legislation. Over the last few years, Amazon has come under intense criticism for its performance quotas with several outlets reporting that workers have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/16/17243026/amazon-warehouse-jobs-worker-conditions-bathroom-breaks"&gt;peed in bottles&lt;/a&gt; as a means of meeting their warehouse fulfillment goals and maintaining their jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0CetAi"&gt;The law will also force companies like Amazon to make these performance algorithms more transparent, disclosing quotas to both workers and regulators. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PxRT26"&gt;Still, supporters of the new law have presented it as a breakthrough against algorithmic monitoring of workers generally. “The bill is the first attempt to create transparency and protections against unsafe algorithmic-enforced quota systems used by corporations like to push warehouse workers’ bodies to the breaking point,” Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez (D) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LorenaAD80/status/1435746747226066946?s=20"&gt;said in a tweet&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wZ5EmZ"&gt;Business groups have come out &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/08/business/economy/amazon-labor-california-senate.html"&gt;in opposition of the bill&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that it would harm the industry by empowering employees to file lawsuits that could be costly and time-consuming for companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AMOhBl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 9/23/21 at 3:08PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Changed headline and body text to reflect the bill was signed into law.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Nest Hub and Nest Hub Max can now show visual responses and the UI in Spanish</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j5XW3Zhz9_tlOlapPWfxF7aqlJ8=/166x0:1957x1194/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69899646/Google_Nest_Hub___Google_Duo___Spanish.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Google Duo call with the UI in Spanish.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="meHCnF"&gt;Google is &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/google-nest/spanish-nest-hub-and-hub-max-us/"&gt;expanding Spanish language support&lt;/a&gt; for its Nest Hub and Nest Hub Max devices in the US. Perhaps the biggest change is that the entire UI for the Nest Hub and Nest Hub Max has been translated into Spanish. That means things like visual answers to your queries and control panels now appear in Spanish, Google tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IczE-3icc3k6mC6po_XSjSCy-rI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22872792/Google_Nest_Hub___Your_Day_Screen___Spanish.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nest Hub’s UI in Spanish.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kUiqWM"&gt;Google has added a handful of new commands that might be useful around the house. One lets you add items to a shopping list — Google gives the example command, “Hey Google, agrega huevos a mi lista de compras” (which translates to “Hey Google, add eggs to my shopping list”). Another lets you call friends and family on Google Duo by saying something like “Hey Google, llama a mamá” (“Hey Google, call mom”). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="INz2Jy"&gt;Two new features make it easier to enjoy music and video from streaming services. You can ask Google to play music from “several” free and subscription music services on their Nest Hub and Nest Hub Max, while people with a YouTube TV subscription can stream Univision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QwCSzW"&gt;You can also try out the Mexican Bingo game “Lotería” right on your Nest Hub or Nest Hub Max, and you can play in English or Spanish. In Spanish, you can start playing it by saying, “Hey Google, habla con &lt;a href="https://assistant.google.com/services/a/uid/000000268d183d8a?e=-WebDirectoryEmbeddedWebviewExperiment&amp;amp;jsmode=o"&gt;Loteria Don Clemente&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Surface Laptop Studio isn’t as original as Microsoft would have you believe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VHBysXNMSvCzDRJTx_o0vA53heU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69899608/vpavic_210921_4770_0009.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tcr1Hc"&gt;Okay, I know this might be partially my fault. When I reviewed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21271796/microsoft-surface-book-3-review-price-specs-features-13-5-screen"&gt;Microsoft’s 13.5-inch Surface Book 3&lt;/a&gt; last year, I complained that the design was dated. I complained that my biggest nitpicks about the Surface Book 2 (which I’ve owned for years, by the way) hadn’t been fixed. Microsoft still hadn’t figured out how to do anything new or fun with the detachable, I lamented. “This form factor might be a dead end.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XsRvvH"&gt;I love the Surface Book and am a staunch defender of the line. I couldn’t see myself using anything else as my primary driver. I hoped — prayed — that my words would result in Microsoft releasing a slimmer, sleeker, better Surface Book 4. I hoped they’d spur Microsoft into pushing the full-sized detachable workstation, a form factor that really only Microsoft has ever mastered, to heights it had never seen before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t6QOqz"&gt;Unfortunately, Microsoft appears to have done the opposite. The Surface Book line, it appears, is no more. Instead, we got the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22686706/microsoft-surface-studio-laptop-design-specs-photos-hands-on"&gt;Surface Laptop Studio&lt;/a&gt;, a product that Microsoft is pushing as a groundbreaking innovation, but which is really — as anyone who closely follows PC releases can tell you — a step backward out of the innovative space and into territory that’s more familiar to the laptop sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="oDJ4bo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Surface Laptop Studio is Microsoft’s new powerful flagship laptop ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22686010/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-price-specs-release-date"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6ExnKW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Instead of doing something — anything — new with the Surface Book form factor, Microsoft has gotten rid of it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XJAFtP"&gt;So this Surface Laptop Studio is a laptop with a 360-degree hinge. A stylus lives on the bottom edge. You can use the device like a regular clamshell. You can pull the display forward over the keyboard and prop it up right above the touchpad like a little tent (a position Microsoft is calling “stage mode”). Or you can flip the display around, over the hinge, and use the thing like a tablet. Those are the only three positions — the hinge can’t hold the screen at whatever angle you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WSR7J2"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iOb31Uc4XKM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tOoAp9"&gt;Now, Microsoft is pitching this as the next step for the Book line: a new, innovative form factor. “It is the culmination of years of Surface innovation — on hinges, display, silicon, and more,” Microsoft’s vice president of devices said of the Studio. CEO Satya Nadella declared that the company was “creating a new laptop category.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VgLZZv"&gt;But if you follow the laptop market anywhere near as closely as I do, it’s hard not to look at this device and think, “Oh boy, another one of these.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kJ4MpW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Acer ConceptD 7 Ezel is the dream computer I’ll never own","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22430445/acer-conceptd-7-ezel-2021-review"},{"title":"Acer Predator Triton 900 review: weird flex","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/12/20691638/acer-predator-triton-900-review-price-specs-features"},{"title":"HP Elite Folio review: style over substance","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22620111/hp-elite-folio-2021-review-arm-windows-10-apps-features-specs-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="MAx5PR"&gt;Just to catch up everyone else: This is not a new or unique design. For one, ThinkPads were doing something similar &lt;a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/THINK-A-brief-history-of-ThinkPads-from-IBM-to-Lenovo.418728.0.html"&gt;in literally 1994&lt;/a&gt;. But to pull a more modern example out of the air, HP’s been doing these for a couple years, and its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22620111/hp-elite-folio-2021-review-arm-windows-10-apps-features-specs-price"&gt;2021 Elite Folio&lt;/a&gt; is basically this thing covered in leather. That laptop also has a stylus (though it lives in an arguably more convenient location just above the keyboard). HP declined to comment on the Surface Laptop Studio for this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ba_FsbbYApDGiR-KOLJR88Rrvsk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22872631/1280px_ThinkPad_360PE_mid_fold.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I wasn’t making that up. This is from 1994.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1FhZ2LiAvW97s_1nRTmtL3C_R90=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22872555/1280px_ThinkPad_360PE_tablet_mode.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This one worked as a tablet, too. Look, there’s even a stylus!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YO5zYm"&gt;Acer (you know, that small, obscure laptop manufacturer) was also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/31/4380132/acer-aspire-r7-review"&gt;doing a similar form factor&lt;/a&gt; as early as 2013. It has a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/12/20691638/acer-predator-triton-900-review-price-specs-features"&gt;gaming laptop&lt;/a&gt; that’s kind of like this. It has a whole line of creator-oriented workstations that are basically this. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22430445/acer-conceptd-7-ezel-2021-review"&gt;ConceptD Ezel&lt;/a&gt; is actually a more advanced form of this design with more powerful components (as Acer pointed out to me when I pinged the company for comment). That screen can stay put at whatever angle you want, so you can float it at infinite angles above the deck, use it as a reverse-clamshell with the screen facing away from (but still perpendicular to) the keyboard, or put it in any number of other positions. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A9hWhUGj5UMlbdmNHGxIBLl5248=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22868476/vpavic_210921_4770_0030.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the Studio from the back. Mmmm. Laptop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cTUi65"&gt;The Laptop Studio can’t even make a cost-savings case against these two laptops. Its base model (with a Core i5, integrated graphics, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage) &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fstore%2Fconfigure%2FSurface-Laptop-Studio%2F8SRDF62SWKPF%3Fcrosssellid%3Dfbt-f5c%26selectedColor%3D%26preview%3D%26previewModes%3D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is $1,599.99&lt;/a&gt;, and the stylus and its charger are an extra $164.98 together; a comparable &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeSurfaceLaptopStudio092321&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fpdp%2Fhp-elite-folio-135-inch-2-in-1-notebook-pc" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elite Folio&lt;/a&gt; (stylus included) is currently listed at $1,416, and a &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/vergeSurfaceProStudio092321/https://store.acer.com/en-us/conceptd-3-ezel-cc314-72g-72sx" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ConceptD 3 Ezel&lt;/a&gt; (stylus included) with a Core i7, a discrete GPU, and twice the storage is $1,499.99. And before you all start on build quality — the Elite Folio and the ConceptD are both very nice laptops with excellent keyboards and touchpads. They’re premium devices targeting a deep-pocketed crowd. (I mean, the Elite Folio is literally covered in leather.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3HWdM8"&gt;And in addition to these direct competitors, there are various &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20923662/microsoft-surface-pro-7-review-tablet-specs-features-price-usb-c-windows-10"&gt;Surface Pro&lt;/a&gt; clones that serve a pretty similar use case. To be clear, the old Surface Book and new Surface Laptop Studio are very different from the Surface Pro and its ilk: they’re full-sized laptops with chips in their base (and optional discrete GPUs), while Surface Pros are Windows tablets to which you can attach a keyboard and kickstand. But I think the case for a Surface Book over a Surface Pro is still much stronger than the case for a Surface Laptop Studio over a Surface Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XSsE1V"&gt;&lt;q&gt;While the Surface Laptop Studio may be a great device, it’s not a new laptop category&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1y5tc8"&gt;Think about it: the Surface Laptop Studio only has three positions, and something like the Surface Pro or the excellent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22376272/lenovo-thinkpad-x12-detachable-review"&gt;ThinkPad X12 Detachable&lt;/a&gt; can be in all those positions as well. It can be a clamshell laptop or a tablet, and detaching the keyboard but leaving the kickstand up will serve the same use case as stage mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QcRd0M"&gt;In short, while the Surface Laptop Studio may be a great device, it’s not a new laptop category. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The HP Elite Folio in easel mode, angled to the right, on an outdoor table with a river in the background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bb-dz7b8Yz58uqzE7n2TyIrKMWM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774696/mchin_191104_4704_0004.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the HP Elite Folio. Hmmm, look familiar?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IZYqMk"&gt;And that’s okay! A laptop doesn’t need to be a new category to be a compelling buy. And the Studio certainly has some advantages over HP’s and Acer’s lines. It has a more powerful processor than the Folio, which is powered by a Snapdragon chip. And perhaps most crucially, it has a higher resolution screen than both of those models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TEhMDa"&gt;But I’m still not convinced that this laptop will court fans of either of those devices. They’re both targeting fairly specific audiences who are uniquely suited to this sort of convertible form factor, and they fit those audiences very well. It could have more success creating converts from the Surface Pro sphere, especially those who want a larger screen than those tablets offer. But those folks will also have to pay a bit more for that real estate. A comparable &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fconfigurator%2Fcto%2Findex.html%3FbundleId%3D20UWCTO1WWUS1%26ecpn%3D&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F23%2F22688432%2Fmicrosoft-surface-laptop-studio-book-3-specs-step-backwards" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ThinkPad X12 Detachable&lt;/a&gt; (stylus and keyboard included) is a good $300 cheaper than this laptop as of this writing. The Surface Pro 8 is also a bit cheaper, even if you add the price of the type cover. The Laptop Studio’s extra inches of screen may not be worth it to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9bNZ9t"&gt;A bigger screen also means a heftier body — both of those detachable devices (with their keyboards on) are over a pound lighter than the Studio, which is also heavier than the Surface Book 3. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer ConceptD 7 Ezel with the screen floating above the keyboard, seen from the left side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qDVOBYAJugfuuZkRbCZhLUJ5ugI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22490293/akrales_20210503_4515_0071.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is an Acer ConceptD Ezel. Wee, look what this thing can do!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="J1X1YM"&gt;My best guess is that the Surface Laptop Studio is best positioned to appeal to people who were already fans of the Surface Book line. And as a member of this apparently small group, this is where I’m really hung up. Because while pretty much everything about the Surface Book was good, the reason I was willing to pay such a high price for it was the innovation behind it. It was an &lt;em&gt;impressive &lt;/em&gt;device; Microsoft was the only company making it. It met a unique combination of needs that no other laptop in the world could meet. In my past few years as a Surface Book owner, I’ve considered switching to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22264792/hp-spectre-x360-14-laptop-stylus-oled-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Spectre&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;XPS&lt;/a&gt; many times, but I just could never do it — I just couldn’t give up that detachable screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XYqEW6"&gt;Sure, the Surface Book wasn’t perfect. But it was something different — and in the crowded and competitive laptop space, it’s rare to see a laptop that’s truly one of a kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zM6Ie7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft says the original Surface Duo will get Android 11 before the end of the year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Microsoft Surface Duo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VQ2mngOvSwDTvhWyRP24eZCldbk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69899054/vpavic_4176_20200905_0038.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bhD1iS"&gt;Microsoft announced a new Surface Duo 2 this week that’s shipping with Android 11, and now the company is committing to release the OS update for original devices this year. “We remain committed to providing updates to Surface Duo, and we’re working to bring Android 11 to existing customers before the end of this year,” says a Microsoft spokesperson in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VRRzj2"&gt;That’s not a firm release date, but then we’ve never had one for Android 11 on the Surface Duo. &lt;a href="https://www.drwindows.de/news/surface-duo-android-11-kommt-im-sommer-microsoft-mit-langfristigem-bekenntnis"&gt;Previous reports&lt;/a&gt; suggested it would land in the summer, but as we move closer to fall and there was no mention at Microsoft’s Surface event, it’s clearly taking longer than expected.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Surface Duo 2 has larger screens." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8r3JkoPUphqvwT1L9JZeafRVesE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22868420/bfarsace_210921_4770_0031.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Duo 2 has larger screens.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uUCkHe"&gt;We’re still waiting to hear exactly what Android 11 on the Surface Duo will bring. Android 11 has native support for dual-screen devices like the Duo, so it should improve some of the software experiences on the device. During our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22686707/microsoft-surface-duo-2-phone-design-specs-features-photos-hands-on"&gt;brief look at the Surface Duo 2&lt;/a&gt;, it seems like  Android 11 brings minor tweaks to Microsoft’s multitasking system, rather than an overhaul. The Surface Duo 2 now defaults to assuming that the right-hand screen is the primary one, but it’s not clear if that same change will come to the original Surface Duo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FMaRNm"&gt;While Microsoft has shipped a number of updates for the Surface Duo, it has still remained a fairly buggy device. Surface Duo users have complained of regular issues with multitasking and gestures, a screen turning off during book mode, and lockups using the fingerprint reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T8cVY5"&gt;Android 11 will now arrive just as Google moves on to Android 12. We’re expecting Android 12 to debut on Pixel devices imminently, and it’s not clear when the Surface Duo and Surface Duo 2 will be updated. Microsoft has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366636/microsoft-surface-duo-android-updates-three-years-support-security"&gt;previously committed&lt;/a&gt; to three years of OS and security updates for the Surface Duo.&lt;/p&gt;
