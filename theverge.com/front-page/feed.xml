    <title>Moped-sharing startup Revel plans to launch a Tesla-only ride-hailing service in NYC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PcvBBuHvudFGcunD2kdBEHxbMHI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69198944/revel_pressimage.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VdBjRF"&gt;Electric moped-sharing startup Revel is adding a new vehicle to its fleet — this time with four wheels instead of two. The Brooklyn-based company is launching its own Uber-esque ride-hailing service in New York City using only electric vehicles from Tesla. And true to its Uber-imitating ways, the company is announcing its intention to launch the service before obtaining its license to legally to operate in the city. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9OJcCM"&gt;It’s an interesting — and potentially risky — move for the three-year-old startup with thousands of shared electric mopeds in cities across the US. As it grows in size, Revel has also gotten more ambitious, launching an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22279921/revel-ebike-subscription-nyc-price-specs"&gt;e-bike subscription service&lt;/a&gt; and unveiling plans to build &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/electric-moped-startup-revel-launches-an-ev-charging-business/"&gt;the largest EV charging station in New York City&lt;/a&gt;. Now, it has its sights set on Uber and Lyft’s customers as it expands into ride-hailing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="F8EYCw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s an interesting — and potentially risky — move&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c09nRK"&gt;But rather than poach customers from Uber and Lyft, Revel may end up hurting New York City’s already struggling yellow taxi drivers. The company says it plans to offer its service only in Manhattan to start out, with pick-ups and drop-offs taking place below 42nd Street. The company says it will expand into additional neighborhoods and boroughs based on where the demand is. That’s prime yellow cab territory, and with &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/09/us/yellow-taxi-drivers-new-york-covid/index.html"&gt;ridership still down 80–90 percent since March 2020&lt;/a&gt;, the timing couldn’t be worse for many cab drivers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f9Ut59"&gt;The city’s Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) has been at odds with Uber and Lyft over the years &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/7/20758796/nyc-uber-lyft-cap-extended-tlc-de-blasio"&gt;over its efforts to cap the number of for-hire-vehicle licenses&lt;/a&gt; it hands out. The TLC exempts wheelchair-accessible and electric vehicles from the cap, giving Revel a loophole to launch its Tesla-only service.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A25FhO"&gt;“TLC capped for-hire vehicles because supply already exceeds demand,” TLC Commissioner and Chair Aloysee Heredia Jarmoszuk said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The electric battery exemption exists to encourage already-licensed cars to go green, not to flood an already saturated market or to disenfranchise the Yellow Taxi sector in Manhattan. This ride-share scheme deviates from the spirit of those rules, and TLC will not cut corners in doing its full diligence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gvHYt0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This ride-share scheme deviates from the spirit of those rules”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k8ZVt6"&gt;A TLC spokesperson was more blunt, saying, “Revel is not licensed to operate for-hire transportation vehicles in NYC.” But Revel says that, as of this month, the TLC approved its base application and issued its base license number. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aLLfhc"&gt;“We are currently finalizing this process,” a Revel spokesperson said. “Revel has always, and will continue to operate legally in any city where we offer our service.” (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/9/7/3300244/uber-taxi-new-york-travis-kalanick-rogue"&gt;Uber famously flouted the TLC’s rules&lt;/a&gt; when it launched in New York City back in 2012.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Huyxzt"&gt;Revel wouldn’t reveal its pricing, but it said it would be competitive with Uber and Lyft. In New York City, vehicle-for-hire firms charge on a per-mile basis, with booking fees and Black Car Fund surcharges tacked on at the end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="npFQQN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10468916"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lKoqUE"&gt;If it ultimately receives the green light to launch, Revel clearly wants to make a splash with its all-Tesla fleet. The company has 50 bright blue Tesla Model Y vehicles with Revel’s logo emblazoned on the side for the initial launch. The Model Ys will be slightly modified, with the front passenger seat removed for added legroom. As per COVID-19 guidelines, a plastic partition will separate the driver from the passengers, and the vehicles will be cleaned on a daily basis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z0g9mQ"&gt;The fleet will be owned by Revel, which is another divergence from Uber and Lyft, which subscribe to an asset-light business model where the drivers or vehicle-for-hire bases own the vehicles. As such, Revel will be responsible for all of the costs associated with ride-hailing, including maintenance, cleanings, and refueling — or in this case, battery charging. To help with that, Revel’s new Superhub charging station will go online with its first 10 chargers starting in June 2020, with more locations planned for across the city in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K3K6Av"&gt;Drivers will be hired as employees by Revel and will have access to training, health care, and paid time off. This is similar to how Revel classifies its workers who rebalance the company’s fleet of electric mopeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="K1TkOV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ride-sharing raises a host of new possibilities for Revel&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rTNuI4"&gt;It’s unclear whether the company’s differences from Uber and Lyft will be enough to convince regulators that it would have a negative impact on the yellow taxi industry in New York City. Uber’s emergence over nine years ago has sent taxi medallion prices tumbling, with many indebted drivers calling for a bailout from the city. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/23/nyregion/nyc-taxi-suicides.html"&gt;Nearly a thousand drivers have filed for bankruptcy, with at least six drivers dying from suicide&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vsj9MA"&gt;Ride-sharing also raises a host of safety concerns. Uber and Lyft have long struggled to keep riders and drivers safe from one another. In its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20997939/uber-safety-report-2018-sexual-assault-ride-hailing-platform-stats"&gt;first safety report&lt;/a&gt;, Uber disclosed that 3,045 sexual assaults occurred on Uber trips in 2018 alone. Additionally, nine people were murdered during Uber rides, and 58 people died in auto-related crashes. Drivers reported being victims of assaults at roughly the same rate as riders. Uber and Lyft recently agreed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325675/uber-lyft-driver-deactivate-assault-murder-share-safety"&gt;share information&lt;/a&gt; on drivers who were deactivated for committing serious offenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TXAlLL"&gt;Revel has already sparred with the City of New York over its sometimes-scofflaw moped customers. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21344993/revel-suspends-electric-moped-nyc-people-killed"&gt;Revel was forced to temporarily shut down&lt;/a&gt; its service after two customers were killed and one was critically injured while riding the shared electric mopeds. The company eventually resumed service with &lt;a href="https://gorevel.com/safety/"&gt;new protective measures for riders&lt;/a&gt; like a mandatory in-app safety test and a requirement that all riders take a selfie of themselves wearing a helmet before they’ll be allowed to ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ShL0ss"&gt;Revel also isn’t the first micromobility company to consider leveling up to cars. Scooter- and bike-sharing service Lime briefly flirted with electric car-sharing with its LimePod product in Seattle, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/19/lime-is-shutting-down-car-rental-service-limepod/"&gt;only to shut it down after a few months&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wrZ9hb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Wktrz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Beefing over beef is a distraction the climate movement can’t afford </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Shake Shack Burger Chain Considers I.P.O." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WOT21nr3m15TEeKEVxUXD3vB29M=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69198925/453780980.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A burger in New York City.&amp;nbsp; | Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ldpaj9"&gt;Lately, it seems like forgoing red meat has become an unfortunate proxy for environmental credentials. &lt;em&gt;Epicurious&lt;/em&gt;, for example, just &lt;a href="https://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/why-epicurious-left-beef-behind-article"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it will no longer publish articles or recipes with beef in a decision it calls, “not anti-beef but rather pro-planet.” And then there are headlines like “&lt;a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/why-do-some-green-activists-eat-meat/"&gt;Why do some green activists eat meat&lt;/a&gt;?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iUhXmQ"&gt;Meat-eating, meanwhile, has become a sort of symbol for climate denial. There are Twitter wars swirling around whether Biden’s climate ambitions will infringe on Americans’ right to eat burgers (his actual climate proposals would not).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TjCkG1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Diet shouldn’t be a political scorecard for how down you are for the planet&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yAGA0K"&gt;But diet shouldn’t be a political scorecard for how down you are for the planet. Shaming people over what they eat — particularly for girls, immigrants, and people who don’t fit the unfairly skinny box of beauty standards — is nothing new. We don’t need to add one more minefield. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X3lm8J"&gt;Focusing heavily on individual responsibility to save the planet can also be a big distraction from the actual systemic change needed to tackle the global climate crisis. What’s more, it can alienate people who do care about climate change but might not have as many options when it comes to what they eat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u7hP2q"&gt;Livestock are responsible for a &lt;a href="http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/197623/icode/"&gt;hefty 14.5 percent chunk&lt;/a&gt; of global greenhouse gas emissions. Meat industries have taken efforts to &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22379909/big-meat-companies-spend-millions-lobbying-climate"&gt;obscure&lt;/a&gt; the connection between meat and climate change. So these industries should be held accountable for the damage they do to the planet we call home. As a media outlet and respected food institution, &lt;em&gt;Epicurious&lt;/em&gt; does have some power and responsibility to do just that by leaving beef behind.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I0GSjl"&gt;Most individuals don’t carry the same weight on their shoulders, especially if you live in a neighborhood where fresh produce or meat alternatives feel out of reach. Taking on the climate crisis is a battle against structural barriers and systemic failures. It’s about confronting power, not people’s dinner choices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="KWDMi9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Confronting power, not people’s dinner choices&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fND22h"&gt;Having the alternatives easily available to be able to give up beef, for example, might require some level of privilege. Up to &lt;a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-access-research-atlas/documentation/"&gt;54 million people&lt;/a&gt; in the US — more than 17 percent of the US population — live in low-income census tracts without a grocery store nearby. If you’re in one of these food deserts, a hot dog from a gas station or a burger from McDonald’s might just be what’s at hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r5A4Hm"&gt;“Boycotts of terrible retailers are a wonderful idea until you realize that they are the only option in some areas,” Mikki Kendall writes in her book, &lt;em&gt;Hood Feminism: Notes from the Women That a Movement Forgot&lt;/em&gt;. “Who is being hurt more? The corporation, or the people who rely on it for access to food?” Kendall’s book is broadly about how mainstream feminist groups can marginalize girls and women of color when they fail to recognize other inequities and injustices they face — including food insecurity. Mainstream environmentalism can apply similar lessons to their movement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="87e888"&gt;“All too often, our culture broadly equates ‘environmentalism’ with personal consumerism. To be ‘good,’ we must convert to 100 percent solar energy, ride an upcycled bike everywhere, stop flying, eat vegan,” &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/5/28/18629833/climate-change-2019-green-new-deal"&gt;writes Mary Annaïse Heglar&lt;/a&gt;, a climate justice essayist, in &lt;em&gt;Vox&lt;/em&gt;. “All this raises the price of admission to the climate movement to an exorbitant level, often pricing out people of color and other marginalized groups.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="699YEv"&gt;There could, of course, be big gains for people and the planet if there were better access to fresh fruits and vegetables for everyone regardless of identity, income, or where they live. That’s a conversation about empowerment and self-determination, not shame and moral high grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tq6bOd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Empowerment and self-determination, not shame and moral high grounds&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mxJk3Y"&gt;There already are plenty of people who abstain from meat for environmental, cultural, or personal reasons. And if someone does want to reduce their individual carbon footprint, there’s &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/videos/2017/12/12/16762900/mediterranean-diet-pescatarian-climate-change"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; that cutting down on meat is one of the most effective ways to do that. The best way to support people who do want to eat less meat might be to ensure they have access to the foods they actually want. Again, choosing what you eat is easier said than done when you don’t have fresh foods or culturally specific ingredients nearby. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ptWe7S"&gt;There are even more disparities to consider when it comes to food and the climate crisis. Not everyone is equally responsible for the problem. Researchers have found that the typical diet of white Americans had &lt;a href="https://grist.org/article/dear-white-people-we-need-to-talk-about-your-diets-carbon-footprint/"&gt;higher per capita greenhouse gas emissions&lt;/a&gt; compared to that of Black and Latinx Americans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fOWOJy"&gt;But again, focusing heavily on individual choice and responsibility to save the planet can be a big distraction. We’re seeing that play out now with the drama over the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/04/26/republicans-meat-biden-climate-plan/"&gt;false story&lt;/a&gt; that Joe Biden plans to limit Americans’ red meat consumption to four pounds a year. Biden has never suggested such a meat limit. Instead, he’s proposed dramatically making over the nation’s infrastructure to transition toward clean energy — an actual policy debate with a lot more rhetorical meat to sink your teeth into. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iWVpy0"&gt;That saga also highlights how much food can be tied to identity, and how shaming someone for their diet tends to divide and disempower people rather than get them to act on climate change. Ultimately, everyone deserves to be at the table if they care about the climate. Refusing someone a seat because they’re not readily abandoning meat hurts more than it helps. Each person might have something different to offer, whether it’s a dish, an idea, or a vote. The solutions make up a potluck — not a prix fixe, one-size-fits-all menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="svMClw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K6XGsS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLjcArAq4sGebo8JT2J9VP6QFsQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mf4umG"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It’s never a bad idea to wait until there’s a good deal, and thankfully, those happen with some regularity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently three models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;. The latest model, and the highest end, is the Apple Watch Series 6 with GPS and Wi-Fi connectivity, which starts at $399. If that’s a little too expensive, you can drop about $120 off the price by buying an Apple Watch SE, which also launched this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Im58vs"&gt;Finally, the three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt; is the most affordable Apple Watch model to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. If you’re looking for something to last a few years, though, it’s probably worth looking at one of the other two watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will deliver software updates to the Series 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6WKu4"&gt;While deals are a fairly regular occurrence, there will be times where there are no price drops on new models. For those times, we also include some deals on refurbished models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199 ($229 for the 42mm), which is a decent deal. It’s a great entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and don’t want to burn a massive hole in your wallet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HTWFvq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514914"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="ns6w5t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Watch Series 3 (non-LTE) review: third time’s the charm","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="q5eI6X"&gt;Currently, the 38mm Series 3 is $169 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-38mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F499753351%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_XyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVsfTmWQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DXyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVsfTmWQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D955948%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAppleWatchDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, which is $30 off its usual price of $199. If you are looking for the Series 3 in 42mm, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-42mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F185638711%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_XyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVsfWmWQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DXyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVsfWmWQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D955948%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAppleWatchDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; has knocked down its price to $179, down from $229.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3G29qi"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable and shares some features also found on the flagship Series 6 model, such as a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. But it doesn’t have the always-on display found on the Series 5 and Series 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qq3ebV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TNieh7"&gt;When it comes to the Echo smart speakers, Amazon has a slew of devices to choose from, one for practically every occasion. For example, maybe you simply want to add Alexa to a room, or you are looking for an Echo device that will allow you to easily manage your other smart home products. Regardless of the reason, these are the best Echo deals currently available right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zNwIju"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="maQ5h0"&gt;Late last year, Amazon released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;4th generation of the Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which looks more like a sphere than an actual dot. But if you prefer the previous design, don’t worry — Amazon has not discontinued the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;3rd-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which still retains the familiar dot shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyVkKL"&gt;During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we saw the 4th-gen Echo Dot go down to its lowest price of $30, which is what it is going for now at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ8C8F5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733331480519791842#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-smart-speaker-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795702%3Fpreselect%3D80770243%26clkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. There is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-With-Clock-4th-Gen/dp/B085M66LH1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a model with a built-in LED display&lt;/a&gt; to show the time, weather, and other information that is available for $40, which is $20 below its usual $60 price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YHsulr"&gt;Amazon is also selling some bundles, including a $40 one that features &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08K4FDPHZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one Sengled Bluetooth bulb&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Amazon-Smart-Charcoal/dp/B08GTWC9ZB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot and Amazon Smart Plug bundle&lt;/a&gt; available for $40. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QG96M6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zX6pQw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot Kids Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LzhwpX"&gt;The 4th-gen Echo Dot Kids Edition is as spherical as its adult version but is designed to look like a tiger or panda. The device also comes with a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which provides access to a slew of kid-friendly content, like audiobooks and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmKSqg"&gt;We have seen this product go down to $40, which is what it is currently available for now at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B084J4QQK1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725323423176814123#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-kids-edition-with-parental-controls%2F-%2FA-81795703%3Fpreselect%3D81502548%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergebestechodeals02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon is also selling a bundle for $55 which includes an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B08GV4SF3W?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot Kids Edition plus an Echo Glow&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MJlccr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9574374"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3GbSWO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wOHvPj"&gt;The 4th-gen Amazon Echo smart home hub has also gotten an updated look. Like the 4th-gen Echo Dot, the 2020 Amazon Echo has a sphere-shaped design, but it’s noticeably bigger than the Echo Dot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JjodUT"&gt;Currently, the fourth generation Echo available for $100 (usual price) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XKF5RM3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733330369536034962#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-4th-gen-smart-home-hub-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795705%3Fpreselect%3D80770246%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergebestechodeals02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xiNGuc"&gt;If you are looking for a pair of Amazon Echo devices, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589613981487950#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is selling an Amazon Echo two-pack for $180&lt;/a&gt;, which knocks $20 off its normal retail price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xR7jKq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508352"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XqDD6Q"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20950100/amazon-echo-studio-smart-speaker-alexa-3d-audio-test-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Studio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cZGT85"&gt;If you’re interested in an Alexa smart speaker with better audio quality and Dolby Atmos support, the Echo Studio is the Amazon product to check out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8dmbf"&gt;There are no deals currently available for the Echo Studio, but it is available for purchase at its usual price of $200 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Studio/dp/B07G9Y3ZMC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725325990660946512" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D411Fi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9536569"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="WiqTO4"&gt;If you are looking for an Echo device that functions more as a smart clock than an entertainment speaker, the Echo Show 5 is the one to consider. The Echo Show 5 includes a 5.5-inch display, making it easy to fit just about anywhere inside your home. Not only does the device include a built-in camera, but there’s also a physical shutter on the device, allowing you to block the camera’s view while keeping the always-on microphone active. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wsps6q"&gt;The Echo Show 5 usually costs $90 and we have seen it go down as low as $45. At the moment, the Echo Show 5 is on sale for $80 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HZLHPKP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589653641321861" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-5-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-77282772%3Fpreselect%3D76612867%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. If you buy the Echo Show 5 on Amazon, you can also receive a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086ZD7VZG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one-year subscription to Food Network Kitchen&lt;/a&gt; at no extra cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xJmJw1"&gt;Amazon also has a few bundles available; you can get an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089Q2RJH9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 and three months of Amazon Kids Plus&lt;/a&gt; for $81, an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086P992GD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 and a 1080p Wi-Fi security camera&lt;/a&gt; for $90, and an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SW188FP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 plus an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $100. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QVFAcO"&gt;Best Buy is currently selling a bundle with the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730445461281046110#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 and a 1080p Wi-Fi security camera&lt;/a&gt; for $85.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wwkfpq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513095"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GGyBnu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20983661/amazon-echo-show-8-review-alexa-smart-display-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="efoU4U"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Show 8 features an eight-inch display; it costs $40 more than the Echo Show 5. When stacked up against the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;, which is its closest competitor in terms of price and functionality, the Echo Show 8 is the better option for a few reasons: it has a slightly larger display, better speakers, and a camera, allowing you to use it as a video chatting device, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zoom calls&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcMAEq"&gt;We have seen the Show 8 go down as low as $65. The Echo Show 8 is currently on sale for $105 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PF1Y28C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589734209430134#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-8-hd-8in-smart-display%2F-%2FA-81795783%3Fpreselect%3D78656158%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. If you buy an Echo Show 8 on Amazon, you will also receive a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086ZF1T9X?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one-year subscription to Food Network Kitchen&lt;/a&gt; at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x04s5v"&gt;There are also a few bundles available for a few dollars more. For $115 you can get &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086ZND1QQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an Echo Show 8 and a 1080 Wi-Fi security camera&lt;/a&gt;; or an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YD5WDCB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 8 with an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $135. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YdQbrX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9573987"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="VVGDbb"&gt;Recently, Amazon released a third-generation Echo Show 10. This device features a 10.1-inch HD screen and unlike the Show 5 and 8, this model allows you to adjust the angle of the screen. It is also mounted on a motorized swiveling base that lets the screen follow you as you move. If you plan on doing a lot of video calling, this is the model to get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z9Ka9y"&gt;We have seen the latest Echo Show 10 gett discounted as low as $200, but no active deals are available right now. But, if you want to buy this product, you can get it for its usual  $250 price at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHZ41L8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733329406175831312#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-10-3rd-gen-hd-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-82381551&amp;amp;sharedid=vergedeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="FGmSVN"&gt;Samsung has announced two new Galaxy Book devices: the Galaxy Book Pro (a regular clamshell laptop) and the Galaxy Book Pro 360 (a touchscreen convertible). They start at $999.99 and $1,199.99, respectively. You can preorder them both today, and they’ll ship on May 14th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JMAvAJ"&gt;I got to spend some time with both devices ahead of the announcement. While they’re not the most exciting computers in the world, I think they could still be great buys — provided they deliver on the fundamentals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvEiZw"&gt;Samsung already sells several Galaxy Books, such as the ultra-light &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/17/21328470/samsung-galaxy-book-s-intel-hybrid-lakefield-announced-price-release-date"&gt;Galaxy Book S&lt;/a&gt; and the QLED display-equipped &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/29/20938145/samsung-galaxy-book-flex-ion-laptops-design-wireless-charging-qled-hands-on"&gt;Galaxy Book Flex and Galaxy Book Ion&lt;/a&gt;. The Galaxy Book Pro isn’t a direct sequel to any of these older devices — Samsung told me it’s not discontinuing any of them. Rather, the Pro attempts to combine a few of the features that have made previous Galaxy Books stand out into a single, high-level machine. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A user types on the Galaxy Book Pro 360, seen over the shoulder, on a picnic table." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xM0TXLtrgSdxhpHAADu7pHel-hA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22472182/bfarsace_4561_20210426_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don’t mind me, just vibing with the Galaxy Book Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QLZDBr"&gt;The most significant of these is the OLED display. Previous Galaxy Books have had QLED screens (which are LCD panels with Samsung’s quantum-dot technology), and Samsung’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21206151/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-review-android-laptop"&gt;Galaxy Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; was the first Chromebook with a 4K OLED screen. Now, the Galaxy Book Pro and Pro 360 are Samsung’s first OLED Windows PCs. Specifically, the Galaxy Book Pro has Samsung’s standard “AMOLED” display, while the Galaxy Book Pro 360 has what Samsung calls a “Super AMOLED” display. The difference is that the “Super AMOLED” has an &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1739046785424313126" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;integrated touch function&lt;/a&gt; — Samsung told me it’s also going to be brighter and more power-efficient than a regular OLED.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ux4umr"&gt;Samsung also claims these screens produce less blue light than standard LCD panels. An “Intelligent Color Engine” will adjust your color profile based on the task you’re doing — so colors might be more vivid while you’re watching a movie and more true-to-life while you’re editing photos, for example. I didn’t have enough time to test this effect in person, but I’m interested to see how well it works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVQhzB"&gt;Both displays are glossy, and they do kick back some glare. That said, I was able to browse the web and watch some videos on a bright outdoor deck, and they were very usable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A user uses the Galaxy Book Pro 360 in tent mode on an outdoor picnic table with the S-Pen.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s that trusty glare.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Book Pro 360 in tent mode, angled to the left, on an outdoor picnic table. The screen displays The Verge homepage. The S-Pen sits by its bottom right corner." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZcjENi5WuxaabxFR_sPjm_C9vYo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22472188/bfarsace_4561_20210426_0006_Edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Book Pro 360 comes with a new S Pen, but there’s no place to store it when you’re not using it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A hand holds the S-Pen in front of a colorful wall." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QgG6ESIQgIMxn5tJ_e7ijI9mmHQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22472185/bfarsace_4561_20210426_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new S Pen is larger and easier to hold than prior models.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6AxzN1"&gt;Another unique feature is the weight. Not only are these some of the lightest Galaxy Books, they’ll be some of the lightest laptops you can buy, period. The Pro 13 starts at just 1.92 pounds (0.87 kg). That’s close to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22239215/asus-expertbook-b9450-review-design-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Asus’ Expertbook B9450&lt;/a&gt;, which is the lightest clamshell I’ve ever tested. Very few laptops are lighter. The Pro 360 models are a bit heftier, starting at 2.29 pounds, but that’s still very portable as far as touchscreen convertibles go. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575308/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell’s XPS 13 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt; starts at 2.9 pounds, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7qEYCo"&gt;Finally, we’re seeing a new S Pen for the first time. “New” is maybe a strong word — the difference between this and the S Pen that comes with 2019’s Galaxy Book Flex is that this one is 2.5 times thicker. Samsung says this will provide “a more true-to-life writing experience.” To be fair, it does feel a heck of a lot like a real pen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DC5Q97"&gt;The new S Pen ships with the Galaxy Book Pro 360 — but make sure you can keep track of it, because there’s no garage in the chassis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Book Pro open, and the Samsung Galaxy Book Pro 360 in tent mode, side by side on a picnic table. Both screens display The Verge homepage.

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Book Pro half open, angled away from the camera slightly to the right on a picnic table." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hWL9I2Mkn5ZH36u-P96E7brfdcc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22472189/bfarsace_4561_20210426_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;These devices are built with 6000-series aluminum.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Book Pro 360 stacked on top of the Samsung Galaxy Book Pro, both closed on a picnic table." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C52y26vAwE35VTnlX6Fxi8mJ8_c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22472190/bfarsace_4561_20210426_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the Galaxy Book Pro 15 on the left, and the Galaxy Book Pro 360 13 on the right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y0Vws4"&gt;In addition to the thicker S Pen, the Galaxy Book Pro and Pro 360 have better processors than the Galaxy Book S. All four models come with Intel’s newest 11th Gen processors. I tried out both a Pro 360 13 and a Pro 15, and everything seemed snappy and smooth. We’ll need to test the devices fully, but the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21440302/intel-tiger-lake-hands-on-tests-core-i7-1185g7-processor-release" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Tiger Lake systems&lt;/a&gt; I’ve tested this year have generally performed just fine, especially on typical single-core workloads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LPKb69"&gt;Battery life, of course, is the one thing I couldn’t test at all. That’s going to be a big question because OLED screens tend to be battery hogs. The last OLED laptop from Samsung that I tested was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21206151/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-review-android-laptop" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;very disappointing in that area&lt;/a&gt;. These Galaxy Books have bigger batteries than the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook, so I’m hoping they won’t be quite as much of a disaster — but I’ve still got an eye out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="oq1uyy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung’s QLED-display Galaxy Book laptops are now available","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246560/samsung-qled-galaxy-book-flex-alpha-ion-available-now"},{"title":"Samsung’s Galaxy Book S is the first laptop with Intel’s new Hybrid processor","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/17/21328470/samsung-galaxy-book-s-intel-hybrid-lakefield-announced-price-release-date"},{"title":"Samsung launches Galaxy Book Flex 5G, the first 5G Intel Evo laptop","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21417175/samsung-galaxy-book-flex-5g-intel-evo-tiger-lake-project-athena-launch"},{"title":"Samsung Galaxy Book review: one step forward, one step back","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/25/15690552/samsung-galaxy-book-12-review-tablet-laptop"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="VSjQGu"&gt;Another thing I’m curious to test more completely is the audio. All four models here include Dolby Atmos speakers, with audio engineered by AKG. The videos I watched sounded fine, but our test area was a bit too loud to get a complete impression. Neither Galaxy Book Pro model comes with a discrete GPU, so this device isn’t targeting creative professionals. Rather, a likely use case for this OLED screen is an incredible movie-watching experience. That’ll be hampered significantly if the audio stinks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e1cDU4"&gt;Diving into the nitty-gritty specs: All four of these models come with either a Core i5 or a Core i7. These all include Intel’s Iris Xe integrated graphics — there’s no discrete GPU option available. The Galaxy Book Pro 13 comes with 8GB of RAM and up to 512GB of storage, while the Book Pro 15 goes up to 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. On the sides, you get Thunderbolt 4, one USB Type-C, one USB-A 3.2, one audio jack, and one microSD; the 15 adds an HDMI port as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wo2xaa"&gt;The Galaxy Book Pro 360 is slightly more “pro” than the clamshell model. Both convertibles come with either 8GB or 16GB of RAM, and the 13 goes up to 512GB of storage while the 15 can get all the way up to 1TB. The Pro 360 13 also has optional 5G in case you’re looking for something you can really use on the go. Ports are the same as those on the 13-inch clamshell, except that there’s a second USB-C in place of the USB-A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WQUdGZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Galaxy Book Pro 360 is slightly more “pro” than the clamshell model&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="75iROr"&gt;In terms of colors, the Galaxy Book Pro comes in mystic blue or mystic silver, while the Pro 360 comes in mystic navy or mystic bronze. My favorite option is definitely the mystic navy 360 — it’s very blue, and it’s the one to get if you want to stand out in the boardroom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oHyepV"&gt;You can preorder both the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1739046848952596186" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Book Pro&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1739046866818705247" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Book Pro 360&lt;/a&gt; today, and they’ll be shipping May 14th. The clamshells start at $999.99 (for the 13) and $1,099.99 (for the 15), while the convertibles start at $1,199.99 (for the 13) and $1,299.99 (for the 15). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2lz746"&gt;Retailers are offering a couple different deals. If you preorder either device before May 13th, you’re eligible for a $150 Amazon credit, a $150 Best Buy gift certificate, and either a $150 eCertificate or free Galaxy Buds Pro through Samsung. If you buy the Galaxy Book Pro between May 14th and May 30th, you’re also eligible for $100 in credit from all three retailers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mFRJt9"&gt;Overall, these are already impressive machines with a reasonable price tag. They’re unbelievably light, they’re well-built, and they have great screens — and this is from a company that’s great at making unbelievably light, well-built electronics with great screens. What I’m not sure about yet is the other fundamentals: How quickly will they charge? How long will they last? How good will they sound? How will I look on a Zoom call? After all, it’s not enough for a $1,000 laptop to have one or two strengths — it needs to be adequate everywhere else, too. And I really hope these groundbreaking elements are bonuses, not features you need to compromise everywhere else to get.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Pixar created Luca’s adorable, transforming sea monsters</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Luca" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UbGBnF7JXHD1xMcKd7X6tzLJCfY=/189x0:1809x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69198633/05_LucaProgressionTransformationImage_v173_17a.pub16.1493_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Pixar Animation Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Dohzlv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Luca&lt;/em&gt;, the next feature film from Pixar, is a coming-of-age story about a pair of unassuming young boys who carry a big secret, as they’re actually sea monsters. Luca and Alberto appear as human on land, where they explore a quaint Italian seaside village. Normally, though, they’re iguana-like sea creatures covered in scales. For the team at Pixar, one of the key questions was figuring out what exactly causes that transformation. And instead of relying on a magical or emotional catalyst, they chose something much more fundamental: water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eNxP8N"&gt;That was just the start. Sorting out the transformation also meant ensuring both versions of the characters were linked in some way, as well as ensuring that the process had some kind of emotional weight. With all of these considerations in mind, water turned out to be a perfect fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iZNXoy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s important that Luca is making choices.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bt5zcK"&gt;“Because the sea monsters are underwater, and the humans are on land, there has to be some component that’s about the water,” Beth Albright, a character supervisor on &lt;em&gt;Luca&lt;/em&gt;, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “So then it just became: ‘Is it literally the water? Or is there something else magical going on?’ And for our story, I think it’s important that Luca is making choices. He’s choosing to be up on land, he’s choosing to go back in the water. And those things are transforming him. Those choices that he’s making are transforming who he is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CrVk02"&gt;That focus on natural elements is a major element of &lt;em&gt;Luca&lt;/em&gt;. The film features a unique art style that almost looks like stop-motion, and helps separate it from other CG animated art. According to character supervisor Sajan Skaria, the goal was to get away from colder and more technical elements in the art and animation. “It was important for us to give our modelers and our artists complete freedom to hit the appeal and the charm,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Luca" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1V9mr0lUOknMCJ_aLc-UqGBYqgI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22473650/04_LucaProgressionTransformationImage_LUCA__progression_full_copy.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Pixar Animation Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Main character Luca transforming from sea monster to human.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1vRsWn"&gt;Part of that meant pulling inspiration from nature. The underwater movements of the sea monsters was based in part on the way iguanas swim, for instance, while the team looked at chameleons for clues on how to tackle the transformation from human to monster. “We looked at a lot of references just to see what our options were,” says Skaria. “Especially with nature, it’s such a great place to go looking for things because it’s organic. We wanted to get away from the mechanical as much as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W0H_VWfKxZJcMvqzBipxhWm-6gU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22475102/02_LucaProgressionTransformationImage_024d_9781797207254_copy.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Pixar Animation Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1EjTuL"&gt;One of the biggest challenges was ensuring the two versions of each character still felt like the same person, despite essentially being entirely different species. There are some big differences: a sea monster doesn’t have a nose, for example, and they only have four fingers. That said, there are some facial landmarks that remain consistent. In the case of Luca, his big eyes were designed to be familiar no matter whether he was human or sea creature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EluqBt"&gt;To keep some similarity, the models for both versions of each character were handled by the same 3D modeler. But it was also important that they weren’t just one-to-one recreations of each other. “We didn’t have to worry about ‘this point needs to match this point,’” explains Skaria. “That would’ve been more mechanical and more logical. But we were going more for feeling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="u3qPTn"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mYfJxlgR2jw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g4ymAL"&gt;That process of change was particularly important, not just from a visual standpoint, but also in terms of character development. I was able to watch the first 30 minutes or so of the film, and watching Luca and Alberto shift from human to sea monster, or vice versa, was pivotal in many of the scenes. Skaria says that this was intentional. “We could’ve hidden this, we could’ve done it off-screen,” he explains. “But we really wanted to show it in slow motion, on camera, because it’s such a core of the movie. It’s the thematic center. We didn’t want to hide it at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IcgLd6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We didn’t want to hide it at all.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zXt7yM"&gt;The challenges of creating &lt;em&gt;Luca&lt;/em&gt; and its shape-shifting cast were only compounded by the pandemic, as the production team was forced to work from home instead of the studio. (The pandemic is also the reason the film will stream on &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1042709/9358?subId1=VergeLucaPixar042821&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; when it debuts on June 18th.) As a supervisor, Albright says that one of her main jobs was to make sure everyone had enough space to breathe and take care of themselves while working on the movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NlzL3N"&gt;“We had to find a way to give everyone context, but also to give everyone space,” she says. “We couldn’t rely on ‘well everyone’s going to come to a meeting at this time, and then do this,’ because everyone has so many things going on right now. It was really important to Sajan and I that we gave everyone some space to do their work when they can do their work, and take care of their family and their lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJEgms"&gt;Skaria adds, “One of the things we realized quickly is that even though we’re physically apart, mentally and emotionally everyone was in a shared experience. I think that brought a lot of meaning to the film because suddenly we were getting insights into people’s lives, and that just really brought everyone closer, and the team bonded much better.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="LLcFd2"&gt;If you’ve been waiting on a good deal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7"&gt;for the latest Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;, today might be delivering that for you — if you really wanted the all-red version. The 40mm-sized Apple Watch Series 6 with a red sport band and red aluminum case costs $299 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5RBMRN?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-40mm-PRODUCT-RED-Aluminum-Case-with-PRODUCT-RED-Sport-Band-Regular%2F478251261&amp;amp;subid1=TheVergeDeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1739048946150992341#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, down from its original $399 price. At $299, it’s just a $20 jump from the $279 Apple Watch SE to get a better smartwatch with slightly faster specs. The big differences in the Series 6 include its always-on display, its ability to take blood oxygen readings, and it has the U1 ultra wideband chip.&lt;/p&gt;

If you’re a fan of retro games and already subscribe to Nintendo Switch Online (a subscription is mandatory to even buy these), this could be worth picking up. These recharge by sliding onto the sides of your Switch, just like Joy-Con. As for the Switch Lite, they’ll work wirelessly, but you’ll need to find another way to charge them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s new ‘Play Something’ shuffle feature is here to solve your movie night indecision</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CSdThDUexJrZdoRWn3mHHY-ITgI=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69198544/US_NETFLIX_TV_Comp_00003.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c60Dqd"&gt;Netflix is officially rolling out its new “Play Something” feature today to all its users, adding a button across the streaming service’s UI to automatically suggest new shows and movies that you’ve never watched before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MoLYTA"&gt;The Play Something button will appear in several places on Netflix’s app, including underneath your profile when you log in, the left-side navigation bar, and in the tenth row of Netflix’s homepage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="40sARm"&gt;The company has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22240550/netflix-shuffle-play-movies-shows-viewing-history"&gt;testing the feature for months&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/18/21374543/netflix-shuffle-play-test-random-tv-movies"&gt;under a variety of names&lt;/a&gt; (including “Shuffle Play”), but today marks its official worldwide debut for all Netflix users. To start, the company is rolling out the Play Something button on TV-based versions of the Netflix app, but it has plans to start testing it on Android devices, too. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LnIBmphCdWpmm10Xdq-zixdMDcA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22475253/US_NETFLIX_TV_Comp_00004.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CSuifY"&gt;Netflix is stressing that the Play Something button isn’t just a “random” button that throws you to the metaphorical wolves of the streaming service’s nearly endless well of content. Rather, the feature uses your existing profile and taste in shows and movies to surface similar titles based on what kinds of things you already watch. The button will show a variety of algorithmically curated content, including entirely new shows and movies, series or films you’ve already started, or something on your watchlist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FWSGZE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lDh7yO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CES will return to Las Vegas as an in-person event in 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="CES-2016-stock-verge-11" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/osKvpWnTtdE4faur1z1ksYssQno=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69198458/CES-2016-stock-verge-11.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9KQEWb"&gt;The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is officially returning to an in-person format in Las Vegas in 2022, the Consumer Technology Association (CTA) announced today, marking the return of the largest tech conference in the world next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IOPS2R"&gt;“We’re thrilled to return to Las Vegas – home to CES for more than 40 years – and look forward to seeing many new and returning faces,” said Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of the CTA, in an announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j2oAGe"&gt;For what it’s worth, the CTA had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21344977/ces-2021-online-cta-las-vegas-conference-coronavirus-pandemic-covid-19"&gt;always intended to return to an in-person CES in 2022&lt;/a&gt;. The group had already announced plans to do so in July 2020, when it announced that CES 2021 would be shifting to an all-digital format due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Other major tech conferences, like IFA 2021 in the fall, are also returning to in-person events this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7bbda2"&gt;CES 2022 will be held from January 5th through the 8th, with the usual media days preceding the conference itself on January 3rd and 4th. According to the announcement, the upcoming conference will be a hybrid of sorts, with events set to take place both physically and digitally. Confirmed attendees will include major tech companies like Amazon, AMD, AT&amp;amp;T, Dell, Google, Hyundai, IBM, Intel, Lenovo, LG, Panasonic, Qualcomm, Samsung, and Sony. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0HHLlP"&gt;The CTA says that CES 2022 will be following the CDC’s coronavirus safety guidelines, along with state and local guidelines for Nevada and the city of Las Vegas to ensure a safe event for attendees.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is adding COVID-19-related information to searches for travel</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/elWecdlROtbuM826mojKXtoAuQw=/165x0:1635x980/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69198250/Explore_Map.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gQD7M8"&gt;Google has unveiled new tools to help people planning their first post-vaccination vacations, as COVID-19 restrictions and requirements still vary widely among domestic and international travel destinations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OjReuL"&gt;A Google search for flights, hotels, or things to do will now also bring up results for any COVID-19-related travel advisories or restrictions at the searcher’s destination. Google has added additional travel restriction details, including whether quarantine is required or if you have to show proof of immunization or a negative COVID-19 test. Users can choose to receive updates about when restrictions are lifted or added for a given destination. The updates are country-specific and state-specific within the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yd7rQq"&gt;Under the “explore” &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/travel/"&gt;tab on Google’s travel page&lt;/a&gt;, people can browse not just for flights but filter destinations by interests, like beaches or skiing. When you choose a destination, you’ll get the updated information on any travel advisories or restrictions as well. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VOews-4-4OYcM82ow8tjXSa7n94=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22471671/COVID_19_Advisory_on_Search.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="r2pChl"&gt;After pandemic lockdowns and travel restrictions kept many people at home much of last year, Google isn’t the only company preparing for the return of travel. Expedia Group — which includes online travel agent (OTA) websites Expedia, Vrbo, Travelocity, Hotels.com, and others — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373546/expedia-travel-restriction-tool-destination"&gt;created its Travel Advisor tool&lt;/a&gt; to help customers plan trips and follow any COVID-19 restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iW82TU"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) still recommends Americans delay travel until they’ve been fully vaccinated, after which they can travel safely within the US. The agency &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/map-and-travel-notices.html"&gt;has a map&lt;/a&gt; showing where travel may be especially risky due to the coronavirus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ab1ejf"&gt;And while Americans are still barred from traveling to many international destinations, a European Union official &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/25/world/europe/american-travel-to-europe.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;over the weekend that Americans fully vaccinated against the coronavirus should be able to visit the EU this summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UmzHpE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ICtYpf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
