    <title>Microsoft is changing the way it buys renewable energy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hCwEiw"&gt;With a new strategy for how it purchases renewable energy, Microsoft hopes to push electricity grids to get clean. The tech giant is now focused on making a local impact in the places where it operates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LYNkCE"&gt;Since 2012, the company has purchased enough renewable energy to match how much juice it uses to power its operations globally. But Microsoft isn’t actually running on renewables 100 percent of the time. All of those&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;clean energy purchases don’t necessarily connect&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to the same electricity grids that the company is plugged into. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fIYNw7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Clean energy purchases don’t necessarily connect&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to the same electricity grids that the company is plugged into&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bkXG8G"&gt;That could change if Microsoft is successful in its new goal. By 2030, it wants to make sure that its clean energy purchases are actually feeding into the local grids where it operates. The move is part of a broader push within tech and environmental advocacy to ensure that big energy guzzlers help phase out dirty fossil fuels wherever they work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZU9jaW"&gt;“[In 2012], we were like a kid building with those big chunky wooden blocks. The tools and the resources we had were somewhat rudimentary,” says Brian Janous, general manager of energy at Microsoft. But those building blocks are evolving, Janous says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VhjL9D"&gt;The company has pledged to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254483/microsoft-climate-change-pledge-update-carbon-dioxide-removal"&gt;carbon negative by 2030&lt;/a&gt;, meaning it plans to capture and store more carbon dioxide than it emits. The carbon removal technology necessary to achieve that goal doesn’t exist at scale yet, but Microsoft is funneling money toward its development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dBbVCp"&gt;Using less electricity in the first place will be a key part to achieving Microsoft’s climate aims. As part of that effort, the company has tried submerging its servers in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436746/microsoft-project-natick-data-center-server-underwater-cooling-reliability"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/6/22369609/microsoft-server-cooling-liquid-immersion-cloud-racks-data-centers"&gt;liquid baths&lt;/a&gt; to make them more energy-efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fxY65c"&gt;When it comes to using renewable energy, Microsoft and other companies with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254483/microsoft-climate-change-pledge-update-carbon-dioxide-removal"&gt;goals to tackle climate change&lt;/a&gt; were limited to how much renewable energy electricity grids could provide them. In the US, renewable energy still only makes up about 20 percent of the electricity mix. So companies like Microsoft, Apple, and Facebook often rely on Renewable Energy Credits to show that they’re funneling money to renewable projects elsewhere, which help offset some of their greenhouse gas emissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="b2gVVx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Every hour of every day, we need zero carbon resources being generated.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6EwSIc"&gt;Moving forward, that won’t be enough for Microsoft to fulfill its new climate target. To get enough locally generated renewable energy, the company is starting to change its power purchase agreements to demand more of its energy suppliers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XKlHzQ"&gt;“What we’re moving towards is a model where we’re really working with our providers to say, ‘Look, we have this goal and we’re putting out this goal publicly.’ Every hour of every day, we need zero carbon resources being generated,” Janous tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DY4C6o"&gt;Microsoft is now one of the largest corporate buyers of renewable energy in the world, but it isn’t alone in its new emphasis on local impact. Adobe, Google, Hewlett Packard, and several environmental groups sent a &lt;a href="https://www.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Federal-Higher-Impact-Carbon-Free-Electricity-Procurement-Memo.pdf?utm_source=newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosgenerate&amp;amp;stream=top"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; to the Biden administration in March advocating for policies that support what they call “higher-impact electricity procurement.” That’s a similar model of sourcing renewable energy from nearby sources on a 24/7 basis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YKafUp"&gt;Google set a &lt;a href="https://sustainability.google/progress/energy/"&gt;goal&lt;/a&gt; last year of running on clean electricity around the clock by 2030. On an even broader scale,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;President Biden has set a goal of getting US electricity grids to run on 100 percent clean energy by 2035.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The new Razer Blade 17 packs more GPU power into the same slim chassis</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/98LZKPa-0OJBntUZxzS43-CYDB8=/0x0:1504x1003/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69580790/Razer_Blade__D17_7___2021__Lifestyle_Shoot_4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f2wW2p"&gt;Razer’s largest laptop is getting big upgrades. The new mid-2021 refresh of the Blade 17 will add newer CPUs, higher-powered GPUs, and an updated webcam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l8gU4b"&gt;The new Blade 17, which drops the “Pro” designation of earlier models, catches the larger laptop up to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22428604/razer-blade-15-gaming-laptop-mid-2021-intel-h-series-nvidia-rtx-3080-thin-15-inch-specs"&gt;Blade 15 Advanced&lt;/a&gt; released earlier this year. It now comes equipped with the same &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22423545/intel-tiger-lake-h-mobile-processors-11th-gen-laptops"&gt;Intel 11th Gen H-Series processors&lt;/a&gt;, with a choice of the Core i7 11800H (2.3GHz base clock, 4.6GHz boost clock), or the top-tier Core i9 11900H (2.5GHz base, 4.9GHz boost), which isn’t available on Razer’s smaller models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vxaTkt"&gt;The laptop also features GPUs from Nvidia’s latest RTX lineup, including the 3060, 3070, and the 3080, with up to 16GB of video memory. Crucially, Razer has increased the Blade 17’s GPUs’ total graphics power to 130 watts, up from the &lt;a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Blade-15-Advanced-RTX-3080-TGP-95-W-beats-RTX-2080-Super-Max-Q-TGP-95-W.537439.0.html"&gt;95 watts&lt;/a&gt; of the Blade 15 Advanced. That additional power means more heat generated, which might be mitigated in part by the Blade 17’s larger chassis. But we can’t say for sure whether heat will be an issue until a full test of the laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jkeZPz"&gt;Speaking of the laptop’s size, it stays the same with dimensions of 0.78 inches (19.99mm) x 15.5 inches (395mm) x 10.24 inches (260mm) and weighs 6.06 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y1bvSwstEIT8nnpnc_SPQJgJtBE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22714938/Blade_17__2021__UHD_Render__3_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Blade 17.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="E1C2T4"&gt;Razer has built the Blade 17’s RAM and storage drives to be user-upgradeable. The laptop ships with a 1TB PCIe NVME drive, with an extra M.2 slot for expanded storage, and up to 32GB of RAM. The motherboard supports up to 32GB of RAM and 2TB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o8fMU9"&gt;The Blade 17’s display options range from a 1440p display with a 165Hz refresh rate to a 1080p resolution with a quicker 360Hz refresh. One variant of the Blade 17 also packs a 4K touch display, though it only has a refresh rate of 120Hz. The sweet spot for most people is probably the 1440p model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xR6f9W"&gt;Some of the new features that round out the Blade 17 are the addition of anti-fingerprint coating previously added to the Blade 15 Advanced as well as an upgraded 1080p webcam with Windows Hello. The speaker system has also been upgraded, now with two speakers on each side of the laptop instead of just one.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3w87zyzX0674pgfzO9t7JeuEH7E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22714944/Razer_Blade__D17_7___2021__Lifestyle_Shoot_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="M9D05y"&gt;The Blade 17 will charge through USB-C at 100W and will ship with Razer’s standard 230W charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7f3ln0"&gt;There are also upgrades to the Blade 15 Base model as well, including the option of an i7-11800H processor and two PCIe 4.0 SSD slots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wWkTC7"&gt;You can preorder the Blade 17 and Blade 15 starting today, and Razer expects the laptops to ship in July–August.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft puts PCs in the cloud with Windows 365</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1MJxL7uNhcfQiiLoAbhIW6H0hEo=/30x0:930x600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69580792/windows365.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4xzS5c"&gt;Microsoft is putting Windows in the cloud. Windows 365 is a new service that will let businesses access Cloud PCs from anywhere, streaming a version of Windows 10 or Windows 11 in a web browser. While virtualization and remote access to PCs has existed for more than a decade, Microsoft is betting on Windows 365 to offer Cloud PCs to businesses just as they shift toward a mix of office and remote work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A1naOU"&gt;Windows 365 will work on any modern web browser or through Microsoft’s Remote Desktop app, allowing users to access their Cloud PC from a variety of devices. “Windows 365 provides an instant-on boot experience,” according to Wangui McKelvey, a general manager for Microsoft 365. This instant access lets workers stream their Windows session with all of their same apps, tools, data, and settings across Macs, iPads, Linux machines, and Android devices. “You can pick up right where you left off, because the state of your Cloud PC remains the same, even when you switch devices,” explains McKelvey.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D98Md45TfMYubBLAPoFCerUGy-Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22716693/windows365web.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 365 streams Windows to a web browser.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jceXwr"&gt;Windows 365 will only be available for businesses when it launches on August 2nd, with a per-user monthly subscription cost. Microsoft is not detailing exact pricing details until the service launches next month, but Windows 365 is designed for one-person businesses all the way up to enterprises with thousands of employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SYdHAL"&gt;There will be two editions of Windows 365: Business and Enterprise. Both are powered by Azure Virtual Desktop, and individual Cloud PCs can be configured with a single CPU, 2GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage at the low-end, all the way up to eight CPUs, 32GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage. Microsoft is offering 12 different configurations for both Windows 365 Business and Enterprise, and businesses will be able to scale processing power so there will be lots of options to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IMkrCI"&gt;Technically, Microsoft offering Windows in the cloud isn’t much different to the myriad of choices that businesses could already opt for with virtualization right now. Microsoft has already offered similar technology with Azure Virtual Desktop, and Citrix has been offering cloud-hosted desktop PCs for years. Where Microsoft is trying to differentiate is in both ease of use and management. “Windows 365 is really going to make a huge difference for organizations that wanted to try virtualization for various reasons but could not — maybe it was too costly, too complex or they didn’t have the expertise in house to do it,” says McKelvey.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xcFKhsU9JB2OYIXt1AggC8Q1quQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22716703/windows365management.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Businesses can create Cloud PCs within minutes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ry7L6v"&gt;Businesses will be able to create Cloud PCs within minutes and assign them to employees, avoiding the need for dedicated physical hardware. That could be appealing for many businesses hiring remote workers or even temporary contract staff that need to securely access a corporate network. As your entire Windows PC is in the cloud, employees don’t need to navigate VPNs or worry about security on personal devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aVdIBQ"&gt;While Windows 365 seems perfectly timed for businesses looking to tackle the complexities of remote work, Microsoft has been working on the service for years. The operating systems group at Microsoft had been working on a project codenamed “Arcadia,” a service to stream video games from the cloud. Arcadia dates all the way back to Microsoft demonstrating &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/26/4774418/microsoft-demonstrates-halo-4-streaming-from-the-cloud-to-windows-and"&gt;Halo running on a Windows Phone in 2013&lt;/a&gt;. This early virtualization work eventually led to Windows 365 and a focus on making it consumer-friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kZhYlv"&gt;“When we built this team, we brought in a couple of leaders who had experience with virtualization, but for the most part we brought in people who had experience with Windows and experience with consumer experiences because that was the bar we wanted to set,” says Scott Manchester, director of program management for Windows 365.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zTONjxrY9lwV6QOCTXbe8ts1amQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22716695/windows365ui.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 365 is designed to be easy to use for businesses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="I2lboO"&gt;The pandemic accelerated work on Windows 365, and Microsoft’s broader focus on hybrid work. Microsoft has been steadily improving Microsoft Teams over the past year and laying out its vision for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447048/microsoft-teams-future-meetings-features"&gt;future of meetings&lt;/a&gt;, remote work, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K6idKl"&gt;While Windows 365 is only for businesses right now, it’s easy to imagine a future where Microsoft could offer more powerful PC computing to consumers directly in a browser. A startup called Mighty is offering a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22408818/mighty-browser-chrome-cloud-streaming-web"&gt;$30-a-month web browser that lives in the cloud&lt;/a&gt;, designed to offer a better web experience on older laptops and PCs. Windows 365 might just be the first significant step toward a future where you don’t need a dedicated Windows PC to use Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook says FTC chair shouldn’t help decide the future of its antitrust case</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Senate Commerce Committee Considers Nominees For NASA Administrator And Federal Trade Commissioner" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z635KtxZuFfo9VbGWOF2PeuFzCA=/0x0:5324x3549/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69580701/1232438844.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Saul Loeb-Pool/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PjAfPL"&gt;Facebook has asked recently confirmed Federal Trade Commission chair Lina Khan to recuse herself from the agency’s antitrust fight against Facebook, claiming her previous criticism of the company disqualifies her from fairly judging its conduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GqS4Fv"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-seeks-recusal-of-ftc-chairwoman-in-antitrust-case-11626267605?mod=djemalertNEWS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; first reported&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Facebook-Inc.s-Petition-to-Recuse-Chair-Khan.pdf"&gt;Facebook’s petition&lt;/a&gt;, which was filed with the FTC today. In the petition, Facebook attorneys write that “Chair Khan has consistently and very publicly concluded that Facebook is guilty of violating the antitrust laws. She has built her career, in large part, by singling out Facebook as a professed antitrust violator.” Facebook cites Khan’s previous anti-monopoly work at the nonprofit Open Markets Institute, her contribution to a congressional antitrust investigation, and her popular and academic writings about tech industry monopolies, as well as her tweets, which include praise for FTC antitrust enforcement against Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="coly0P"&gt;The petition claims that Khan has “prejudged Facebook’s alleged antitrust liability” by supporting the FTC’s earlier enforcement actions and by conducting academic and congressional investigations where she concluded Facebook had monopoly power. Khan’s opinions have been unusually high-profile, but it is not unusual for government officials to have worked in advocacy positions or expressed opinions on their subjects of expertise, and it’s rare for a confirmed appointee to be disqualified on that basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4z6QlZ"&gt;Facebook is following a playbook set by Amazon, which also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557456/amazon-lina-khan-recusal-petition-federal-trade-commission-antitrust"&gt;asked Khan to recuse herself&lt;/a&gt; from potential Amazon proceedings. (“Facebook agrees with Amazon’s arguments concerning the circumstances where a commissioner’s prior statements require recusal and incorporates those legal arguments,” the petition notes.) But Facebook facing an even more immediate risk: last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554476/ftc-facebook-instagram-antitrust-case-whatsapp-federal-court"&gt;a judge threw out&lt;/a&gt; a federal antitrust lawsuit against Facebook and gave the FTC until July 29th to amend and refile it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oCwJBB"&gt;Khan &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22527709/lina-khan-ftc-commissioner-competition-facebook-amazon-google-apple"&gt;joined the FTC shortly&lt;/a&gt; before the Facebook case was dismissed, and, as chair, she could play a pivotal role in deciding its future. Facebook wants Khan to refrain from “participating in any decisions concerning whether and how to continue the FTC’s antitrust case against the company.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g5HnCH"&gt;Recusal petitions against FTC commissioners are not commonly granted, and Khan was confirmed largely because of bipartisan support for her sharp and public criticism of tech companies. She has not indicated plans to recuse herself from cases involving Amazon — and it seems unlikely that she’ll do so with Facebook either.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The urban heat island effect can be deadly&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="kFe2DF"&gt;Cities around the world are running a fever. City-dwellers suffer through more sweltering temperatures in the summertime than people who live in greener areas nearby. It’s a dangerous consequence of living in what scientists call an “urban heat island.” What’s worse is that the urban heat island effect makes some neighborhoods within a city, usually those with more low-income residents and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22452777/hot-summer-weather-race-urban-heat-island-us-cities"&gt;people of color&lt;/a&gt;, even hotter than others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q5dp5X"&gt;The problem is that cities were built in a way that traps heat. Satellites can see this phenomenon from space. Scientists working with NASA have used satellite data to &lt;a href="https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/?v=-79.55102734375,37.83409079743424,-68.34497265625,43.78350920256575&amp;amp;l=MODIS_Terra_Land_Surface_Temp_Day,Reference_Labels_15m(hidden),Reference_Features_15m(hidden),Coastlines_15m,VIIRS_NOAA20_CorrectedReflectance_TrueColor(hidden),VIIRS_SNPP_CorrectedReflectance_TrueColor(hidden),MODIS_Aqua_CorrectedReflectance_TrueColor(hidden)&amp;amp;lg=true&amp;amp;s=-73.948,40.8088&amp;amp;t=2021-06-17-T22%3A37%3A24Z"&gt;map changes in surface temperatures&lt;/a&gt; from suburbs to cities, and from affluent neighborhoods to communities that have received less investment over time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="unJDlj"&gt;Taking cities’ temperatures and finding ways to cool them down is a matter of life and death. Extreme heat has killed &lt;a href="https://www.weather.gov/hazstat/"&gt;more people on average each year&lt;/a&gt; in the US than any other weather-related event over the past 30 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9A79Lm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; hit the streets of New York City with thermal cameras to see if we could find our own evidence of the urban heat island effect. We were pretty shocked to see just how bad it was in the Big Apple. To see for yourself, check out our video above. You can also see our data in the map below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="R4DpKZ"&gt;&lt;div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/6535514"&gt;&lt;script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yIuwtC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The map above shows which neighborhoods in New York City are considered the most “&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/HeatHub/hvi.html#jumpto"&gt;&lt;em&gt;heat-vulnerable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.” In heat-vulnerable East Harlem, The Verge documented average land surface temperatures reaching as high as 110 degrees Fahrenheit. That was more than 20 degrees hotter than readings we took in the affluent Upper East Side. The Verge took these readings with a thermal camera on June 24, 2021, when air temperatures at the nearest NOAA weather station in Central Park only reached a high of 77 degrees.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TVA TemPad review: who needs TikTok when you can control time and space?</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Loki’s signature gadget, reviewed&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="Jz0XaO"&gt;As time goes on, mobile devices have grown ever more powerful in their function: what were once simple communication devices or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/11/21/18105423/ipod-click-wheel-button-music-control-hardware-design"&gt;multimedia players&lt;/a&gt; have turned into tiny &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;pocket-sized supercomputers&lt;/a&gt; that are jam-packed with features. And nothing exemplifies this trend more than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22574400/loki-retro-hardware-tempad-kasra-farahani-interview-marvel-disney-plus"&gt;TVA TemPad&lt;/a&gt;, which packs in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523186/loki-review-episode-1-2-disney-plus"&gt;temporal tracking and manipulation abilities&lt;/a&gt; that give the most ordinary of owners powers that surpass &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18513309/avengers-endgame-spoiler-free-review-marvel-cinematic-universe-iron-man-thor-captain-america-phase-4"&gt;even the mightiest of heroes&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CHROTY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoilers for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loki&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;’s first season ahead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="g2U87g"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How Loki built a different reality with retro hardware","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22574400/loki-retro-hardware-tempad-kasra-farahani-interview-marvel-disney-plus"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="gzkGC9"&gt;Unlike most modern devices, the TemPad aims for an almost retro-futuristic design. Despite featuring dual displays on both the exterior and interior of the device, the TemPad itself is clad in a warm wood and brass finish that’s reminiscent of a simpler time. Broadly speaking, the TemPad harkens back to a pre-iPhone era: the external touchscreen, matched with an internal display and physical keys, brings to mind older devices like 2007’s LG Voyager and a time before blank, featureless touchscreen slates dominated the market. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C0EaK3YQWXR5tgKLyFZLyeaLXC8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22716031/Screen_Shot_2021_07_13_at_4.25.53_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qEdagF"&gt;Instead of a full QWERTY keyboard, though, the TemPad only offers a doubled numpad, along with an oddly shaped D-pad and a dedicated Miss Minutes button. But the TemPad is primarily controlled through the spherical black control surface, which works as a tappable button with additional gestures. A cutout in the top display also cleverly allows it to be used when the device is closed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="npnaIm"&gt;The TemPad puts that external display to good use, both for showing its standard suite of apps (like those used to track branching nexus events and the shattering of time and space) as well as a Galaxy Note-esque memo feature that allows for quick doodling on the external touchscreen. Notably, the TemPad also offers the ability to automatically animate and then project those drawings as 3D holograms, a decidedly unique feature compared to most other mobile hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SAKhgnYQfTYVjp_VlXEyd4NVqFw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22716032/Screen_Shot_2021_07_13_at_4.01.07_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F8MSEGBX-UpwlvMgcgGx9N5inXQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22716034/Screen_Shot_2021_07_13_at_4.01.46_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WkclY0"&gt;The TemPad hardware also offers you a wide variety of storage options: the device can be simply pocketed, of course, but the TVA also offers both a belt-mounted and a clever wrist-mounted case option for keeping your pad close at all times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Q6ujm"&gt;The flagship feature on the TemPad is its ability to create Timedoors, glowing orange doors that let you traverse the boundless realm of space and time, hopping between timelines and alternate realities more or less at will. It’s an incredibly useful feature, one that helps make up for the TemPad’s limited application support, lack of an App Store, and poor hardware design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;
&lt;aside id="AHS1eM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Battery life on the TemPad leaves much to be desired&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MGYeUDELsCfkwQRhdDRasiN5KzY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22716038/Screen_Shot_2021_07_13_at_4.14.40_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EPexDi"&gt;Battery life on the TemPad also leaves much to be desired. Timedoors, in particular, use up a lot of power, leaving one at risk of getting stranded in all manner of unfortunate locations. Exacerbating this is the fact that recharging a pad is also extremely difficult — requiring something akin to “the power source to a civilization’s only hope” to power it back up again, a markedly more difficult task than finding a USB-C brick with high enough wattage to support fast-charging on most devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WKbJeB"&gt;Like many mobile devices, the TemPad features a smart digital assistant, Miss Minutes, which works across a variety of TVA technologies and devices. Unlike Siri or Bixby, though, Miss Minutes is a semi-sentient artificial intelligence, capable of responding intelligently to queries. Miss Minutes is used to help compensate for some of the TemPad’s limitations, offering a way to look up older records without resorting to tedious text inputs. Tasks occasionally take longer than usual, however, as the assistant has been known to have her own plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1F6rFd"&gt;Perhaps the biggest flaw in the TemPad is its decidedly low-resolution display technology. While most phones and laptops opt for colorful LCDs or vibrant OLED panels, the TemPad features a rather uninspired two-tone orange-on-black display. Text is chunky, images are rendered at a frustratingly low resolution, and maps for tracking variants are vague 2D outlines. Video playback, while possible, leaves much to be desired, requiring that you zoom in on portions of a video just to be able to discern identifiable features in some cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G7XkDdlhX3QOtHqtcGkeIgQEGLY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22716039/Screen_Shot_2021_07_13_at_4.08.32_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CrZjc91NTuIc8oZw64Hm9hawIrM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22716037/Screen_Shot_2021_07_13_at_4.05.26_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QUw3ts"&gt;The TemPad is also unfortunately fragile for a mobile device, with at least one device shattering into a spark- and smoke-spewing pile after a rough fall. Given the active intended audience for the TemPad, a little more rugged durability would be nice to see on future models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QodA15"&gt;Continuing its throwback design, the TemPad’s UI resembles that of an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_1000"&gt;early Palm OS&lt;/a&gt; (a similarity that’s only exacerbated by the low-resolution, two-tone display). The home screen only displays four apps at once; the default offerings include the flagship Timedoor application, Settings, Directory, and the Miss Minutes assistant. The UI is occasionally difficult to manage, though, making it easy for you to accidentally open Timedoors to undesired locations when not taking the proper care to select a destination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nzexfl"&gt;Another misstep with the TemPad is the heavy reliance on enterprise-level software. While the ability to track timeline variants and analyze the impact of branching nexus events is no doubt useful to TVA agents and judges, the average consumer isn’t going to get much use out of those features. More conventional contact and mapping applications would go a long way toward making the TemPad a more useful day-to-day device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qgAIgv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10650974"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="PeL0Rx"&gt;Another issue with the TemPad is availability: right now, the device is only accessible by TVA agents who have been kidnapped by a nefarious organization and brainwashed to enforce a single instance of reality, mercilessly pruning anyone or anything that stands in the way of that goal. It’s a decidedly steep price to have to pay for the hardware, especially given that it still can’t play TikTok videos. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon is crowdfunding these Diane von Furstenberg Echo Dots</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The ‘Midnight Kiss’ Diane von Furstenberg Echo Dot." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QgVuo9_-wsDdvjnGTgIxm_u9lJU=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69580196/Midnight_Kiss_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wJRL0u"&gt;Amazon is launching the next line of products for its Build It crowdfunding platform. The company has collaborated with fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg on a range of Echo Dot smart speakers that’ll only go on sale if enough people pre-order them within 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nerclG"&gt;That’s by no means a given. Amazon launched the Build It program earlier this year with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22286662/amazon-alexa-cuckoo-clock-build-it-program-preorder"&gt;three Alexa-powered devices&lt;/a&gt; — a nutrition scale, a cuckoo clock, and a sticky note printer — and only the last of those reached its goal in time. Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08SPBLN1C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently estimates&lt;/a&gt; that the Smart Sticky Note Printer will ship between July and September, but if you didn’t get in on the Build It campaign, you can’t pre-order it right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dn1I2F"&gt;The Echo Dot x Diane von Furstenberg range comes in three variations: &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/EchoDotMidnightKiss"&gt;Midnight Kiss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/EchoDotIkat"&gt;Ikat&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/EchoDotTwigs"&gt;Twigs&lt;/a&gt;. They all have a “special promo price” of $59.99 each, which is $10 more than a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;regular fourth-gen Dot&lt;/a&gt; or the same price as the cute panda and tiger Kids Edition model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Hgjri"&gt;Here’s the full collection:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fTsPvwTusOGLTvVxnHiy8QRbj_0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22714278/Echo_Dot_x_Diane_von_Furstenberg_Logos.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;From left to right: Twigs, Ikat, and Midnight Kiss.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pGGyp2"&gt;Amazon isn’t saying exactly how many people will need to order each model for it to actually get built, but the deadline is August 13th. You’ll only be charged if and when the products ship out. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Skyward Sword HD is just the thing to hold you over until Breath of the Wild 2</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/26Qyi7KuVXIG2N32nDzabf1a7jQ=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69580198/Switch_ZeldaSSHD_ND_Feb_SCRN16_bmp_jpgcopy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mwxi1C"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; changed a lot about &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Most importantly, it made the fantasy realm of Hyrule more open, increasing the sense of pure adventure. If you saw something off on the horizon — a crumbling ruin, a giant mountain, whatever — you could find your own way there, rather than following a path laid out by the game’s developers. It’s what made the game so refreshing, but it could also make going back to older entries challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LnM4cA"&gt;At least, that was my fear playing &lt;em&gt;Skyward Sword&lt;/em&gt;, which originally launched a decade ago and is coming to the Switch this week. Aside from a few quality-of-life tweaks, slightly updated visuals, and the very welcome addition of a motion control-free control scheme, the new version is the same as the one that debuted on the Wii in 2011. That means it’s a largely linear affair that’s missing the open-ended structure that made &lt;em&gt;BotW&lt;/em&gt; so engrossing. But it still has enough &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt; magic to make it worth playing — particularly if you missed it the first time around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZwHBMz"&gt;The core is the same as always. A quiet young boy named Link discovers that he’s actually a hero — shock! — and eventually gets a legendary sword and green outfit to help him on a quest to save a princess named Zelda. But as with the best &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt; adventures, &lt;em&gt;Skyward Sword&lt;/em&gt; takes that basic formula in interesting new directions. The game begins in a city in the clouds. The residents of this small, floating village ride giant birds like horses and live above a sprawling cloud barrier that separates them from what they believe is a desolate and inaccessible surface. Naturally, this is exactly where Link needs to go.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QstdDw-Ro9GIAtmm2DZptnTpQaA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22715686/Switch_ZeldaSSHD_ND_Feb_SCRN17_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8z1VTt"&gt;The premise was refreshing a decade ago, and it still remains an enticing world to explore. There’s something really fun about soaring through the sky, exploring this very different history of Hyrule. At its best, &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt; takes a familiar place and makes it feel new — there’s a reason &lt;em&gt;Wind Waker&lt;/em&gt; is so beloved — and that’s exactly what happens in &lt;em&gt;Skyward Sword&lt;/em&gt;. This was especially true back in 2011, as it was the next mainline &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt; after the comparatively drab &lt;em&gt;Twilight Princess&lt;/em&gt;. Each entry is like a new take on an ancient fable. &lt;em&gt;Skyward Sword&lt;/em&gt; remains one of the more memorable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ROIavU"&gt;But while the world still feels fresh after all this time, the actual game is very familiar territory. Unlike &lt;em&gt;BotW&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Skyward Sword&lt;/em&gt; pushes you along a predetermined path, where you go through a series of areas — a forest, a desert, a volcano — solving puzzles in order to get to the dungeon at the end, where you’ll find another bread crumb in your search for Zelda. And in traditional &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt; fashion, you’ll slowly gather new items that open up new areas. That could be a slingshot for shooting down vines or a magically controlled drone that lets you hit switches remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="SiNDnt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:803778"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aFOvRm"&gt;There’s a satisfying sense of progression, even if the straightforward structure can feel dated. &lt;em&gt;Skyward Sword &lt;/em&gt;funnels you along a path; the path can be large at times, but there’s usually only one or two things you can or should be doing. It’s missing the sense of freedom and serendipity that are so core to &lt;em&gt;BotW&lt;/em&gt;. This didn’t bother me as much as I expected — likely because the world is still so interesting, and the puzzles and combat remain excellent — but it can be frustrating at times, particularly if you find yourself stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KY3GpJ"&gt;The big change between this version of &lt;em&gt;Skyward Sword&lt;/em&gt; and the original is the controls. &lt;em&gt;Skyward Sword&lt;/em&gt; was built with motion controls in mind; it originally required the Wii’s MotionPlus add-on, which made your sword swipes more accurate. You can still play that way, wielding two Joy-Con controllers like a sword and shield. But on the Switch, there’s also a more traditional control scheme so you can play in portable mode or use a Pro Controller.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VB94xmw0nHEGFrx0yCmEa50asO0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22715921/Switch_ZeldaSSHD_ND_Feb_SCRN11_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yjUexO"&gt;For the most part, it works. Sword swipes have been moved to the right analog stick, which you can use to replicate thrusting a sword in various directions. As someone who doesn’t enjoy flailing my arms in front of a screen, it’s a welcome addition, but there are a few little niggles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nFyeB0"&gt;For example, &lt;em&gt;Skyward Sword&lt;/em&gt; on the Switch finally adds camera controls to the game, one of the biggest omissions from the original. But the way they work is a little wonky. In order to rotate the camera, you have to hold the left shoulder button and move the right stick — the same stick that controls your sword. I kept finding myself swinging a weapon when I meant to look around; it’s just natural to go straight for the right stick when you need to rotate the camera. It’s especially annoying in battle if you need to both attack and look around at the same time. (The lock-on option helps somewhat, but not when there are lots of bad guys or bosses that teleport around.) The right stick is freed up when using motion controls, but this does require a level of coordination I don’t seem to possess; it’s tough to rotate a camera with your thumb while also swinging your arm around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3PzXi7"&gt;Aside from that, this port is improved in all of the expected ways. It runs smooth, the graphics look cleaner (despite a few muddy textures here and there), and the new control scheme makes it a more accessible version of &lt;em&gt;Skyward Sword&lt;/em&gt;. There are even some nice little tweaks, like a slightly less chatty talking sword that serves as your guide. The biggest barrier is your expectations. Yes, it can feel dated after &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild. &lt;/em&gt;But for me at least, the fantastical world, clever puzzles, and challenging dungeons made it worth pressing through. And given that the still-untitled sequel to &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22533513/nintendo-switch-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-sequel-trailer-e3-2021-release-date-trailer"&gt;looks like it’ll feature a similar sky-themed world&lt;/a&gt;, this could be just the thing to hold you over until its release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ngGRW5"&gt;&lt;small&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;launches on July 16th on the Nintendo Switch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix Kids’ new Top 10 row makes content discovery a little easier</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p1_EBPiByuTeFXOX5VWqp-6ZZh8=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69580266/Kids_Profile_Top10_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Netflix Kids will now have its own top 10 row.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KAVyWL"&gt;Netflix is launching two new tools this week that should help make finding age-appropriate content a little easier to discover within the kids version of its streaming service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SbtVx3"&gt;Today, Netflix is introducing a new Top 10 row for age-restricted profiles, borrowing one of the most useful tools for discovery from the adult version of the service. Netflix’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21151327/netflix-top-10-list-homepage-subscribers-originals-licensed-movies-tv-shows"&gt;existing top 10 tool&lt;/a&gt; works by surfacing the most popular titles on the service, often new and original titles, which can make finding something to stream a lot less of a headache. Launching in 93 countries, the row will be updated daily and will feature both shows and movies with the regional equivalent of a PG and below rating. Additionally, titles that make the cut will display a “Top 10” badge across Netflix when they’ve made the cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4CZ1xX"&gt;The company said the new top 10 section will appear across TV apps, web, and mobile (iOS and Android), a notable exception being Apple TV. A spokesperson for Netflix told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that support will also not be included on some older devices. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l2zcyaTdc75sIvdfIeIPkkKou5U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22716051/Kids_Recap_Email.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kids Recap Email displayed on a mobile device.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gBR5Sz"&gt;Separately, Netflix is also introducing a biweekly Kids Recap Email that will launch Friday. The email, sent to account holders with at least one kids’ profile set up, will cover tips for using the platform’s features, offer insight about the kind of content being watched on kids profiles, and will recommend similar content based on viewing history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dNNp7Y"&gt;The new features arrive as Netflix continues to invest in its children's programming. The company &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/kids-sensations-cocomelon-and-little-baby-bum-get-all-new-animated-series"&gt;announced Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; it had partnered with Moonbug Entertainment on new series and specials based on characters from the popular animated &lt;em&gt;CoComelon&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Little Baby Bum&lt;/em&gt; properties that would begin streaming in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="thsY37"&gt;Heather Tilert, Netflix’s director of original animation for preschool viewers, said in a statement that the company was “thrilled to partner with Moonbug to expand the worlds of both shows, and to bring our youngest viewers even more songs, stories, and adventures from some of their favorite animated friends.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s educational ‘Today at Apple’ classes are launching on YouTube with a Peanuts-themed session</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YjaJIZ9WGSLKpmK_8KscUL0kTHk=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69580223/Snoopy02.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Learn how to draw yourself as a &lt;/em&gt;Peanuts&lt;em&gt; character in the first “Today at Apple” YouTube session.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rUqCvi"&gt;Apple is bringing its educational “Today at Apple” classes to YouTube, the company announced Wednesday. The first episode will show you how to draw yourself as a &lt;em&gt;Peanuts&lt;/em&gt; character in the company’s Pages app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lU1Kgc"&gt;The session features two people who work on the Apple TV Plus show &lt;em&gt;The Snoopy Show&lt;/em&gt; — showrunner Mark Evestaff and storyboard artist Krista Porter — and it’s hosted by an Apple Store employee named Anthony. I’ve watched the nearly 10-minute episode, and it’s a pretty easy guide to follow about turning yourself into a &lt;em&gt;Peanuts&lt;/em&gt; cartoon. Unsurprisingly, it’s packed with Apple technologies; Anthony and Porter draw on iPads using Apple Pencils, and they’re collaborating in the same Pages document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3ijEdo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Today at Apple” first launched in 2017&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lQkzIU"&gt;Apple first announced the “Today at Apple” program in 2017 as a community-focused feature of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/25/15419398/apple-store-redesign-genius-bar-grove"&gt;larger retail makeover&lt;/a&gt;. But the company has had to move &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Ftoday%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F14%2F22576342%2Ftoday-at-apple-youtube-classes-sessions-peanuts-snoopy-show" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;some sessions online&lt;/a&gt; due to the pandemic, which forced Apple to close down many of its US retail stores. Although all 270 US stores reopened &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307723/apple-stores-reopened-us-retail-open"&gt;in March&lt;/a&gt; for the first time since the pandemic began, this new YouTube series signals that Apple is still working to build ways to educate its customers without requiring them to step inside a physical store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wrHHJJ"&gt;The first episode of the series is available now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="o3YkOQ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b0nWcBVvhd0?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ayWPho"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 14th, 9:15AM ET: Added the first episode.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
