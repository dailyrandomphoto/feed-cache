    <title>Apple is reportedly relying on states to pay for digital ID rollouts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MSYOHsRuYaylI_sE51MNxp6dFS0=/129x0:2871x1828/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70141339/license.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ftM9p0"&gt;Apple will soon let users in participating states &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522864/apple-wallet-iphone-airport-ids-hotel-key-card-ios-15-wwdc"&gt;digitally store their driver’s licenses&lt;/a&gt; or state IDs on their iPhone’s wallet, but according to a report by &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/14/apple-sticking-taxpayers-with-part-of-the-bill-for-digital-id-rollout.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt;, the initiative will be partially funded by the states — and their taxpayers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XPDAbi"&gt;CNBC got ahold of contracts signed by Georgia, Arizona, Oklahoma, and Kentucky, and found that Apple will maintain tight control over its deployment. It reports that Apple gets “sole discretion” over a number of aspects of the program, including its device compatibility, the service’s launch date, states’ marketing campaigns, as well as how states report on the initiative's performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qXNBn4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple gets “sole discretion” over a number of aspects of the program&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R1qbG0"&gt;The contract also says that each state will have to “allocate reasonably sufficient personnel and resources (e.g., staff, project management and funding) to support the launch of the Program on a timeline to be determined by Apple.” This includes testing out the service on different types of Apple devices “in accordance with Apple’s certification requirements.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X9AUXV"&gt;Additionally, states are responsible for promoting the digital ID service to citizens, as well as encouraging its adoption among members of the federal and state government, including local police and the Internal Revenue Service. State agencies are required to “feature the Program in all public-facing communications relating to Digital Identity Credentials,” which is subject to Apple’s review and approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CNp0wG"&gt;And if that isn’t enough, Apple is holding states accountable for the authenticity of the program’s identity verification. The contract absolves Apple from any discrepancies in its verification system, stating: “Apple shall not be liable for any Verification Results, and Agency acknowledges that all Verification Results are provided ‘AS IS’ and without any warranty, express, implied or otherwise, regarding its accuracy or performance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i54w6P"&gt;Despite being an Apple-led program, taxpayers are footing the bill to roll out this single-platform digital ID program in their states — even if they don’t have an iPhone. The contract clearly says “except as otherwise agreed upon between the Parties, neither Party shall owe the other Party any fees under this Agreement,” meaning that the participating states will be funding its promotion and adoption using taxpayer’s tender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tQQcCq"&gt;Having a digital ID program — especially one paid for by states — raises a number of concerns, the most obvious one being security. Users are expected to transfer their most sensitive documents to their iPhones, essentially establishing their identities on a single device. If implemented incorrectly, it sets a precedent for surveillance; what happens to user information when a digital ID is scanned at an airport or at an age-restricted concert? This type of tracking information is tempting to abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDQ6WF"&gt;Much like what Apple is trying to do with its digital ID program, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21516653/clear-identity-health-covid-airports"&gt;Clear, a digital identification app&lt;/a&gt;, serves as a fast pass to the front of security lines in airports and sports stadiums, or as an app to store proof of your COVID-19 vaccination. As an article by &lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/clear-conquered-u-s-airports-now-it-wants-to-own-your-entire-digital-identity-15d61076e44d"&gt;&lt;em&gt;OneZero&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; notes, Clear considered selling user data in the past, but instead uses that data to promote relevant ads to users. No matter how Apple chooses to leverage this data, its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652051/apple-iphone-drivers-license-state-id-arizona-georgia-ios-15"&gt;digital ID system is making its way to Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;, Iowa, Maryland, and Utah, in addition to the four aforementioned states, very soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wG3sqF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to Apple with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The FBI’s email system was hacked to send out fake cybersecurity warnings</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AiPzwC66vkTZM6s1_aP5XHrUjMM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70140776/acastro_180109_1777_0003_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IiLLc3"&gt;Hackers targeted the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) email servers, sending out thousands of phony messages that say its recipients have become the victims of a “sophisticated chain attack,” first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-system-hacked-to-email-urgent-warning-about-fake-cyberattacks/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The emails were initially uncovered by &lt;a href="https://www.spamhaus.org/"&gt;The Spamhaus Project&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit organization that investigates email spammers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2NEWV"&gt;The emails claim that Vinny Troia was behind the fake attacks and also falsely state that Troia is associated with the infamous hacking group, The Dark Overlord — the same bad actors who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/29/15483850/netflix-hacker-orange-is-the-new-black-ransom"&gt;leaked the fifth season of &lt;em&gt;Orange Is the New Black&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In reality, Troia is a prominent cybersecurity researcher who runs two dark web security companies, NightLion and Shadowbyte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dcDNjt"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;These emails look like this:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sending IP: 153.31.119.142 (&lt;a href="https://t.co/En06mMbR88"&gt;https://t.co/En06mMbR88&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br&gt;From: eims@ic.fbi.gov&lt;br&gt;Subject: Urgent: Threat actor in systems &lt;a href="https://t.co/NuojpnWNLh"&gt;pic.twitter.com/NuojpnWNLh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Spamhaus (@spamhaus) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/spamhaus/status/1459452609979371520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ppOmqb"&gt;As noted by &lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt;, the hackers managed to send out emails to over 100,000 addresses, all of which were scraped from the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN) database. A report by &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-13/fbi-s-email-system-compromised-hackers-warn-of-cyber-threat"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; says that hackers used the FBI’s public-facing email system, making the emails seem all the more legitimate. Cybersecurity researcher Kevin Beaumont also attests to the email’s legitimate appearance, stating that the headers are authenticated as coming from FBI servers using the Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM) process &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573813/google-authenticated-brand-logos-gmail-rolling-out-bimi-dmarc"&gt;that’s part of the system Gmail uses to stick brand logos on verified corporate emails&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BXSDJi"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The email was sent from these FBI internal servers, per the headers (which validate with DKIM). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;dap00025.str0.eims.cjis - 10.67.35.50&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; wvadc-dmz-pmo003-fbi.enet.cjis &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;dap00040.str0.eims.cjis - 10.66.2.72&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before anybody runs off the Russia cliff, I would check webapps.&lt;/p&gt;— Kevin Beaumont (@GossiTheDog) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GossiTheDog/status/1459521411492589569?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D1CLuK"&gt;The FBI responded to the incident in a &lt;a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-statement-on-incident-involving-fake-emails"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;, noting that it’s an “ongoing situation” and that “the impacted hardware was taken offline.” Aside from that, the FBI says it doesn’t have any more information it can share at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hERDn0"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt;, the spam campaign was likely carried out as an attempt to defame Troia. In a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vinnytroia/status/1459515619838251010"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;, Troia speculates that an individual who goes by the name “Pompompurin” may have launched the attack. As &lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt; notes, that same person has allegedly tried damaging Troia’s reputation in similar ways in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fpuFMK"&gt;A report by computer security reporter &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/11/hoax-email-blast-abused-poor-coding-in-fbi-website/"&gt;Brian Krebs&lt;/a&gt; also connects Pompompurin to the incident — the individual allegedly messaged him from an FBI email address when the attacks were launched, stating, “Hi its pompompurin. Check headers of this email it’s actually coming from FBI server.” &lt;em&gt;KrebsOnSecurity&lt;/em&gt; even got a chance to speak with Pompompurin, who claims that the hack was meant to highlight the security vulnerabilities within the FBI’s email systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ffkjTy"&gt;“I could’ve 1000 percent used this to send more legit looking emails, trick companies into handing over data etc.,” Pompompurin said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;KrebsOnSecurity&lt;/em&gt;. The individual also told the outlet that they exploited a security gap on the FBI’s Law Enforcement Enterprise (LEEP) portal and managed to sign up for an account using a one-time password embedded in the page’s HTML. From there, Pompompurin claims they were able to manipulate the sender’s address and email body, executing the massive spam campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9pHCpC"&gt;With that kind of access, the attack could’ve been much worse than a false alert that put system administrators on high alert. Earlier this month, President Joe Biden &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761208/biden-administration-security-vulnerabilities-patch"&gt;mandated a bug fix that calls for civilian federal agencies&lt;/a&gt; to patch any known threats. In May, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22433266/biden-executive-order-cybersecurity-government-infrastructure-colonial-pipeline-solarwinds-hafnium"&gt;Biden signed an executive order&lt;/a&gt; that aims to improve the nation’s cyber defenses in the wake of detrimental attacks on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22426158/cyberattack-forces-shutdown-major-us-fuel-colonial-pipeline"&gt;Colonial Pipeline&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288961/solarwinds-hack-100-companies-9-federal-agencies"&gt;SolarWinds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter shouldn’t be hiding basic app improvements behind its Blue paywall  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OY_aNasx_Uc2HKrj7dvYEYAqaa0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70140559/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0005.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZwdK9A"&gt;Twitter launched its new subscription product, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22766286/twitter-blue-subscription-service-scroll-nuzzel-undo-tweets-ad-free-articles-us"&gt;Twitter Blue&lt;/a&gt;, in the US this week — it’s a $2.99 per month service that &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/twitter-smarter--twitter-harder-with-twitter-blue"&gt;promises to make Twitter&lt;/a&gt; “more customizable, more frictionless, and simply put — better.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q3s1y3"&gt;Let’s start just by looking at what’s actually included in a Twitter Blue subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="2KqvJU"&gt;Ad-Free Articles (a take on Scroll, for articles you click through on Twitter)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0D8PJC"&gt;Top Articles (a take on Nuzzel, for articles discussed on Twitter)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="P7QNrU"&gt;Themes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="A4438B"&gt;Bookmark folders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cN2ZTs"&gt;Customizable navigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="E4SHaK"&gt;An “undo button” for Tweets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cloiiO"&gt;A “Reader” mode for reading threads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RO3Oze"&gt;Twitter Blue Labs for early access features, including longer videos and pinned DMs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;aside id="wsXQlU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Twitter will now let you pay to undo tweets and read ad-free news in the US","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22766286/twitter-blue-subscription-service-scroll-nuzzel-undo-tweets-ad-free-articles-us"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="b3U36j"&gt;Looking at that list, there are two different categories of things here: features that enhance or support journalism and news in some fashion (which are, broadly speaking, good) and features that make the Twitter app better or otherwise easier to use, which I have more of an issue with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="881y4V"&gt;It doesn’t take much time using Twitter to realize that the ability to quickly fix a typo would be a nice thing to have. Or that the company should do something to fix threaded conversations, which have become such a mess that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21152579/twitter-thread-easier-full-text-reading-unroll-how-to"&gt;there’s actually enough demand for a third-party service&lt;/a&gt;, Thread Reader, specifically to try and wrangle the chaos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GTeB0i"&gt;But instead of just fixing the obvious problems with its product, Twitter Blue takes features like the undo button for tweets, the reader mode for threads, or the ability to edit the navigation bar — basic improvements that would improve Twitter’s usability for everyone — and limits them only to those willing to pay for them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KtMBGV"&gt;Like Twitter’s blog post says, the goal of Blue is to make Twitter “more frictionless” and “better.” But by limiting these changes to customers who are willing to shell out the $2.99 per month, Twitter is choosing to leave its product actively worse for the bulk of its users in an effort to try and squeeze extra cash out of the far smaller percentage of customers willing to pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gwqg1C"&gt;Twitter has effectively spent years leaving much of its platform to stagnate, with inexplicable changes like changing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/3/9661180/twitter-vine-favorite-fav-likes-hearts"&gt;the like button to a heart&lt;/a&gt;, pivots to Instagram-chasing “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22461070/twitter-fleets-stories-ads-monetize-instagram-snap"&gt;Fleets&lt;/a&gt;,” and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22587583/twitter-new-tweetdeck-preview-beta-hands-on-editorial"&gt;controversial Tweetdeck beta&lt;/a&gt;. And now that the company &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; have things that customers have been begging for for years (even if the undo button still isn’t the edit button that everyone’s been clamoring for), it’s charging users for the privilege. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GvPfSf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fixing Twitter’s terrible-to-follow threads should be free, not $36 a year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ng4m56"&gt;Put another way, fixing Twitter’s terrible-to-follow threads should be the default, not something that requires spending $36 a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XOQyBT"&gt;The Scroll and Nuzzel-style features (Ad-Free Articles and Top Articles) make more sense to me. The idea here of subsidizing and supporting ad-free journalism with subscription payments is a good one, just like it was when Scroll first launched a few years back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGOzuL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/28/21111865/scroll-ad-free-website-subscription-launches"&gt;Scroll’s reliance on cookies&lt;/a&gt; (and the tech industry’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21064698/google-third-party-cookies-chrome-two-years-privacy-safari-firefox"&gt;general move away from them&lt;/a&gt;) meant that it was probably inevitable that it would have had to shift to a different model sooner or later. And given the prevalence of Twitter as a news source for millions of people, it’s probably not the worst fit for a successor to the service. Building &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/3/18/5523128/nuzzel-keeps-track-of-twitter-and-facebook-so-you-dont-have-to"&gt;Nuzzel’s Top Articles&lt;/a&gt; into Twitter — where a lot of those conversations happen anyway — makes a lot of sense, too. I’m not wholly on board with the fact that these services are now walled into Twitter’s app exclusively, but that’s the cost of doing business in a world of service acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vipj4H"&gt;But the bulk of Twitter Blue’s features just feel weird to me. Watching Twitter ask users to pony up for extra quality of life changes, as though the company couldn’t take the time or expense to support an undo button without the extra fees, comes off as disingenuous to me in the same sort of way that Disney starting a Patreon to fund a Marvel show or Apple launching a Kickstarter would be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YOQOxU"&gt;It’s still very much early days for Twitter Blue, so there’s a lot of time for Twitter to improve the service, roll out more functionality, and expand what’s included in its subscription. But for now, Twitter Blue feels weirdly caught between its news ambitions and a frustrating cash grab. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s new floodlight camera is bright but not beautiful</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Speedy smart alerts and good lighting control make up for an odd design&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="fGKUq1"&gt;If you’re going to install one outdoor security camera at your home, a floodlight camera is the best option. You get lights and a camera in one unit to capture all the action and you don’t have to mess with charging batteries or drilling holes through your walls for power cables — a floodlight cam can go wherever you have existing outdoor lighting. It’s a win-win smart home device. The only downsides are a high upfront price and a more involved installation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TXREl7"&gt;Unfortunately, the new &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/nest_cam_floodlight?hl=en-US"&gt;Google Nest Cam with floodlight &lt;/a&gt;($280) doesn’t solve either of these issues, being one of the more expensive floodlight cams and having the oddest design and installation process. But, despite these failings, it’s an excellent floodlight camera and has several benefits over the competition — which is multiplying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FZ96pU"&gt;These benefits include a built-in battery backup for if the power goes out, intelligent motion sensing so the floodlights aren’t always going off when a moth flies by, and on-device processing that translates to much speedier alerts — crucial for a security camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RZowP9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10861576"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4Eqiai"&gt;The Nest Cam with floodlight is functionally a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22710545/nest-doorbell-battery-cam-battery-test-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Google Nest Cam (indoor/outdoor) &lt;/a&gt;magnetically attached to two, high-powered 2,400 lumen-producing, motion-sensing lights. It has all the same camera specs — 1080p HD video with night vision, a 130-degree diagonal field of view, two-way audio, IP54 weather resistance, and a built-in battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C2wa0M"&gt;It can also record up to three hours of event-based video clips for free and has free smart alerts for motion, people, vehicles, and animals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uaClrs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A siren is the one missing feature on the Nest Cam&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DAxJcy"&gt;The specs are comparable to the competition, although it’s the narrowest field of view by 10 degrees. Ring offers 140 degrees in its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371015/ring-floodlight-cam-wired-pro-video-doorbell-4-price-features"&gt;Floodlight Cam Plus &lt;/a&gt;($180), and Eufy’s $300 option has a 360-degree rotating camera and 2K video, which is the same resolution Arlo offers in its battery Flood Cam Pro 3 ($250) that can be powered with an AC adaptor. The new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22770834/wyze-floodlight-cam-big-field-view-small-price"&gt;Wyze Floodlight Cam&lt;/a&gt; has the option of two cameras, so you can survey two angles over 130 degrees each. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RW2Ad5MPTYvEKwnktxfuoxxqUMA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23000207/jtuohy_211011_4869_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nest Cam with floodlight is the same camera as the Google Nest Cam. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/scMqz1W8GtH0QtmMvV9SIKZur98=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23000212/jtuohy_211011_4869_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It attaches magnetically and is then hardwired in via a short magnetic cable. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v5IscR"&gt;A siren is the one missing feature on the Nest Cam that’s found on all the competition. If you pay for Nest Aware, you do get the option to call 911 directly from the app, but the lack of a loud alarm to scare off a potential intruder is a big omission here. Additionally, both Eufy and Wyze have the option of onboard storage, so you don’t need to pay for a cloud subscription to view recorded video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fkZ9dk"&gt;With the Google Nest Cam, a Nest Aware subscription (starting at $6 a month) is essential if you’re planning to use this camera as a security device. While you get three hours of event-triggered recordings for free, that’s not going to do much good if there’s someone creeping around your property at 1 a.m. but you don’t see the alert until you wake up at 6 a.m. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aZULvN"&gt;A subscription adds 30 or 60 days of event-based recordings, 24/7 continuous recording, the excellent Familiar Faces feature, and sound alerts — although only for carbon monoxide and smoke alarms, which is less useful for an outdoor camera. I do miss the “dog barking” and “people talking” alerts that came on the older Nest IQ cams. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sGAkez7_Kp5OV1lJvB8ZFRYqrs4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23000220/jtuohy_211108_4869_0015.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Nest Cam is designed to be installed on a wall rather than under an eave. But even with this slightly odd setup, it worked well as a security camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5R59Xw"&gt;My colleague Dan Seifert &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22710545/nest-doorbell-battery-cam-battery-test-review-price-specs-features"&gt;reviewed the Google Nest Cam&lt;/a&gt;, and his thoughts apply here — this is a good camera with decent video quality. Still, it’s not as great as the Nest IQ cameras were, whose 4K sensors and longer digital zoom made it easier to hone in on details such as a name badge or license plate. The camera also can’t automatically zoom and pan as its predecessors could (and the Arlo can), a handy feature for an outdoor security camera as it can track someone further around your property. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xO4jKE"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Google Nest Cam with floodlight test footage day|104815" data-volume-uuid="ae8ebd178" data-volume-id="104815" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="true" id="volume-placement-4" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daytime footage is good enough to identify people but if you zoom in it gets pixelated quickly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XbPiu0"&gt;But when paired with the floodlights, the Google Nest Cam gets a clearer picture at night — the added lumens allowing for full-color night vision. While this doesn’t help with distance, it does provide more detail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cUAA3i"&gt;Google has also implemented the lighting control nicely, giving you as much control over the floodlights as you get with any other smart light. You can turn them on and off and dim or brighten them with voice control or in the Google Home app. You can also add them into a Routine, so they can come on when you leave and turn off when you arrive home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DrQsnE"&gt;These are security lights, though, so even on the dimmest setting, they’re still bright, and I wouldn’t plan on using them as outdoor accent lighting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qk2N4F"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Google Nest Cam with floodlight test footage night|104816" data-volume-uuid="9ae8a7517" data-volume-id="104816" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="true" id="volume-placement-191" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nighttime footage is crisp and clear (up to 20 feet) and when the floodlights kick on (triggered by person detection in this clip) you get full color.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Eubnkb"&gt;There’s also plenty of control for deciding what triggers the lights and when. You can choose one or more from motion, live viewing, and any camera event (such as people, animals, vehicles) to activate the lights at night, and there are four daylight sensing options to determine how dark it has to be before they come on. There’s also a setting for how long the lights stay on once activated, from 10 seconds up to five minutes. In the Home app you can also turn them on or off like regular lights, with no timeout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="njUrOp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s plenty of control for deciding what triggers the lights and when.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GvQPno"&gt;These options significantly cut down how often I lit up the side of my house where I placed the camera. I set it to turn on only when it saw a person and created an activity zone to cut out my neighbors’ pathway, which is adjacent to mine. Compared to the Ring Floodlight Camera installed on the other side of my house (which also has person detection), it turned on much less frequently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N9ZAvlppYdAYaO8NAKctZJR_H5o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23009968/689F7521_A79B_4DBA_94BC_D4F0226AD34C.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nest Cam’s two floodlights are controlled in the Google Home app in the same way as other smart lighting options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S7SJpj36oSxnEDcM0yYXOkxr-xc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23010496/64205C35_3119_49F9_B225_3FD88ABF0EC8.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The option to create activity zones paired with smart motion alerts prevents the floodlights from activating too often.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EW7YT5"&gt;I have two main issues with this camera: the Google Home app and the design. I’ll start with the app. The Home app does some things well — including lighting control, and it’s great that the floodlight is set up just like any other light in the app. But it’s not good for viewing or managing security cameras; specifically, the timeline view is clunky, and the route into viewing events is convoluted (although I do like the mini GIFs you get when you eventually land on the Full History page). The old Nest app is much better, but Google is moving away from it, and frustratingly, you can only use this Nest camera in the Google app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XI7SsR"&gt;Case in point, there are no controls for the floodlights in the camera portion of the app. You can choose what turns them on in the camera settings, but you can’t adjust brightness, turn them on or off, or dim them there. Instead, you have to navigate over to the main Google Home control page — about six taps away — to do any of this. This feels like an oversight and is a frustrating user experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qGyhLn"&gt;As for design, Google over-thought this one. A floodlight camera is a simple concept: lights with a camera in the middle. Most of those on the market today look remarkably similar, but the Nest Cam with floodlight has a base that’s almost a foot long. This means if you’re installing on the side of your house on a wall, the camera extends outwards farther than others do — giving the motion sensor beneath it and the camera itself a better view. But if you install it under an eave — where all my existing floodlight wiring is (and I am not alone here) — you end up with a very long, ungainly looking device dangling off the side of your house. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/axd4a500VUX_7NRHZVTIgon89_A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23006576/jtuohy_211111_4869_0017.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An awkward design makes the Google Nest Cam tricky for an under-the-eave installation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LbFMHQ"&gt;Installing the floodlight was also tricky, mainly because of this awkward positioning. Attaching the wiring was similar to any floodlight device; you need to hardwire it to your houses’ electrical wiring using a standard outdoor junction box (and if you’re not comfortable with wiring, especially while on the top of a ladder, I would highly recommend paying for a professional to install it — Nest offers this for $179). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PrUSfA"&gt;The problem came with getting the right angle for the camera. Because we had to install it essentially upside down, the very short wire that attaches the Google Nest Cam to the floodlights left little room for maneuverability. I couldn’t angle it high enough to capture the whole area I wanted to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JG6cIX"&gt;Thankfully, the lights themselves have a lot more flexibility, and you can rotate them fully back and forth, and easily position them to cast the light where you want it and not into your neighbors’ window. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XQPZ0o"&gt;Awkward design aside, the Google Nest Cam with floodlight performed very well in my testing. The lights respond accurately to the different motion events — only turning on for people, animals, or motion when those were selected. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G1wAPngoiOVInQrlExaqWH61szo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23000215/jtuohy_211108_4869_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The power cable, motion sensor, and microphone visible here are designed to go under the camera, but when mounting under an eave they sit sideways. The power cable also prevents the camera from being positioned higher on the magnetic mount.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qcEun9"&gt;The lights also responded instantly to general motion events as those use the motion sensor on the floodlight. The smart motion activations (for people and animal) depend on the camera seeing the person or animal first, so they took a second or two longer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ajP7LM"&gt;Alerts also came through on my iPhone 13 much faster than those on the Ring floodlight camera I’m also testing, likely due to the Nest’s on-device processing. However, Nest’s Familiar Faces feature still needs some work, telling me at one point it had spotted me outside, when it was actually the rather burly Comcast tech out there working with my connections.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MIv7cK"&gt;If you are invested in the Google Home ecosystem, the Google Nest Cam with floodlight is your best option if you have the wiring in place. It’s a better choice than the battery Nest Cam and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/5/21048999/arlo-pro-3-floodlight-security-camera-ces-2020"&gt;Arlo Floodlight Pro 3&lt;/a&gt;, the only other floodlight camera that’s fully integrated with the Google Home app (where you can view footage in the app and on a Nest smart display). The Arlo has a similar price and can be installed without wires if that’s an issue, but the lighting isn’t as flexible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="lsVIik"&gt;None of the new Nest Cams, which include an indoor/outdoor battery cam, indoor wired cam and doorbell cam, work with any other smart ecosystem. So, if you are running an Amazon Alexa or Apple HomeKit smart home, you should look at Ring, Eufy, Arlo or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21273479/netatmo-outdoor-security-camera-siren-robbery-launch-price"&gt;Netatmo’s Smart Outdoor Camera&lt;/a&gt;. These all work with Alexa, and the Netatmo and Arlo also work with HomeKit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="lus84t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10861947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The White House allegedly challenged Intel’s plans to increase chip production in China</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i5adaZG6iYkB9t6VbEhWLFdQ0VM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70138888/acastro_180529_1777_intel_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1KaS2N"&gt;Intel’s efforts to speed up chip production in China have reportedly been contested by the Biden administration, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-13/white-house-spurns-intel-plan-to-boost-chip-production-in-china"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Sources close to the situation told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; that Intel proposed making silicon wafers in a Chengdu, China factory, which could start production towards the end of 2022. However, Intel’s plans were “strongly discouraged” by White House officials due to potential security issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wuAMHT"&gt;Since Intel needs to secure funding from the government in order to ramp up production, the administration’s opinion holds some weight on Intel’s path forward. As &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes, Intel said it currently has “no plans” to produce silicon wafers in China after discussing it with government officials, and that it will instead consider “other solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2TK9nu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Biden administration remains skeptical about China’s use of technology&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="diogu6"&gt;“Intel and the Biden administration share a goal to address the ongoing industrywide shortage of microchips, and we have explored a number of approaches with the U.S. government,” Intel said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. One of these approaches may be to invest in factories to manufacture silicon wafers in the US and Europe, in line with the administration’s goals of manufacturing essential components within the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FV8uf5"&gt;The Biden administration remains skeptical about China’s use of technology. Biden recently expanded on existing policies from the Trump era that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/13/17686310/huawei-zte-us-government-contractor-ban-trump"&gt;places restrictions on the government’s use of China-based brands&lt;/a&gt; Huawei and ZTE, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308477/fcc-huawei-zte-ban-universal-service-fund-national-security-threat-risk"&gt;labels both companies as threats to national security&lt;/a&gt;. Biden’s newly-signed legislation blocks the two brands &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/biden-signs-legislation-tighten-us-restrictions-huawei-zte-2021-11-11/"&gt;from obtaining licenses from the Federal Communications Commission&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, Biden previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/22/22740155/commerce-departments-new-rule-hacking-tools-china-russia"&gt;put restrictions on the sale of hacking tools&lt;/a&gt; to China and also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22516719/biden-executive-order-american-investment-chinese-firms-huawei-zte"&gt;banned US investment in Chinese surveillance companies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MeHNs2"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547826/chip-shortage-cars-playstation-5-gpus-semiconductors-time-foundaries-tsmc"&gt;global chip shortage&lt;/a&gt; seems to be seeping into more areas of technology every day. With &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/13/22780037/tesla-reportedly-shipping-cars-without-usb-ports"&gt;Teslas reportedly shipping without USB ports&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/5/22765709/bmw-chip-shortage-touchscreen-car-suv-manufacturing"&gt;newer BMWs coming without touchscreens&lt;/a&gt;, and cuts in production for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759377/nintendo-making-20-percent-fewer-switches-chip-shortage"&gt;Switch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22775829/sony-ps5-supply-chip-shortage-forecast-cut"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723209/apple-iphone-13-chip-shortage-manufacturing-report"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;, it’s starting to look like Intel’s prediction might be right; we may not see &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22739192/intel-chip-shortage-q3-2021-earning-laptop-revenue"&gt;the end of the chip shortage until 2023&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>‘Deep regret’: Global climate summit fails developing nations once again</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="COP26 Summit - Day Four Finance" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bli1R3j4OLGU2eBVvJ2gIhddX_I=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70138482/1351105691.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OXuKe5"&gt;At high-profile climate negotiations in Glasgow, rich nations stuck poor nations with a big bill. Wealthy countries responsible for the most planet-heating pollution have reneged on commitments to help developing nations adapt to a warming world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GJbdvl"&gt;That means delegates and activists from the places most vulnerable to climate change will wind up paying the price back home after leaving the United Nations climate summit that closes today. They’ll need to scrounge together funds for new infrastructure that can safeguard them from rising sea levels, devastating droughts, or monstrous storms — or suffer the losses of living without it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="o5CryH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are failing people”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BGdJrV"&gt;“We are failing people,” says Harjeet Singh, a senior advisor on climate impacts for the Climate Action Network International, a group of more than 1,500 NGOs across the world. “We are failing people who expect so much from their leaders, from this process.  And what we are suffering around the world is because of 30 years of inaction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yNaw7h"&gt;A big goal going into the Glasgow summit, called COP26, was to get wealthy nations to fulfill an old promise. They agreed 12 years ago during another climate conference in Copenhagen that by 2020, they would funnel $100 billion a year to climate action in developing nations. That hasn’t happened, the final text of Glasgow agreements notes “with deep regret.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VrfFzI"&gt;Early on in negotiations, a bloc of negotiators from Africa and about two dozen other developing nations called on affluent countries to provide at least &lt;a href="https://www.climatechangenews.com/2021/11/08/developing-countries-put-number-post-2025-climate-finance-needs-1-3trn-year/"&gt;$1.3 trillion&lt;/a&gt; a year for climate mitigation and adaptation by 2030. Others asked for &lt;a href="https://unfccc-cop26.streamworld.de/webcast/bangladesh-cvf-press-conference-on-the-500-billion"&gt;$500 billion&lt;/a&gt; over five years, and that half of finance go towards adaptation. Ultimately, a &lt;a href="https://unfccc.int/documents/311127"&gt;deal&lt;/a&gt; was struck at the summit to at least double finance specifically for adaptation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bf7Bu0"&gt;Rich countries have, so far, only shelled out about &lt;a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/adaptation-gap-report-2021"&gt;$80 billion&lt;/a&gt; a year in climate finance. And just a &lt;a href="https://www.oecd.org/env/climate-finance-provided-and-mobilised-by-developed-countries-aggregate-trends-updated-with-2019-data-03590fb7-en.htm"&gt;quarter&lt;/a&gt; of finance flows into efforts to adapt to climate change. Historically, most money has flowed into helping developing nations cut greenhouse gas emissions through things like switching to renewable energy or promoting energy efficiency. That’s important, of course. But with climate change already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617371/extreme-weather-science-attribution-un-report-climate-change"&gt;supercharging storms, wildfires, droughts&lt;/a&gt;, and other disasters, finding ways to adapt is becoming more urgent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KxlrEB"&gt;“The reality is that the genie’s already out of the bottle,” says Saliha Dobardzic, a senior climate change specialist with the Adaptation Fund, which is administered through the World Bank and gives climate grants to developing nations. The fund, which pre-dates the $100 billion climate finance target, raised a record &lt;a href="https://www.adaptation-fund.org/adaptation-fund-raises-record-us-356-million-in-new-pledges-at-cop26-for-its-concrete-actions-to-most-vulnerable/"&gt;$356 million&lt;/a&gt; in new pledges during COP26. “Climate change impacts are being seen and experienced everywhere to some degree — and coping and living and adapting to that requires resources.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KCYmZ7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The genie’s already out of the bottle”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1vS7Ji"&gt;Adaptation might look like homes retrofitted to better weather the next storm, raising them above floodwaters or insulating them from the elements. It might include early warning systems in places that didn’t have them so that residents have more time to prepare or flee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qelFp8"&gt;Forecasting can also help farmers continue feeding their communities. Singh has worked with farmers in the Gambia and India to adapt farming practices to more unpredictable weather. When rains come late, for instance, farmers might turn to seeds that can grow in a shorter time span. And they turn to crops that retain more moisture in the soil. “Those kinds of things are happening, but what is needed now is money to scale up those options,” Singh says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g07k8G"&gt;The money it will actually take to prepare developing nations for the consequences of climate change is between five to 10 times greater than the public finance that’s currently available, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/adaptation-gap-report-2021"&gt;United Nations report&lt;/a&gt; released earlier this month. And those costs are expected to balloon. The price tag for developing countries to adapt to climate change could reach 300 billion a year by the end of the decade, the UN report says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eWResZ"&gt;Developing countries are paying for a problem that was passed onto them, for the most part, by wealthier nations. China’s currently the biggest climate polluter, followed by the US. But historically, the US has released almost twice as much carbon dioxide pollution as China &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/4/24/18512804/climate-change-united-states-china-emissions"&gt;since the start of the industrial revolution&lt;/a&gt;. Small developing nations on the front lines of climate change are responsible for a much smaller slice of emissions. On a per-capita basis in 2018, the average American was responsible for almost &lt;a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC?end=2018&amp;amp;locations=S2-US&amp;amp;start=1960&amp;amp;view=chart"&gt;10 times as much&lt;/a&gt; heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions as a person living on a small island state in the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bNTZFn"&gt;“Quite clearly, the advanced economies in the global North are the ones who have caused most of what we are experiencing in terms of climate change,” says Henry Neufeldt, chief editor of the UN adaptation report. “Developing nations deserve to receive support.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mScelG"&gt;To make things worse, negotiators also fell short on another key goal in Glasgow. Countries’ plans to slash greenhouse gas pollution, so far, still aren’t good enough to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius, a threshold &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/"&gt;considered critical&lt;/a&gt; for staving off catastrophic climate impacts. To do that, global greenhouse gas emissions would need to drop nearly in half (compared to 2010 levels) by the end of the decade. Countries were expected to come to Glasgow with ramped-up plans to cut down their emissions. Counting all those up, global emissions are still &lt;a href="https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/message_to_parties_and_observers_on_ndc_numbers.pdf"&gt;expected&lt;/a&gt; to rise above 2010 levels this decade, albeit not as steeply as they would have without those new commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JydoWk"&gt;That failure to cut emissions makes adaptation even harder. Considering current emissions reductions commitments, the world is &lt;a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-do-cop26-promises-keep-global-warming-below-2c"&gt;heading towards&lt;/a&gt; a future where more than &lt;a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2865/a-degree-of-concern-why-global-temperatures-matter/"&gt;70 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the world’s coastlines experience sea level rise greater than two-thirds of a foot. When seawater creeps onshore, it floods peoples’ homes — sometimes permanently. It contaminates sources of fresh drinking water. And it allows dangerous wave surges to do more damage to communities when cyclones hit. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qs10yr"&gt;Samoa, a small island nation where 70 percent of the population lives within just 1 km of the coast, received an &lt;a href="https://www.adaptation-fund.org/project/enhancing-resilience-of-samoas-coastal-communities-to-climate-change/"&gt;$8.7 million grant&lt;/a&gt; in 2012 from the Adaptation Fund to cope with some of those impacts. The initiative led to new seawalls to guard against encroaching water — as well as more roads to make it easier for people to evacuate inland when cyclones hit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vu3dE9"&gt;Still, there’s more work to do. Many of the initiatives’ targets were “too ambitious,” according to a &lt;a href="https://www.adaptation-fund.org/projects-document-view?URL=en/360761632165938755/51-Final-Report-AF-Samoa-05-with-signature-audit-trail.pdf"&gt;2018 evaluation report&lt;/a&gt;. An initial target was to build or improve 80 km (roughly 50 miles) of coastal roads, but the budget ended up only being enough for 30 km of roads at a cost of about $3 million. What’s more worrying is that those roads still face an uncertain future as climate change worsens storms, flooding, and coastal erosion. The roads will likely still need to be climate-proofed with updated construction standards, the report says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmgiKQ"&gt;The Samoa project also resulted in a “&lt;a href="https://www.adaptation-undp.org/projects/af-samoa"&gt;handbook&lt;/a&gt;” to guide potential relocation from hazard zones in the future. Being forced to abandon their homes is a worst-case climate scenario for many communities on small island nations that are losing land to the sea. They’ve pushed for finance for efforts to not only adapt but recoup losses from permanent climate damage. For those people who face the prospect of losing everything to climate-fueled disasters, Singh says, “it’s about the support to restart and rebuild my life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3RZqfR"&gt;The Alliance of Small Island States at COP26 &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AOSISChair/status/1458689527116185602?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsmi=181589086&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_Nk2D1tkCH77AJin1nkmh_hgftCIthM44L1W5EuqSgVLcgrQenxGfRzP5iUdntrMDByX37c1dBYnasubtvqy_UFsxwjUhD_MV5auf8AyA-1W6x15I&amp;amp;utm_content=181589086&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; creating a standalone process for financing “loss and damage.” That was ultimately removed from the decision text (although Scotland pledged independently to give &lt;a href="https://www.gov.scot/news/scotland-to-boost-climate-funding/"&gt;£2 million&lt;/a&gt;). Formalizing funding for loss and damage is something that wealthy nations have shot down since the adoption of the landmark Paris climate agreement in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z6rGkB"&gt;“Rich countries continue to block and ignore the needs of vulnerable people who are suffering now,” Singh says. “People are losing homes now, they need support now.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla has reportedly been shipping out some cars without USB ports</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2ySYljk82KZG743BWd2S_HLVQNY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70138334/acastro_180430_1777_tesla_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U4JJQw"&gt;Some Tesla customers have noticed that their newly-purchased Model 3s and Model Ys have missing USB ports, an issue first spotted by &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/11/12/new-teslas-delivered-with-surprise-missing-usb-ports-due-to-parts-shortages/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Tesla has reportedly been telling customers that the chip shortage is behind the lack of ports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eW6mCF"&gt;As noted by &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;, the issue didn’t seem to start cropping up until November 11th, and only seems to be affecting Model 3s and Model Ys. &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/qsnp5p/new_m3sprobably_other_models_as_well_are_coming/"&gt;Recent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModelY/comments/qryiy6/missing_usb_ports/"&gt;buyers&lt;/a&gt; have turned to Reddit to voice their concerns about the missing ports, noting that the USB-C ports on the center console and near the rear seats are missing — many also claim that their EV’s wireless charger also isn’t working (via &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Q9KrLN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Users will have to deal with driving a pricey battery-on-wheels that can’t even charge their own devices&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W2RUDi"&gt;To make matters worse, some buyers also allege that Tesla didn’t even tell them that their car wouldn’t come with USB ports, &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt; notes. For some, it wasn’t until they saw others’ reports or received their car did they realize the USB ports were missing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QQNPqv"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;, users who managed to get in touch with Tesla say that the ports may be available this December, and they can then make an appointment to get them installed. But that’s probably not a guarantee that the parts will even be available at that time. So for now, users will have to deal with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/24/22743398/tesla-quietly-raises-prices-electric-vehicles-model-x"&gt;driving a pricey battery-on-wheels&lt;/a&gt; that can’t even charge their own devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5PRTR5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547826/chip-shortage-cars-playstation-5-gpus-semiconductors-time-foundaries-tsmc"&gt;The chip shortage&lt;/a&gt; has branched out into many areas of technology, and the automotive industry isn’t an exception. Some of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/5/22765709/bmw-chip-shortage-touchscreen-car-suv-manufacturing"&gt;BMW’s newer models won’t come with a touchscreen&lt;/a&gt;, and buyers likely won’t ever be able to get one installed at a later date. Even GM has been negatively affected by the shortage, as it already had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575836/gm-wireless-charging-cadillac-chevy-tahoe-chip-shortage"&gt;drop wireless charging&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331766/gm-pickups-semiconductor-shortage-fuel-economy-emissions"&gt;ditch its fuel management module&lt;/a&gt; in some of its newer vehicles. It even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701086/cadillac-super-cruise-2022-escalade-semiconductor-shortage"&gt;axed Cadillac’s hands-free Super Cruise&lt;/a&gt; feature due to the shortage. With all that said, now might not be the best time to buy a new car.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Another Samsung Galaxy S21 FE leak shows the device from more angles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3NaqK2p2ft8k-U4f1A1Gb8vy1uo=/0x529:1414x1472/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70138065/galaxy_s21_fe_leak_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Coinbrs&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AtVCeW"&gt;The yet-to-be-announced Samsung Galaxy S21 Fan Edition (FE) has become the victim of another leak, according to a report by &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-fully-revealed-thanks-to-leaked-marketing-materials/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Just like its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21506470/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-review-camera-processor-price"&gt;S20 FE predecessor&lt;/a&gt;, which serves as the affordable counterpart to the S20, the S21 FE is supposed to be the budget-friendly alternative to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;the flagship S21&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o9zcu9CiIyr6FSkjlQdZclyZA00=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23011950/samsung_galaxy_s21_fe_games.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Coinbrs&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hR73vs"&gt;Marketing images leaked by &lt;a href="https://coinbrs.com/news/coinbrs-exclusive-samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-5g-revealed-in-full-glory-all-official-images-specs/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coinbrs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; show several images of the device, and it, unsurprisingly, closely resembles the S21. The images show us much of what we saw in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22651847/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-fan-edition-leaked-manual-specs-features"&gt;S21 FE’s user manual that was previously leaked&lt;/a&gt; in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUGTso"&gt;As noted by &lt;em&gt;Coinbrs&lt;/em&gt;, the device will reportedly have three cameras on its rear: a main 64MP sensor, a depth sensor, and an ultra-wide-angle sensor. On the front, it’s said to have a hole-punch notch housing a 32MP selfie camera, along with an in-display fingerprint scanner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K4szWc"&gt;When compared to the S21 base model’s 6.2-inch display, the S21 FE is rumored to have a slightly bigger screen than its premium counterpart, sporting a 6.4-inch FHD+ 120Hz AMOLED display. &lt;em&gt;Coinbrs&lt;/em&gt; says that it may also have a larger 4,500mAh battery that supports 15W fast charging — a small upgrade from the S21’s 4,000mAh battery. In terms of processing power, &lt;em&gt;Coinbrs&lt;/em&gt; expects it to either come with the Snapdragon 888 or the Exynos 2100 chip depending on the market, as well as up to 12GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z4wt66"&gt;In June, we weren’t sure there was going to be an S21 FE at all — the ongoing chip shortage spurred &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532816/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-production-reportedly-halted"&gt;rumors that Samsung may be halting the phone’s production&lt;/a&gt;. The S21 FE still hasn’t been officially confirmed by Samsung, but &lt;em&gt;Coinbrs&lt;/em&gt; claims that the company will officially reveal the phone on January 4th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The remastered GTA Trilogy has been unavailable on PC for over a day</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Grand Theft Auto The Trilogy Definitive Edition" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xZtE9WKki-fyHMgzfKSr-dvMiPs=/129x0:1521x928/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70137665/unnamed.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bOy1co"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/22/22739195/remastered-grand-theft-auto-trilogy-release-date-november-11th-gta3-vice-city-san-andreas"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; became unavailable on the Rockstar Games store the same day it launched. &lt;em&gt;The Trilogy&lt;/em&gt;, which comes packaged with the remastered versions of &lt;em&gt;GTA III&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;GTA: Vice City&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;GTA: San Andreas&lt;/em&gt;, was supposed to be playable on November 11th, but due to maintenance and other issues, it’s been anything but that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ee7Nzq"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The Rockstar Games Launcher is now online, but GTA: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition is unavailable to play or purchase as we remove files unintentionally included in these versions. We're sorry for the disruption and hope to have correct ones up soon. &lt;a href="https://t.co/NiMNXUKCVh"&gt;https://t.co/NiMNXUKCVh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Rockstar Support (@RockstarSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RockstarSupport/status/1459311246789038089?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="geoHpt"&gt;Rockstar Support sent out a tweet saying that the remastered bundle is currently “unavailable to play or purchase,” while it takes out “files unintentionally included in these versions.” It doesn’t tell us what type of files it's removing, or provide an estimated time frame of when the game might come back online, only noting that it hopes to replace the incorrect files “soon.” And as for anyone who managed to snag copies of the games before it was taken down, Rockstar has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FlangerOfTowels/status/1459345764644110342"&gt;barred them from playing&lt;/a&gt;. Rockstar also took down the older versions of the games from its store — along with Steam — prior to the release of the remastered trilogy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r0JNvM"&gt;Unfortunately, the launch of the three remastered games has been nothing but tumultuous. The Rockstar Games Launcher went down for “maintenance” on Thursday, making not only the remastered trilogy unplayable, but also rendered Rockstar’s entire lineup of games, its store, downloads, and cloud system unusable for over a day. Rockstar finally restored service to its Games Launcher and other services last night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CcZRb1"&gt;So far, early reviews of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/22/22739195/remastered-grand-theft-auto-trilogy-release-date-november-11th-gta3-vice-city-san-andreas"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GTA: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; aren’t looking promising. &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gta-trilogy-definitive-edition-is-a-mess/"&gt;Reviewers are finding the game&lt;/a&gt; filled with glitches and bugs, mainly affecting the game’s graphics. Some users have posted their experience on Twitter, and it doesn’t look pretty — from a rainstorm with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JankyNedelko/status/1458945407397081098?s=20"&gt;blinding white droplets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RerezTV/status/1458876324920102915"&gt;blatant spelling errors&lt;/a&gt;, to just all-around &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VinePotato/status/1458561236237496328"&gt;funky-looking characters&lt;/a&gt;, the game has some serious quirks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YGsaJN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to Rockstar Games with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back. Despite not being available on PC, the games are still available for purchase on the &lt;a href="https://store.rockstargames.com/en/game/buy-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition"&gt;Rockstar Games Store&lt;/a&gt; for PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One and Series X/S, as well as the Nintendo Switch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The early Black Friday tech deals are coming on strong</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cZ0b-Y4m-krCrmzIYS74qXVckdI=/0x0:2500x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70137531/VRG_Illo_4859_GG_Main_lede.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="saqVkI"&gt;You made it to the weekend. Good job. In exchange for making it to arguably the best time of the week, we owe you some deals. That’s just how it works. Below, you’ll find a potent mixture of this week’s best tech deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QoC7qL"&gt;Before we get started, however, a little bit of housekeeping. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759813/holiday-gift-guide-best-tech-gadget-unique-ideas"&gt;We published a massive holiday gift guide this week&lt;/a&gt;. Its art (by &lt;a href="https://www.richardparrydesign.com/store"&gt;Richard Parry&lt;/a&gt;) is so good that I’ve attached it above for you to peep. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qi775u"&gt;As we get closer to the holidays, you might want to subscribe to our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/newsletters"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge Deals&lt;/em&gt; newsletter&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re not the kind of person who checks deals every single day, we think you’ll appreciate our bi-weekly dispatch filled with the best deals we’ve seen during the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PGqXhR"&gt;We also want to remind you that our sister site, &lt;em&gt;The Strategist,&lt;/em&gt; whips up a great newsletter filled with other kinds of deals, shopping advice, and exclusives that you might want to have shipped to your inbox. If you’re interested — and you should be —&lt;a href="https://nymag.com/strategist/newsletter/"&gt; you can sign up right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="DDgvxp"&gt;The capable Nest Audio smart speaker is back down to $60&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="AVBlS0"&gt;Google’s Nest Audio is the successor to the original Google Home from 2016. A lot has changed since then, and the Nest Audio features a better design and audio performance than its predecessor, along with the opportunity for stereo pairing. The reason I’m writing about it here, of course, is because it’s currently cheaper than usual. Normally $100, you can pick one up from a variety of retailers, like &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfZfC8wHORV?u1=vergedeals111321%20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-nest-audio-smart-speaker%2F-%2FA-81539079&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDeals111321%20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, for just $60 right now. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21501300/google-nest-audio-assistant-smart-speaker-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dPUn63"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9503894"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qMGdzM"&gt;Additionally, we’ve pulled together some other Google Nest deals that you might be interested in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/11/2/22757318/google-nest-smart-home-audio-speaker-assistant-video-doorbell-home-hub-cam-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Also, if you’ve had your eye on the latest Google Nest Learning Thermostat, &lt;a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1264455&amp;amp;u=1225169&amp;amp;m=83747&amp;amp;urllink=www%2Ewellbots%2Ecom%2Fproducts%2Fgoogle%2Dnest%2Dlearning%2Dthermostat%2D3rd%2Dgeneration&amp;amp;afftrack=Vergenewsletter111221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; readers can get it for $70 off at Wellbots&lt;/a&gt; through December 1st. Just use promo code &lt;strong&gt;THEVERGENEST &lt;/strong&gt;to get it for $179 at checkout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="laRL6h"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8m2yph"&gt;The second-gen AirPods are an insta-buy at $89 from Walmart&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="fic1CC"&gt;Whether you need an easy gift for someone close to you or you’d like to treat yourself, Walmart’s deal on Apple’s second-gen AirPods with the wired charging case cannot be beat. Most retailers sell them for around $110 to $120, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441&amp;amp;subid1=VergeNewsletterDeals111221%20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;but you can snag them online right now for just $89&lt;/a&gt;. This is a killer deal for iPhone or iPad users. The more Apple devices you use, the more you’ll get out of these AirPods, since they can seamlessly pair with any modern Apple device you’re signed into with your Apple ID. If that was’t enough, they also offer great battery life and solid sound. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="540bfF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="VETqSD"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iuJY9VJ3gXE_0l7f1nsrEjcB9qI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16325377/cq5dam.web.1920.1920.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bose&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bOxSEN"&gt;Bose is hosting a refurbished sale on its best headphones&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="RUqzxZ"&gt;The Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 are currently available through &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeDeals111321/https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones_outlet/noise-cancelling-headphones-700-fr.html#v=noise_cancelling_headphones_700_fr_black%20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bose’s refurbished outlet for just $250&lt;/a&gt;. These normally sell for between $350 and $400 depending on the color you want. I know, reading “refurbished” can feel icky sometimes, but Bose says that these “occasionally have minor, nearly imperceptible blemishes” and goes as far as guaranteeing them with a one-year warranty and a 90-day trial. It’s a good deal in our book, especially for a pair of over-ear headphones that offer multipoint pairing and superb noise cancellation. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="MvwGmV"&gt;Fully’s excellent Jarvis standing desk and other products are 15 percent off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="w1teDF"&gt;If your home office is in need of an ergonomic overhaul, check out the sitewide, 15 percent discount Fully is offering on its products right now. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=44880&amp;amp;u1=VergeDeals111321&amp;amp;murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fully.com%2Fstanding-desks%2Fjarvis%2Fjarvis-adjustable-height-desk-bamboo.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fully makes the Jarvis standing desk&lt;/a&gt;, which a handful of &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;staffers own (and adore). Even if you don’t want to plop down the cash on a desk, you can still kit out your current space &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44880&amp;amp;u1=VergeDeals111321&amp;amp;murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fully.com%2F%23fully-favorites%20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;with clever accessories at a discount&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4ucMio"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10852598"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="vBEAZu"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lrRhtL"&gt;Amazon and Target are offering “buy two, get one free” on games, books, and more&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="9Hx5e8"&gt;For the last deal, you should check out the ongoing promotion currently happening at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/promotion/psp/A2NEKY0JEA1965?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;amp;tag=vergenewsletter-20&amp;amp;linkId=7d3ea0c0c66c0835e1f67d4e15fb9a4d&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl%20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Fbuy-2-get-1-free-mix-match%2F-%2FN-93tfbZ54jft&amp;amp;subid1=VergeNewsletterDeals111221%20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, which will net you a free item of your choosing when you buy two others. Each retailer has its own respective list of qualifying goodies, but each of them have some of the newest releases in the world of gaming, movies, books, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9bgjkB"&gt;At Amazon, you can get games like the new &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Vanguard&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy,&lt;/em&gt; and catch up on the &lt;em&gt;Dune &lt;/em&gt;hype with Frank Herbert’s original novel. Target seems to offer a wider swath of gaming releases, both new and a little older. &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Vanguard&lt;/em&gt; is on its list, too, along with several first-party Sony titles for the PlayStation 4 (&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man, The Last of Us Part Two&lt;/em&gt;) and PlayStation 5 (&lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt;). People who enjoy board games may find something appealing here, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="DAlyIo"&gt;
&lt;p id="KnLTyQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: The Verge Deals newsletter on November 10th listed the Keychron Q1 as a 65 percent layout mechanical keyboard. The Keychron Q1 has a 75 percent layout. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
