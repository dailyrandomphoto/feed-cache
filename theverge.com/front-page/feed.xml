    <title>Apple’s latest sci-fi drama Invasion starts out too dang slow</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PQtrqlpNNUdjBoiPqyrrDQIFMS8=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70031940/Invasion_Photo_010202.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0cD52c"&gt;For a show about an alien invasion,&lt;em&gt; Invasion&lt;/em&gt; is decidedly lacking in aliens thus far. The latest sci-fi drama on Apple TV Plus, the series debuts with three episodes, which, theoretically, should give viewers a good sense of what to expect. Instead, those episodes oh-so-slowly introduce you to characters and stories without giving much of a hint as to how it all connects aside from the teaseist of teases. Three hours in, and I’m still not even sure what it’s about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iYfhd0"&gt;The big hook of &lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt; is that it’s a global story. The idea is that you’ll be able to see the impact of this event from a bunch of different perspectives, and at the very least, it succeeds at that (albeit with the expected American-centric viewpoint). Over the first few episodes, you’re introduced to a sheriff in Oklahoma, a housewife in Long Island, a US soldier stationed in Afghanistan, a teen in London, and an expert in Tokyo working with the International Space Station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H4v9II"&gt;And the show’s creators &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want you to know each of these individuals. The first three episodes are spent almost entirely on setting up their lives and circumstances. You’ll see a marriage slowly unravel (with some help from Find My iPhone, in one of the more obvious bits of product placement on Apple TV Plus) and watch a boy’s struggles with an almost pathological bully at school. I was particularly drawn into a secretive relationship between two women at the Japanese space agency that’s tragically cut short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bULNKY"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X2xFrbVNx0U?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="R2oUYZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The ratio of human drama and sci-fi storytelling is completely out of whack&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2LBsGJ"&gt;Many of these stories are interesting, even if they often delve into cliche; the sheriff, of course, is one day away from retirement before the invasion starts to happen. The problem is that the ratio of human drama and sci-fi storytelling is completely out of whack. Across the first three hours, there are only hints of alien elements. There’s the usual like crop circles and fleeing animals, as well as some more unsettling moments like when an entire music class simultaneously gets a nosebleed. Eventually, things start crashing into the planet, causing havoc while TV news reports blame it on terrorists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w7X1WI"&gt;I’m all for a slow burn, but after three episodes, I should have some clearer sense of the titular&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;invasion. (Apple’s other big sci-fi drama, &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;, is similarly slow, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690292/foundation-apple-tv-plus-review"&gt;but at least it’s pretty to look at&lt;/a&gt;.) Here the pacing feels like it's stopping this invasion dead in its tracks. It's great meeting the characters and having a strong sense of their lives before aliens blow it up, but I am also here to see actual aliens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pOc8VT"&gt;It’s entirely plausible that things pick up soon, and the sci-fi elements are actually interesting. We still have seven episodes to go. (New episodes will release every Friday, like most series on Apple.) But early on, &lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt; demands far too much of viewers, expecting them to stick around without giving much assurance of an eventual payoff. Please, just show me an alien already.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump’s social network has 30 days to stop breaking the rules of its software license</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Celebrity Sightings In New York City - October 18, 2021" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZCv4wpmh3dgSvNCSbBfUul4_LOg=/0x0:6679x4453/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70031810/1347355440.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Devaney/GC Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a2ICgm"&gt;The Software Freedom Conservancy (SFC) &lt;a href="https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2021/oct/21/trump-groups-violates-affero-gpl/"&gt;says former President Donald Trump’s new social network violated&lt;/a&gt; a free and open-source software licensing agreement by ripping off decentralized social network Mastodon. The Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) has 30 days to comply with the terms of the license before its access is terminated — forcing it to rebuild the platform or face legal action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lqiGPQ"&gt;TMTG launched a special purpose acquisition company fundraising effort yesterday with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738240/donald-trump-truth-social-spac-dwac-stock-merger"&gt;promises to build a sweeping media empire&lt;/a&gt;. Its only product so far is a social network called Truth Social that appears strongly to be &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dgm5k/truth-social-is-mastodon-trump"&gt;forked from Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;. While anyone can freely reuse Mastodon’s code (and groups like right-wing social network Gab &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/12/20691957/mastodon-decentralized-social-network-gab-migration-fediverse-app-blocking"&gt;have already done so&lt;/a&gt;), they still have to comply with the Affero General Public License (or AGPLv3) that governs that code, and its conditions include offering their own source code to all users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V84GDP"&gt;Truth Social doesn’t comply with that license and, in fact, refers to its service as “proprietary.” Its developers apparently attempted to scrub references that would make the Mastodon connection clear — at one point &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/drewharwell/status/1451259053699653649"&gt;listing a “sighting”&lt;/a&gt; of the Mastodon logo as a bug — but included direct references to Mastodon in the site’s underlying HTML alongside obvious visual similarities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9txvSq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Truth Social must offer its source code to the pranksters who defaced it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gXH5M5"&gt;TMTG’s strategy hasn’t sat well with the SFC, an organization that enforces free and open-source software licenses. “The license purposefully treats everyone equally (even people we don’t like or agree with), but they must operate under the same rules of the copyleft licenses that apply to everyone else,” SFC policy fellow Bradley Kuhn &lt;a href="https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2021/oct/21/trump-groups-violates-affero-gpl/"&gt;wrote in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “Today, we saw the Trump Media and Technology Group ignoring those important rules — which were designed for the social good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VJPBvZ"&gt;Truth Social hasn’t officially launched. But users could access a test version of the platform, where many of them created prank accounts that &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/21/trump-truth-social-fake-accounts/"&gt;flooded the service&lt;/a&gt; with false company announcements and even fake Donald Trump posts. (The platform has since been replaced by a waitlist.) The SFC demands that TMTG offer all these users access to the Truth Social source code. “If they fail to do this within 30 days, their rights and permissions in the software are automatically and permanently terminated,” Kuhn says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5eDU1A"&gt;If Truth Social fails to make the source code available, the SFC could sue it for violating the terms of the license it used. Earlier this year, the group sued electronics maker Vizio for “repeated failures to fulfill even the basic requirements” of free software licensing. “We will be following this issue very closely and demanding that Trump’s Group give the corresponding source to all who use the site,” Kuhn writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CNIbTG"&gt;Mastodon founder Eugen Rochko also said yesterday that he intended to seek legal counsel about the situation, although he didn’t discuss a specific course of action. “Compliance with our AGPLv3 license is very important to me as that is the sole basis upon which I and other developers are willing to give away years of work for free,” &lt;a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/nice-start-trumps-truth-app-may-violate-terms-of-open-source-code-its-built-on"&gt;he told &lt;em&gt;Talking Points Memo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Home Alone is now a $250 Lego set, and it might be the most impressive fan-inspired model yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y1itW3OLcnZU31zt-alLUVVFIPs=/0x145:2560x1852/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70031487/home_alone_lego_04.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Complete with treehouse zip line and traps&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="6d3oPF"&gt;Some of the most amazing Lego sets of the past decade have been dreamt up by fans — and this week, the Danish toy brick company revealed its largest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22241339/metroid-lego-set-voting-process-ideas-nintendo"&gt;Lego Ideas&lt;/a&gt; set yet. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Flego-ideas-home-alone-21330&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F22%2F22739574%2Fhome-alone-movie-lego-set" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It’s Kevin McCallister’s iconic house from &lt;em&gt;Home Alone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s a 3,955-piece marvel filled with movie moments, hidden references, and a number of Kevin’s booby traps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tKmDN4"&gt;Kevin can slide down the stairs on his sled, land a clothes iron on Marv’s face, zipline down to his treehouse, break the shelves that release Buzz’s tarantula, drop a paint can, and more. Lego even recreated the scary basement furnace with its opening jaws, with a light-up brick so it can glow, and there’s a gear you can turn to spin the train set and turntable that Kevin disguised as people (to make it look like someone was “home”). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NPOaim"&gt;The whole build opens up like a dollhouse, including a full attic playspace you access by flipping up the roof, and each floor can lift off if you’d rather interact from the top down. As &lt;em&gt;The Brothers Brick &lt;/em&gt;point out &lt;a href="https://www.brothers-brick.com/2021/10/21/lego-ideas-21330-home-alone-house-the-largest-ideas-set-ever-is-packed-with-movie-references-review/"&gt;in their review&lt;/a&gt;, it’s got a few never-before-seen bricks, too: the door with the pet flap is new here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MuOOBY"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Flego-ideas-home-alone-21330&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F22%2F22739574%2Fhome-alone-movie-lego-set" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The set’s going on sale November 1st&lt;/a&gt; for $250, and I don’t think I’m going to be able to resist — heck, I just spent half an hour marveling at the high-res images. Here, I’ll share them with you! &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New US rules on spyware exports try to limit surveillance tech like Pegasus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WUT5MpG0EWZTg0ytLW6oUAhWusE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70031421/acastro_190204_1777_privacy_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hybpBC"&gt;The US Department of Commerce announced &lt;a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/10/21/2021-22774/information-security-controls-cybersecurity-items"&gt;a new rule&lt;/a&gt; to prevent the sale of hacking tools to China and Russia, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/commerce-department-announces-new-rule-aimed-at-stemming-sale-of-hacking-tools-to-repressive-governments/2021/10/20/ecb56428-311b-11ec-93e2-dba2c2c11851_story.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports. The Commerce Department outlined the change in a &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2021/10/commerce-tightens-export-controls-items-used-surveillance-private"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, which requires US companies to have a license in order to sell spyware and other hacking software to countries “of national security or weapons of mass destruction concern.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iZEfYx"&gt;The rule is complex and purposefully so. If a US company wants to export spyware to a government that poses a national security concern, the company would need a license. But if the software is specifically for cyber defense and not sold to anyone associated with the government, no license would be needed. As &lt;em&gt;The Post&lt;/em&gt; explains, companies will need a license to export hacking software and equipment to China, Russia, and other listed nations, whether for cyber defense or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RoUH48"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The United States is committed to working with our multilateral partners to deter the spread of certain technologies”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="laWupJ"&gt;“The United States is committed to working with our multilateral partners to deter the spread of certain technologies that can be used for malicious activities that threaten cybersecurity and human rights,” said Gina M. Raimondo, the US Secretary of Commerce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMqjnv"&gt;The rule is set to go into effect in late January and targets tools and software like Pegasus. This intrusive software, made by Israel-based company NSO Group, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/18/22582532/pegasus-nso-spyware-target-phones-journalists-activists-investigation"&gt;was used by governments to spy on smartphones belonging to journalists and human rights activists&lt;/a&gt;. It’s able to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22589942/nso-group-pegasus-project-amnesty-investigation-journalists-activists-targeted"&gt;steal data from mobile phones and even turn a device’s mic&lt;/a&gt;, all while going unnoticed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="De07kG"&gt;Although the US is a member of the &lt;a href="https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/wassenaar"&gt;Wassenaar Arrangement&lt;/a&gt;, a voluntary export control regime that sets rules on the export of dual-use technologies, it’s one of the last of the 42 participating countries to impose restrictions on the sale of hacking tools. Security officials who spoke to &lt;em&gt;The Post &lt;/em&gt;say that the US took so long to create the rule due to its complexity — if done incorrectly, having such a limitation could prevent cybersecurity specialists from collaborating with experts from other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AvNdSD"&gt;The Department of Commerce is allowing a period of 45 days for public comment and then another 45 days to make any additional changes before it officially goes into effect.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to customize your iPhone’s app icons</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OOdBcTTheQdzuU1CVztawE8DbsE=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69446002/bfarsace_201106_4269_030.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CT8iXi"&gt;Have you ever wanted to make your iPhone your own, with your individualized style and flair? Sure, you can change your home screen wallpaper. But if you really want to personalize your phone, why not create your own app icons? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D4hFLk"&gt;It’s doable, using Apple’s built-in Shortcuts app. You actually won’t be replacing the icons that the apps came with — rather, you’ll be creating separate shortcuts that lead to the app.   It’s a tedious and time-consuming process, but in the end, you can have a fully customized iPhone home screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JTqHfS"&gt;Here’s how you do it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="4A9Oyt"&gt;Before you begin, it’s a good idea to find an icon for your new shortcut. There are a bunch of icon sources online (&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.flaticon.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22529978%2Fapple-iphone-ios-apps-icon-change" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Flaticon&lt;/a&gt;, for example), or if you’re artistic and / or ambitious, you can create your own. Whether you use someone else’s or your own, save the image to Photos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4opbvA"&gt;Okay, let’s begin. Find and tap on the Shortcuts app. It’s pre-installed; if you can’t see it immediately on your home screen, swipe left until you’re at the App Library and start typing “Shortcuts” into the top search bar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dA4Adi"&gt;Once you’re in the app, tap on the “plus” sign in the upper-right corner. Type the name of your new shortcut on top, and then tap on “Add Action”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Shortcut can help you create new bookmarks for your apps" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DmTDxfYPnlWBvy5ksFZwCCeVnMA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653452/IMG_9007135DEFEF_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shortcuts can help you create new bookmarks for your apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="After you select the plus sign to start a new shortcut, tap on Add Action." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uEijEWhSAHyFqJ9T5oqG4WvJ3vY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22945508/IMG_D954C140D41F_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;After you select the plus sign to start a new shortcut, tap on Add Action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Rl4v05"&gt;There are a lot of interesting things to try out in Shortcuts. But right now, what we want to do is switch app icons. Type “Open app” in the search bar and then tap on the “Open App” link.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XCKRrg"&gt;Tap on the word “App” that appears (rather faintly) next to the word “Open.” You’ll see a list of your apps; pick the one you want to customize.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zwuizA"&gt;Now, tap the blue symbol in the upper right corner. You’ll be taken back to your shortcut page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Type “Open app” in the search bar." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gevNxwMcl4ZoUkKfC_1rXQF0M9Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22945593/IMG_4F75405CF491_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Type “Open app” in the search bar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tap “App” to select which icon to replace." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S0yQJPUJfMIHPa974FkTA-jIKOY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22945595/IMG_22637E24C8DD_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tap “App” to select which icon to replace.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="HzgHOz"&gt;Tap “Add to Home Screen.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uuIAM1"&gt;You’ll now see a preview of the icon (which will be a standard, uninteresting icon that Shortcuts automatically adds). Don’t worry — we’re going to make it better. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Name your shortcut and tap on “Add to Home Screen.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y4diHVaFAan70_wVunFyFKyt1bg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22945896/IMG_5A159D409582_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Name your shortcut and tap on “Add to Home Screen.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="At first, you get a generic icon." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rpqlPJlBKnT0wSSeVIn8cNh2Rcw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653474/IMG_5A5AAD54523D_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select “Add.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="qb7nmD"&gt;Tap on the icon under “Home Screen Name and Icon.” You’ll have the choice of either taking a photo, choosing a photo, or choosing a file. Assuming you’ve already saved an image in Photo, tap on “Choose Photo” and select the photo you want to use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="udyrhq"&gt;If you’ve chosen an existing photo, a highlighted area will indicate what part of the photo will appear as an icon; you can move the photo around until you’re happy with the section indicated. Tap “Choose” in the lower-right corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can create an icon from a new photo, a saved photo, or a file" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tVDuCP2oNtlJkjaJJkSN8j_CM7s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653487/IMG_8F28F1423B8D_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can create an icon from a new photo, a saved photo, or a file.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You’ll have to crop your photo to the right dimensions" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/02fQSnoF4bW2iUtHgdeN-rswHUo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653493/IMG_2A665EFE27F3_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll have to crop your photo to the right dimensions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="lCKV5y"&gt;Now, you’ll see your new icon. If you haven’t added a name for your new shortcut, you can still do it here by typing the name next to the icon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uK6ETB"&gt;All ready? Tap Add in the upper right corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vzDhp6"&gt;You should see your new customized icon on your home screen. Congrats!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SBacWP"&gt;There’s the possibility you may see two new icons on your home screen: one with the first boring icon and one with your wonderful new icon. If that’s the case, just press and hold the icon that you don’t want, and then select “Delete bookmark.” Remember, this (and the other you created) is a bookmark / shortcut — not the original.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Voila! Your new icon is ready" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IqDtwhDt2TrnFN05duszNvUc69w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653500/IMG_0D46D384E161_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Voila! Your new icon is ready.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can hide the original icon if you want" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2wcXApwlRvi8PzqoYVUXlCHp7iw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653502/IMG_141812774F53_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can hide the original icon if you want.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="uMQx0K"&gt;You can also hide the original app icon so you’ll just have the new one visible. (You don’t want to delete it completely, of course; that would delete the app.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4q02gy"&gt;Long-press on the original app icon and select “Edit Home Screen.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8Ppj8h"&gt;Tap on the minus sign. On the pop-up menu, tap “Remove from Home Screen.” The original icon won’t be deleted, just hidden; you can always find it in the App Library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="vs46q8"&gt;One note: when you use your new icon to go to the app, you will occasionally get a small drop-down notice that tells you what the original app is called and to remind you of the fact that it is a shortcut. But the drop-down will only last for a second or two, so it shouldn’t be much of a bother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTLWzA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 22nd, 2021, 10:30AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on Jun 13th, 2021; it has been updated to accommodate changes in iOS 15.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo delays its Advance Wars remaster to spring 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vfaJByBHZe6-i2iZXqks_VHrh9o=/54x0:1134x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70030926/screenshot03.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jX2wMK"&gt;Nintendo has delayed its upcoming remaster of the first two &lt;em&gt;Advance Wars&lt;/em&gt; games. &lt;em&gt;Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp&lt;/em&gt; had been set to release on December 3rd, but it will now be coming out sometime in spring 2022. “The game just needs a little more time for fine tuning,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1451533822022066179"&gt;Nintendo said in a tweet&lt;/a&gt; on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZRz1y"&gt;The company announced the remasters of &lt;em&gt;Advance Wars&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fftL_XeK2qU"&gt;at E3 2021&lt;/a&gt;, and Nintendo says they’re “reimagined and rebuilt from the ground up.” You can check out the board game-inspired aesthetic in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fftL_XeK2qU"&gt;the game’s debut trailer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuAZa4tjWpg"&gt;in an E3 gameplay demo&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KBNiTw"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fftL_XeK2qU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6wUYEp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advance Wars&lt;/em&gt; is one of many recent game delays. In September, EA’s &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt; was bumped nearly a month &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676330/battlefield-2042-release-date-delay"&gt;from October 22nd to November 19th&lt;/a&gt;. Last week, FromSoftware’s &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt; was pushed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22732651/from-software-elden-ring-release-date-delayed"&gt;from January 22nd to February 25th&lt;/a&gt;. And on Wednesday, CD Projekt Red said that the next-gen versions of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22736560/cd-projekt-red-delay-cyberpunk-2077-witcher-3-2022"&gt;would miss&lt;/a&gt; their targeted late 2021 release windows.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s unique Frame TV is $500 off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung Frame TV 2018" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LwCiwE71z4_xN5WXZ4ZuB0vZclw=/0x699:4194x3495/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70030818/2018_2_The_Frame_Lifestyle_Image_Assets_20.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 65-inch LCD version is $1,500 today.&lt;/em&gt; | Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rEPUfc"&gt;Samsung’s The Frame doubles as both wall art and an HDR-compatible QLED TV. The television offers a decor-friendly design while also displaying customizable images when somebody’s in the room. When turned on, however, it transforms into a smart 4K TV with Alexa built in that boasts a 120Hz refresh rate to display content smoothly. Right now, you can pick it up for its lowest price yet. For a limited time, you can buy the 65-inch 2021 model for $1,500 instead of $2,000 from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VW898FS/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0QwA2D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10819823"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vkvczZ"&gt;Samsung lovers, you’re in luck: we’ve got another great deal for you, this time on phones. Right now, Amazon is taking $280 off of Samsung’s recently released &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09HGBG94S?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt; – which supports Samsung’s stylus, the S Pen – when you buy the 256GB version bundled with an S Pen Folio Case. Normally, you’d pay $1,880 for the package, but right now, you can get it for $1,600 in the green, silver, and black colors — its best price on the site yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RLRrYQ"&gt;In our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, we called the Galaxy Z Fold 3 as good as a foldable gets, making this a great deal. We also loved that it’s water-resistant and praised how Samsung improved the 120Hz screen, its multitasking capabilities on Android, and its durability. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="igpN4c"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10820291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zbVkbs"&gt;If the Galaxy Z Fold 3 deal is a little too expensive, you may be interested in this tempting deal, which can save up to $1,000 on your carrier plan. Right now, T-Mobile is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Foffers%2Ft-mobile-pays-off-your-phone&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F22%2F22738411%2Fsamsung-the-frame-google-pixelbook-go-galaxy-z-fold-3-t-mobile-legend-of-zelda-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offering&lt;/a&gt; to pay off up to $1,000 of whatever you owe AT&amp;amp;T or Verizon starting today, October 22nd, if you switch carriers. Families can also benefit from this deal. T-Mobile will additionally pay up to $1,000 for up to five of your devices, which means a family of five can get a maximum of $5,000 to pay off their phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t515wi"&gt;To qualify for this deal, you’ll have to bring your smartphone to a T-Mobile store, as well as a photo of your last bill. If you qualify, T-Mobile will then give you a virtual prepaid MasterCard with up to $1,000 you can use to “free” yourself from your old carrier. Note, however, you need to also stick with T-Mobile for over 90 days to get the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oh23EM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10820342"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="ulRnqA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best phone plans in 2021 (and how to pick one)","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22606623/best-cell-phone-plans-verizon-att-t-mobile"},{"title":"Cellphone plan fine print, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360228/unlimited-plan-verizon-att-t-mobile-premium-data-tethering-limits"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Xgbmmi"&gt;Google’s least expensive Pixelbook Go is even cheaper today. Right now, you can purchase the Intel i7 processor-powered model with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YMM3R39?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB of storage and 16GB of RAM for $1,302 instead of $1,400.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WD9Isv"&gt;If you’re a fan of Chromebooks made by Google, the latest Google Pixelbook Go &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931476/google-pixelbook-go-review-the-price-of-simplicity"&gt;offers&lt;/a&gt; good value for its price, making this an even better deal. It has a great backlit keyboard, a simple, elegant design, and weighs relatively little — at 2.3 pounds, you can carry it around easily. The Chromebook also sports a 13-inch touchscreen display, as well as an excellent 12-hour battery life, with two USB-C ports and a 3.5mm port as well. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931476/google-pixelbook-go-review-the-price-of-simplicity"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nest Cam (indoor) review: Google’s pretty little camera takes one step forward and three steps back </title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;It might look good, but it doesn’t perform well&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="CUFCsf"&gt;Indoor cameras are an awkward category. It’s hard to find a way to fit one into your home without feeling like Big Brother is watching you. My family hates having them in the house and only grudgingly lets me set them up to test as long as I take them down as soon as possible. Despite my assurances that the devices are set to not record when we’re home — they just don’t quite believe me. And they’re not alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="79yVHk"&gt;Making a camera prettier so it blends in better with your home — as is the case with Google’s newest $100 Nest Cam (indoor) — may feel like a step in the right direction, but it really isn’t. In the end, it’s still a big black eye staring at you — no matter how attractive its exterior casing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hYtKi4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10820719"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fswtfV"&gt;If you’re going to have an indoor camera, you need a really good reason. Security — while a valid reason for some — can be just as easily achieved with a well-placed outdoor camera (and be much less likely to catch you in your knickers by accident). Safety — checking to see if you left the stove on or looking in on the living room when your smart smoke alarm goes off is fine in theory — but, in reality, requires a camera in every nook and cranny where something could conceivably go wrong (which is the theory behind Ring’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22692048/ring-always-home-cam-drone-amazon-price-release-date-specs"&gt;Always Home Cam&lt;/a&gt;). Ultimately, the most popular reason to use indoor cameras is to check in on pets and kids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nxO82c"&gt;As a pet / child cam, the Nest Cam — which is part of &lt;a href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Blog/Message-from-our-GM-Updates-for-our-Nest-customers/ba-p/17122"&gt;Google’s new lineup of security cameras that includes&lt;/a&gt; a doorbell, an indoor / outdoor camera, and a floodlight cameras —  does a nice job. Its best feature is its on-device processing that delivers snappy (and free) smart alerts to tell you whether it’s a cat or your child that just snuck into the kitchen before dinner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="obbTRG"&gt;With three hours of free event playback, you can see what went on without having to pay a monthly subscription fee (as long as you catch the alert within that three-hour window), and thanks to some local storage, the camera can record an hour’s worth of events if the internet goes down. If you spring for Google’s Nest Aware plan (starting at $6 a month), you can add the excellent Familiar Faces feature (which will tell you &lt;em&gt;which&lt;/em&gt; child snuck into the kitchen — but sadly not which cat) and enable 24/7 recording (a handy feature if you want to see what your dog did all day or “film” a party or event at your home).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OtFgeY"&gt;Unfortunately, the Nest Cam is not as good at either of these things as Nest’s previous camera — the $299 Nest Cam IQ Indoor. It had the option of sound alerts to detect a dog barking and people talking and could record a timelapse — which was a fun use of 24/7 recording. Granted, it was $200 more expensive and quite large and bulky in comparison to the diminutive newer model, but I’m not usually a fan of making smart home devices dumber or less capable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZfsjzO"&gt;Perhaps Google thinks the fancy 4K sensor-powered Nest Cam IQ with a built-in Google Assistant was overkill for the average person, and maybe it was. But that doesn’t explain why the newer Nest Cam with its 1080p, 2-megapixel camera has significantly worse video quality than the older version, beyond just lower resolution. Google said it ditched the 4K sensors to help preserve bandwidth (its wired cameras are notorious data hogs), but based on my testing, competitors’ cameras that cost under $50 have better video quality than this camera. They don’t look as pretty, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KcRegQmi82OGdWQTPWAeNGIUVsY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22946134/1D84FD79_B8C7_4664_B453_9C26AA1DD7D1.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nest Cam struggled with contrast and definition in indoor lighting situations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3H0uatox2yLSuQvlnHHcKEtCl9k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22946137/B8D02405_CCDE_44D5_A864_9D54EF84C214.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The $36 Wyze cam with similar specs as the Nest Cam captured much clearer footage, as you can see in this screenshot taken at the same time in the same location as the Nest Cam.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T3JwK1"&gt;In my testing, I compared the Nest Cam side-by-side with a $36 Wyze Cam V3, and the Wyze Cam produced much better quality images. The images from the Nest Cam were over-saturated, dark, and regularly had a lot of artefacting. They also looked like I was viewing my home through rose-tinted glasses. I tested two units because Google said it has identified an issue with some cameras where the auto-white balance is out of whack, causing the rosy tint. But both cameras I tested had the same issue. Google says it’s rolling out a fix next month, and I’ll re-test and update this review if I see any changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vYDaUd"&gt;I also did a comparison with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22710545/nest-doorbell-battery-cam-battery-test-review-price-specs-features"&gt;the Nest Cam battery&lt;/a&gt;, which is Google’s new indoor / outdoor camera that has the option of being wired. It didn’t struggle as much with the contrast as the wired version, but its indoor images were not as crisp and clear as those it captured outdoors.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t7j4YXRd6wV_wI_mSEcfQo0ZMMI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22946144/3405C8C4_A7AC_4902_BAAE_89C8549CB06F.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nest Cam cast a very rosy glow over my house (which is not pink in real life). &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0ibudBKMJQq17AH-jlLpsAhmPVY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22946160/6719EAD3_08AB_4F13_8DDC_A5AB1FB4DBDF.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This image taken at the same time but from a wall-mounted Nest Cam IQ, provides a more accurate representation of my kitchen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1O5RAt"&gt;Night vision on the Nest Cam was more successful — and definitely not rose-tinted. The standard black and white video captures up to 15 feet at night, which is more than you’d need in most home environments. The 6x digital zoom (a step down from the Nest Cam IQ’s 12x) gave me enough pixels to zoom in on faces and make them out clearly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6Gol6"&gt;Of course, video quality isn’t &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; when it comes to a smart home security camera. It’s no good having top-quality video if you can’t access it quickly on a useable app. Design and build are also factors, as are privacy features, audio quality, and smart home integrations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e6cfGtMGGC_DwtidEhsFbAE3IBY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22928575/jtuohy_211012_4809_vrt.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nest Cam can be mounted to a ceiling or wall using screws.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DxMNfz"&gt;The Nest Cam has a nice design and the unique option of four color choices — white, grey, blue, and pink. It’s also surprisingly small — the base is almost as big as the camera, and the two together top out at just under four inches. A maple wood base on the pink camera is a nice decor touch, but I didn’t like the limited amount of flexibility the camera had on the mount (which it’s fixed, too). While you can mount it on the wall, as well as sit flat on a table or shelf, it only tilts up and down a few degrees, making it tricky to position perfectly in some situations. You can move it side to side almost a complete 360 degrees, but the fixed cord will stop you from going all the way around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5OxNIa"&gt;When the camera is recording, a small LED on the camera glows green, and this can’t be disabled. If someone is viewing the live stream, the LED flashes. This is a good privacy feature — although not enough to assuage the fears of my family. Ultimately, a physical hardware shutter is the only thing that will make most people feel comfortable, and I’m surprised Google didn’t offer this option.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DHHr9KwJv_bHOMHgs3cTYsXdXmE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22928574/jtuohy_211012_4809_6.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nest Cam is only slightly taller than a travel sized bottle of hand sanitizer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IYXR4t"&gt;The Nest Cam has full-duplex two-way audio, which worked well in my testing. I could carry on a conversation as if it were a telephone call — even talking over each other and still being able to hear. That experience is much better than a lot of indoor security cameras where the interaction is more like a walkie-talkie, and lag time can be really frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JEa9BK"&gt;The Nest Cam is also fast at sending alerts. Notifications for motion, animals, people, and vehicles (there’s not a lot of traffic in my living room, to be fair) arrived on my iPhone 13 just 1 to 3 seconds after the action. This would give me plenty of time to react — however, the Google Home app takes up to 10 seconds to pull up the footage. For just quickly viewing footage, the Nest Hub smart displays are faster than the app, pulling up a feed within a couple seconds, but you can’t interact with the feed or talk to someone through the Hub. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MFswPp"&gt;This brings me to my other issue with the Nest Cam: the Google Home app. You have to use it with this camera; it won’t work with the Nest app. I have used and loved the Nest app for years, and its ability to quickly scroll through footage and recorded events all on one page is something I really miss here. With the Home app, you have to tap into two or three different screens to see clips, live footage, or a timeline, and the timeline scroll is very slow (&lt;a href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Blog/Message-from-our-GM-Updates-for-our-Nest-customers/ba-p/17122"&gt;Google has said it’s fixing this&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dGG8ST"&gt;While the accuracy of alerts in the newer Nest Cams is far superior to the older ones — which would routinely ping me 35 times in the middle of the night because a spider was building its web on the camera — digging in the Settings section of the Google Home app to figure out how to set up an activity zone is almost as tiresome. But Google has clearly indicated that it plans to migrate everything from the Nest app, so we’ll all have to struggle on in the Home app. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/23Z0R5glzw8QCf2o8XAeauKTFvc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22928553/jtuohy_211012_4809_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nest Cam uses an attached 10 foot USB-A power cable, which can plug into the included power brick.  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MTyDQe"&gt;There is simply too much going on in the Home app to make using it as a security camera hub a pleasant experience. And while the camera interface has some nice touches (like seeing a live feed of all your cameras when you open it), it’s too fiddly and requires too many taps and clicks and scrolls to get to the footage you want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OElNUE"&gt;It’s also missing some features from the Nest app, including scheduling your cameras to come on and off at certain times. Instead, there’s a Routine that will control them based on your location, but that’s not helpful if you want them on at night while you are sleeping. There is an option to only get notified when the camera is on and no one is home, which helps a bit, but scheduling doesn’t feel like a big ask. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="WCT15R"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10820840"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5x1dCH"&gt;You also can’t use Google’s Nest cameras in any ecosystem other than Google Home. The old Nest cameras worked with Amazon Alexa and, more recently, SmartThings, but these are Google only. If you are running a Google smart home, that won’t be an issue — these cameras integrate nicely with any other Google-compatible device. Except for in one odd way — you can’t view your camera feed on a Chromecast-enabled TV. Google says it’s working on adding the feature, as well as a web interface, which was a feature of Nest cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RvWnMy"&gt;While I do appreciate Google’s efforts to make smart home devices more suited to our home, and the local processing is an excellent step forward, I don’t like seeing devices lose functionality. Google still has a lot of work to do with the Nest Cam, and that’s a shame because Nest’s indoor cameras were the industry gold standard. Now, in far too many respects, they’re playing catch up.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It’s party time, smash the EXTRA BASS button</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VwooU4nfKbDtpiBDo9qXUxzT59g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70030660/akrales_210916_4737_0043.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LpIFK6"&gt;The button is simple, almost plain. A flat black circle, simple dye-sublimated letters, and a small LED pinprick to let you know that it’s on. “EXTRA BASS,” it declares in tall, bold capitals. For indeed, the EXTRA BASS button only does one blindingly obvious thing: it adds &lt;em&gt;extra bass.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1OROMT"&gt;The speaker in question here is a &lt;a href="https://www.sony.com/electronics/hi-fi-systems/gtk-xb90/buy/gtkxb90"&gt;Sony XB90 Extra Bass High Power Audio System&lt;/a&gt;. It is a product without pretension, without guile or duplicity. It has Extra Bass in the name, and the eponymous button is a microcosm of the device, a thing that encapsulates the form and function in a neat, tidy shorthand.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JkUvY9AAvPpawwFnSQvZEN6xl_k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869930/akrales_210916_4737_0037.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MPGRqM"&gt;This is not a speaker for listening to soft sonatas of Mozart or enjoying the sonic subtleties of a rare acoustic studio recording. It is a party speaker, with emphasis on the “party,” and if you don’t happen to have a party handy, it will happily create one in seconds with thudding, ear-rattling sound. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3xRSlb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It is a party speaker, with emphasis on the “party”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NCMMcB"&gt;The Sony XB90 Extra Bass High Power Audio System is the size of a beer cooler and is destined to sit alongside one — its intended resting place a dingy basement of a college apartment, a backyard pool party, or a raucous tailgate. (Sony, in fact, sells a different model &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/1/8/18173383/sony-gtk-pg10-beer-holding-karaoke-party-speaker-hands-on-ces-2019"&gt;with cupholders built in&lt;/a&gt;.) It is liberally festooned with LED lights and offers a variety of useful input methods (including Bluetooth, an aux cable, and a USB-A port for charging and playing music from a newer phone that might not have a headphone jack). You can daisy chain more of the 26-pound speakers together, too, should you own more than one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L5qGZ6"&gt;The EXTRA BASS button is the natural culmination of the XB7. “Parties are good,” the XB7 practically says merely by existing. “Loud, thumping bass makes parties better. But what if the bass was… EXTRA BASS?”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uS8wuzPpD3LmDhuMCw8q3RU9NWk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869929/akrales_210916_4737_0030.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9mtVts"&gt;Pressing the EXTRA BASS button doesn’t, at first, translate the impact of what you’re doing. The button itself is ordinary looking, the mechanical click is the same as any other button on the XB7. But its impact can be felt (literally, depending on the track and how high you’ve cranked the volume) almost immediately. The EXTRA does exactly what it promises: it boosts up the bass to almost comically distorted levels, ensuring that whatever you’re listening to will be given the deep, body-rattling sound it deserves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CTJVZK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“What if the bass was… EXTRA BASS?” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AG5LRn"&gt;The almost pedestrian nature of the EXTRA BASS button is its biggest flaw. Other party speakers, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/8/2/12353122/philips-nitro-speakers-headphones-synesthesia-LED-light"&gt;regrettably discontinued Philips Nitro Speaker&lt;/a&gt;, gives the bass-boosting button the visual splendor it deserves: a glowing red, caution-tape-ringed “NX BASS” button that gives the impression that pressing may also inadvertently launch a missile in addition to making sure that partygoers feel the bass line of Daft Punk’s “Around the World” vibrating in their bones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V402iJ"&gt;The EXTRA BASS button dreams to imagine a world that can be more. What if the party never had to end? What if the night &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; go on forever? What if the bass was just a little bit more &lt;em&gt;extra?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gEBjD7"&gt;On any other product, an EXTRA BASS button would be a ridiculous thing to exist. But in the Natty-Light soaked world of the XB90, the EXTRA BASS button turns not just logical but almost necessary — and when faced with a tool designed and implemented with such bespoke perfection for the task it’s meant for, it’s hard not to appreciate the beauty of it. &lt;/p&gt;
