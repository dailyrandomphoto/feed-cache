    <title>Uber will now let drivers and riders record audio during trips for safety</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6KxwQH5YdEU-oKqEWHRLm6hNjp0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70235227/acastro_180927_1777_uber_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UCrpXZ"&gt;Uber is releasing its audio-recording feature to three US cities later this month, Uber said &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uber.com%2Fnewsroom%2Falways-looking-out%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F6%2F22814616%2Fuber-new-safety-features-ridecheck-audio-recording" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in its press release&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lKEnwK"&gt;At the beginning of a trip, riders and drivers can enable this feature by clicking the shield icon in the app’s Safety Toolkit and selecting “Record Audio.” While both riders and drivers can record individual trips, drivers have the option to leave the feature on while they’re actively seeking rides. The app will notify the rider if the driver is using the feature. Uber first launched audio recording in Latin America in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FQz3kf"&gt;The move is the first in-app feature that provides audio documentation of rides. Uber &lt;a href="https://help.uber.com/driving-and-delivering/article/can-i-use-a-video-camera-?nodeId=efaad152-cbb6-45fe-9d7d-911842d21c8b"&gt;allows drivers&lt;/a&gt; to use their own dashcams to record rides on their own if local laws permit it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7OXeF"&gt;As for audio file privacy, the file is encrypted and stored on rider and driver’s devices, but no one can listen to the audio, even Uber. If either the rider or driver decides to submit a safety report, they can attach the audio file, and a trained Uber safety agent will decrypt and review the recording. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="19OZQs"&gt;Along with audio recording, Uber is releasing audible seat belt alerts soon, according to the press release. The seat belt alert will come from the driver’s phone, and the rider will receive a push notification reminding them to put on their seat belt. Uber said that this feature will be available in the US in early 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gAM2Ar"&gt;The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration — or NHTSA — &lt;a href="https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/813072"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that in 2020, the national seat belt use rate was 90.3 percent. NHTSA also &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/seat-belts"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that of the 22,415 passenger vehicle occupants killed in 2019, 47 percent were not wearing seat belts. NHTSA said they found no significant changes in seat belt use from 2019 to 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wRyaWC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;of the 22,415 passenger vehicle occupants killed in 2019, 47 percent were not wearing seat belts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NSvLDT"&gt;Uber also announced enhancements for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20868466/uber-ridecheck-detect-vehicle-crashes-smartphone-driver-gps"&gt;its RideCheck feature&lt;/a&gt;, first launched in 2019 to detect accidents and unusual long stops. Now, RideCheck can now detect when Uber drivers take an unexpected route or when a trip ends abruptly before the final destination. If detected, riders and drivers will receive a notification to make sure everything is safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AvqZMF"&gt;Uber first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20997939/uber-safety-report-2018-sexual-assault-ride-hailing-platform-stats"&gt;published a safety report&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 looking at data between 2017 and 2018 following increased complaints from occupants regarding its safety practices. Ultimately, these observations included the safety of drivers who have also complained to the company about rider behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G81n1M"&gt;Uber has been steadily releasing new safety features in response to both riders and drivers experiencing unsafe conditions during their trips, including allegations of sexual assault. In March, Uber, along with its competitor Lyft, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325675/uber-lyft-driver-deactivate-assault-murder-share-safety"&gt;announced that it would share&lt;/a&gt; information about drivers who were deactivated for committing serious offenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="05XEA5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This AI art app is a glimpse at the future of synthetic media</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qrUQnMvQG3cr_3Rk2WnA3dHgzbc=/167x0:3047x1920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70235161/dream_wombo_ai_art_examples.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A few example images generated by the Dream app. You can see the prompts used at the bottom of the picture. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fnubep"&gt;If you’ve been hanging out on Twitter lately, then you’ve probably noticed a profusion of AI-generated images sprouting all over your timeline like weird, algorithmic visions. These pictures have been generated using a &lt;a href="https://app.wombo.art/"&gt;new app called Dream&lt;/a&gt;, which lets anyone create “AI-powered paintings” by simply typing a brief description of what they want to see. It’s odd, often uncanny stuff — and extremely fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qTlMjq"&gt;The resulting artwork has its own particular aesthetic, defined by swirling shapes and incoherent objects. The real magic, though, is that no matter what you type, the app will generate something that is visually compelling (at least until we get too used to these toys) and that matches your prompt in often surprisingly apposite ways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WYB12h"&gt;Consider, for example, the image below: “Galactic Archaeology With Metal-Poor Stars.” Not only has the app created a picture that captures the mind-boggling galactic scale of a nebula, but the star-like highlights dotted around the space are mostly blue — a tint that is &lt;a href="https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/20219/relationship-between-metallicity-and-color-should-pop-i-stars-be-blue"&gt;scientifically accurate&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;metal-poor&lt;/em&gt; stars (as metallicity affects their color). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2xkb9"&gt;A few &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wombo.art%2F&amp;amp;src=typed_query"&gt;quick&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=wombo%20dream&amp;amp;src=typed_query&amp;amp;f=top"&gt;searches&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter reveal plenty more examples, but really, you should have a play with the app yourself to understand it better. (If nothing else, the images it generates are exactly the right size to create a personalized wallpaper for your phone.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="E6Wscw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;“Galactic Archaeology With Metal-Poor Stars” &lt;a href="https://t.co/0z2R1IQgbL"&gt;https://t.co/0z2R1IQgbL&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/CXmFEDwc8F"&gt;pic.twitter.com/CXmFEDwc8F&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dr. Kaitlin Rasmussen (@toomanyspectra) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/toomanyspectra/status/1467315733503754240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YT292B"&gt;This sort of AI-generated artwork is not new, but it is becoming higher quality and more accessible. Past examples of these sorts of text-to-image models have included research-orientated programs like &lt;a href="https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/"&gt;DALL-E &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="https://alexasteinbruck.medium.com/vqgan-clip-how-does-it-work-210a5dca5e52"&gt;VQGAN+CLIP&lt;/a&gt;, as well as more specialized commercial projects like &lt;a href="https://www.artbreeder.com/landing_page/"&gt;Artbreeder&lt;/a&gt; (which is particularly good at creating portraits of fictional beings and people). With tools such as these, the AI art scene has exploded in recent years, with practitioners creating everything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/21/21395115/roman-emperors-photorealistic-portraits-ai-artbreeder-dan-voshart"&gt;lifelike Roman emperors&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.thiswaifudoesnotexist.net/"&gt;infinite waifus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nzC649"&gt;&lt;q&gt;AI-generated art is quickly improving in both quality and accessibility&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tFuYaC"&gt;The Dream app takes things a step further with its speed, quality, and accessibility. It’s available on &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/in/app/wombo-dream/id1586366816"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.womboai.wombodream&amp;amp;utm_source=web-app&amp;amp;utm_campaign=web-app&amp;amp;pcampaignid=pcampaignidMKT-Other-global-all-co-prtnr-py-PartBadge-Mar2515-1"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://app.wombo.art/"&gt;and the web&lt;/a&gt; and is the work of a Canadian startup named Wombo. The company previously made that AI-powered app that lets you feed in static images to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22323271/wombo-ai-memes-deepfake-app-lip-sync"&gt;create lip-synced renditions&lt;/a&gt; of memeable songs. What exactly powers Dream isn’t clear (we’ve contacted Wombo to find out), but a lot of AI art tech is open-source, which means the firm has likely built on past work to create the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FkhMyf"&gt;Generally, programs like these are trained on vision datasets — huge libraries of images that are tagged based on objects and scenery. The programs pick out consistent patterns and themes in these images and then use this information to try and generate something that matches the users’ prompt. We don’t know what dataset Dream’s algorithms were trained on, but based on its output, it’s safe to say it includes a wide range of imagery — able to generate pictures that correspond to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CanalBrushRush/status/1466518885931397121"&gt;anime characters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Reecee_yt/status/1465057776560967681"&gt;video games&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dINF8M"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Found an app that is an ai attempting to make art and honestly??? This shit be popping off. I could never render these colors so vibrantly. &lt;br&gt;These were all created with the words “Knight armor” in Wombo Dream. Like??? They are gorgeous??? &lt;a href="https://t.co/mEANARv8Qm"&gt;pic.twitter.com/mEANARv8Qm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— MotherLyra (@Lyraa121) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Lyraa121/status/1462336815613067271?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n1ru1U"&gt;The accessibility of Dream means it’s being put to novel uses, too. It’s been used for viral games (like inputting your &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KaySocLearn/status/1467527596250333187"&gt;PhD thesis title&lt;/a&gt; and sharing the result) and for more directed projects as well. In one amazing Twitter thread, the writer and illustrator Ursula Vernon (who publishes under the name T. Kingfisher) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UrsulaV/status/1467652391059214337"&gt;shared a short comic&lt;/a&gt; they’d made using Dream. The comic’s characters are drawn by hand, but the backgrounds are AI-generated, with the surreal, shifting quality of the images explained as a result of the setting: a dream library overseen by the Egyptian god of writing, Thoth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftw6Lh"&gt;Vernon tweeted about her experience, noting that she had to do a not-insignificant amount of work to prepare the images and that the inability of the program to create scenery from within a space with consistent architecture created its own challenges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1usH3s"&gt;“In Conclusion—does it work visually? I think the answer is ‘sort of,’” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UrsulaV/status/1467657377809940482"&gt;tweeted Vernon&lt;/a&gt;. “I’m very aware of the weirdnesses as an artist, obviously. As a dream sequence, the messed up architecture kinda works, but how long can you get away with it? Sooner or later, the reader is probably gonna notice that nothing takes place in the same scene from a different angle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lWFY5d"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So this weekend, armed with a couple of AI art programs, I started noodling around to see what I could do, and if I could put together one of my Weird Little Comic ideas using mostly retouched computer generated imagery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These nine pages were the result. &lt;a href="https://t.co/POXoBN0Hbx"&gt;pic.twitter.com/POXoBN0Hbx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kingfisher &amp;amp; Wombat (@UrsulaV) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UrsulaV/status/1467652391059214337?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w0aIKA"&gt;Despite its obvious limitations, Dream shows us a glimpse of the future of synthetic or AI-generated media. For evangelists in this space, the promise of the technology is one of infinite variety. In the future, they say, games, comics, films, and books will all be generated on the fly in response to our every prompt and whim. And although we’re a long, &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; way from such media matching the quality of human output, limited, hybrid applications will be coming sooner than you think — appearing like something first glimpsed in a dream.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lucid Motors’ mega SPAC merger is under investigation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fe8sYrAGKQTtlzHq9-SVvkRph8E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70235159/ahawkins_210623_4646_0015.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QT5kt2"&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is investigating yet another merger between an EV startup and a special purpose acquisition company, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;SPAC&lt;/a&gt;. This time, it’s the massive deal from July that turned Saudi-owned Lucid Motors into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594177/lucid-motors-spac-nasdaq-saudi-arabia-ev-startup"&gt;a publicly traded company worth more than $20 billion&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jUBWSP"&gt;Lucid Motors announced the probe in &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1811210/000110465921146500/tm2134520d5_424b3.htm"&gt;a Monday morning stock exchange filing&lt;/a&gt;. The startup said that it received a subpoena from the SEC on December 3rd “requesting the production of certain documents related to an investigation” that “appears to concern” the merger, as well as “certain projections and statements.” Lucid Motors said it’s “cooperating fully with the SEC in its review.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="dvLUw6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10368711"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BduTOx"&gt;The startup, which was founded in 2007 as a battery tech company and rescued by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund in 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22268085/lucid-motors-spac-merger-public-nyse-cciv-deal-air-sedan"&gt;announced in February&lt;/a&gt; that it was merging with a SPAC run by investor Michael Klein called Churchill Capital IV. Lucid Motors ultimately raised more than $4 billion in the deal and started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22784017/lucid-motors-valuation-ford-spac-air-sedan-deliveries"&gt;shipping its first electric vehicle&lt;/a&gt; — the Air sedan — in October. The startup’s valuation had soared since, and it recently passed the market cap of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22784017/lucid-motors-valuation-ford-spac-air-sedan-deliveries"&gt;legacy automakers like Ford&lt;/a&gt;. But Monday’s news sent Lucid Motors’ stock tumbling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oL5jLv"&gt;The SEC is already investigating the SPAC mergers that turned Lordstown Motors, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22441025/canoo-sec-investigation-spac-merger-projections"&gt;Canoo&lt;/a&gt;, and Nikola into publicly traded electric vehicle startups. The agency has been particularly focused on the validity of the financial projections these companies made when they announced the mergers, as well as any claims they made about the preorders collected for their vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a4Qo6h"&gt;Nikola’s founder was indicted earlier this year on charges brought by the SEC (as well as parallel charges from the Department of Justice), and the company recently said it has set aside $125 million for &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/04/nikola-expects-125-million-sec-penalty-under-proposed-resolution.html"&gt;an expected settlement with the agency&lt;/a&gt;. Lordstown Motors’ CEO resigned after the company’s own investigation found he had made misleading claims about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532976/lordstown-motors-ceo-steve-burns-resign-short-seller-investigation"&gt;preorders for its electric pickup truck&lt;/a&gt;, though the SEC and DOJ are still probing the startup. Canoo said as recently as November that it continues to cooperate with the SEC in its own investigation. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ikea Nordmärke portable wireless charger details revealed by the FCC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SB3-NvcigpQ_FvfS2ecS77c3Jvw=/0x0:1619x1079/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70235102/ikea3.001.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;FCC filing of the new IKEA Nordmärke portable qi wireless power bank | Image: FCC&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MCJz2L"&gt;Ikea is starting to distribute a new wireless charging puck with a built-in battery. The discovery of this Nordmärke-branded portable charger came from a reader of German tech news outlet &lt;a href="https://www.mobiflip.de/shortnews/ikea-nordmaerke-qi-laden-akku/"&gt;mobiFlip&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/ikea-nordmarke-qi-charger-leak-203043188.html"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), who purchased the product from an Ikea in Cologne for €19.99 Euros ($22.57).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jvIs6U"&gt;We couldn’t find any references to the new charger on Ikea’s website, however, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; was able to locate &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/FHO-E2108"&gt;the company’s filing with the FCC&lt;/a&gt;, where the product is listed with ID FHO-E2108.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="This is the Ikea wireless charging puck upside down and cut in half showing the electronics inside. Two yellow cylinders are visible which are the battery cells, covered in glue." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3OklXSNa1QgE4MhrfilNDbwKD9o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23066152/ikeachargerbatt.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Ikea Nordmärke wireless charger cut in half, presenting nonremovable 18650 cells.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0u4NAK"&gt;The wireless charger carries the same label as Ikea’s other Qi-enabled wireless charging pads, which come in various circular and rectangular plastic bodies finished with materials such as cork and fabric. The new charger is also outfitted in gray fabric — but comes in a square shape and enough height to accommodate the batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7qtRW4"&gt;The bottom of the charger mentions that the Li-ion battery’s capacity is 24Wh (6,500mAh) and uses a common 18650 cell. Based on the internal images, the charger contains two heavily adhered and soldered 18650 cells — rendering the batteries hardly user-replaceable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wig6di"&gt;Ikea’s new charger, much like the company’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fsearch%2Fproducts%2F%3Fq%3Dwireless%2520charging&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F6%2F22816581%2Fikea-nordmarke-portable-wireless-qi-charger-fcc" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/19/22677980/ikea-sjomarke-wireless-qi-charging-existing-furniture"&gt;wireless chargers&lt;/a&gt;, operates at a sleepy 5W rate. According to the FCC-filed &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/FHO-E2108/Users-Manual/E2108-User-Manual-Rev1-5558655"&gt;manual&lt;/a&gt; for this Nordmärke charger, the device needs a 10W USB-C power supply — but you’ll have to bring your own charging source and cable. Expect to start seeing these rolled out into Ikea stores in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Matrix Awakens is an interactive tech demo for PS5 and Xbox Series X / S</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7zOb0W7TsB_IKl2m4ojwN0g1Ti8=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70234957/Xbox_Series_S___Xbox_Series_S_2021_12_06_15_32_47.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CRcZ3y"&gt;Epic Games has created &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Awakens&lt;/em&gt;, an interactive tech demo built in Unreal Engine 5. A teaser for the interactive &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt; experience appeared today, and the tech demo will be available on PS5 and Xbox Series X / S consoles. You can pre-install the demo right now (29GB) &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/EP1464-PPSA05754_00-MATRIXUNREALDEMO"&gt;on PS5&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Fthe-matrix-awakens-an-unreal-engine-5-experience%2F9ng8rk1f3hcc&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F6%2F22820392%2Fthe-matrix-awakens-epic-games-tech-demo-unreal-engine-5" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X / S&lt;/a&gt;, and it will launch during The Game Awards on December 9th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nDHLj"&gt;Members of the original movie team, including Lana Wachowski, have worked with Epic Games to create &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Awakens&lt;/em&gt;. The Xbox store listing promises “a wild ride into the reality-bending universe of &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt; that features performances by Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="48ygme"&gt;The teaser video appears to show a digital version of Keanu Reeves and not the &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; kind. “How do we know what is real?” Reeves asks, mysteriously.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5o78Vss-KZD-gLf_5SU1Fvr8WNM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23067059/JC1uYno.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is this another digital Keanu Reeves?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IkadvX"&gt;Epic Games originally announced its Unreal Engine 5 with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/13/21256079/epic-unreal-engine-5-playstation-5-demo-next-gen-graphics-release-date"&gt;stunning PlayStation 5 tech demo last year&lt;/a&gt;. It included photo-realistic lighting, incredibly visual quality, and a level of game detail that Unreal Engine 5 promises to deliver for next-gen consoles like the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3CKZni"&gt;This &lt;em&gt;Matrix &lt;/em&gt;tech demo could be equally impressive, with the teaser claiming it will offer “a glimpse into the future of interactive storytelling and entertainment with UE5 in this free, boundary-pushing cinematic and real-time tech demo.” It arrives just ahead of &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Resurrections&lt;/em&gt; theater release on December 22nd.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DoorDash launches ‘ultra-fast’ delivery in NYC, with couriers who are actual employees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tZW2DE-pSXexPuT1uiM-gSumueY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70234913/acastro_190724_1777_doordash_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;DoorDash “fast” delivery comes to New York Cityfv | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8Cp4RR"&gt;Food delivery platform DoorDash has &lt;a href="https://ir.doordash.com/news/news-details/2021/DoorDash-Introduces-Ultra-Fast-Grocery-Delivery-Providing-Busy-Consumers-with-a-Reliable-and-Convenient-Way-to-Restock-Instantly/default.aspx"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; its “ultra-fast” DashMart delivery service in New York City because apparently delivery &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22667600/delivery-workers-seamless-uber-relay-new-york-electric-bikes-apps"&gt;couriers aren’t already frazzled enough&lt;/a&gt; and no one can possibly wait more than 15 minutes for anything (not quite &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95516647"&gt;what Andy Warhol predicted&lt;/a&gt;, but we’re way past that now). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vWBaqA"&gt;However, there is a key difference between the delivery jobs on the main DoorDash platform and positions with the new DashMart fast delivery service: DashMart workers will be part of what the company calls DashCorps, considered full- and part-time employees — instead of independent contractors — and many will be eligible for benefits. DashCorps workers will have set schedules and be paid $15 per hour, plus tips, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DivAssetPlaceHolder1"&gt;To start in NYC, the ultra-fast deliveries — which will arrive within 10 to 15 minutes of order times — will come from a DashMart location in Chelsea that’s open from 7AM to 2AM daily, with more locations to follow soon. The Chelsea DashMart has more than 2,000 items including fresh and frozen foods, household goods, and local products, the company says. Customers can order via the DoorDash app or website; those who have its DashPass membership won’t be charged delivery fees. DoorDash will donate excess DashMart produce to a local community food bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kdCJlU"&gt;“Achieving ultra-fast delivery times inherently requires more structure and organization to ensure orders are fulfilled quickly and merchant and customer expectations are met,” the company’s director of new verticals Andrew Ladd &lt;a href="https://doordash.news/2021/12/06/introducing-ultra-fast-deliveries-with-doordash/"&gt;explained in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. DashCorps workers will use a different app than workers for the standard DoorDash platform, wear uniforms, and in addition to deliveries, will perform other tasks including stocking shelves, customer support, and administrative work. The roles are “fundamentally different from dashing,” Ladd added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="QZlF62"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Revolt of the delivery workers","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22667600/delivery-workers-seamless-uber-relay-new-york-electric-bikes-apps"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="cF3JbK"&gt;DoorDash first &lt;a href="https://blog.doordash.com/introducing-dashmart-1891ecc0257d"&gt;announced the launch&lt;/a&gt; of its DashMart stores in eight cities in August 2020. Unlike the Chelsea location, the first DashMarts didn’t have brick-and-mortar locations, functioning kind of like ghost kitchens for convenience stores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="23IllV"&gt;Why would someone want to continue working for the main DoorDash platform when the seemingly more attractive DashCorps jobs are available? Ladd writes that the “binary choice between working as an employee or an independent contractor” is “outdated and doesn’t reflect the needs of the modern workforce.” Its independent contractor “Dashers” prefer the flexibility over their schedules that DoorDash offers, the company claims, and “we’re steadfastly committed to protecting and strengthening this independent workforce.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FA7iTA"&gt;The benefits for those DashCorps workers who are eligible would include those that “traditionally come with employment,” including medical, dental, vision, flexible spending accounts, and commuter benefits, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gAitFw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Xbox Windows app will let you know if games play well on your PC before you download them</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qOC99JyvdYjl3fRkORcIM1QD7lI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70234866/acastro_190530_1777_xbox_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DwRcqz"&gt;Microsoft is adding a simple label to its Xbox app for Windows, letting PC gamers know if a title runs well on their machine before they go ahead and download it. The feature is currently in testing and limited to certain games before it rolls out to all Xbox app users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aLMSj5"&gt;While system requirements have always been listed in the Xbox app, this simple label should make it easier for PC owners to figure out if a game can run on their system. Microsoft is running a performance check against a variety of PC games to build this label.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XxSy3sPOoZ4O-A-JqkF01Y-ttVU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23066897/qMewYBb.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new label in the Xbox app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1RkvPc"&gt;There are a number of games that don’t have the label yet and simply show “performance check not available yet,” which suggests the Xbox app doesn’t just simply check your PC system requirements. It appears Microsoft is building its own database of how well PC games run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1kpJpk"&gt;Microsoft hasn’t officially detailed this new performance check yet, so it’s not clear if the label is based on the minimum specifications for a game, the recommended ones, or other system information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8psSXU"&gt;If the ratings are reliable, it could be an easy alternative to using third-party tools and websites like &lt;a href="https://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri"&gt;Can You Run It&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re interested in trying out this new label or even the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791013/microsoft-xbox-app-windows-install-folders"&gt;ability to install PC games more freely&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft is allowing everyone to test this new version of the Xbox app. All you need to do is download the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fxbox-insider-hub%2F9pldpg46g47z" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Insider app&lt;/a&gt; and opt into the Windows gaming preview.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp now lets you set all chats to disappear by default  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5JVDz9wDJ7KBUiebHjbb2bQ0o7A=/0x0:3491x2327/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70234600/DisappearingMessagesComms_Web_Website_Static_en.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new features in action.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: WhatsApp&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GHLbm7"&gt;WhatsApp is adding new functionality to its &lt;a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/chats/about-disappearing-messages/?lang=en"&gt;disappearing messages feature&lt;/a&gt;, which lets users set messages in a chat to automatically be deleted after a set period of time. WhatsApp says users will now have the option to turn on disappearing messages automatically for &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;their new one-on-one chats, so that all future messages will be automatically deleted from the service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B5J9XD"&gt;The Meta-owned messaging service also says it’s giving users more options for how long before a message is deleted. When the feature first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21550634/whatsapp-disappearing-messages-feature"&gt;launched in November last year&lt;/a&gt;, users only had the option of having messages disappear after seven days. Going forward, however, there will also be the option of deleting them after just 24 hours or 90 days. The new functionality was previously reported as being in development &lt;a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-21-17-16-whats-new/"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="guFbsO"&gt;
&lt;div class="iframely-embed" style="max-width: 640px;"&gt;&lt;div class="iframely-responsive" style="padding-bottom: 188.8889%;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10114134070256701" data-iframely-url="https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fplugins%2Fpost.php%3Fhref%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.facebook.com%252Fzuck%252Fposts%252F10114134070256701&amp;amp;key=9ef4a209439e42bc59783ba959d50197"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://cdn.iframe.ly/embed.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2dMbk0"&gt;WhatsApp notes that turning on disappearing messages by default won’t affect existing chats. When you start a new one-on-one chat, a notice will appear to say that the disappearing messages feature is turned on, alongside a note that says it’s on by default (so your contacts don’t think it’s anything personal). You also have the option of turning the setting off for individual chats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VcnyqR"&gt;Although the new default setting doesn’t affect group chats, WhatsApp says it’s added a new option when creating groups to let you enable the disappearing messages feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xY8FLD"&gt;WhatsApp says the new features are available now across all platforms. Instructions for how to use them3m4 can be found in &lt;a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/chats/about-disappearing-messages"&gt;WhatsApp’s FAQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Theranos is gone, but ads for shady tests aren’t</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/psdUmh6jGzKCut-AzJ9ZxaWLdJw=/0x0:1800x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70234636/czapatka_180518_1777_blood_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Theranos claimed it could run hundreds of tests on a single drop of blood.  | Photo by Cory Zapatka / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Companies can market tests that don’t have FDA approval&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="YsyWO6"&gt;The advertisement was slick and emotionally compelling: real patients, lined up to share how blood testing was a stressful and draining experience, are told about a new test that only needs one single drop of blood. They’re grateful, almost overwhelmed. Then, there’s a tiny vial, accompanied by the phrase “the tiny blood test,” before the Theranos logo &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F185518071%3Futm_campaign%3D5370367%26utm_source%3Daffiliate%26utm_channel%3Daffiliate%26cjevent%3D7395e650426311ec81ce17cb0a82b836%26clickid%3D7395e650426311ec81ce17cb0a82b836&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22816112%2Ftheranos-lab-developed-test-fda-regulation-everlywell" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;appears on-screen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eaijex"&gt;The question of whether Theranos ads were misleading, and whether ads like that one were &lt;a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2018/06/07/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-experimented-arizonans-bad-blood-book/675541002/"&gt;put on television&lt;/a&gt; even though Elizabeth Holmes &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; they were misleading, is part of &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/us-v-elizabeth-holmes-et-al"&gt;the case against Holmes&lt;/a&gt;, who’s on trial in San Jose, California for 11 counts of wire fraud. But the advertisement’s existence raises a bigger question about how the federal government and Food and Drug Administration regulate medical tests: why was Theranos able to advertise its tests — which weren’t FDA approved — at all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PwYti0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;why was Theranos able to advertise its tests — which weren’t FDA approved — at all?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lLbCKQ"&gt;Answering that question requires diving into byzantine FDA rules and regulations around medical testing, as well as how, exactly, the agency applies them. Theranos’ tests fell into a category called “lab-developed tests” for which FDA oversight is limited. If a test is designed by and used in a single lab, that lab is allowed to sell and advertise the test without the FDA’s sign-off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GiBBLI"&gt;The agency hadn’t changed its approach to lab-developed tests much before Theranos, even as technology advanced and these tests started to be marketed directly to consumers. It hasn’t made changes since Theranos flamed out, even though — as testimony throughout the Holmes trial highlighted — bad tests can put patients at risk, both physically and psychologically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZatHBT"&gt;Take Everlywell, which sells at-home test kits for things like sexually transmitted diseases and cholesterol — apart from its COVID-19 product, it’s tests are &lt;a href="https://support.everlywell.com/article/58-how-does-everlywell-validate-the-reliability-credibility-of-your-labs"&gt;not FDA-approved&lt;/a&gt;. All told, companies marketing lab-developed tests are claiming to be able to diagnose dozens of conditions affecting millions of people. But the tests behind these claims are subject to far less scrutiny than tests that have gone through an FDA &lt;a href="https://www.testing.com/articles/commercial-tests-fda-approval/"&gt;review process&lt;/a&gt; — which at minimum requires registering with the agency and, for many tests, involves a detailed analysis on the tests’ performance. The minutiae of how and why those are different, though, isn’t easily apparent to anyone who isn’t an expert in medical testing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="re1I9Z"&gt;“I don’t think most people understand the difference” between lab-developed tests and FDA-approved ones, says Ana Rutschman, an assistant professor in the Center for Health Law Studies at Saint Louis University School of Law. It’s not realistic to expect them to, she says. But understanding the difference is the only way to know what you’re getting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="1qH5nY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A broad category&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="TWpOC1"&gt;There’s a good reason lab-developed tests exist: they give labs the ability to develop and sell their own tests, which is important when there’s a gap in the types of FDA-approved tests offered or during an emergency. Early on in the COVID-19 pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-issues-new-policy-help-expedite-availability-diagnostics"&gt;one roadblock&lt;/a&gt; in the rollout of virus testing was that the public health emergency meant labs were not allowed to deploy their own in-house tests for the coronavirus — everything had to get FDA authorization, which slowed the process. As that authorization process later illustrated, many lab-developed tests, even ones developed quickly, are very reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="F0lB3q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the category itself is very broad&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aCEqm4"&gt;But other lab-developed tests might not be as reliable. Part of the challenge in evaluating these tests is that the category itself is very broad, says David Grenache, former president of the American Association for Clinical Chemistry. An FDA-approved test would become “lab-developed” — no longer qualifying as FDA-approved — if a lab makes any changes to the protocol under which the FDA approved it. For example, if a test was approved using saliva samples collected at an urgent care clinic, and that same test was run using a saliva sample collected at home, it could be considered lab-developed. “They’ve altered the packaging, or the way the test is supposed to be performed, so now we’re going to call it lab-developed,” Grenache says. Theranos took that route for some of its tests, which it ran on &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/23/technology/elizabeth-holmes-testimony.html"&gt;modified equipment&lt;/a&gt; from testing company Siemens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OUya6N"&gt;But lab-developed tests can &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; include brand-new tests that aren’t just slight modifications to FDA-approved products — like, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/science/2015/11/11/9706356/fda-theranos-health-diagnostics-cancer-tests-regulation-loophole-ldt"&gt;genetic tests that claim to detect cancers&lt;/a&gt;. And just like a simple test tweaked to work off an at-home saliva sample, a test claiming to flag genes that could cause cancer growth could advertise to the general public without any input from the FDA at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g7cv52"&gt;The FDA is still responsible for overseeing lab-developed tests, and the agency can (and should) step in if a test is harmful. It has sent warning letters to companies like &lt;a href="https://www.natlawreview.com/article/fda-issues-warning-letter-to-lab-marketing-three-laboratory-developed-tests"&gt;Inova Genomics&lt;/a&gt;, which was promoting a test it said could predict how people would react to certain medications. The agency wrote that the tests didn’t have valid data backing them and “pose significant public health concerns.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wyGv7S"&gt;That intervention came &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the tests were already being sold to patients. The FDA doesn’t regularly check in on the tests done by labs, and only steps in if there’s a complaint or if someone brings a problem to its attention. “There aren’t really FDA police,” says Catherine Klapperich, director of the Laboratory for Diagnostics and Global Healthcare Technologies at Boston University. “That’s how Theranos was able to go on, and on, and on. It’s not like there’s someone patrolling, checking in on everyone.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="eIIwHj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There aren’t really FDA police”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2z4Op"&gt;So the companies selling lab-developed tests have a lot of leeway around what they’re able to say in their marketing materials. They can’t lie about what their tests can accomplish — which is what Theranos allegedly was doing when it said it could run hundreds of tests on a single drop of blood. But they’re free to say that a test was proven to work (even if that statement was only based on a very small study) or that it passed muster with the FDA (even if that just means the company stuck to the FDA lab-developed test framework). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pRuhsu"&gt;“You can say, ‘I’ve followed every single piece of the regulations,’ and you might well be telling the truth. It’s just that the regulatory framework is so weak that it means virtually nothing,” Rutschman says. “But you’re free to go to a customer and say that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="z3bwdO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Trust but verify’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Vv7Oue"&gt;In part, the flexibility around lab-developed tests comes because taking a dangerous medication could do more immediate harm than inaccurate or misleading tests. (In the Holmes trial, several doctors testified they were immediately skeptical of weird Theranos results and ordered new tests.) Doctors review tests before they prescribe medications, and they might do additional screening after getting a single concerning result. “If you’ve got a really abnormal result, you’re probably following up with the physician anyway,” Geranche says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aSYI4E"&gt;But bad tests aren’t &lt;em&gt;harmless&lt;/em&gt;. They can cause stress and anxiety or give someone false reassurance that they don’t have a problem. Jurors in the Holmes trial &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-elizabeth-holmes-trial-patients-describe-alarming-test-results-11637272480"&gt;heard from patients&lt;/a&gt; who had incorrect test results from Theranos, including Erin Tompkins, whose Theranos test showed that she had an HIV antibody despite never having an HIV or AIDS diagnosis before. Brittany Gould appeared to fight back tears as she testified she’d been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22687026/theranos-patient-bad-test-miscarriage-pregnancy"&gt;wrongly told by a Theranos test&lt;/a&gt; she was miscarrying her pregnancy — which would have been her &lt;em&gt;fourth&lt;/em&gt; miscarriage in a row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OKVGvY"&gt;A test that purports to tell someone that they have serious conditions like cancer, for example, could trigger expensive treatments or drastic life changes. “That really should not be marketed to consumers,” says Mike White, a genetics professor at Washington University in St. Louis. “You should have some physician judgement involved.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="0041Ou"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s buyer beware”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="05MQqa"&gt;Because lab-developed tests receive no oversight from the FDA, patients are left to sort out for themselves how reliable the tests are. “It’s buyer beware,” Grenache says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9uaE8d"&gt;But most buyers don’t have the resources or background to suss out tests’ reliability. They may not even know that the test they’re getting is lab-developed. That’s why Rutschman thinks there should be more explicit warnings on packaging and advertisements for lab-developed tests saying that they could come with some risks — similar to warnings on tobacco packaging. “I think that if somebody’s getting one of these tests to find out whether they’ve had a miscarriage, or for a cancer screening or something like that, it could give you some pause,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sa9vEV"&gt;The Theranos advertising gave no indication that the tests the company was making hadn’t gone through the FDA approval process, and so hadn’t submitted data on their performance to the agency for review. There would have been no reason to think that there’s any difference between the oversight of its blood tests and others that were FDA approved. That’s the case with companies like Everlywell, too — its test information pages just say that the tests are run in certified labs, which most people likely wouldn’t realize is a signal those tests have a lower level of oversight. The company discloses that its tests are lab-developed tests in the &lt;a href="https://support.everlywell.com/article/58-how-does-everlywell-validate-the-reliability-credibility-of-your-labs"&gt;FAQ section&lt;/a&gt; of the website, but it doesn’t give any explanation of what that means.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="HjT02Q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;experts don’t think the option for labs to go this route should be eliminated entirely&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RkmkLs"&gt;Again, a test that’s lab-developed isn’t automatically a bad test. And experts don’t think the option for labs to go this route should be eliminated entirely — they can be useful. But the Theranos case is a clear example of how companies looking to cut corners can take advantage of the system. There isn’t much preventing them from throwing up a slick website for an in-house product that’s only been tested on 15 people. And the people who click through to that slick website may not know that they should dig deeper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Ez9p6B"&gt;“It all goes back to how much trust you’re going to have in a company that’s putting its name and reputation out there to do the right thing,” Grenache says. “I would trust but verify.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMV3Be"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PT2pC2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4VzHAl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JPWcl3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AqfpzM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="RwE26E"&gt;Security isn’t just about passwords and databases. It cuts down to the most basic questions of what we need to protect ourselves and the people we care about. So this week, we’re bringing you stories about how people protect themselves in the most extreme conditions — whether it’s Muslims navigating FBI surveillance or refugees trying to secure a working SIM card. There’s fun stuff too, like TikTok teens solving a mysterious car crash, but the overall message is clear: it’s rough out there, and you’ll need every trick you’ve got.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ofxZY4"&gt;Still, it’s not all bad news. We’ll also be showing you some of our best advice on how to navigate your online life — whether it’s recovering your hacked Facebook account or hiding your email from data brokers. This isn’t quite as glamorous as fighting off ransomware, but we’re betting you’ll find it a whole lot more useful. These aren’t the skills you’ll need when things get serious, but they’re the kind of skills you need right now.&lt;/p&gt;
