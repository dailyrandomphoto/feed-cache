    <title>MWC insists on holding potential COVID-19 superspreader event in Barcelona</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration the GSMA Mobile World Congress (..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vt7EutlzRxvzaUmZLtwa3pA947E=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68832175/1201569982.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XIe35g"&gt;The world’s largest phone show, Mobile World Congress, is moving forward with an in-person event in June, despite the risks that it could turn into a COVID-19 superspreader event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BlRJ0O"&gt;Over 100,000 people usually attend MWC. John Hoffman, the CEO of the GSM Association (which organizes the show) says those numbers will be scaled back this year. He &lt;a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/blog/blog-mwc-shanghai-to-provide-china-5g-showcase-barcelona-blueprint/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Mobile World Live&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that he’s expecting around 50,000 people will travel to Barcelona, interact with each other and locals, and then fly back home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MrxPq1"&gt;The event’s &lt;a href="https://www.mwcbarcelona.com/attend/safety-security"&gt;safety and security page says&lt;/a&gt; organizers will be “controlling crowd density” and requiring masks. Hoffman said he &lt;a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/blog/blog-mwc-shanghai-to-provide-china-5g-showcase-barcelona-blueprint/"&gt;wouldn’t expect&lt;/a&gt; everyone in attendance to be vaccinated against COVID-19. “Our view is it would be great if the world was vaccinated, but we can’t rely on that in 2021,” he told &lt;em&gt;Mobile World Live&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OfWpnX"&gt;Instead, the group is asking that everyone in attendance have a negative COVID-19 test within 72 hours of their arrival. Testing is not a sufficient way to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, particularly when tests are done that far in advance. Someone could very easily test negative, contract the virus en route to MWC, and spread the disease when they arrive. XPrize founder Peter Diamandis relied on testing to hold an &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/13/1018374/peter-diamandis-covid-superspreader-a360-conference/"&gt;in-person conference&lt;/a&gt; in California with under 100 people in January — but there was no quarantine requirement, and mask-wearing wasn’t enforced. Dozens of people tested positive for the virus afterward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MhJMhT"&gt;Big meetings and events, especially when they’re connected with international travel, can be breeding grounds for coronavirus infections. Hundreds of thousands of COVID-19 cases were tied back to a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/11/world/superspreading-boston-biotech-conference-in-february-is-linked-to-1-9-percent-of-all-us-cases.html"&gt;biotech conference in Boston&lt;/a&gt; at the start of the pandemic, for example. Holding a large event places not only the attendees at risk, but also the people who live in the region where the event takes place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YyPsGb"&gt;The GSM Association &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/5/21123846/mobile-world-congress-gsma-coronavirus-lg"&gt;fought against canceling&lt;/a&gt; its 2020 show, which was set to take place last February just as COVID-19 was emerging as a worldwide problem. It took &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/10/21131118/mwc-2020-coronavirus-intel-sony-amazon-cancel"&gt;major brands&lt;/a&gt; like LG, ZTE, Sony, and Amazon pulling out for the group to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21127754/mwc-2020-canceled-coronavirus-trade-show-phone-mobile-world-congress-gsma-statement"&gt;shut down the event&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jbCmHn"&gt;COVID-19 is still a major threat worldwide. Spain is &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/europe/spain-coronavirus-cases.html"&gt;currently averaging&lt;/a&gt; around 12,000 new cases and 400 deaths per day. While the situation may improve by June, people around the world will still be vulnerable to the disease. The vaccine rollout in Spain is slow, with only around &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/"&gt;65,000 doses&lt;/a&gt; given per day. Most of the population will still be unvaccinated come summer if that pace continues. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A new kind of Verge Live event is coming March 1st</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I6EFIwV1dIh0qOzt8gk8lw9-HgI=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68832158/VRG_VergreLive_Event.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4trFch"&gt;One of the internet’s foundational laws just turned 25 years old, and it’s never been more controversial. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act protects websites and apps from liability for user-generated content, helping to create the internet of today. But problems with online harassment and other crimes — plus mistrust of big services that benefit from the law — have led to calls for change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mi8e25"&gt;Congress has introduced several proposals to overhaul Section 230, most recently the SAFE TECH Act, a sweeping rollback of the law’s protections. These proposals would affect the entire internet, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268421/cda-section-230-25th-anniversary-reform-stakes-big-tech-internet"&gt;raising huge questions&lt;/a&gt; about the future of online communication. Yet public debate has focused on just a few companies: Facebook, Twitter, and Google, tagged collectively as “Big Tech.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="VTDAME"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10347701"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OPDMjL"&gt;On March 1st at 2PM ET, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; will host a forum on the future of Section 230. One of the sponsors of the SAFE TECH Act, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), will discuss how she’s approaching tech regulation and her agenda for the next congressional term. Then, we’ll be moderating a panel with some of the voices that Section 230 debates often ignore — including nonprofit organizations and smaller online businesses. We’ll be announcing that slate of panelists in the days to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4D6rc"&gt;Like a lot of things in 2021, we’ll be holding this event remotely, meeting over video and taking live audience questions online. It’s free, and you can &lt;a href="https://voxmediaevents.com/thevergelive/thevergearticle"&gt;register online right now&lt;/a&gt;. Hope to see you there.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google rebrands G Suite for Education to Google Workspace for Education</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_o80hoRLAQNFGvdpq8_pvdWu8Ec=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68832081/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DKMgwa"&gt;Google is announcing a swath of new features for its education-focused products today, including that G Suite for Education is being &lt;a href="https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/google-workspace-for-education"&gt;rebranded to Google Workspace for Education&lt;/a&gt;. The company first unveiled the Workspace branding for its office apps suite &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21503649/google-workspace-g-suite-gmail-chat-meet-docs"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt;, but the education-focused suite had retained the G Suite branding until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kzgs0r"&gt;Among other changes to the different tiers, the free edition of G Suite for Education is being renamed to Google Workspace for Education Fundamentals and G Suite Enterprise for Education is being renamed to Google Workspace for Education Plus. If you’re already a G Suite Enterprise for Education customer, you’ll automatically roll over to Google Workspace for Education Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qPxa67"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google is also announcing data storage policy changes for its education customers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1Cg92r"&gt;Google is also announcing data storage policy changes for its education customers. Previously, Google offered unlimited storage to qualifying institutions, but starting next year, the company will move schools toward a pooled storage model, offering a baseline of 100TB of pooled storage shared among an institution. The policy will go into effect for all existing Google Workspace for Education customers in July 2022 and will be in place for new customers that sign up in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CFY34g"&gt;There are also new features on the way for Google’s Meet videoconferencing service to &lt;a href="https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/Google-Meet-safety-and-engagement"&gt;make it better for virtual learning&lt;/a&gt;, and some of those features are coming to non-education customers as well. The new features include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="beRFB4"&gt;The ability to mute everyone on a call and end a call for everyone attending. This is rolling out soon and will come to education customers first&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="E4niCQ"&gt;Emoji reactions, which will launch by August for all Meet users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="35hClk"&gt;Meeting transcripts, which are launching for education and enterprise Meet customers later this year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="3HvF2H"&gt;In addition, Google is integrating Meet and its Google Classroom product &lt;a href="https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/classroom-roadmap"&gt;more tightly&lt;/a&gt;. Students won’t be able to join Meet calls created from Classroom before the teacher does, and Meet will be able to restrict meetings to just students and teachers in a class based on a Classroom roster. These features, and others, will launch later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YPuyf3"&gt;There are also new features in the works for Google Classroom, including support for add-ons from third-party services (available for Google Workspace for Education Plus or Teaching and Learning Upgrade customers) and offline support for the Classroom Android app.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook will block Australian users and publishers from sharing news links in response to new bill</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s8H1TJFTo6zIjS1epADmSHhtp80=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68831733/akrales_180614_1777_0080.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0RDeqE"&gt;Facebook has decided to block both Australian users and media companies from sharing links to news articles and related content on its main social network, following the country’s proposed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/19/21227263/australia-facebook-google-ad-revenue-media-coronavirus-economy"&gt;landmark regulatory measure&lt;/a&gt; that would force tech giants to pay Australian news organizations for using their content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rcX3WV"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r6652"&gt;bill&lt;/a&gt; passed the Australian House of Representatives today and is believed to have enough votes to pass the Senate, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/17/business/media/australia-google-pay-for-news.html"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. The bill also targets Google, which at one point last month &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22243468/google-threatens-to-remove-its-search-engine-from-australia-if-new-law-goes-into-effect"&gt;threatened to leave the country entirely&lt;/a&gt;. However, Google has since decided to start cutting deals with major Australian media organizations, like &lt;a href="https://newscorp.com/2021/02/17/news-corp-and-google-agree-to-global-partnership-on-news/"&gt;Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp.&lt;/a&gt;, to comply. Facebook, it appears, will not follow suit — for now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DC2f8J"&gt;“The proposed law fundamentally misunderstands the relationship between our platform and publishers who use it to share news content,” reads a &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/changes-to-sharing-and-viewing-news-on-facebook-in-australia/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; from William Easton, the managing director of Facebook Australia &amp;amp; New Zealand. “It has left us facing a stark choice: attempt to comply with a law that ignores the realities of this relationship, or stop allowing news content on our services in Australia. With a heavy heart, we are choosing the latter.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UJHhnU"&gt;The policy change from Facebook will have stark consequences for both users and media organizations. Easton’s blog post outlines four distinct categories that will be affected and in what ways: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Wc8FXj"&gt;Australian publishers: “They are restricted from sharing or posting any content on Facebook Pages. Admins will still be able to access other features from their Facebook Page, including Page insights and Creator Studio. We will continue to provide access to all other standard Facebook services, including data tools and CrowdTangle.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Hkhp2I"&gt;International publishers: “They can continue to publish news content on Facebook, but links and posts can’t be viewed or shared by Australian audiences.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mCdssv"&gt;Australian users: “They cannot view or share Australian or international news content on Facebook or content from Australian and international news Pages.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cB095A"&gt;International users: “They cannot view or share Australian news content on Facebook or content from Australian news Pages.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="qMuOuX"&gt;Facebook says it’s using a “combination of technologies” to restrict news content and it will have processes for reviewing content that was removed inadvertently, although it is not sharing those processes at this time. It also says the news content changes won’t affect any of the company’s other products or services in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Er8R0O"&gt;Easton’s blog post makes clear Facebook saw this measure as a last resort. The company cites statistics, like how news content makes up less than 4 percent of what people see in the News Feed and how Facebook drove an estimated AU$407 million in referrals to Australian news publishers, as reasons why it felt the bill unfairly penalizes tech platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Z5H1kK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The proposed law fundamentally misunderstands the relationship between our platform and publishers who use it to share news content.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fECUJC"&gt;Facebook also draws a distinction between how news publishers and readers access news content on its social network versus Google’s search engine. “Google Search is inextricably intertwined with news and publishers do not voluntarily provide their content. On the other hand, publishers willingly choose to post news on Facebook, as it allows them to sell more subscriptions, grow their audiences and increase advertising revenue,” Easton argues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yuF9M0"&gt;“We were prepared to launch Facebook News in Australia and significantly increase our investments with local publishers, however, we were only prepared to do this with the right rules in place,” Easton goes on. “This legislation sets a precedent where the government decides who enters into these news content agreements, and ultimately, how much the party that already receives value from the free service gets paid. We will now prioritise investments to other countries, as part of our plans to invest in new licensing news programs and experiences.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The podcast wars will come down to ad tech, not exclusive content</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dfsgvhQ9s3vGEfV1YTdfVxYoP5s=/0x0:3240x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68831596/adiaconis_201202_4322_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Alix Diaconis / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5g8o7h"&gt;iHeartMedia, the company behind podcasts like &lt;em&gt;Stuff You Should Know&lt;/em&gt; and hundreds of radio stations across the US, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/iheartmedia-to-acquire-triton-digital-from-scripps-11613563201"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that it’s spending $230 million to acquire a platform many people outside the audio industry have likely never heard of: Triton Digital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dDsUWF"&gt;Triton Digital specializes in audio ad technology, particularly for live radio broadcasts and podcasts. The company is able to insert ads dynamically, meaning they’re tailored to the individual listener on the fly, and create its own podcast rankings based on access to third-party podcast networks, like NPR. Essentially, iHeart can now take on an even bigger role in the audio advertising space, both in selling and programming ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jk4IQh"&gt;This news suggests ad technology will determine who ultimately cashes in on audio. We’ve already seen this point play out in other recent acquisitions. Spotify bought Megaphone, a hosting platform with a dynamic ad insertion marketplace, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21557458/spotify-megaphone-podcast-streaming-ad-insertion"&gt;in November&lt;/a&gt;, and SiriusXM acquired Midroll, an ad-serving marketplace and platform, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/13/21315911/siriusxm-stitcher-podcast-deal-buy-midroll-earwolf"&gt;in July&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UezDkT"&gt;Spotify’s made the biggest splash in audio over the past couple years with flashy acquisitions of podcasting networks and deals with big name stars, like Kim Kardashian West and the Obama family. But the exclusives route isn’t necessarily panning out. Joe Budden, one of Spotify’s original exclusive shows, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21403282/joe-budden-spotify-exclusive-leaving-host-podcast"&gt;left the network&lt;/a&gt; when his contract expired in September to instead make his show available everywhere, along with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22262497/joe-budden-podcast-network-patreon-spotify"&gt;bonus, Patreon-only content&lt;/a&gt;. Michelle Obama’s show, which was widely hyped as a major exclusive get, also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21494284/spotify-michelle-obama-podcast-release-exclusive"&gt;now has its first season available everywhere&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lrWzEY"&gt;Exclusive deals garner headlines and attention, but when it comes to succeeding in the medium to long-term, ad sales will be key. Brian Kaminsky, chief data officer and president of revenue strategies at iHeart, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; this acquisition allows the company to create the equivalent of Google Ad Manager for audio, where advertisers can be paired with all kinds of audio programming to meet their goals. For iHeart, data on shows, ad purchases, and ad programming will happen on one united backend. (Kaminsky clarifies that iHeart will still employ and rely on a sales team, not just a digital marketplace.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LEH2fU"&gt;“We will have the only complete ad technology stack for all forms of audio, so broadcast, streaming, podcasts, voice audio content experiences,” he says. “That puts iHeart in a position literally to serve the audio advertising needs of every customer possible, and not just the sort of enterprise class customer that you think of when you think of the big agencies, but all the way down through to the long tail of small businesses and people who were using self-service platforms to buy video and display and social from the likes of Facebook and Google.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUHKll"&gt;Although Google has entered the podcasting industry through its Google Podcasts player, the company only mentioned serving audio ads &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/admanager/listen-new-features-grow-your-digital-audio-business/"&gt;as a beta feature&lt;/a&gt; in August last year. The company says it’s exploring more ways to monetize audio, however, and will have updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r7N51y"&gt;Of course, as it goes with acquisitions, Triton’s existing customers might now be put in an uncomfortable bind. Entercom, an iHeart competitor that runs radio stations around the US, is a customer of Triton, for example, as is NPR and others. They might not want to put their money in iHeart’s pockets. Kaminsky says Triton will remain separate from iHeart with its own management and tech teams, and he points out that iHeart &lt;a href="https://www.iheartmedia.com/Other-Businesses"&gt;already operates&lt;/a&gt; three other companies that do business regularly with competitors with no issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zlnuOb"&gt;“Obviously, we’re going to be sensitive to people’s concerns, we’re not going to just be cavalier about it, but I think that most folks in the audio community are going to see this as a good thing,” he says. “iHeart has been a staunch supporter of broadcast radio, of companionship audio, of audio as part of the community, as opposed to audio that’s driven exclusively by technology, and I think that the players in the audio space will see that and will continue to avail themselves of the technology and services that Triton provides.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wXBt16"&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Steam’s biggest new hit is a Viking survival game that struck like a bolt from the blue</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V1jZ3m6OHe2wY4qSrBownsaWqo4=/155x0:829x449/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68831563/valheim_steam.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WxySs4"&gt;The other day, I saw a game named &lt;em&gt;Valheim &lt;/em&gt;atop the Steam Early Access sales charts, with overwhelmingly positive reviews. &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/9/22275109/valheim-viking-game-steam-charts-explainer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt; seemed to like the $20 Viking-themed survival game&lt;/a&gt;, and I thought friends might like it, too. I wasn’t ready to commit quite yet — I waffled a while before giving it a go. Know who bought it while I was making up my mind? &lt;em&gt;One million other people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="67WpZr"&gt;On February 10th, just eight days after launch, indie developer Iron Gate announced that &lt;em&gt;Valheim &lt;/em&gt;had &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970?emclan=103582791463217109&amp;amp;emgid=3059603085894895511"&gt;already sold 1 million copies&lt;/a&gt;. Five days after that, &lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970/view/4627981752752748715"&gt;reached 2 million sales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Here are a few other facts you might like to know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="4TAu80"&gt;It has now been &lt;a href="https://steamcharts.com/"&gt;the second-most played game on &lt;em&gt;all of Steam&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at one point, ahead of every game save &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, &lt;/em&gt;and it’s comfortably sitting at number three now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fzcx0K"&gt;It’s already set a top-ten record for concurrent players on Steam &lt;a href="https://steamdb.info/app/892970/graphs/"&gt;with roughly 392,000&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, knocking &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://steamcharts.com/"&gt;off that top 10 chart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WJosSj"&gt;It topped the Steam Top Sellers list during Valve’s Steam Lunar New Year sale — despite having zero discounts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="O6RSp0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/valheim-may-well-be-steams-biggest-ever-viral-hit/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt;’s trajectory is unlike anything we’ve seen before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oUq6tJ"&gt;The closest parallel is perhaps &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/pubg-playerunknown-brendan-greene-interview-july-2017/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; —&lt;/em&gt; which similarly came out of Steam Early Access, sold oodles of copies during Steam sales &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/steam-summer-sale-pubg-player-unknown-battlegrounds/"&gt;(also without being on sale&lt;/a&gt;), set a record for the Steam game with the most simultaneous players (3.2 million) that still stands today, and kicked off the entire battle royale genre that spawned today’s &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and more. But even &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; took months to reach the kind of numbers that &lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt; already has now, and that was with a genre-defining, action-packed, nail-biting, streamer-friendly game that makes for a delightfully tense watch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MmalvW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Technically, ‘Valheim’ released a 2018 alpha build on itch.io&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UjhWdv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt;, by comparison, is slow and methodical. It’s part of an established genre of survival games where you scavenge and harvest, chop and dig, hunt and skin, then build better tools to do it all more efficiently over and over again. Only here, you’re also a badass Viking who can (eventually) build fortresses and ships, you’re hunting down gods for sport, and you’re exploring &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/valheim-player-discovers-whats-beyond-the-edge-of-its-enormous-map/"&gt;a gobsmackingly gigantic map&lt;/a&gt; filled with idyllic scenery, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PatrikJarlestam/status/1361604565531959305"&gt;charming music&lt;/a&gt;, a touch of lived-in mystery, and some enemies that stomp me convincingly enough that I get a slight &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/em&gt; vibe out of it. Oh, and when you cut down trees, they fall and hit other things (like you) for massive damage! That’s never going to get old.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jvXfF31K_kYujVsQz_1WN9Ow060=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22309294/valheim_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The game’s graphics may seem dull at first but can be picturesque, particularly with eye candy like depth of field, tessellation, and sun shafts. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zklytf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/9/22275109/valheim-viking-game-steam-charts-explainer"&gt;As Cass Marshall at &lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, it’s also incredibly accessible and easy to learn — I’d convinced myself that I disliked survival games due to their typically rigid mechanics, but in &lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt; everything seems to make sense without thinking too hard. I don’t need to spend ages punching trees to build some basic tools, there’s no need to acquire blueprints (recipes unlock as soon as you find new materials), and I don’t have to painstakingly plan how I want my house to look before I start building. You can instantly demolish a portion of a structure and refund your materials if it’s not quite right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wk3PCo"&gt;In fact, building is fast enough that I’m starting to build temporary forward operating bases before I venture into each new area, like the tiny fort below that took all of five minutes and I’ve since expanded twice. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DDoTrQoXUEMDG9CjIsfEfptUEqo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22309305/valheim_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It gets real dark at night. Fire is a must if you’re planning to stay up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Fp3dFC"&gt;There’s no telling how long the magic will last for me or for the game’s 2 million players and counting, of course. It’s been &lt;a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/945360#1y"&gt;all downhill for &lt;em&gt;Among Us &lt;/em&gt;on PC&lt;/a&gt;, which currently only attracts one-tenth of its peak player count of 438,000 last September (though it could still be wildly popular on mobile). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HKI4K5"&gt;But I imagine word-of-mouth may keep &lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt; going for a while. I can’t wait to try the game’s two- to ten-player co-op mode with my circle of friends, and that means more copies in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="khWT2s"&gt;If &lt;em&gt;Valheim &lt;/em&gt;does have staying power, expect to hear this game’s name on a lot of lips in the months to come. If history’s any indication, we’ll soon see a rush of knockoffs, &lt;a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-08-18-mobile-version-of-fall-guys-is-a-scam-mediatonic-warns"&gt;fake-outs&lt;/a&gt;, and attempts to make other games play more like it, and there may be a lot of pressure on Iron Gate to port the PC-only game to consoles and phones as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US announces charges against North Korean hackers for sweeping hacking scheme</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Stimulus Optimism Grows As GOP Lawmakers Warm To Bipartisan Plan" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J_488J0SRxOxWss1fzimdWx3Hcs=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68831179/1229946499.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NjAheI"&gt;The Justice Department unsealed charges Wednesday for three North Korean computer programmers accused of conspiring to extort over $1.3 billion from banks and other businesses across the globe, &lt;a href="http://washingtonpost.com/national-security/north-korea-hackers-banks-theft/2021/02/17/3dccf0dc-7129-11eb-93be-c10813e358a2_story.html"&gt;as first reported by &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HJtIuf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;In 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/6/17826722/north-korea-sony-hack-wannacry-charges"&gt;the Justice Department brought charges&lt;/a&gt; against one North Korean operative, Park Jin Hyok, for their involvement in the infamous Sony Pictures hack in 2014, as well as the devastating 2017 WannaCry ransomware attack. In Wednesday’s unsealed indictment, Park and others are accused of participating in a sweeping conspiracy to hack into banks and crypto exchanges as well as creating the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/14/15637888/authorities-wannacry-ransomware-attack-spread-150-countries"&gt;WannaCry virus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vAwQ4V"&gt;“North Korea’s operatives, using keyboards rather than guns, stealing digital wallets of cryptocurrency instead of stacks of cash, are the world’s leading bank robbers,” Assistant Attorney General John C. Demers said in a statement Wednesday. “The Department will continue to confront malicious nation state cyber activity with our unique tools and work with our fellow agencies and the family of norms abiding nations to do the same.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ek5Bil"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1367701/download"&gt;The indictment&lt;/a&gt; was filed in December and alleges that the defendants work for North Korea’s military intelligence agency, the Reconnaissance General Bureau. The DOJ says that the defendants targeted cryptocurrency exchanges, stealing millions from banks and businesses around the world. They are also accused of multiple phishing campaigns from March 2016 to February 2020 targeting US military contractors, energy and technology companies, and the State and Defense departments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SXxIJi"&gt;The victims of this wide-ranging hacking conspiracy vary from the Central Bank of Bangladesh to cryptocurrency companies based in South Korea, Indonesia, and Slovenia, according to the indictment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tK8dSV"&gt;“Simply put, the regime has become a criminal syndicate with a flag,” Demers said on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4tYa0X"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yh654U"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Brydge’s Pro Plus iPad keyboard gets much better trackpad support with new firmware</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gz2ot_feK6QKxMzoBK4LczmOdR4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68830902/DSC00760.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Aeq4bm"&gt;Brydge has announced a new firmware update for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206568/brydge-pro-plus-review-ipad-pro-keyboard-trackpad"&gt;Pro Plus iPad keyboards&lt;/a&gt; that promises to hugely improve the trackpad experience. The update brings “native” multitouch to the trackpads, meaning you can use the same kind of multi-finger gestures on a Brydge device as Apple’s own Magic Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMzPc0"&gt;The Brydge Pro Plus was the victim of unfortunate timing. It was originally announced as a power-user product designed to support Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/25/18743993/ipad-mouse-ipad-os-how-to"&gt;experimental cursor feature&lt;/a&gt;, but then Apple turned that into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/3/18/21184933/ipados-13-4-mouse-trackpad-support-ipad-apple-computer-date"&gt;consumer-level functionality&lt;/a&gt; with iOS 13.4 and released its own keyboard/trackpad accessory, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21227345/magic-keyboard-ipad-pro-tablet-laptop-review-price-specs-features"&gt;expensive but excellent Magic Keyboard&lt;/a&gt;. At launch, the Pro Plus’ trackpad was usable for basic tasks, but it didn’t have full gesture support and couldn’t compete with the smoothness of Apple’s own hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="iOhmE1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Brydge Pro Plus review: an almost awesome iPad laptop","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206568/brydge-pro-plus-review-ipad-pro-keyboard-trackpad"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="vLCQyi"&gt;I’ve spent a couple of days with a beta version of Brydge’s new firmware, using the company’s keyboard designed for the 11-inch iPad, and the news is good so far. While the trackpad on this model is quite small, and its levered mechanism means there isn’t a lot of space for clicking, the cursor movement is far smoother and gestures work well. You can use three fingers to swipe between apps, for example, or swipe up to bring you to the multitasking interface. Simple two-finger scrolling is also much improved, working with consistent momentum as you’d expect across various apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MQoBB1"&gt;I’ll have to test the Pro Plus’ new firmware further before giving a final verdict, but my first impressions are positive. The Pro Plus looks like it’ll soon be a much more viable product than it was upon its original launch, particularly since Brydge is putting it on sale today; the 12.9-inch model is getting a $60 reduction to $169.99, while the 11-inch version is available for $40 off at $159.99.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r-STwegfKI0oJcIBOP32bqwoXhY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22309579/BRY8012___Main.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="n1X3Uq"&gt;Brydge is also announcing a new trackpad-equipped iPad keyboard, the first product to come out of a collaboration with OtterBox that was &lt;a href="http://news.brydge.com/111070-brydge-announces-go-to-market-collaboration-with-otter-products"&gt;announced last year&lt;/a&gt;. The 10.2 Max Plus is designed for the seventh- and eighth generation iPads with 10.2-inch displays, and includes a detachable case that Brydge says offers 4-foot drop protection. It’s set to ship in late March and will be &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brydge.com%2Fproducts%2Fbrydge-10-2-max&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F17%2F22287000%2Fbrydge-pro-plus-ipad-keyboard-new-firmware-native-multitouch#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available to preorder today&lt;/a&gt; for $129.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HPVa8E"&gt;If you already have a Pro Plus keyboard, meanwhile, Brydge is opening signups for a public beta of the new firmware. You can register &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brydge.com%2Fpages%2Fmulti-touch-beta&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F17%2F22287000%2Fbrydge-pro-plus-ipad-keyboard-new-firmware-native-multitouch#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;; the page notes that the firmware will require an iPad running Apple’s iPadOS 14.5 public beta. The program will begin on March 3rd, but 500 users will get earlier access on February 24th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s new FPS Boost mode for Xbox Series X and S can double frame rates in games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6kALP86_rk4wAW-D30WsdzNb__A=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68830900/xboxfpsboost.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RPQoDU"&gt;Microsoft is launching a new FPS Boost feature for its latest Xbox Series X and Series S consoles that’s designed to make existing games run better. While Microsoft has previously focused on improving frame rates with backward compatibility for its latest Xbox consoles, FPS Boost is specifically designed to improve older games without developers having to put in any additional work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="05jC0H"&gt;Some games will nearly double frame rates, and Microsoft says it has seen a few instances where backward-compatible titles even quadruple in frame rates. The first games to support FPS Boost are &lt;em&gt;Far Cry 4&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;New Super Lucky’s Tale&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Sniper Elite 4&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;UFC 4&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs 2. &lt;/em&gt;The improvements vary across games, with &lt;em&gt;New Super Lucky’s Tale &lt;/em&gt;now running at up to 120fps, and &lt;em&gt;UFC 4&lt;/em&gt; includes 60fps performance on the Xbox Series S specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d7ngZR"&gt;Games that work with FPS Boost will include a new indicator when you hit the Xbox button on a controller, just like how Quick Resume or auto HDR indicators pop up today on Xbox Series X and S consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U_mco2cQwbPXCWC77mnPK3wFseE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22309418/xboxfpsboost.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New FPS Boost feature for Xbox Series X and S.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Lm2Gg6"&gt;“This is just the beginning,” explains Paul Eng, a senior program manager at Xbox. “We will announce and release more titles featuring FPS Boost soon, as we roll out new menu icons and system settings in an upcoming system update.” This new dashboard update will arrive in the spring and include the ability to toggle compatibility options on games. You’ll be able to disable auto HDR or toggle this new FPS Boost feature on and off to really see the impact it provides or simply play games in their original form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EMHulE"&gt;Microsoft will be rolling out FPS Boost more broadly soon with this new dashboard update. While the initial list is rather limited, Microsoft says it’s planning to announce more games that support FPS Boost in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="nsmTjY"&gt;The Los Angeles Police Department requested access to Amazon Ring footage while investigating vandalism during last summer’s anti-racism and police brutality protests, according to newly released emails. &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/02/lapd-requested-ring-footage-black-lives-matter-protests"&gt;The Electronic Frontier Foundation calls it&lt;/a&gt; the first evidence of police trying to identify protest attendees with home surveillance cameras — although it’s part of a much longer relationship between Amazon and law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SQSn5o"&gt;The EFF published a string of redacted emails between the LAPD and an Amazon representative. The document includes copies of several requests to Ring customers, asking for surveillance footage from their camera-equipped doorbells. Many of the forms are heavily redacted, but on June 16th, Amazon submitted a request clearly related to the protests. “During the recent protests, individuals were injured and property was looted, damaged, and destroyed,” the LAPD said in the request. It asked for video during a redacted period of time, “in an effort to identify those responsible.” At least one user appears to have sent video footage soon after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Zeb6R"&gt;Amazon has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/31/22258856/amazon-ring-partners-police-fire-security-privacy-cameras"&gt;reportedly partnered with over 2,000 police and fire departments&lt;/a&gt;, which allegedly requested footage for around 22,000 total incidents in 2020. Most requests ask users to voluntarily submit video, but police can obtain footage directly through Amazon with a search warrant or court order. Police departments have also used social media and high-tech tools like facial recognition to track down protest attendees — sometimes in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295301/philadelphia-protester-arson-identified-social-media-etsy-instagram-linkedin"&gt;cases that involve&lt;/a&gt; clear acts of property destruction or violence, and sometimes over charges that appear &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/18/21373316/nypd-facial-recognition-black-lives-matter-activist-derrick-ingram"&gt;inflated or retaliatory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6OQ4hS"&gt;In a statement to the EFF, the LAPD said it is “not uncommon for investigators to ask businesses or residents if they will voluntarily share their footage with them.” However, Ring cameras let police access a far greater wealth of video recordings — making questions of privacy even more urgent.&lt;/p&gt;
