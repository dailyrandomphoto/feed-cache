    <title>Don’t overthink it: Elon Musk’s Tesla Bot is a joke</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CW2LEJettegsravy59OyDj-hYrc=/0x0:1060x707/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69753469/robotics_1.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VMybrN"&gt;After a dense presentation about the undeniably impressive work Tesla is doing with AI, the company’s self-anointed Technoking, Elon Musk, capped the evening by bringing out a dancer in a spandex suit. Behold, said Musk: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22633514/tesla-robot-prototype-elon-musk-humanoid-ai-day"&gt;my Tesla Bot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jN0wru"&gt;The dancer in the suit, he said, was the model for a new humanoid robot Tesla will produce in the near future. After the dubstep and applause had faded, the vaguest of briefing slides promised that the Tesla Bot will stand five feet, eight inches (1.7m), weigh 125 pounds (56kg), have “human-level hands,” and eliminate “dangerous, repetitive, boring tasks.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yXSEpk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A robot is just a Tesla without wheels, says Musk&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a1axCd"&gt;Musk said that building a human-replacement robot — something no company in the world is close to achieving — was a logical step forward from Tesla’s work developing self-driving cars. “Our cars are semi-sentient robots on wheels,” he said. “It kind of makes sense to put that on to a humanoid form. We’re also quite good at sensors and batteries and actuators so we think we’ll probably have a prototype some time next year that basically looks like this.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VkCc3y"&gt;Even by Musk’s standards, it was a bizarre and brilliant bit of tomfoolery: a multipurpose sideshow that trolled Tesla skeptics, fed the fans, ginned up the share price, and created some eye-catching headlines. The latter being particularly important in a week when most Tesla news has focused on a federal investigation into a tendency of the company’s Autopilot software to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22626819/tesla-autopilot-crash-emergency-vehicle-probe-nhtsa"&gt;crash into parked emergency vehicles&lt;/a&gt;. Forget about all that, says Musk, just look at the person in the spandex suit! Next year, it’ll be a real robot, &lt;em&gt;I promise&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rtm5a9"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Lmao this is how he made his announcement? &lt;a href="https://t.co/6Ktybjyeav"&gt;pic.twitter.com/6Ktybjyeav&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ryan Mac  (@RMac18) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RMac18/status/1428708172856918018?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bycBkl"&gt;Do you believe him? &lt;em&gt;Should &lt;/em&gt;you believe him? I won’t answer that for you, but I want to restate the facts. Elon Musk got up on stage last night and promised that Tesla, a company whose driver assist software is unable to reliably avoid parked ambulances, would soon build a fully functioning humanoid robot. Musk said that the machine would be able to follow human instructions intuitively, responding correctly to commands like “please go to a store and get me the following groceries.” He outlined these scenarios and then said: “Yeah, I think we can do that.” This was minutes after he’d ushered away the best demo of the Tesla Bot available:&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;a dancer in a spandex suit. If nothing else, you have to admire the chutzpah. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v68mAM"&gt;To put Musk’s claims in context, remember that Boston Dynamics, a company which makes Atlas, the most advanced bipedal robot in the world, has never described its machines as anything but R&amp;amp;D. Atlas, says Boston Dynamics, is simply a way to push the cutting edge of robotics: it’s not even close to commercial deployment. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628663/boston-dynamics-atlas-video-parkour-flips-falls-program"&gt;recent videos of the machine&lt;/a&gt;, the company showed how difficult building a bipedal robot is and how often Atlas trips and falls. It’s also worth noting that Boston Dynamics has been working on Atlas and its bipedal predecessors &lt;a href="https://robots.ieee.org/robots/petman/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;for more than a decade&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Musk thinks he can leapfrog their work in a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GS9FMH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“[Calling it] horse shit sounds generous, frankly.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f3zJxt"&gt;Carl Berry, a lecturer in robotics engineering at the UK’s University of Central Lancashire, put things to me in less uncertain terms: “[Calling it] horse shit sounds generous, frankly. I’m not saying that he shouldn’t be doing research like this, but it’s the usual overblown hype.” Berry stressed that deploying robotics and AI in manufacturing usually required making the simplest machine possible: not the most complex. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cKrMt0"&gt;“I’m not saying Tesla researching this stuff isn’t a good thing,” he said, “but between them and companies like Boston Dynamics they leave the public with unrealistic expectations of what robotics is currently capable of or will be for many years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBlmUr"&gt;I personally don’t doubt that if Musk wants to he can produce something that &lt;em&gt;looks&lt;/em&gt; like a Tesla Bot in 2022. It wouldn’t be hard to make a decent automaton — something on the level of Disney’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22399471/disney-imagineering-robot-groot-bipedal-free-walking"&gt;more advanced theme park models&lt;/a&gt;, for example. Once he’s got it to walk out onstage he can even send it to space, just for the headlines. But if he does, it will be just another distraction. Robotics are having a huge effect on manufacturing, no doubt about that, but there’s no need to pretend that machines need to look human to do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lm3qd0"&gt;This sort of bait-and-switch is often how Musk operates. Just think about how his plans for the Hyperloop changed over time. The technology was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/8/12/4614940/elon-musk-reveals-plans-for-high-speed-hyperloop"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; as a railgun-like train system that would move people from Los Angeles to San Francisco in less than half an hour. Over the years, these ambitions have shrunk until the project &lt;a href="https://la.curbed.com/2018/12/18/18147366/elon-musk-tunnel-tesla-test-opening-grimes"&gt;morphed into The Loop&lt;/a&gt;: a small tunnel that you can drive a car through, if you want. (Otherwise known as: a tunnel.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xliRsH"&gt;What the Tesla Bot really reminded me of is Sophia: the mechanical chatbot that’s appeared on chat shows and magazine covers. Sophia relies on misdirection to fool audiences and is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/18/16904742/sophia-the-robot-ai-real-fake-yann-lecun-criticism"&gt;regular target of AI experts’ scorn&lt;/a&gt;. But it also has a job to do. As one of the robot’s creators, Ben Goertzel, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/10/16617092/sophia-the-robot-citizen-ai-hanson-robotics-ben-goertzel"&gt;told me in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, Sophia works by priming our imagination, encouraging us to fool ourselves into thinking the future is closer than the evidence suggests. In the process, the robot generates funding and news coverage for its makers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXP9GB"&gt;“If I tell people I’m using probabilistic logic to do reasoning on how best to prune the backward chaining inference trees that arise in our logic engine, they have no idea what I’m talking about,” said Goertzel. “But if I show them a beautiful smiling robot face, then they get the feeling that AGI may indeed be nearby and viable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cdll6j"&gt;That feeling is what Musk wants to inculcate in his audience, be they investors or otherwise. His twist on the Sophia strategy is that he doesn’t even need a simulacrum of a robot to sell the dream. All he needs is a dancer in a spandex suit. Now that’s innovation. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Duolingo adds a family plan and new ways to learn non-Latin characters</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/laDyvJ0FLui1IRnGOu3g8kc0jU8=/0x92:1080x812/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69753378/1___Hero_Image.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Duolingo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2C4jLu"&gt;At &lt;a href="https://www.duolingo.com/duocon"&gt;Duolingo’s virtual conference&lt;/a&gt;, the company is announcing that it will add a family plan to its app, along with new games and puzzles to help people learn languages that use non-Latin alphabets, such as Japanese or Arabic. One of the main new features is a tab that will appear for some languages, which shows users a grid of letters in an alphabet, along with the sounds they make. (If you’re an Android user, the feature may sound familiar as it’s been available on that platform, but now it’s coming to iOS and the web.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="39JDZc"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://support.duolingo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058962891-Family-Plan-FAQ"&gt;family plan&lt;/a&gt; will give six people (the subscriber, who becomes the family manager, and five others) the benefits of Duolingo Plus, which includes no ads, unlimited hearts, mastery quizzes, and more. It costs $120 a year, which isn’t bad compared to the individual Plus plan, which costs $80 a year when paid annually, or $12.99 a month, though there’s no monthly payment option for the family plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RqyuQm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some languages will include games that involve tracing non-Latin characters&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iUX5M6"&gt;Duolingo says that the ability to tap on symbols and hear their sounds will be coming to languages like Korean, Russian, Ukrainian, Greek, Arabic, Hindi, Hebrew, and the newly added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22362723/duolingo-yiddish-language-classes"&gt;Yiddish&lt;/a&gt; (Japanese &lt;a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/learning-to-read-japanese-characters/"&gt;has had some of the features for a few months&lt;/a&gt;). In addition to the chart, there will also be lessons, and some languages will include games that involve tracing non-Latin characters or even building the character like a puzzle. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4b0zRj7v65CQeEbLJeVTbtTimc0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22793979/Korean.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Duolingo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exercises for languages may include listening exercises, tracing characters, and puzzles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="trAMmS"&gt;It makes sense that Duolingo is adding a family payment plan, which has been &lt;a href="https://forum.duolingo.com/comment/26245380/Suggestion-Duolingo-Plus-Family-membership"&gt;repeatedly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://forum.duolingo.com/comment/49499481/Starting-a-family-plan-please-help"&gt;requested&lt;/a&gt; by users, and new reasons to use its app given that the company &lt;a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/duolingo-ipo/"&gt;just went public at the end of July&lt;/a&gt;. As someone who’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22583950/duolingo-language-learning-anxiety"&gt;bounced off the company’s lessons&lt;/a&gt; for Russian and Japanese, though, I appreciate the additional lessons for the characters that I’ve struggled to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stitch Fix stylists reportedly quit in droves as the company leans on algorithms to serve customers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Stitch Fix Illustrations As Earnings Figures Released" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o7CZhFEeV1TUX-Xe7FJjlRXcCvg=/0x2:4000x2669/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69753356/1233318623.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="weJeJK"&gt;Stitch Fix stylists — who choose outfits for its customers — quit in droves after the company ended its flexible scheduling policy, according to a new report from &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/stitch-fix-employees-quitting"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And at least one worker told &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/em&gt; that employees felt like they were “training the algorithm” which also helps choose customers’ clothing, suggesting the company may be heading toward relying more on computer-generated recommendations instead of human stylists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mPFS4e"&gt;&lt;a href="https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/4hqj866x"&gt;During a call with investors&lt;/a&gt; after its June earnings announcement, new CEO Elizabeth Spaulding (who started the job August 1st) said Stitch Fix stylists “play a very active role in training our machine learning models with our data science team for outfits, which our ability to generate algorithmic outfits in a feed is, we think, a real source of differentiation that requires that human touch to help build and train those models, as well as quality control.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iytt38"&gt;Stitch Fix is one of several online styling services. Customers take a “quiz” about their personal style, clothing preferences, preferred price range, and sizes, and a stylist picks out clothing based on those preferences which are then shipped to the customer. The customer can choose to keep the clothing and pay for it, or send it back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwhHvp"&gt;The company used to allow its stylists, many of whom work part time remotely, to choose their own schedules. Indeed, as of this writing, &lt;a href="https://www.stitchfix.com/careers/styling"&gt;Stitch Fix’s careers page&lt;/a&gt; says its stylists “love the flexibility to set a work schedule that fits into their daily lifestyle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M53gqj"&gt;But earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.modernretail.co/retailers/stitch-fix-to-stylists-accept-scheduling-changes-or-resign/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Modern Retail &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that the company told employees via internal message that it was making changes, and that part-time stylists had to be available to work a minimum of 20 hours per week, between 8AM and 8PM local time. There was no guarantee the workers would get 20 hours weekly, however. Previously, stylists could indicate how many hours they would commit to working on a given day, but with the changes, Stitch Fix required that they specify exactly when they would work those hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fsUET7"&gt;According to the internal message, stylists had the option of committing to the new schedule rules or resigning and receiving an “exit payment” of $1,000 if they signed a nondisclosure agreement. About 1,500 stylists left after the updated policy was announced, &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/em&gt; reported, roughly a third of its stylists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ewmIeh"&gt;Stitch Fix said in June it generated $535.6 million in revenue in &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/07/stitch-fix-sfix-reports-q3-2021-results.html"&gt;its third quarter&lt;/a&gt;, up 44 percent from the year prior, and grew its active client count 20 percent to 4.1 million people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HBmnR6"&gt;The stylists who spoke to &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/em&gt; said they noticed more customer orders being sent out with items chosen completely by an algorithm, with a human stylist involved only to write a note to the customer or if a customer complained. “We knew from the beginning we were teaching the algorithm,” one stylist told the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MwYIbA"&gt;Stitch Fix did not immediately reply to a request for comment Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile’s massive data breach leaked info for 5.3 million additional customers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LJO03I3sABMpXk2L0YOJ51ERKuQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69753137/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="srbZRz"&gt;The news about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630446/t-mobile-47-million-data-breach-ssn-pin-pii?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"&gt;T-Mobile’s latest data breach&lt;/a&gt; is only getting worse, as the company &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fnetwork%2Fadditional-information-regarding-2021-cyberattack-investigation&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F20%2F22633853%2Ftmobile-data-breach-imei-sim-fcc" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced new details&lt;/a&gt; from its investigation. While someone in possession of the leaked data &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/15/22626270/t-mobile-investigating-report-customer-data-breach"&gt;said they had obtained information for as many as 100 million customers&lt;/a&gt;, including driver’s license info, IMEI numbers, and more, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630446/t-mobile-47-million-data-breach-ssn-pin-pii?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"&gt;T-Mobile’s first statement&lt;/a&gt; put the figure at 47 million or so and did not mention the IMEI / IMSI data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K81kUx"&gt;Now, T-Mobile has confirmed that for the 7.8 million on-contract, or postpaid, customers it already counted in the breach, data stolen includes the information mentioned Thursday (first and last names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, and driver’s license / ID numbers), as well as phone numbers and IMEI / IMSI information. IMEI stands for International Mobile Equipment Identity and is a number that’s assigned to every mobile device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Eib8BJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More than 50 million people have been included in the breach&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7mfsT0"&gt;IMSI stands for International Mobile Subscriber Identity and is the identifier for the SIM card to which your mobile phone number is tied. That kind of data could be used to track mobile devices or assist in SIM swapping attacks where someone hijacks your phone number to intercept two-factor authentication codes or other information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KDOsYC"&gt;Additionally, 5.3 million more postpaid customers have also been identified as part of the breach, but without revealing their driver’s license / ID or Social Security numbers. The same goes for an additional 667,000 accounts of former T-Mobile subscribers that are being added to the total. Former Sprint prepaid and Boost Mobile customers are still in the clear, however, 52,000 names tied to Metro by T-Mobile accounts were stolen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EUKXCT"&gt;An unspecified number of files contained “phone numbers, IMEI, and IMSI numbers.” According to T-Mobile that did not include any personally identifiable information, which is a questionable claim since it could be easy to tie someone’s identity to their phone number based on other leaked data or simply browsing publicly available listings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L3FAsX"&gt;The FCC already announced it’s investigating the incident, and at least one class-action lawsuit has been filed against T-Mobile, calling its response and promised two years of identity protection services “inadequate.” The investigation is still ongoing, but T-Mobile customers (current, former, or just prospective ones who filled out an application) can &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fbrand%2Fdata-breach-2021&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F20%2F22633853%2Ftmobile-data-breach-imei-sim-fcc" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;go here&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="qoM4PT"&gt;Whether you use iOS or Android, the Tile Mate (2020) is a great Bluetooth tracker that’s designed to help you keep watch over your personal stuff. This $15 discount on a four-pack from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tile-RE-19004-Mate-4-Pack/dp/B07W73PTJB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749570688602172611#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; is a great value for people getting started with Bluetooth trackers or someone building an arsenal of them. Unlike Apple AirTags, they can remotely ping your phone and also have an innovative design, known as a hole, for easily attaching to things without additional accessories. Similar to AirTags, and to the benefit of humankind, they have user-replaceable batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="ZPeJ79"&gt;The Roku Streambar is an all-in-one solution for your TV’s streaming and audio needs, and is currently $30 off from several retailers, including &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Roku-Streambar-Streaming-Premium-Released/dp/B08G8JH836?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749571467545583546#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1595571-REG%2Froku_9102r_streambar_stereo_soundbar.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1129183/2092?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Froku-streambar---hd-4k-hdr-streaming-media-player---38--premium-audio--all-in-one--and-voice-remote-with-tv-controls--2020-%2F-%2FA-79829328" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. The compact, wall-mountable soundbar doubles as a 4K HDR streaming device complete with HDMI, USB, and optical audio ports. It’s perfect for small rooms where space is at a premium, and it will sound better than the tinny speakers found on even some larger, high-end TVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QBXmvz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10488551"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rwEMMT"&gt;Amazon’s Fire Sticks have become table stakes in the streaming device landscape, though, at this point you probably don’t want anything still topping out at 1080p in the year 2021. This deal for $12 off the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-TV-Stick-4K-with-Alexa-Voice-Remote/dp/B079QHML21?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K&lt;/a&gt; brings the price of the 4K streaming stick down to a level we haven’t seen since Amazon Prime Day. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/31/18044584/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

You can pick from either the silver or space gray configuration on Amazon, and Target also offers the gold colorway. This is the Apple Watch to get if you’re shopping on a budget... assuming you don’t want to deal with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419569/apple-watch-series-3-software-update-reset-bad-experience" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;firmware nightmares&lt;/a&gt; that accompany the Apple Watch Series 3.

    <title>WarioWare is more chaotic than ever on the Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MEa0GJ9YxbZwAEeQ6wQq7M0C0F0=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69752440/Switch_WarioWareGetItTogether_screen_02.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qU97Fk"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;WarioWare&lt;/em&gt; series has always been about chaos. Its self-described micro-games are so fast and strange that by the time you understand what’s going on, the game has already moved on to something new. Switch owners will be able to get a taste of that with the upcoming &lt;em&gt;WarioWare: Get It Together&lt;/em&gt; — and from what I’ve seen, it might be the most chaotic take on the series yet. Nintendo recently took me through a brief hands-off demo of the game, running through a couple of different modes. The one unifying factor between them all seemed to be a desire to take the micro-game concept to absurd new levels of mayhem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOFxPP"&gt;The main change is that there is now a cast of characters you can play as, all plucked from the &lt;em&gt;WarioWare&lt;/em&gt; universe. And each has their own unique controls and specific abilities, which can make a big difference in the seconds-long micro-games you’ll play through.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8L3jXjpA82jGWvyaL7aHzx7LBAs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22794584/Switch_WWGIT_2021_MediaPreview_VarietyPack_SCRN_03_copy.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;“Daily grind” mode.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aEcK9k"&gt;These characters impact the main story mode, which you can play cooperatively, but from what I saw it looks like the “variety pack” mode will be where most of the fun is. Nintendo describes it as a “hub of party games,” which basically means that you’ll play through playlists that feature a series of themed challenges. One pack, called “daily grind,” features a handful of side-scrolling levels that get progressively stranger and more challenging. You start out as Wario but can collect power-ups that randomly turn you into another character, each of which has a completely different style of movement. One is on a skateboard, for instance, and will roll forward automatically, while another is a flying witch that can shoot magic spells. When you grab a power-up, you’ll have no idea which one you’ll transform into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lD2Ty1"&gt;Another pack, called “puck ‘er up,” starts out like a game of air hockey. But every time you score a goal you’ll be transported to a random micro-game. That game actually appears as a tiny window in the middle of the screen, and while the player who scores tries to finish it, everyone else can mess with them, knocking the window around or squashing it so small that the game becomes virtually unplayable. It was stressful just watching; I can only imagine how wild it would be to actually play. I foresee a lot of arguments in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5Bh731iZkYNY59yPwDiSWiBKDQI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22794585/Switch_WWGIT_2021_MediaPreview_VarietyPack_SCRN_05_copy.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;“Puck ‘er up” mode.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rdjWTX"&gt;As random as it is, &lt;em&gt;Get It Together&lt;/em&gt; does give you the option to prepare, at least a little. There’s a “play-o-pedia” mode, which is exactly what it sounds like: a playable encyclopedia. Here you get a feel for how each character controls, as well as play through endless versions of each micro-game you’ve encountered so far. It should help somewhat once you jump into the pure chaos of each game mode, where you never know what’s coming at you on a moment-to-moment basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dwj1YB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Get It Together&lt;/em&gt;, which will be the first new entry in the series in three years, is launching on the Switch on September 10th, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1428525951302918145"&gt;Nintendo just released a demo on the eShop&lt;/a&gt; that you can play right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMBvnU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mXhG00"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What’s on your desk, Chaim Gartenberg? </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9PmOWVxKOjwcsxY8wdm3Fw_FnKQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69752446/cgartenberg_210816_4718_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Setting up a brand-new space&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="t05WxD"&gt;If you’re a frequent reader of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, I’m sure the name &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/chaim-gartenberg"&gt;Chaim Gartenberg&lt;/a&gt; is known to you. He’s been reporting and commenting here for years on everything from the latest AMD Ryzen processors to the new trailer of &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;, and has become a familiar sight on videos as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LFRKEE"&gt;Chaim recently moved to a new space, which means he got a chance to set up a new space for working at home. We asked him to talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DKOcNC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about yourself. What is your background, and what do you do at The Verge?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Km0TiP"&gt;I’ve been at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; for just over nine years — I started as an intern in August 2012, and I’ve worked with a lot of pieces of the site over years, including being a reporter, working with our Circuit Breaker gadget blog, and, of course, writing tech news. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4phBzV"&gt;Right now, I’m one of our news editors, which means a fair amount of news writing, but I also do a lot of tech reporting, in addition to helping out with our culture and games coverage. Mostly, though, I just like getting to write about the latest tech things and geeking out over obscure specification details (looking at you, incomprehensible USB-C standards!). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JsPs0h"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell us a bit about your workspace. How did you decide where and how to set it up?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8V9qIO"&gt;We just moved in the beginning of June, and one of the biggest things on the list for when we were apartment hunting was space so that both my wife and I could have our own offices. Mine is technically also our guest bedroom — we have plans to put in a trundle bed / couch-type thing just behind where I usually sit, but it doubles as a pretty spacious office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qTLRYL"&gt;The one downside is that there’s not much natural light; the window just faces an internal wall, so I rely a lot on lamps. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="desk and chair" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NRCSkX93awjH_pRHmFvKPuXkhbM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22793237/cgartenberg_210817_4718_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A console table and a left-over office chair.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hYEZC9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about the desk itself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fRRfo9"&gt;The desk is actually a console table that my wife and I got for free when someone in her old building was giving it away. We ended up getting a nicer table for our entryway, though, and between the height and the width of the table, I thought it would be a pretty perfect desk for me (given that I couldn’t actually fit my knees under my old desk). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gl5aqR"&gt;It’s not the deepest desk, so I do have to think a little bit about what I put on there, but it fits my laptop, a notebook, and a bottle of seltzer or a mug of tea, which is good enough for me. The smaller size also helps keep in check my usual tendency to just let all my clutter run rampant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mklBfo"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How about your chair?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jJbHzb"&gt;I don’t actually have a lot of information on the desk chair. It was a gift from my wife, who snagged it when her company closed down their office when the pandemic started and let folks take home any furniture they wanted. (The wood and fabric filing cabinet that my printer is mounted on also came from there.) Given that I had been using a metal folding chair until then, it was a nice upgrade. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="headphones holder" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sw9GHsaWxt1CZILR2ZvNp-7EUSM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22793241/cgartenberg_210817_4718_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A pair of Sony MDR-7506 wired headphones hang near an M1 MacBook Air.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="maZk30"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, let’s go for the gold: could you tell us about the tech that you’re using there?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nqQMzX"&gt;Absolutely! The star of the show is my main work laptop: an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;M1 MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; issued me, and hands-down the best laptop I’ve ever used. Mine is a 16GB RAM / 512GB storage model, which I’ve customized with a &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; sticker (which also helps avoid confusing it with other laptops). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HLAjmZ"&gt;To the left is a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Powered-Wireless-Charging-iPhone/dp/B07LDDS5NY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech Powered wireless charger&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not the newest charger around, and is basically only useful for charging an iPhone (it tops out at 7.5W), but it was cheap (since it’s the older model, it cost around $20) and it keeps my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt; perfectly angled to unlock with Face ID so I can check my notifications at my desk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xrncy5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10709358"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KG9bBO"&gt;The headphone stand is a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.masterdynamic.com%2Fproducts%2Fheadphone-stand&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22628813%2Fremote-work-desk-home-set-up-chaim-gartenberg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fancy aluminum model from Master &amp;amp; Dynamic&lt;/a&gt; that just plain looks nice. Hanging on it is a pair of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR7506-Professional-Diaphragm-Headphone/dp/B000AJIF4E?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony MDR-7506&lt;/a&gt; wired headphones, which I keep around for podcasting and any important video calls where I don’t want to risk using a pair of wireless headphones. I keep a pair of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-phone-call/dp/B0863TXGM3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony WH-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt; noise-canceling headphones on top of the metal cabinet to the left of my desk, too, since I live in NYC and, well, the city gets pretty loud sometimes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xwLbI3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10709304"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7CJcW8"&gt;While I work almost exclusively off my laptop, I do keep a fancy camera setup for times that I need to look more professional on a Zoom call. The camera seen here on that tripod is a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Premium-Compact-Multi-Interface-DSCRX100M2/dp/B00DM8R866?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony RX 100 II&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s actually not the one I use for calls. That is my &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Mirrorless-Digitial-3-0-Inch-16-50mm/dp/B00I8BICB2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony a6000&lt;/a&gt;, but I needed it to actually shoot the pictures for this article. Similarly, I keep a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rode-Podcaster-USB-Dynamic-Microphone/dp/B000JM46FY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Rode Podcaster microphone&lt;/a&gt; around for the occasional podcast appearance or when I’m interviewing people for &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;articles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JTX9QA"&gt;The speakers are a pair of since-discontinued Nocs NS2 Air Monitors from 2013 that I &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/4/15/17234280/nocs-ns2-air-monitors-airplay-speakers-bluetooth-obsolete-problem"&gt;bought in college&lt;/a&gt; when they were extra cheap (the company had just released a newer model with Bluetooth). They still sound great, but they’ve never been updated to AirPlay 2, so using them as wireless speakers is a little flaky. Usually I just plug them into my laptop instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zfJJLT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10709338"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZWP5CH"&gt;To the left of the speakers is a stack of smart home gadgets: a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749563079979439697" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Home Mini&lt;/a&gt; (for controlling the lights and air conditioning in the office), a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749563126328264024" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Wifi puck&lt;/a&gt; (one of three scattered around the apartment), an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Aqara-Control-Automation-Supports-Assistant/dp/B08Y1PJZZH/ref=sr_1_5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Aqara hub&lt;/a&gt; for our light switches, and a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Hue-Stand-Alone-Bridge/dp/B016H0QZ7I?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Philips Hue hub&lt;/a&gt; for our smart bulbs. Please ignore the rat’s nest of cables peeking out behind them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ntW15F"&gt;On top of the metal filing cabinet is what I like to think of as my charging station: it’s where I keep any gadgets or gizmos that need occasional charging, like my custom-hacked iPod (which has 256GB of internal storage and a quadruple-sized battery), my &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Kindle-Oasis-now-with-adjustable-warm-light/dp/B07F7TLZF4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Oasis&lt;/a&gt;, and my Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones (when they need a top up.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YYSNXS"&gt;And then on the right of my desk is a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brother-HL-L2360DW-Wireless-Networking-Replenishment/dp/B00LEA5EJM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Brother HL-L2360DW&lt;/a&gt; laser printer that I bought in 2017. It’s a very basic printer: it only prints in black and white and doesn’t feature much in the way of bells or whistles. It is wireless, though, and does support duplex printing, both of which are more useful to me than color photos. I don’t actually have to print out that many things these days, but it’s extremely helpful for the occasional concert tickets, shipping labels, and other assorted random documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HSVmIy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anything special about the baseball?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s1WGYZ"&gt;I got the baseball from a Yankees game years ago that my dad took me and my brothers to, and it sits on top of a 3D-printed gear that one of my college friends made for me. Mostly, though, it’s just another thing to occasionally fidget around with during the day, &lt;a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Baseball_(object)" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Captain Sisko-style&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jWbq3G"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I envy you your Baby Yoda. (Although I have a Jawa that’s nearly as cute.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f6qOCt"&gt;Thank you! I got it &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeWOYDChaim081921&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F750337366%2Fthe-original-baby-child-the-baby-child" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;from an Etsy seller&lt;/a&gt; when the Mandalorian had first kicked off Baby Yoda fever across the internet — something that actually turned into an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/17/21069124/baby-yoda-dolls-etsy-disney-mandalorian-copyright-takedown-enforcement" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;interesting story for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about how Disney was issuing take-down notices for the most popular unlicensed toys featuring the character. He used to live on my desk at the office, but I rescued him from the empty office when I started working more remote last year. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A stuffed Baby Yoda from Etsy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A Yankees baseball sits near a Sega Genesis cartridge." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YDm-L1JbXlG16JfdY0wEXufrTzU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22793234/cgartenberg_210816_4718_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Yankees baseball sits near a Sega Genesis cartridge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xE0W6g"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I also like your bulletin board setup.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8V7Vla"&gt;It’s very much a work in progress, but I had accumulated a lot of random bits of art, stickers, and patches over the year that were living in a drawer. I’m still planning to add a lot of stuff to that setup — especially some pictures — but it’s a big step up from the blank slate of wall that used to be there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kxO2UW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And there are a few old-fashioned touches: the dictionary, for example, and the Sega Genesis cartridge. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HanHIR"&gt;The Genesis cartridge has lived on various desks of mine since high school; Sonic is one of the first games I can ever remember playing, and while I don’t actually have a Sega Genesis anymore, it’s a nice reminder to have. The dictionary is more aspirational: I like the idea of thumbing through an actual paper book to look up things while I’m writing, although I usually tend to just use my computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AXm1Qf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is obviously a work in progress. Do you have any other plans to add decorations, furniture, or other stuff to the space?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PGHzHy"&gt;Absolutely. I’m currently looking into replacing the desk with a larger and adjustable standing desk, and potentially getting a monitor / keyboard / mouse setup so I can dock my laptop and use a more traditional desktop setup with a bigger screen (that’s probably also better for my posture). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yGwPuV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T1oOai"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic wants Fortnite to be the last game standing — so it’s stealing ideas </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aukTBHVR2QDXrp1zQFXnIKXOBoM=/105x0:1940x1223/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69752259/Screen_Shot_2021_08_19_at_3.45.54_PM_copy.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epic liberally borrowed ideas from &lt;/em&gt;Among Us&lt;em&gt; for its &lt;/em&gt;Impostors&lt;em&gt; mode.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FdKTA6"&gt;This week, Epic Games added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628622/fortnite-among-us-copy-new-imposters-game-mode"&gt;a new mode called &lt;em&gt;Impostors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where players complete tasks on a ship while two impostors sneakily try to teleport as many agents off the ship as they can. If that sounds like a familiar gameplay loop to you, you’re not the only one who feels that way — fans immediately noticed that the mode borrows heavily from &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;, a social deduction game that exploded in popularity in 2020 and was built by a tiny indie studio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yshybb"&gt;The team at Innersloth, the developers of &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630365/among-us-fornite-impostors-mode-clone-reaction"&gt;are justifiably upset with Epic’s blatant repurposing of its hit game&lt;/a&gt;. But despite the underhanded tactics by Epic, &lt;em&gt;Impostors’&lt;/em&gt; polish and surprising connections to the ever-expanding &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; story could be a preview of the future of Epic’s smash hit as it tries to be the ultimate live service game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KSvx98"&gt;While I’m not a fan of how liberally Epic borrowed from &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;, when I’ve played &lt;em&gt;Impostors&lt;/em&gt;, I’ve found it pretty enjoyable in large part because it doesn’t mess with &lt;em&gt;Among Us’&lt;/em&gt; formula. As an agent, you’ll complete all sorts of rote tasks that are somehow a lot of fun. Many of the tasks have &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;-specific tie-ins, such as punching a Peeley punching bag or tossing soda cups at a miniature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/4/18057306/fortnite-fortnitemares-end-cube-gone"&gt;Kevin the cube&lt;/a&gt;. And as an impostor, I did everything I could to sneakily take out my opponents, and I was able to do so &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616664/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-worldbuilding-storytelling"&gt;while dressed as Ariana Grande&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oFUeGS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Epic has offered an Among Us-like mode before&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SyLysI"&gt;Epic has actually offered an &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;-like mode before, &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/spy-within-ltm-infiltrates-fortnite?sessionInvalidated=true"&gt;called The Spy Within&lt;/a&gt;, but that was made by fans using Fortnite’s in-game Creative mode tools. I personally thought it was clunky, and I only played a couple matches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O5lB9N"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Impostors&lt;/em&gt;, on the other hand, has Epic’s full might behind it, which ensures the game looks great and plays well. I know that I’ll come back to it a number of times in the coming days. And Epic’s direct involvement with &lt;em&gt;Impostors&lt;/em&gt; has an added bonus in that it ties directly into the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="54XByB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1RNbUaCKHA"&gt;The trailer&lt;/a&gt; for the mode, for example, reveals that it takes place on a ship run by the Imagined Order — or the IO, which players might recognize as the identifying acronym of AI enemies you can encounter in the main battle royale mode. And some of the tasks you complete as an agent in &lt;em&gt;Impostors&lt;/em&gt;, such as filling up a treasure chest with goodies, seem to imply that the people on the ship are the ones preparing the main battle royale island for every single drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yOMHC1"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W1RNbUaCKHA?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AnuNS4"&gt;I’ve been playing &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; almost daily for more than three years, so the added world-building in &lt;em&gt;Impostors&lt;/em&gt; has been a nice surprise. But it’s also a clever way to entice players back into the game who may not care about battle royale as much anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIF7nT"&gt;Lifting good ideas also isn’t really a new strategy for Epic; it’s just the most brazen recent example. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; actually launched as a co-op survival game, but Epic quickly added the now-gargantuan battle royale mode following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/23/17156952/pubg-creator-brendan-greene-epic-games-fortnite-battle-royale-genre-gdc-2018"&gt;the huge success of &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18127222/fortnite-creative-mode-season-7-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; Creative mode&lt;/a&gt; is Epic’s take on games like &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;, where players make their own worlds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QSDv7l"&gt;Epic’s ability to clone &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; opens the door to other hand-crafted modes mimicking nearly any genre or popular title. A &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; kart racer? A &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; strategy game? A &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; RPG? I wouldn’t be surprised if Epic made any or all of those at some point in the future. And presumably, these hypothetical modes would be offered for free right inside the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; app you and 350 million registered players (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21249497/fortnite-350-million-registered-players-hours-played-april"&gt;as of April 2020&lt;/a&gt;) already have, meaning you could easily try them out just by downloading the game’s latest update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eRBWMR"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Impostors&lt;/em&gt; mode also indicates that Epic is starting to look past rivals like &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;. While &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; has been more than just its core battle royale mode for some time, with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;spectacular&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616664/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-worldbuilding-storytelling"&gt;concerts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21241414/fortnite-party-royale-ltm-mode"&gt;the violence-free Party Royale mode&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21301688/fortnite-party-royale-christopher-nolan-movies-date"&gt;even in-game movie screenings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Impostors&lt;/em&gt; suggests Epic could bring the most popular games into &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, too, to try and keep you from playing anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d4INo6"&gt;Just as Netflix sees its key rivals as things &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/17/18187357/netflix-views-numbers-disney-amazon-fortnite-youtube-earnings-bird-box"&gt;like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://marketrealist.com/2020/07/netflix-sarandos-co-ceo-tiktok-threat/"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, it appears that Epic now views &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; as competing with anything else that can command your time. To succeed against everything, the game has to become everything — an impostor through and through.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US COVID-19 data has never been good enough  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A Pop Up Covid-19 Vaccination Site As Cases Rise in Florida" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MlUBf_RU0kpBClm1ec0ECECfNPM=/208x0:5053x3230/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69752115/1234713347.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dp8UNm"&gt;When American experts first started to worry that COVID-19 vaccines weren’t working quite as well against delta as they did against earlier coronavirus strains, they didn’t have much domestic data to go on. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was only collecting data on post-vaccination COVID-19 cases if they led to hospitalization or death — the agency &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/09/america-is-flying-blind-when-it-comes-to-the-delta-variant"&gt;wasn’t doing big-picture tracking&lt;/a&gt; of COVID-19 in vaccinated people. Only a few states and counties were collecting and publicizing that information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Hd5Uq"&gt;The CDC was doing some analysis, but it wasn’t sharing the information quickly, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/08/18/cdc-data-delay-delta-variant/"&gt;frustrating experts&lt;/a&gt; who hoped for a more dynamic picture of how the delta variant was affecting vaccinated people. The agency finally released some data this week as part of the justification for pushing booster doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, but the scope was still limited and came too late. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HuSSac"&gt;“It’s not acceptable how long it takes for this data to be made available,” a senior CDC official &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/08/18/cdc-data-delay-delta-variant/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. For the most part, US experts had to rely on vaccine data from other countries: Israel, Canada, the United Kingdom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F5lxXv"&gt;Data, or lack thereof, has been one of the biggest challenges in the US COVID-19 response. From the early days of the outbreak, health departments have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22627004/public-health-data-gaps-fax-email-politico"&gt;struggled to collect information&lt;/a&gt; on cases, and often only had delayed and incomplete data. Most clinical trials investigating COVID-19 &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/30/health/covid-drugs-antivirals.html"&gt;treatments&lt;/a&gt; were small and couldn’t deliver conclusive answers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2SccQm"&gt;Part of the problem was that the US has a fragmented public health system, and data is siloed off in individual hospitals. Places with national health systems, like the UK, were in a better position to understand big-picture trends through the pandemic — its National Health Service was able to run a &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22397833/dexamethasone-coronavirus-uk-recovery-trial"&gt;multisite clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; to look at COVID-19 treatments, which eventually identified treatments that saved lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7YIAlK"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;CDC is a retrospective agency, it’s not in business of gathering real-time info that requires analytical work and providing partial answers. We relied on it to do these things mistakenly judging it’s capabilities, resources, culture. We need to make reforms going forward.&lt;/p&gt;— Scott Gottlieb, MD (@ScottGottliebMD) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ScottGottliebMD/status/1426890092036202499?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mAUpob"&gt;Over 18 months later, the problems in the US persist. Officials don’t have a good grasp on where and how COVID-19 is spreading in certain groups, former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb outlined &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ScottGottliebMD/status/1426887512216190978"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. The CDC isn’t equipped to collect real-time data, he notes. That constrains the country’s response. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LCDZd1"&gt;Now, those problems are making it harder to understand the dynamics of coronavirus infections from the delta variant in vaccinated people in the US. Delta has only been the dominant coronavirus variant in the US for around two months, so it could take some time for the patterns to emerge. But officials are moving forward with booster plans based only on the limited information they have now. Hopefully, the data will eventually catch up with their actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TXuoMq"&gt;Here’s what else happened this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="u3vy4u"&gt;Research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hIQOrD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/08/18/u-s-decision-on-covid-19-booster-shots-baffles-and-upsets-some-scientists/"&gt;U.S. officials’ decision on Covid-19 booster shots baffles — and upsets — some scientists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many experts say that the available data on vaccine efficacy doesn’t support the decision to offer boosters to everyone. The shots still hold strong against severe disease. (Helen Branswell / &lt;em&gt;Stat News&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nMUqwW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/16/health/covid-kids-toddlers-transmission.html"&gt;Babies and Toddlers Spread Virus in Homes More Easily Than Teens, Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Young children, who can’t be isolated when they’re sick, are more likely to pass COVID-19 onto other people living in their household. (Emily Anthes / &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wb8PNu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02259-2"&gt;Delta’s rise is fuelled by rampant spread from people who feel fine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;The virus starts building up around two days before people start showing symptoms of COVID-19. Most infections happen in the pre-symptomatic phase, making it harder to stop the spread. (Smriti Mallapaty / &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is shutting down its Android Auto mobile app in favor of Google Assistant </title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7lzNnr2AQmobn4BGu0Y3LZpJ4_E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69751811/acastro_180413_1777_android_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="grFFuz"&gt;Google has confirmed it’s shutting down the standalone “Android Auto for Phone Screens” app with Android 12. Instead, anyone who wants a driving-friendly interface for their Android phone should use the &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/assistant/answer/10217503"&gt;Google Assistant driving mode&lt;/a&gt;, which is available within Google Maps, or the native Android Auto interface available in select cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DI7gUa"&gt;“For those who use the on phone experience (Android Auto mobile app), they will be transitioned to Google Assistant driving mode,” Google said in a statement. “Starting with Android 12, Google Assistant driving mode will be the built-in mobile driving experience. We have no further details to share at this time.” Google says that the experience isn’t changing for anyone using Android Auto in compatible cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Nq181o"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Google Assistant driving mode will be the built-in mobile driving experience”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LCrYJg"&gt;Google’s confirmation came after &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-auto-for-phone-screens-killed/#update1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that some users were seeing a message in the Android Auto for Phone Screens app that said the service is “now only available for car screens” and pointed phone users towards Google Assistant driving mode as a replacement. Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/17/android-auto-phone-screen-stops-working/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the Android Auto for Phone Screens app now says it’s incompatible with Pixel devices running Android 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="on6LzG"&gt;Android Auto’s app history is a little bit messy, but this is a move that’s been a long time coming. The saga started in 2019, when Google decided to &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/androidauto/answer/9468382?hl=en"&gt;build most of Android Auto’s features into Android 10&lt;/a&gt; as a system level feature, and discontinue the previously downloadable app. That’s fine for anyone with an Android Auto-compatible car, but anyone with an older vehicle would have lost access to the driving-friendly interface available directly on their phone. Bad times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PLcoTy"&gt;Google’s plan for these users was a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/7/18535644/google-assistant-waze-driving-mode-shortcut-features-release-date-io-2019"&gt;Google Assistant driving mode&lt;/a&gt;, but this software was delayed, and despite being announced in 2019, it only started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/18/21521549/google-assistant-driving-mode-available-android"&gt;rolling out late last year&lt;/a&gt; (it’s subsequently &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/16/google-assistant-driving-mode-international/"&gt;expanded internationally&lt;/a&gt;). That meant Google effectively needed a stopgap measure, and the clunkily named &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/5/20949523/android-auto-standalone-app-android-10-users"&gt;Android Auto for Phone Screens app&lt;/a&gt; was born. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Dieter Bohn did a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20850630/google-android-auto-assistant-maps-driving"&gt;great rundown of the situation&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 if you want to learn more. &lt;/p&gt;
