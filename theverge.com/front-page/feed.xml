    <title>The Palm Pre home button was the first to be the last</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l3zOV8whYGjc86JbBpmaliPhGlg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69518062/dbohn_210622_4651_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The original Palm Pre.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="naZwsh"&gt;Physical home buttons are all but extinct on modern smartphones, and the Palm Pre ended them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwC9oK"&gt;It’s not hard to notice that smartphones have steadily shed their buttons throughout the years: keyboards, numpads, call and hang up buttons, directional navigation keys, and more have all fallen to the wayside in favor of more versatile touchscreens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2vucRL"&gt;In 2007, the iPhone — with its then-revolutionary 3.5-inch multitouch display — helped to push that trend along by reducing navigation down to a single home button. But even as touchscreen sizes grew and buttons fell away, the humble home button stubbornly stuck around. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/2/28/18244645/apple-home-button-user-interface-iphone-7-fake"&gt;Apple wouldn’t ditch the button&lt;/a&gt; for over a decade, when the iPhone X arrived in 2017.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qSuMvH"&gt;But it was the Palm Pre, and its largely unnecessary center button, that showed home buttons could be removed for good.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M8Hu0k23dB3Ulpv_sx22hS6AC3M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22687394/dbohn_210622_4651_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pre’s home button (left) and the button-less Pre 2 (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XSwpP4"&gt;The original Pre, launched in 2009, may not have seemed like the harbinger of home button doom. After all, the Pre &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; a home button, at least for its first iteration. But crucially, the Pre’s home button was effectively a vestigial organ — an appendix that evolution hadn’t quite managed to weed out just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tOma6B"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The first device to prove that gesture-based navigation could work&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ptp40g"&gt;Pressing the Pre’s home button did exactly one thing: brought up webOS’s “Card” app switcher, something that could also be accomplished with a swipe gesture. Everything else about the Pre’s navigation was focused instead on the touch-sensitive area around the button. Gestures were used to return home, go back a screen, pull up a dock of favorite apps, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ODSrpW"&gt;The home button itself served more as training wheels for users used to seeing one on other touchscreen devices, rather than a necessary part of the user experience, one that was wholly optional to the actual function of the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wmxlaN"&gt;It’s no wonder that just a year later the Pre 2 would go on to skip the nearly useless button entirely in favor of an illuminated LED strip for gestures. That familiar-looking white pillbox has been aped by the modern iterations of both iOS and Android for multitasking gestures. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l1BGztDEjtgjW8jLrUt6LGbni7A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22687393/dbohn_210622_4651_0002.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="T5dhxV"&gt;There were, of course, issues with Palm’s implementation: some of the gestures were unintuitive, and for users making the jump from a more traditional Palm device, there were a lot of new concepts that had to be learned from scratch. Conversely, more modern smartphones benefit from the advantage of users who are far more familiar with touchscreen interfaces, along with far more real estate to make those gestures work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7iG3NY"&gt;But while the Pre would ultimately fail, it still stands out in history as arguably the device with the ultimate home button in the history of smartphones — and as the first device to prove that gesture-based navigation could actually succeed in replacing home buttons. And taking a look at any popular smartphone in 2021, it’s clear that at least in that regard, Palm was way ahead of the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hSUc2W"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNF1f5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Pavilion Aero 13 is HP’s lightest consumer laptop ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The HP Pavilion Aero 13 open on a desk. The screen displays a large wave. To the right is a cup of pencils, pens, and scissors. Above is a shelf with notebooks and a protractor." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aQTqa8274Grly41vMQOz5RWJAeE=/0x298:1000x965/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69517882/HP_Pavilion_Aero_13_Laptop_PC_NaturalSilver.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the HP Pavilion Aero 13.&lt;/em&gt; | HP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xk5yit"&gt;HP has announced the Pavilion Aero 13, the lightest consumer laptop yet. It has a maximum weight of 2.18 pounds (0.987 kg), making it one of the most portable laptops you can buy of any type or size. It’s also powered by AMD’s Ryzen 5000 mobile processors, up to a Ryzen 7 5800U. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pl8jF0"&gt;On the outside, the Aero is available in four colors: pale rose gold, warm gold, ceramic white, and natural silver. Weight isn’t the only thing getting slimmed down, as this is the first Pavilion with a 90 percent screen-to-body ratio. The Pavilion has traditionally been HP’s budget line, with a bigger and clunkier design than the company’s pricier lines, but HP has been shrinking the bezels and chassis footprints on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276459/hps-pavilion-x360-convertible-laptops-streaming"&gt;a number of its models&lt;/a&gt; this year. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The HP Pavilion Aero 13 closed on a red background. To the right is a pair of pink sunglasses." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PwnT_swd6bB21J2MOSvPfxnKyJg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22686896/HP_Pavilion_Aero_13_Laptop_PC_NaturalSilver_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screen will reach 400 nits of brightness.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QFGxre"&gt;It’s not surprising that this product will be AMD-only. The latest Ryzen generation has been running more efficiently than competing Intel chips across the board. Since they require less heavy-duty cooling to run well, the 5000 generation has enabled manufacturers to put out impressively thin and light systems this year. Razer was able to release its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22548663/razer-blade-14-review-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-9-5900hx-nvidia-rtx-3070"&gt;thinnest and lightest Blade laptop ever&lt;/a&gt; with AMD’s Ryzen 9 5900HX inside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i95U4P"&gt;Ryzen chips are also a reasonable fit for the Pavilion line, since many have been priced lower than comparable 11th Gen Intel chips recently. While AMD systems have been making their way into higher-priced tiers over the past few years, price is still one of the primary areas where they’re competitive. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22538867/asus-zenbook-13-oled-review-amd-ryzen-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus’ Ryzen-powered Zenbook 13 OLED&lt;/a&gt; has made a statement as one of the most affordable OLED systems currently on the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EYFIGD"&gt;The Aero 13 OLED will be available in July for a starting price of $749. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PY3fJn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0z65Hs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony acquires Returnal developer Housemarque, hints Bluepoint is next</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AJdqfSWyHBXnI_APN54LNuUKy4o=/85x0:1003x612/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69517791/Welcome_Housemarque_210628_scaled.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4SQN47"&gt;Sony has acquired Housemarque, the Finnish studio behind recent PS5 exclusive &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/06/29/welcoming-housemarque-to-the-playstation-studios-family/"&gt;the company announced today&lt;/a&gt;. It was announced &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nibellion/status/1409822833631502338?s=21"&gt;with a tweet&lt;/a&gt; which suggests Sony might also be about to acquire Bluepoint Games, the studio behind the recent &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt; remaster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o40aks"&gt;In a blog post announcing the acquisition, PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst said that the studio “is one with incredible vision, capable of creating memorable new games that resonate with our community.” Although Housemarque has produced games across multiple platforms including PC, iOS, and the Xbox 360, the majority of its recent titles have been exclusive to Sony’s platforms. Prior to &lt;em&gt;Returnal &lt;/em&gt;it was best known for the &lt;em&gt;Super Stardust &lt;/em&gt;games, which have appeared on the PS3, PS4, and PSP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="E59MNw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Thrilled to announce &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Housemarque?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Housemarque&lt;/a&gt; has officially joined PlayStation Studios! The extremely talented studio with a proven track record and best-in-class gameplay has a bright future and we couldn’t be more excited to be part of it! &lt;a href="https://t.co/B47YlfmgCs"&gt;pic.twitter.com/B47YlfmgCs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Hermen Hulst (@hermenhulst) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hermenhulst/status/1409818077349306374?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CJKty3"&gt;In a statement, Housemarque’s co-founder and managing director Ilari Kuittinen welcomed the acquisition, saying that it “gives our studio a clear future and a stable opportunity to continue delivering on gameplay centric approaches, while still experimenting with new methods of narrative delivery and pushing the boundaries of this modern artform.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Uqbhcw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;..so apparently PlayStation Japan uploaded the wrong image with their first tweet on Housemarque's acquisition, and it actually mentions a Bluepoint acquisition &lt;a href="https://t.co/yQBHtLbG5c"&gt;pic.twitter.com/yQBHtLbG5c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Nibel (@Nibellion) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Nibellion/status/1409822833631502338?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CHKdhl"&gt;News of the Housemarque acquisition arrived alongside a tweeted image that suggests Sony is about to acquire another studio. It appears that when Sony’s PlayStation Japan Twitter account tried to tweet about the Housemarque acquisition, it accidentally used a promotional image announcing an acquisition of Bluepoint Games instead. The high quality of the image suggests it’s official but premature. The original tweet and image have since been pulled, but &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Nibellion/status/1409822833631502338"&gt;Twitter user Nibel&lt;/a&gt; has verified via TweetDeck that the image came from the official PlayStation Japan account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fSq44d"&gt;Bluepoint Games is another studio with a long history of collaborations with Sony. As well as the recent &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt; remaster, it’s also remastered other PlayStation titles like &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Colossus&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; trilogy, and &lt;em&gt;Flower&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x739OV"&gt;Sony’s acquisition(s) comes as its main console rival, Microsoft, has been on a spending spree of its own. In recent years the Xbox manufacturer has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22319124/microsoft-bethesda-acquisition-complete-finalized"&gt;acquired Bethesda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/10/17446914/microsoft-studios-the-initiative-undead-labs-playground-games-ninja-theory-compulsion-games-xbox-e3"&gt;Ninja Theory, Playground Games&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/9/18658920/microsoft-acquires-double-fine-psychonauts-e3-2019"&gt;Double Fine&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/10/18082922/microsoft-xbox-inxile-obsidian-entertainment-studio-acquisition"&gt;Obsidian Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;. Acquisitions like these are important for filling Microsoft’s and Sony’s consoles with exclusive games to entice would-be buyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FySpK2"&gt;However, in an &lt;a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/housemarque-sony-playstation-acquisition"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;GQ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Hulst denied that Sony is in an “arms race” with Microsoft. “I’m always looking for people that have a similar set of values, similar creative ambitions and work very well with our team that we can further invest in and help grow as creators,” Hulst said, “It’s not like we’re going around and just making random acquisitions.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dell’s versatile UltraSharp 4K webcam uses AI to keep you in the frame</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oQG3mCMs6JjEWjaENsSJ3h-o_IM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69517763/dellultrasharphero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The UltraSharp shown on its two included mounts.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Dell&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qsr9Lw"&gt;Dell has launched the high-end UltraSharp webcam that costs $199.99 and is available now worldwide. Its cylindrical design is reminiscent of Apple’s old but iconic iSight external webcam, but its features are aimed to compete with Logitech’s Brio and other modern 4K-ready webcams. In addition, it aims to serve as a more affordable and easier-to-set up alternative to mounting a DSLR camera behind your monitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mzfRRQ"&gt;The UltraSharp is a USB-C webcam that houses a Sony STARVIS CMOS 8.3-megapixel sensor. It’s capable of recording or streaming in 4K at 30 or 24 frames per second and in 1080p or 720p at 24, 30, or 60 frames per second. You can tweak the field of view (FOV) between 65 degrees for a close crop, 78 degrees, or 90 degrees for the widest crop available. The webcam has a bevy of auto-light correction features that aim to make your picture look good regardless of your lighting. It supports up to 5x digital zoom and has autofocus. Dell claims the UltraSharp offers the best image quality in its class. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Dell UltraSharp webcam" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jXSJjkk5gQQamRK8CVNjVcjzn10=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22686315/dellwebcam.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Dell&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The USB-C cable can be routed through the monitor mount for easy cable management. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tVCN06"&gt;This webcam can work without drivers on Windows 10 or macOS computers, but many of its features are accessible only in Dell’s Peripheral Manager software. One of the most appealing features that the software unlocks is the AI auto-framing mode that lets it follow your movements to keep you centered in the frame. The webcam doesn’t actually move, but the video feed appeared to pan and deliver smooth, seamless motion tracking during a live demo shown to &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; (The GIF below is an accurate portrayal.) A similar feature has appeared recently in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22429549/amazon-echo-show-8-5-camera-update-price-kids-edition"&gt;Amazon’s new Echo Show smart displays&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;the latest iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s a perk that currently sets Dell’s webcam apart from the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Dell UltraSharp webcam" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ffL0E1_lkOlQpExUrZUtjgvU6n4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22686368/dellultrasharpAI.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFdZZ4"&gt;Other noteworthy features include its infrared sensor that can log you in to your PC via Windows Hello facial recognition. It also has a proximity sensor that, on Dell PCs, can take advantage of the company’s Express Sign-In feature that can log you in and out automatically depending on whether you’re sitting at your PC or not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GxQWA6"&gt;The UltraSharp includes a standard monitor mount as well as a tripod mount. It can connect magnetically to either one. (There’s also a magnetic lens cap included.) The monitor mount seems like it’ll be a solid option for most — even for people who own monitors with the slimmest of bezels. And for streamers or people who are looking for a specific angle, it’s great to have the option to easily put it on a tripod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XPpHYO"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t2WVqBHV10I?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3ajYXn"&gt;But $199.99 isn’t cheap for a webcam, and I haven’t even gotten to its biggest omission: it doesn’t have an internal microphone. Dell said it was focused primarily on optics for this model, so you’ll need to source your own microphone — whether that’s a standalone USB or XLR mic or a headset. That might be a deal-breaker for some, but mic aside, this one’s stacked with enough thoughtful features that might make it worth the price still. We’ll be testing this one, so check back for more in-depth impressions soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nothing’s debut wireless earbuds will be announced on July 27</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gvv9DZU-lRuRSurGMinVg49rpEo=/151x0:1771x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69517591/Global_Landscape.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nothing&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4IDnYd"&gt;Tech startup Nothing will announce its debut pair of true wireless earbuds, the Nothing Ear (1), at 9AM ET on July 27th, the company’s founder &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/getpeid/status/1409829386308624388"&gt;Carl Pei announced today&lt;/a&gt;. The launch comes around a month later than the June launch window &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22428397/nothing-ear-1-true-wireless-earbuds-launch-carl-pei"&gt;Nothing previously announced&lt;/a&gt;, after Pei &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/getpeid/status/1405911656929054730"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that the company was delaying the launch because it had “a few things left to finalize.” Carl Pei is best known as one of the co-founders of OnePlus, a company he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519785/oneplus-carl-pei-departure"&gt;parted ways with last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KhkhK"&gt;Details about the Nothing Ear (1) are thin, but the company has teased several details about them over the past few months. We know they’ll have a “stripped-down aesthetic” featuring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22320915/nothing-true-wireless-earbuds-teenage-engineering-concept-1"&gt;transparent materials&lt;/a&gt; in their construction, and that they’ve been designed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298802/nothing-teenage-engineering-swedish-design-founding-partner-audio-headphones"&gt;in collaboration with Teenage Engineering&lt;/a&gt;. But Nothing has been far less forthcoming about the earbuds’ tech specs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="inZCMs"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Are you ready for the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SoundOfChange?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#SoundOfChange&lt;/a&gt;? The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nothing?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Nothing&lt;/a&gt; ear (1) Launch Event is on 27 July! &lt;a href="https://t.co/1qZaJaKQvD"&gt;https://t.co/1qZaJaKQvD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Carl Pei (@getpeid) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/getpeid/status/1409829386308624388?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xD70jF"&gt;Wireless earbuds are the first product category that Nothing is planning to tackle, but Carl Pei has talked about moving into more areas over time. In an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22250653/nothing-brand-oneplus-carl-pei-announcement-consumer-technology-smart-devices"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in January, Pei said the company eventually hopes to build up an entire ecosystem of interconnected devices. “The ultimate vision of having everything connected in a seamless way, that can only happen when you have multiple categories of products,” Pei said. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Messages will auto-delete OTPs and sort like Gmail, but only in India</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/onctS4v3GwU4qQE6IDRPcAeu6Zg=/0x0:2100x1400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69517507/messages_otp.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OTPs can be set to delete automatically after 24 hours.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YeUvXY"&gt;Google is updating its Messages app in India to allow it to delete one-time passwords (OTPs) automatically, to stop the single-use codes from clogging up your inbox, &lt;a href="https://india.googleblog.com/2021/06/messages-makes-it-easier-to-help-you.html"&gt;the company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. Alongside it, Google also says the app will be able to sort messages into categories, keeping your personal correspondence away from notifications about bank transactions and special offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YLi3vj"&gt;As someone that &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; exclusively uses WhatsApp for personal communication, my phone’s default texting app is typically a graveyard of six-digit codes, which by design become useless mere minutes after they’re received. Having the ability to automatically delete them after 24 hours should make Messages less cluttered and more usable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rZNhyjUvXV4mlQQqMp6f5TOsLqA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22688245/msedge_wB2FkrvQhQ.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Source: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Gmail-style categories.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pFLB42"&gt;It’s a similar story when it comes to categorizing messages. Google says it’s using a machine learning model to sort messages into categories like personal, transactions, OTPs, and offers, which sounds very similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/29/4374306/gmail-declares-war-on-inbox-clutter-with-new-tabbed-design-for"&gt;what it already offers for emails in Gmail&lt;/a&gt;. The sorting process happens on-device, Google says, so it should still work while offline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FZsUAu"&gt;Google says the new features will roll out “over the coming weeks” in India, on Android phones running version 8 and above. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment on whether the feature could see a release outside of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google launches new search tool to help combat food insecurity</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TeA5Lpc6KfhyHYRykevgGBjiIoE=/226x0:1645x946/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69517398/google_food_support.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google is working with non-profits to aggregate 90,000 locations with free food support across all 50 states .&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bUA5vq"&gt;Google announced a new website designed to be a “one-stop shop” for people with food insecurity. The &lt;a href="http://g.co/findfoodsupport"&gt;“Find Food Support” site&lt;/a&gt; includes a food locator tool powered by Google Maps which people can use to search for their nearest food bank, food pantry, or school lunch program pickup site in their community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9rGbnt"&gt;Google is working with non-profit groups like No Kid Hungry and FoodFinder, as well as the US Department of Agriculture, to aggregate 90,000 locations with free food support across all 50 states — with more locations to come. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cCLMyV41Dh9-ItVHK31NVqJTyu4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22687633/oNi6GDgn4Vdz5B4W3X383J0AxEvKEnQuLEzgqP1rAR5j7qs818cPe916aCTj7vR_ID_kEXl_x1aZtTyqRB6qi8HHdfncLu07S6BjHTm3637efWRTnpf2Cc_YATCr9JTumsuh3EYiKlFqaqGm5UrcsmvxQQOD_mmo2IZaSCD9KPEUwuc5.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CIJGK1"&gt;The new site is a product of Google’s newly formed &lt;a href="https://blog.x.company/a-new-home-for-project-delta-a39f8286b6d7"&gt;Food for Good team&lt;/a&gt;, formerly known as Project Delta when it was headquartered at Alphabet’s X moonshot division. Project Delta’s mission is to “create a smarter food system,” which includes standardizing data to improve communication between food distributors to curb food waste. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fz5nLx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;90,000 locations with free food support&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UfeKgx"&gt;Food insecurity is defined by the US Department of Agriculture as &lt;a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-us/definitions-of-food-security.aspx"&gt;a lack of consistent access to enough food for an active, healthy life&lt;/a&gt;. The number of people experiencing food insecurity spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic, affecting an estimated 45 million people or &lt;a href="https://www.feedingamerica.org/sites/default/files/2021-03/National%20Projections%20Brief_3.9.2021_0.pdf"&gt;1 in 7 Americans&lt;/a&gt;, including 15 million children. Google says that searches for &lt;a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;amp;geo=US&amp;amp;q=food%20bank%20near%20me"&gt;”food bank near me”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;amp;geo=US&amp;amp;q=%2Fm%2F030gj7"&gt;”Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;amp;geo=US&amp;amp;q=food%20stamps%20application"&gt;”food stamps application,”&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;amp;geo=US&amp;amp;q=school%20lunch%20pickup"&gt;”school lunch pick up”&lt;/a&gt; reached record highs during 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gIwZQ"&gt;In addition to the new food location site, Google is publishing five new videos on YouTube aimed at de-stigmatizing food insecurity. The site will also include links to food support hotlines, state-by-state benefit guides, and information for specific communities, such as seniors, families and children, and military families. Visitors can also find information about how you can donate food, time and money to support those in need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MBp5IG"&gt;“We want people to know they’re not alone,” Emily Ma, head of Food for Good, &lt;a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/connecting-people-to-food-support/"&gt;says in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cwDTqr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ArltOW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 11 includes new Dynamic Refresh Rate feature to save laptop battery life</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9xHlDGHI5iDWeXov8lB6NJgCM9g=/116x0:1370x836/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69517393/Windows_11_Generic_Laptop_Device_Render.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e9wRVy"&gt;Microsoft is introducing a new Dynamic Refresh Rate (DRR) feature in Windows 11 that’s designed to save laptop battery life and boost refresh rates when they’re really needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j3j9An"&gt;A number of laptops now ship with 120Hz and beyond displays, which make Windows feel a lot smoother across scrolling, animations, and inking. While the added smoothness feels great, running at higher refresh rates takes its toll on battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4XSRSk"&gt;In Windows 10 you have to decide between 60Hz and 120Hz on a laptop, and it’s a static choice. Microsoft is now building DRR into Windows 11, which will allow a laptop to dynamically adjust its refresh rate. “This means that Windows 11 will seamlessly switch between a lower refresh rate and a higher refresh rate based on what you’re doing on your PC,” &lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/dynamic-refresh-rate/"&gt;explains Ana Marta&lt;/a&gt;, a program manager on the graphics team at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kXDHX6"&gt;You’ll need a laptop that supports DRR and 120Hz or above refresh rates, and the feature will mean that regular tasks like writing emails or documents will run at 60Hz, and then DRR will kick in and boost the screen to 120Hz for inking and scrolling. Apps will need to support DRR, and during the Windows 11 preview DRR is limited to just Office for the scrolling boost. Office, Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Whiteboard, Microsoft Photos, Snip &amp;amp; Sketch, Drawboard PDF, Microsoft Sticky Notes, Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Illustrator, Microsoft To Do, and Inkodo will all support DRR for inking, too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/puq8WTCCBXnv0WuhVADuGXL_vfo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22688228/DRR_UI_6.22.2021.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new DRR option in Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8tEULH"&gt;DRR shouldn’t be confused with VRR (variable refresh rate), particularly because DRR doesn’t apply to games and is focused purely on Windows apps. Windows 11 will be a requirement for DRR, alongside a laptop that supports a variable refresh rate of at least 120Hz. You’ll also need a new graphics driver (WDDM 3.0), and Microsoft says it’s working with its graphics display partners to enable DRR on a variety of devices running the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22553639/microsoft-windows-11-download-available-preview-features"&gt;Windows 11 preview&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6IuvYr"&gt;Where DRR looks like a natural fit is with Microsoft’s Surface line of hardware, particularly thanks to Microsoft’s focus on enabling DRR in inking scenarios. No Surface devices currently ship with a 120Hz display, but this could be an early sign that Microsoft may finally deliver a Surface tablet display that can compete with Apple’s ProMotion displays on the iPad.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google beefs up Play Store developer verification in response to scams</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vMy11f4h-yYq1mFelvh0OfUcesA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69517335/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5MaO2a"&gt;Google is working to enhance the integrity of the Play Store by adding new restrictions and safeguards to developer accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RLVzyr"&gt;Google Play Store developers will soon have to verify their email address and phone number and provide extra details like a physical address in an attempt to increase security and ensure that accounts are being created by ‘real people,’ &lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/06/play-dev-id-requirements-2-step.html"&gt;the company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. Developers will also be required to use two-step verification. The search giant says it’s making the changes “to keep Google Play safe and secure and to better serve our developer community,” and to “make sure that every account is created by a real person with real contact details.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rrGIDd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://therecord.media/google-to-require-2fa-and-a-physical-address-from-android-app-devs/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Record&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the announcement coincides with the emergence of a cottage industry of sellers who’ll create large amounts of developer accounts for others to use to upload malware and other scammy apps to the Play Store. A screenshot of a cybercrime forum post published by &lt;em&gt;The Record&lt;/em&gt; shows these accounts being sold for $89 each. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fR6qGZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“To keep Google Play safe and secure and to better serve our developer community”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dxGH8M"&gt;Meanwhile, the two-step verification requirement should make it harder for scammers to break into and steal legitimate developers accounts. It mirrors a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422778/google-accounts-enabling-two-step-verification-default"&gt;similar change the search giant announced&lt;/a&gt; for regular Google accounts earlier this year, where it will now enable two-factor authentication by default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyhMSH"&gt;The changes are significant compared to Google’s current developer account policies that only require new signups to provide an email address and phone number. Details like a physical address “will not be public-facing,” the company says, and are solely to “to help us confirm your identity and communicate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JFKlqY"&gt;Google is introducing the new requirements in stages. It says that, from today, account owners will have the option of setting their account type as personal or business and verifying their contact details. Then, in August, all new signups will be required to follow these same steps when they create their accounts, and to use two-step verification. “Later this year” the changes will be fully implemented for all existing accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c8BllN"&gt;The changes come amidst a wider crackdown on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22411560/google-play-store-listings-scammy-emoji-deals-misleading-assets-guidelines-policy"&gt;scammy apps on the Play Store&lt;/a&gt;, which will prohibit developers from using cheap tactics in their listings to incentivize installs. App listings will no longer be able to use eye-catching features like all-caps or emoji in their titles, or include phrases like “download now.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CrdxmN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LYuFJF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
