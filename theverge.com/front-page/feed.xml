    <title>Litecoin price jumps 20 percent after hoax links the cryptocurrency and Walmart </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Rn8435"&gt;The Litecoin cryptocurrency saw its price spike by as much as 20 percent on Monday after a fake press release claimed Walmart would begin accepting Litecoin as payment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MJyULD"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/09/13/2295879/0/en/Walmart-Announces-Major-Partnership-With-Litecoin-LTC.html"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; posted to GlobeNewswire linked to a non-functioning website, and there was no evidence of any Securities and Exchange Commission filing, which would have been expected since Walmart is publicly traded. Walmart’s official newsroom never included the release, and the company typically uses &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210823005697/en/Walmart-Launches-Walmart-GoLocal-a-New-Delivery-as-a-Service-Business"&gt;Business Wire&lt;/a&gt; to distribute releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FST50B"&gt;Several news outlets published reports based on the hoax press release, and a short time later &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LTC-USD?p=LTC-USD&amp;amp;.tsrc=fin-srch"&gt;Litecoin’s price jumped&lt;/a&gt;, along with those of other cryptocurrencies, before quickly falling back to the previous levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nbuq5b"&gt;It’s not yet clear who may have been behind the hoax press release, but a Walmart spokesperson &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/13/walmart-to-accept-payments-with-cryptocurrencies-using-litecoin.html"&gt;confirmed to CNBC&lt;/a&gt; that the news announcement was fake. GlobeNewswire and Walmart didn’t immediately reply to requests for comment from&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JjwmH5"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hS5rwH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram is testing new ‘Favorites’ to bring order to your chaotic feed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZKNcTBubP5QtM-Fi0UGPO_qALP4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69842022/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yFl5h3"&gt;You’re on Instagram looking for your best friend’s daily dog update, but you have to scroll endlessly through a sea of posts you care little about, and probably forget what you’re looking for in the first place. After a few extra annoyed scrolls, you close the app in frustration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOJ2Yd"&gt;It seems Instagram is well aware of your plight, because it is quietly testing out a solution for your messy feed called “Favorites.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ph25cH"&gt;According to Alessandro Paluzzi, a mobile developer who first &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1435919581277609989?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;posted about the new feature on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, Favorites lets you categorize your most important Instagram accounts (friends and creators) as your priorities, so that their posts will land “higher” in your feed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dhrAp6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Instagram?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Instagram&lt;/a&gt; is working on "Favorites"  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ℹ️ Posts from your favorites are shown higher in feed. &lt;a href="https://t.co/NfBd8v4IHR"&gt;pic.twitter.com/NfBd8v4IHR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Alessandro Paluzzi (@alex193a) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1435919581277609989?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3ZMmGi"&gt;If this feature sounds familiar, it’s because Instagram was testing a different &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/23/15856858/instagram-favorites-private-sharing-friends-list"&gt;Favorites feature back in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, which you let you limit the exact audience for each post. For example, you could share your wedding photo with just your designated favorites, rather than with your entire following. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="74JCiE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new feature gives you more control over who you see first in your feed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Yc6osZ"&gt;The 2021 iteration of Favorites, however, is about giving you more control over your feed — by telling Instagram which accounts are most important to you. After all, you may follow a bunch of different brands and creators on your account, but you don’t necessarily prioritize their content on the same level as your closest friends and families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NkjEUC"&gt;Currently, Instagram ranks the order of your feed by the most recent and shared posts from the people you follow, plus other “signals” like how likely you’ll engage with a post, according to the company’s June 2021 &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/shedding-more-light-on-how-instagram-works"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about its algorithm. While you may “like” many posts you see, those may not be the content you’re actually looking for, but might be sending Instagram all the wrong signals on what you actually want to see in your feed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="treq2k"&gt;It’s not clear whether this Favorites feature will become an official feature at all or if it will change before it’s rolled out more broadly. For now, Instagram says it “is an internal prototype that’s still in development, and not testing externally.” Perhaps in the future, you just might see this feature in your account menu, just below &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/30/18117718/instagram-close-friends-stories-favorites"&gt;“Close Friends”&lt;/a&gt; — a feature that lets you control who you share your Stories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cvg7r8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, September 13th, 10:42AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Article updated with comment from Instagram.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Brydge’s excellent iPad Pro keyboards are $50 off at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GisnuiIf0xksBe0mmAhpgxxji2g=/159x0:1881x1148/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69851430/DSC00765.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4gaWNh"&gt;You can do more with your iPad Pro by connecting it to a wireless keyboard, especially one that features a trackpad to help you navigate more like a traditional laptop. Brydge’s Pro Plus wireless keyboards with a trackpad for the 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfzEnLHJyqg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;are $50 off at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Normally $170, the model built for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro is $120. Naturally, the smaller Brydge Pro Plus for the 11-inch iPad Pro costs a bit less. It’s normally $150, but you’ll pay $100 for it now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZuGfkL"&gt;The Brydge Pro Plus is one of a few options available that has a backlit keyboard and a trackpad built in. It connects to your tablet via Bluetooth and recharges via USB-C. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206568/brydge-pro-plus-review-ipad-pro-keyboard-trackpad" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="53gQmx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10750005"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="ZbC6iS"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Galaxy Buds Live review: cool beans|76973" data-volume-uuid="2f0898dea" data-volume-id="76973" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-572" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eaNVny"&gt;Also seeing a steep discount today are Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Live, the company’s bean-shaped wireless earbuds. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-Cancelling-Charging-Included/dp/B089B6Y618?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;At Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, you can score a set for the lowest price yet. Originally $170, they’re just $105 new today in the color of your choosing. In our review, Chris Welch notes that these stand out with a powerful, yet balanced sound and lengthy battery life. Though, the noise cancellation can’t block out a ton of noise, and they might not be a perfect fit if you have very small ears. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (or watch it above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U7Ndwz"&gt;Blue is the only color not available through Amazon, but Best Buy has it &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfzETWiLtNU" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for $120&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1Wx2m1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10685823"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4c510I"&gt;SteelSeries is hosting a member-only 20th anniversary sale on gaming mice, keyboards, headsets, and accessories. If you have an account with the site (making one is free), you can save a considerable amount of money on an upgrade for your PC or console setup. I suggest that you &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsteelseries.com%2Fgaming-sales&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F9%2F13%2F22671298%2Fbrydge-ipad-wireless-keyboard-steelseries-samsung-galaxy-buds-live-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;check out the full list of discounted products here&lt;/a&gt;, but for some hand-picked recommendations, its Aerox 3 Wireless mouse with a lightweight design, waterproofing, and USB-C charging is $70 (usually $100).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GyrAnq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10221749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UdO5Tl"&gt;As for headsets, its Arctis Pro Wireless unfortunately isn’t looped into the anniversary sale, but the wired version is, which is the next best thing. Normally $250, you can get the Arctis Pro plus a GameDAC system included for $180.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QhwtZ3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10750030"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iNQWSY"&gt;Through Thursday, September 16th at 11AM, &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/nioh-the-complete-edition" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nioh: The Complete Edition&lt;/em&gt; is free of charge&lt;/a&gt; on the Epic Games Store. This third-person action game was developed by Team Ninja, known for its excellent and difficult &lt;em&gt;Ninja Gaiden&lt;/em&gt; games. &lt;em&gt;Nioh &lt;/em&gt;is no different in terms of difficulty, though it usually gets compared to games like &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/em&gt; in terms of game mechanics and controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cdIg3O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10750050"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Garmin Venu Sq" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WkP_joAPgkX0QzjLfl8PDlrcBSg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21902348/12_DSCF3105.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Garmin&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6kBP4B"&gt;Lastly, like SteelSeries, Garmin is also hosting an anniversary sale at its site, discounting several of its wrist-based trackers, as well as other accessories. Of note, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbuy.garmin.com%2Fen-US%2FUS%2Fp%2F643260&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F9%2F13%2F22671298%2Fbrydge-ipad-wireless-keyboard-steelseries-samsung-galaxy-buds-live-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Garmin Venu&lt;/a&gt; is $270 (normally $350), while its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbuy.garmin.com%2Fen-US%2FUS%2Fp%2F702902&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F9%2F13%2F22671298%2Fbrydge-ipad-wireless-keyboard-steelseries-samsung-galaxy-buds-live-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;high-end Fenix 6 watch&lt;/a&gt; is $450 (normally $550). Check out the rest of the products here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hawkeye’s first trailer introduces the other Hawkeye and some Christmas hijinks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/07xpl7Yh_UQDelW43C5Y3glIDMY=/437x0:1943x1004/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69851305/Screen_Shot_2021_09_13_at_9.17.50_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y0UuwC"&gt;The first trailer for Disney Plus’ &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; has arrived, giving a first look at the surprisingly whimsical Christmastime adventures of Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) — and his new successor, Kate Bishop (Hailee Steinfeld), who also is running around New York City as a preternaturally skilled, purple-clad archer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fS5PM8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; picks up with the titular character after the events of &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt;, which saw Renner’s character flip out into a gothic edgelord style as the murderous vigilante Ronin after his family was wiped from existence in Thanos’ snap. But with things back to normal (and his family restored), Clint just wants to enjoy Christmas with his family: visit New York City, see the new Captain America musical, and enjoy fine dining. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rX9feBatSwn5Lh1mgSZ844MY1Og=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22846462/Screen_Shot_2021_09_13_at_9.21.40_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Marvel&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lucky the Pizza Dog!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IiEhYU"&gt;All that seems to get thrown into a loop, though, when word of a vigilante wielding a bow and wearing what looks a lot like Barton’s old Ronin suit starts running around New York. It turns out to be Steinfeld’s Kate Bishop, who proudly tells Hawkeye that &lt;em&gt;she’s&lt;/em&gt; the “world’s greatest archer.” From there, it seems a whole bunch of Christmastime mayhem ensues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O1C1ak"&gt;The trailer is particularly notable for its surprisingly light tone: Hawkeye has never been one of the &lt;em&gt;Avengers&lt;/em&gt;’ more comedic characters, and his previous outing in particular (which again, saw him get a full sleeve tattoo, a tragic haircut, and an international revenge tour) was grim. The new series is expected to draw on the acclaimed Matt Fraction and David Aja comics run (the Tracksuit Mafia and Lucky the Pizza Dog both appear to be in the trailer), which is known for its lighter tone, more grounded stakes, and habit of routinely taking Clint Barton down a peg or two. Although with the Christmas spirit in the air, it also looks like &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; will be taking some pointers from classics like &lt;em&gt;Home Alone&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Die Hard&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CLKZ1w"&gt;Hawkeye is set to debut on &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1139008/9358?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; for a six-episode season &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22558074/hawkeye-disney-plus-marvel-november-24th-release-date-announcement"&gt;starting on November 24th&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What to expect from Microsoft’s Surface event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2jY_qUbvTjPQay4UnoA-x3sqgtY=/8x0:2392x1589/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69851281/twarren_surfacecomparison_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UFfxxR"&gt;Microsoft is holding a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22651859/microsoft-surface-event-date"&gt;Surface event on September 22nd&lt;/a&gt;, where “the company will talk about devices and Windows 11.” With Windows 11 set to debut on October 5th, we’re expecting to see four new Surface devices showcasing all the latest software features in the new OS. It won’t be all Windows 11, though. Microsoft will also launch a second version of its Surface Duo Android-powered foldable device next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IOL469"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; will be covering all of Microsoft’s Surface hardware announcements starting at 11AM ET / 8AM PT on September 22nd, and here’s what to expect.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-QssjzH62OYRWTUFKaGD0FaYJJM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22329299/twarren_210223_4439_0012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’re expecting a new Surface Pro for Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4Nsjmv"&gt;Surface Pro 8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="TbRXPE"&gt;The Surface Pro is the main flagship Surface device, and one that has existed since the launch of Windows 8 in 2012. Microsoft is now planning to launch a new Surface Pro 8 ready for Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L6eDWp"&gt;We’re not expecting any huge design changes on the Surface Pro 8, simply because Microsoft has already made it clear to businesses that it will maintain the Surface port connectivity and overall hardware design to keep it compatible with docks and accessories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SIWEu8"&gt;That said, a source familiar with Microsoft’s plans tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; the company is planning to ship a larger display on the Surface Pro 8 with smaller bezels. We also understand Microsoft will move to support Thunderbolt on at least one Surface Pro 8 model. This is the first time Microsoft has supported Thunderbolt on any Surface device, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21239517/microsoft-surface-laptops-tablets-thunderbolt-support-security-concerns-comment"&gt;concerns around security&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft is also planning to drop USB-A ports on at least one Surface Pro 8 model, combined with this Thunderbolt support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oC8Dfk"&gt;Microsoft will also ship its Surface Pro 8 with Intel’s latest 11th Gen chips and support for removable SSDs just like the Surface Pro X and Surface Laptop 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZFVya7"&gt;Surface Book 4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6nDRYR"&gt;Microsoft will also debut its big Surface Book design next week. It’s a significant design change that will involve ditching the detachable display in favor of a display that pulls forward to convert between tablet and laptop form factors much &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18196266/hp-spectre-folio-leather-laptop-convertible-2-in-1-review-specs-price-features"&gt;like the HP Elite Folio&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Windows Central&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/surface-book-4"&gt;first reported&lt;/a&gt; these details last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fbBWdB"&gt;This new design also allows Microsoft to upgrade the display on the Surface Book 4. We understand Microsoft will opt for a high refresh rate display on the Surface Book 4, possibly up to as high as 120Hz to support a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555295/microsoft-windows-11-dynamic-refresh-rate-laptops"&gt;new Windows 11 Dynamic Refresh Rate feature&lt;/a&gt;. This will allow the Surface Book 4 to include smooth scrolling, and then switch down to standard 60Hz modes to save battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ERXqk"&gt;This dynamic refresh rate will also help improve inking on the Surface Book 4, as inking will switch to high refresh rates. Microsoft is also improving the Surface Pen that works with the Surface Book 4 to include haptic feedback. It will also snap to the side of the Book 4 and support charging when it’s there.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft will have a new Surface Pro X ready for Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ripPRi"&gt;Surface Pro X&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="EUAG1U"&gt;Microsoft is also expected to launch a new Surface Pro X model next week. While there won’t be any major design changes, we’re expecting a chip upgrade inside and possibly even a high refresh rate display. We’ve heard Microsoft has been testing high refresh rate displays on the Surface Pro or Surface Pro X line, and we’ll find out next week if Microsoft has managed to upgrade its displays on the Surface Pro lineups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JxET4i"&gt;Surface Go 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Bp3ry8"&gt;The final Windows-powered Surface device we’re expecting next week is the Surface Go 3. This smaller Surface will maintain the same smaller footprint design but with a big upgrade inside. We’re told at least one model will ship with Intel’s Core i3 processor, offering better performance for this smaller Surface than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21259805/microsoft-surface-go-2-review-windows-tablet-speed-intel-processor-price"&gt;existing Pentium Gold processor models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xtHemv"&gt;We’re also hoping to see Microsoft move away from models with 4GB of RAM and the slower eMMC storage on base models. The Surface Go 3 looks like a modest upgrade in time for Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Z1LoMx"&gt;Surface Duo 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Ps7dME"&gt;Microsoft also looks set to debut its next Surface phone. The successor to the Surface Duo has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22593992/microsoft-surface-duo-2-triple-camera-leak-photos"&gt;already leaked online&lt;/a&gt;, offering an early glimpse at what to expect. The biggest hardware upgrade will be a triple-camera system that includes ultrawide, telephoto, and standard camera lenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3R3GVd"&gt;The triple-camera system will add a camera bump to the rear of the device, as seen in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22593992/microsoft-surface-duo-2-triple-camera-leak-photos"&gt;leaked photos earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. The Surface Duo 2 should also ship with Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 888 processor, with 5G support and an NFC reader, both of which were missing from the first generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QklcUP"&gt;Microsoft is also making some other minor changes to the hardware on the Surface Duo 2, including moving its fingerprint reader into the power button on the Duo 2 and centering the USB-C port on the right-hand side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EKaBs0"&gt;The real questions around the Surface Duo 2 will be its software changes. The original Surface Duo has struggled with its software support for dual displays, and the successor is expected to ship with Android 11. This should help with some dual-screen support, but Microsoft will also have to offer far better software support to make the Surface Duo 2 successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ql4YB1"&gt;
&lt;p id="m1yMwf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; will be covering all of Microsoft’s Surface hardware announcements on September 22nd. The event kicks off at 11AM ET / 8AM PT, so stay tuned for all the latest Surface news.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>BuddyPhones Cosmos Plus are full-featured travel headphones for kids</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Bluetooth, noise cancellation, volume limiting — these kids’ headphones have it all&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="pzaVj1"&gt;In my home, headphones for my kids tend to be a hand-me-down affair. When I’ve upgraded to something newer or better, I pass down my old cans to my kids to use with their tablets or Chromebooks. But this is less than ideal for a variety of reasons: the older headphones might be lacking features like Bluetooth or noise cancellation; what fits my oversized head likely won’t sit comfortably on their kid-sized domes; and standard headphones don’t have a way to limit their maximum volume, which can lead to hearing loss in children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cvJLhv"&gt;That’s where the BuddyPhones Cosmos Plus come in. The $99.99 Cosmos Plus check off every feature you might want in a pair of kids’ headphones. Bluetooth? Yup. Noise cancellation? You got it. Volume limiting? Three different levels, as a matter of fact. Kid-friendly aesthetics and size? Yes and yes. They come in six different colors with cartoon graphics on the ear cups and have a color-matched hard case, USB-C charging cable, 3.5mm cable, and boom mic all in the box. Though some parents may balk at spending $100 on headphones for their kids, you can’t deny that there’s a lot of value packed in the Cosmos Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Sxoden"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10748998"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bwqA5UvHjUwvWao_UIjC3gWbp5s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22844890/dseifert_4749_buddyphones_cosmos_plus_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cosmos Plus come with a color-matched hard case, charging cable, audio cable, and boom mic in the box.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YBpoOO"&gt;The Cosmos Plus have a colorful, all-plastic design, with a padded headband and plush ear cups. Their 227-gram weight makes it easy for smaller heads to wear them without getting tired, and they have a wide range of size adjustment, from small enough to fit on a five-year-old’s head to big enough to stretch over my larger-than-average adult-sized cranium. Though these won’t compare to higher-end wireless headphones in terms of materials and build quality, they are sturdy and flexible and don’t feel like they will break immediately. The included hard case helps ensure they won’t break when tossed in a bag or not being used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CqtmLZ"&gt;The outside of the ear cups have cartoon graphics — a fairy princess and rainbow unicorn on the models I tested, with a lion, cartoon DJ, scientist, and pirate on the other color options — and you can get them in pink, white, yellow, gray, blue, or dark blue depending on your child’s preference. There’s no mistaking the fact that these were designed with kids in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B4HJeKCYWn3IohffuspSK1HRj-8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22844899/BuddyPhones_Cosmos__combined_all_colors.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Onanoff&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cosmos Plus come in six different color options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YlI2ZF"&gt;I was able to test the Cosmos Plus for a few weeks with my own six-year-old and nine-year-old. We used them at home during their allotted screentime and during two long road trips. For the most part, my kids liked the headphones — there were no complaints of discomfort or inability to hear their videos or games, and they both liked the cartoon designs on the ear cups. My spouse and I appreciated the silence in the car as we crossed hundreds of miles without any bickering or arguing between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9JAF4h"&gt;As for the audio specs, the Cosmos Plus have 40mm neodymium drivers, similar to many other over-ear Bluetooth headphones. The sound quality isn’t going to remotely compete with the best from Apple or Sony — there is bass, but it’s not especially pronounced, and instruments can get lost in the mix easily — but it’s average for this price point and just fine for the music or content kids might use them with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDHwWN"&gt;More importantly, the Cosmos Plus have three levels of volume limiting: 75dbA, 85dbA, and 94dbA. The default mode is the 85dbA setting, which BuddyPhones identifies as the “kids mode.” The lowest setting is meant for the extra-sensitive ears of toddlers (BuddyPhones recommends the Cosmos Plus for ages three and up), while the highest setting is dubbed “travel mode” and is designed to overcome the noise of an airplane engine. Sounds above 85dbA are &lt;a href="https://www.mottchildren.org/health-library/tf4173"&gt;considered harmful and should be limited as much as possible&lt;/a&gt;, according to hearing experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GJy7X5"&gt;All three levels of volume limiting are available when the headphones are used in Bluetooth mode, while the wired mode is set to the 85dbA limit. Changing the mode requires holding volume up and volume down buttons together for two seconds, which will cycle the headphones through the various modes. It’s relatively simple for parents to change but not obvious for kids to do on their own. Though I don’t have the gear to validate BuddyPhones’ specific decibel claims for each level, there is a noticeable difference with how loud each setting allows the headphones to be and the middle setting is certainly lower than the max volume my own headphones reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WZTAVIV477JlWtnKOKdiZu-wnOk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22844892/dseifert_4749_buddyphones_cosmos_plus_4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The right ear cup has the power / pairing button and volume up and down, plus the USB-C charging port.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FeYPU0rkNei3itjCASpPlc_J0y8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22844891/dseifert_4749_buddyphones_cosmos_plus_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the left ear cup is a switch to turn on Study Mode, as well as a button to enable the active noise cancellation, which works in both wired and wireless modes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KlB87z"&gt;Further aiding the volume limiting feature is the Cosmos Plus active noise cancellation, which can be used in either wired or wireless modes. A button on the left ear cup turns the ANC on or off, with a green light indicating it’s on. The noise cancellation won’t silence the world in the way the best noise canceling headphones on the market can, but it is effective enough to help reduce low frequency sounds like a constant fan, road noise, or the drone of an airplane cabin. Having noise cancellation is &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/are-your-kids-headphones-permanently-damaging-their-hearing#How-can-parents-help-protect-young-ears?"&gt;generally recommended for kids&lt;/a&gt;, since it allows them to hear their music or video easier without having to turn up the volume more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PTwGy2"&gt;The Cosmos Plus also have a “Study Mode,” which is activated by a switch on the left ear cup. The company says this boosts the midrange and “lowers down part of the audio spectrum which is not on the voice human spectrum and can impact audibility of a voice.” It’s also designed to make it easier to hear voices when on video calls. The Cosmos Plus have microphones on the ear cup and the detachable boom mic that can be used instead. But neither are particularly great — I tested the Cosmos Plus on a day of Zoom calls for work and had mixed results. My colleagues said the boom mic caused my voice to clip, producing a crackling sound, while the ear cup mic had a noticeable echo.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Caub5TEqr-KWD1R1W7KqN9cJDeg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22844893/dseifert_4749_buddyphones_cosmos_plus_8.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The included boom mic plugs into the USB-C port, but it still doesn’t provide the best voice quality for calls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4UaoI1"&gt;Lastly, the Cosmos Plus have the ability to share their audio with another set of wired headphones, simply by plugging them into the 3.5mm headphone jack on the left ear cup. This is a convenient feature when two kids are watching the same movie on a single device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4rCqlz"&gt;But despite the long list of features, there is room for improvement, particularly in how the Cosmos Plus are powered on and off. Instead of a switch to go from off to on to pairing mode, the Cosmos Plus rely on long-pressing a single button located between the volume buttons. A one-second press will turn the headphones on and flash a blue light; do the same when they are on and the light will flash red and turn the headphones off. But if you hold that button down for a second or two too long and miss the first light flash, the Cosmos Plus will go into their pairing mode and you have to release the button and hold it down again for five seconds before they fully shut off and you can start over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UUK6AFG0mnfTtAdLi-Meg6Spw50=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22844895/dseifert_4749_buddyphones_cosmos_plus_14.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cosmos Plus are light enough and small enough for kids to wear for hours at a time without discomfort.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y1RnCTR_nqlfB58w-3U3tFGIajk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22844897/dseifert_4749_buddyphones_cosmos_plus_12.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even older kids can appreciate the Cosmos Plus’ set of features.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WV91Lv"&gt;This made it difficult for the kids to turn the headphones on and off themselves — nearly every time they wanted to use them my spouse or I would have to handle turning them on and making sure they connected to their tablets correctly. If they didn’t turn the headphones off properly when they were done, they risked running the battery down unnecessarily in the case. Though I appreciate the button controls over the touch swiping that a lot of modern Bluetooth headphones use, the power button should really be a switch instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bEvGPS"&gt;Additionally, while it’s nice to have the noise cancellation separate from the Bluetooth controls, allowing it to work both wired and wirelessly, it also meant that sometimes the kids would remember to turn it on and sometimes they wouldn’t. They would also forget to turn off the ANC when they put the headphones away, since the button is separate from the power button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9oBfS2"&gt;As for battery life, BuddyPhones claims up to 24 hours between charges. I don’t think they lasted quite that long in our testing, but they do last long enough that we only have to charge them once a week or so at home. They also lasted through an 11-hour car ride with plenty of juice to spare, though they were not being used the entire time. Charging is done through the USB-C port and takes a couple of hours to top them up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AYO1yt"&gt;In all, there’s little to complain about with the Cosmos Plus. They have a wide set of features, including the important things like volume limiting and noise cancellation; come in a bunch of colors kids like; and have all the necessary accessories in the box. Though the power button situation can certainly be improved and the microphones aren’t as good as more expensive headphones, the Cosmos Plus are an ideal travel headphone for kids and certainly better than my old hand-me-downs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What to expect from Apple’s iPhone 13 event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l2WnJedXB1sVhcLhp4xichPG_Tk=/166x0:1123x638/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69851117/Screenshot_2021_09_10_7.38.39_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IlLw7g"&gt;Apple’s first fall event is coming up on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22648593/apple-fall-event-2021-date-iphone-macbook-watch"&gt;Tuesday, September 14th, at 1PM ET / 10AM PT&lt;/a&gt;, right around the time when the company typically introduces its latest version of the iPhone. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21508028/apple-iphone-12-pro-max-homepod-mini-event-recap-biggest-announcements"&gt;Like last year’s iPhone event&lt;/a&gt;, Tuesday’s announcements will be entirely digital, in the slick, over-produced style that’s become Apple’s trademark during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Du1zo1"&gt;Rumors suggest a potentially less dramatic set of announcements compared to the iPhone 12’s radical flat-edged design. It does seem like the Apple Watch and AirPods could get some serious attention, though, even if the iPhone 13 looks more or less the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t0h080"&gt;Keep reading below for a roundup of everything we expect to see at the event, including some long-shot surprises Apple could have in store.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="iPhone 12 mini (left) and iPhone 12 (right)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8833rrFzFziADRLiBLUiwc7W2Ew=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22023082/vpavic_4279_20201107_0180.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ewr5Bs"&gt;An iPhone 13 with a familiar design and maybe a new nighttime camera trick&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="HaEvbK"&gt;Rumors suggest that the iPhone 13 will look a lot like the iPhone 12 but with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307312/iphone-13-smaller-notch-high-refresh-rate-screen-hole-punch-foldable-se-5g"&gt;a possibly smaller notch and high refresh rate displays&lt;/a&gt; on all or most models. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576703/iphone-13-rumors-sizes-notch-camera-processor"&gt;Both &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; and analyst Ming-Chi Kuo&lt;/a&gt; seem to be in agreement that the new iPhone will receive iterative if helpful changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nUBVbq"&gt;Those could include an LTPO (low-temperature polycrystalline oxide) display like Apple uses to provide variable refresh rates on the Apple Watch. The new phone hardware may also include &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/04/rumors-iphone-13-to-feature-larger-wireless-charging-coil-alongside-stronger-magsafe-magnets/"&gt;stronger magnets, a larger charging coil for MagSafe&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/02/14/iphone-13-always-on-display-matte-back/"&gt;always-on display&lt;/a&gt;, and possibly, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/09/iphone-13-fewer-storage-options-and-new-colors/"&gt;new colors and fewer storage options&lt;/a&gt;. A new A-series processor is naturally in the cards as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oXLloq"&gt;The star of Apple’s iPhones, the cameras, will likely also receive an upgrade with the iPhone 13. Improved performance for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21553255/apple-iphone-13-camera-2021-ming-chi-kuo-analyst-prediction"&gt;the ultrawide camera&lt;/a&gt;, better optical zoom for video recording, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-10/apple-readies-new-iphones-with-pro-focused-camera-video-updates"&gt;ProRes support, and a Portrait Mode for video&lt;/a&gt; have all been rumored. The other possible addition is &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/15/iphone-13-always-on-display-stronger-magesafe/"&gt;astrophotography capabilities&lt;/a&gt; to compete with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22203782/google-removes-wide-angle-astrophotography-pixel-4a-5g-5"&gt;a similar feature&lt;/a&gt; Google has offered in the past. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gregjoz/status/1435272731746979840?s=20"&gt;An event announcement video&lt;/a&gt; tweeted by Apple’s senior vice president of worldwide marketing Greg Joswiak featuring a dramatic pan up to a starry night sky may have added more fuel to that specific fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="g1aETW"&gt;A flat-edged Apple Watch Series 7 with a bigger screen and the same health features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MeuKUr"&gt;While the iPhone 13 is staying consistent, it seems the Apple Watch Series 7 might get a more involved redesign. The rounded body Apple’s used since the introduction of its smartwatch is rumored to be replaced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/29/22647766/apple-watch-series-7-rumors-screen-size-new-design-41mm-45mm"&gt;with flatter displays and edges&lt;/a&gt;, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. The change sounds similar to the shift Apple made from the iPhone 11 to the iPhone 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t4Grz5"&gt;Earlier this year, news broke that Apple was also possibly introducing an entirely separate, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22351979/apple-watch-rugged-extreme-sports-rumor-bloomberg"&gt;more rugged, extreme sports-friendly version of the Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;. Rumors have coalesced around the iPhone 12-inspired Series 7 since but not this sports version. We’ll have to wait and see if it arrives this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjio0g"&gt;Other improvements to the mainline Series 7 could include a faster processor and overall bigger watches at 41mm and 45mm (up from 40mm and 44mm), thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654621/apple-watch-series-7-new-watchfaces-bigger-screens"&gt;a combination of larger displays, smaller bezels, or both&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports. It’s not clear if that would impact the compatibility of the many watch bands Apple has sold over the years, but here’s hoping it doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9yyugr"&gt;Those hardware changes will allow for new watchfaces, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Gurman, but likely not new health features. Despite rumors of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532916/apple-watch-series-7-features-blood-glucose-body-temperature-extreme-sports-edition-se-2"&gt;body temperature and blood glucose tracking&lt;/a&gt;, now it seems Apple might leave those additions for future models. Complicating matters further, though, Apple has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22666305/apple-series-7-manufacturing-issues-resolved-september-mass-production"&gt;reportedly resolved production delays&lt;/a&gt; for the new Watch, some versions &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1436226530598817815?s=20"&gt;could arrive late or in smaller quantities&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="F57Mhj"&gt;Third-generation AirPods with some AirPods Pro-inspired looks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="imEUed"&gt;The entry-level third-generation AirPods are also rumored to be in line for a makeover. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21534123/apple-airpods-3-pro-2-2021-chip-design-battery-life-true-wireless-earbuds-headphones-homepod"&gt;Early word in 2020&lt;/a&gt; pointed to a design that takes cues from the AirPods Pro, minus the earbuds’ swappable rubber tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GdxNzc"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-28/apple-plans-redesigned-airpods-for-2021-new-airpods-pro-in-2022?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;Further corroboration in 2021&lt;/a&gt; suggests the same. It seems you can expect shorter stems, rounded earpieces, and a squatter wireless charging case that might have a 20 percent larger battery, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PineLeaks/status/1435302679014739970?s=20"&gt;according to Pine Leaks&lt;/a&gt;. In general, the new AirPods might finally look a bit less like headphones with the wires cut off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="qwruU3"&gt;The launch of iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey, with a few ingredients missing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1qfN18"&gt;Apple is expected to announce the launch dates for iOS 15, iPadOS 15, watchOS 8, and macOS Monterey, though the company has confirmed some features will arrive late or in beta form. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W4DRGp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"&gt;iOS 15 and iPadOS 15&lt;/a&gt;, which finally brings proper, moveable widgets to the iPad for the first time along with other improvements, will likely arrive in late September with the iPhone 13. Notable upgrades include Focus Modes that create approved notification and app lists for specific settings like work or personal time, a dramatic redesign of Safari (that’s now settled into something &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629183/ios-15-beta-safar-address-bar-fix-options-accessible-controls"&gt;a bit more familiar&lt;/a&gt;), new FaceTime layouts and audio improvements, a possible future source of controversy in digital IDs, and yet another tweak to multitasking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWlynE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;watchOS 8 is also expected in the fall&lt;/a&gt; with more modest upgrades. Along with support for Focus Modes and new digital keys and IDs, watchOS 8 brings new watchfaces (including a nice photo one), new exercise types (pilates time to shine), and a mindfulness app to Apple Watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7omTiC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22557880/apple-macos-public-beta-facetime-safari-updates"&gt;macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt; could come later in the fall (perhaps timed to the launch of a new Mac computer). The new desktop OS continues to pick up features from Apple’s mobile OSes, like support for Shortcuts, AirPlay, and helpful changes to FaceTime and Messages. The most exciting new Monterey feature, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523613/macos-monterey-wwdc-apple-ipad"&gt;Universal Control&lt;/a&gt;, allows for seamless control of an iPad with the mouse and keyboard already attached to your Mac. That includes easily dragging and dropping files from iPad to Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jNWBKl"&gt;Unfortunately, Universal Control might not be there at launch. The feature has yet to be included in a beta, and Apple has already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629165/apple-shareplay-ios-ipad-os-15-macos-delayed"&gt;announced delays for SharePlay&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s take on group watch plug-ins and Discord screen sharing that became all the rage early on in the pandemic. Luckily, other features &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596970/apple-macos-monterey-live-text-intel-processors"&gt;previously limited to Apple’s M1-based devices&lt;/a&gt; — like Live Text — are coming to older Intel machines. You win some, and you lose some, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9_f3z8bOTLHy8XPZWdaY6WFdmMY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15974614/akrales_190318_3298_0088.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eyTC3Z"&gt;Possibly a longer wait for new iPad Minis, iPads, and Macs of all stripes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ul7qvE"&gt;It really seems like updates to the entry-level iPad and the long-ignored iPad Mini are happening; the question is when. Apple could reserve the devices for a later event in October rather than hang with a new iPhone and Apple Watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FFHF0J"&gt;The new iPad Mini is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573423/ipad-mini-2021-release-date-news-features-bezels"&gt;expected to receive the flat-edged design&lt;/a&gt; that’s apparently sweeping through Apple’s entire product line, along the usual processor improvements, a larger screen between 8.5 to 9 inches, no home button, and a Touch ID sensor built directly into the power button. The entry-level iPad changes are expected to be more minor — thinner bezels and body and the inclusion of an A13 Bionic chip, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/20/new-ipad-mini-exclusive-a15-processor-usb-c/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IeRsUa"&gt;Even less likely are new Macs, whether &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;a new Macbook Pro&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244011/apple-new-macbook-air-design-magsafe-charger-report"&gt;Macbook Air&lt;/a&gt;. Apple will probably want to schedule some separate time to announce whatever it has planned for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22637477/new-mac-mini-design-ports-m1x-release-date-gurman"&gt;next version of the M-series chips&lt;/a&gt; and the new designs that could come with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a0Crt2"&gt;That’s a whole lot of possible announcements, not even taking into account a tease for longer-term Apple projects like the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654606/apple-ar-vr-headset-iphone-wireless-connection-stream-data"&gt;continued exploration of AR and VR&lt;/a&gt;. Stay tuned to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; to hear about it all.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to sell or trade in your old iPhone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T70nzkoDsN25RaoDxSoNkLFe0ws=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69851082/jbareham_170916_2000_0232.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r2qn1u"&gt;If you’re an iPhone owner, it’s very possible you’re considering trading up to the latest model, which (when this article was last updated) is likely to be the iPhone 13. However, if your current iPhone is still in good shape, you may be wondering about what to do with it. Should you sell it? Trade it in? Give it away?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DXGfsW"&gt;Well — any of the above. This guide will walk you through the process of preparing your old phone, and what your best alternatives are for disposing of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Y9FVIs"&gt;Are you transferring to a new iPhone?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="DHovgw"&gt;If you’re transferring to a new iPhone — or even if you’re not — you probably want to back up your phone before you do anything else (see below). Backing up to iCloud is probably easiest — and it also gives you the option of transferring your data either directly from your old phone to your new phone, or transferring your data from iCloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3NF8gC"&gt;Once you’ve done that, then go ahead and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/20/20871131/data-transfer-new-iphone-11-pro-max-ios-how-to"&gt;copy all your data to your new phone&lt;/a&gt;. If you want, you can also try going to “Settings” &amp;gt; “General” &amp;gt; “Transfer or Reset iPhone.” Depending on the version of iOS you’re running, you may have access to a wizard called “Prepare for New iPhone,” which will run you through all the steps necessary to transfer your data to your new phone. (It will also let you check your phone’s trade-in Status.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It doesn’t hurt to check that your iPhone is back up to iCloud." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8sugnJrj_qQoBajv2ry2xUaLYbs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22838046/IMG_D79739CF9DAE_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It doesn’t hurt to check that your iPhone is backed up to iCloud.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Under “Transfer or Reset Phone” you’ll find a wizard to walk you through the process." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LtRfDLKH_olAw2egNZ1dIhjsZ5Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22838053/IMG_D831063B05A8_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Under “Transfer or Reset Phone” you’ll find a wizard to walk you through the process.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PMsgrZ"&gt;Back up your phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ffuR80"&gt;As mentioned above, it’s a good idea to have a current backup of all of your data saved on iCloud, your laptop, or any other local / cloud storage.  Backing up your phone on iCloud Backup is probably the easiest. If it’s been a while and you want to make sure backup is switched on in your phone’s iCloud settings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ntzmom"&gt;Tap on “Settings” &amp;gt; [your name] top button &amp;gt; “iCloud” &amp;gt; “iCloud Backup.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eEEtWS"&gt;If “iCloud Backup” is switched off, toggle it on. If it’s already toggled on, and you’re preparing to wipe your old iPhone, you may want to tap “Back Up Now” just in case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="nGLcQ1"&gt;You can also &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/back-up-iphone-iph3ecf67d29/ios"&gt;back up your iPhone to a computer&lt;/a&gt;: either to your Mac by using your Finder (if your Mac is using a macOS version before 10.15, you’ll use iTunes) or to a Windows PC (again, using iTunes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6qWjaR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Verge guide to the iPhone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/21/17828022/iphone-user-guide-how-to-ios-tips"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="3W7ILm"&gt;Wipe your phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="BpfFOB"&gt;When you’re sure that all of your data is stored — and you’ve transferred all your data to your new phone — it’s time to wipe your old phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJzHI1"&gt;First, you have to make sure you’ve gotten rid of a few identifiable features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="uUBuwb"&gt;Disable “Find My iPhone” by going to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Find My” &amp;gt; “Find My Phone” and toggling “Find My Phone” and “Find My Network” to off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DQ6OXX"&gt;Unpair any devices from your phone, including your Apple Watch. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SMREGp"&gt;Toggle iMessages off (just in case).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="g1y20x"&gt;Then you need to sign out from your Apple ID:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="t9tT4x"&gt;	Select “Settings” &amp;gt; [your name] top button &amp;gt; “Sign Out” (at the bottom of the page).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LaxEWl"&gt;	Enter your Apple ID password.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xmVLyK"&gt;	You’ll be asked if you want to keep a copy of your data on this iPhone. Assuming you’ve backed everything up and are about to wipe your phone, you don’t need to toggle anything on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xZdkhV"&gt;	Tap on “Sign Out” in the upper right corner, and then again on the “Are you sure?” pop-up window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="1ucZCq"&gt;Finally, get ready to erase it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="RHqjWX"&gt;Remove the SIM card from the phone. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="72iH92"&gt;Go into “Settings” &amp;gt; “General” &amp;gt; “Transfer or Reset iPhone”  and select “Erase All Content and Settings.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="If you’re wiping your phone, you don’t want to keep any data on it." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/piUZnlaqfVeSDb64HBCoO6H3iqo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22838056/IMG_C0157C8B9455_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re wiping your phone, you don’t want to keep any data on it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You’ll get one last chance to change your mind." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eMHILye-QLRmP11cto9ODExlSS0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22838059/IMG_BB1A5D632ACF_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll get one last chance to change your mind.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XBA7Rz"&gt;Clean it up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="sqdesG"&gt;Before you even think of selling your phone, you need to make sure it’s looking its best. Remove the case and / or any stickers, and assess the damage you can see, including scratches or dents, which you’ll have to mention when selling the phone. Then, clean your phone using a screen wipe or screen cleaner. (You might want to leave your screen protector on if it’s in good condition.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZfhwf"&gt;It’s also a good idea to take photos of your phone. You’ll need them for the listing when selling the phone online; in addition, they’re useful in case the recipient reports further damage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cNdcWI"&gt;Sell your phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="tUf4or"&gt;There are a variety of places where you can try to sell your used phone. A few of those are listed here, along with the estimates I got for an iPhone 11 in good condition with 256GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d0Rtla"&gt;The first thing you might think of is to trade your phone in to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Ftrade-in&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22664451%2Fiphone-13-sell-trade-in-old-apple-how-to" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This may be especially useful if you haven’t bought your new iPhone yet, and you want to see if you can save a little on your new device. If you’ve already bought your new phone, then you can go to Apple’s trade-in page and see what your phone is worth. Note that in return you’ll be getting a gift card for future Apple purchases. The quote for the iPhone 11 was $390 in trade-in value at the time of publish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ofjsLE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.decluttr.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22664451%2Fiphone-13-sell-trade-in-old-apple-how-to" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decluttr&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; buys the phone from you and then resells it. The company gives you a price online; you then ship your phone to Decluttr within 28 days. The phone will be inspected; if there are issues, you will be offered a revised price which you will have 14 days to accept or decline. An iPhone 11 in good condition with 256GB received a quote for $401.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C6JQzg"&gt;&lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fservices%2Fbest-buy-trade-in%2Fpcmcat133600050011.c&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Buy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; lets you either mail in your phone or bring it to your nearest Best Buy retail store; either way, you can trade it in for an e-gift card. My iPhone 11 was given an estimated value of $360 (increased to $400 if traded in for specific tech products).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5F5SmE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://flipsy.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flipsy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; deals with a variety of retail sites; it will let you know what vendors offer how much, and then you get 14 days to ship the device. The vendor pays for shipping. If the vendor doesn’t agree with your assessment, they will send a revised offer; since each vendor has its own return policies, it’s a good idea to check before you ship. The iPhone 11 got prices from two vendors; the highest was $455.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5YPx3L"&gt;With &lt;a href="https://swappa.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swappa&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you create a listing along with a price; when your device is sold, you receive payment from Swappa and then ship the phone directly to the buyer. Swappa charges a fee from the buyer, depending on the price of the phone, but you are responsible for shipping costs. The average price that an iPhone 11 with 256GB could be sold for was quoted as $543.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3Gx6n"&gt;And of course, there’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpages.ebay.com%2Fseller-center%2Findex.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22664451%2Fiphone-13-sell-trade-in-old-apple-how-to" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;eBay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Selling here can be a bit complicated, but basically you get up to 250 listings for free each month; once you sell your item, there is a 10.2 percent fee plus a $0.30 transaction fee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ktxNwU"&gt;Places where you can sell your phone free of charge (except, of course, for shipping fees) include &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/selling/"&gt;Facebook Marketplace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://craigslist.org"&gt;Craigslist&lt;/a&gt;, and the subreddits &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/phoneswap/"&gt;r/Phoneswap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/appleswap/"&gt;r/Appleswap&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hardwareswap/"&gt;r/Hardwareswap&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3t6ZHP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If you don’t want to sell or trade in your old phone, there are other things you can do with it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rx0YPR"&gt;Play it safe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="t0XZEr"&gt;Most of these transactions take place via mail. However, if you decide to do the transaction in person, it’s safest to meet in a public place — and these days, if you’re at all concerned about infection, to either do it outdoors in a park or other public space, or in a cafe or other indoor venue that follows current safety recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eicK6g"&gt;And if you decide you don’t want to sell or trade in your old phone, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21542079/phone-reuse-android-iphone-how-to"&gt;there are other things you can do with it&lt;/a&gt;, including using it as a webcam or letting it be your kids’ first grown-up phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhSxUq"&gt;Whatever you decide to do with your old phone, just make sure you’re happy with your new phone first. You don’t want to have to return that brand-new phone because of problems (or because you just don’t like it) and suddenly find yourself desperately scrounging around for a temporary substitute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A0PHLx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 10th, 2021, 2:00PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was originally published on January 14th, 2020 and has been updated to account for differences in iOS and in available services and websites.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Toem is a charming photography game in black and white</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tQrB2HoD4YHghvK7i1AlF34TQS4=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69851075/vlcsnap_2021_05_07_14h46m05s312.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Toem&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Something We Made&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qUqOIj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toem&lt;/em&gt; is a delightful game about photography. Its emphasis on exploration and low stakes felt vastly different from another photography game I played this year, &lt;em&gt;New Pokémon Snap&lt;/em&gt;. And to my surprise, I enjoyed &lt;em&gt;Toem&lt;/em&gt; a lot more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kaRi5A"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Toem&lt;/em&gt;, developed by &lt;a href="https://www.somethingwemade.se/"&gt;Swedish indie studio Something We Made&lt;/a&gt;, you play as a character armed with a camera who wanders through a number of different themed areas, such as a forest and a city, taking pictures of what you find along the way. The bulk of your exploration takes place from an isometric point of view, but when you use your camera, the game shifts to a first-person perspective, often giving you a whole new look at the world around you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MbqidX4_djCYyXLyqGIxvK6e3Nw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22837206/vlcsnap_2021_05_04_13h05m56s815.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Something We Made&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The camera view in &lt;/em&gt;Toem&lt;em&gt;. Yes, you can take selfies.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cjPWBP"&gt;Usually, you’ll use your camera to take pictures of animals, interesting landmarks, or specific things for a quest. But sometimes, that first-person view is the only way to see some things that might be out of sight while in the isometric view, such as what might be under a bridge. That encouraged me to constantly pick up my camera as I was playing and scan the world around me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aw7ieu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toem&lt;/em&gt;’s charming black-and-white art style is a joy to take in; I especially liked how things looked like they’re made from paper and cardboard. The characters, meanwhile, seem as if they were plucked right out of a Nickelodeon cartoon. The sound design is also excellent. There are a lot of pleasant music tracks that help you settle into the game’s relaxed mood, and characters speak in charming gibberish like what you might have heard in &lt;em&gt;Celeste&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="awEFtu"&gt;To progress through &lt;em&gt;Toem&lt;/em&gt;, you accept quests to take certain photos or to find items in the world. Once you complete enough quests, you can advance to the next area. Often, the tasks you can complete are quite silly, such as bringing a ghost to a perfect date spot or finding a lost balloon so it can attend its birthday party. And you don’t need to do every available quest to be able to move onto the next area, so if you can’t figure one out, it’s not a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4_CKoh0CEenjjEppf36hxput3E8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22837234/vlcsnap_2021_05_04_13h01m16s154.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Something We Made&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One quest involves finding this person’s dog.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oUqGlx"&gt;The game encourages you to explore each nook and cranny, gives you a lot of freedom in how to go about things, and has a wonderful playfulness about it all. It also made me realize just how much I hope the next &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Snap&lt;/em&gt; borrows from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZfyWT"&gt;I was really excited for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22405886/new-pokemon-snap-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Pokémon Snap&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but I found its structure, which forces you down curated routes that you have to play repeatedly (and, for a good chunk of the game, without any way to boost through them), to be frustratingly limiting. I also didn’t like how you could miss photo opportunities; it added an unnecessary level of anxiety to a game about calm nature rides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e35fqp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toem&lt;/em&gt;, by contrast, is a lot more relaxed and open, and for me, that lets me have a lot more fun playing photographer. I always had my eye out for things like hidden animals in the trees, cool graffiti on walls, or even just somebody’s cat. And without any pressure or punishment to miss a photo, I was much more motivated to snap anything that looked interesting or seek out certain photos to help out a quest-giver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WlOOYP"&gt;When I played &lt;em&gt;New Pokémon Snap&lt;/em&gt; earlier this year, I wanted it to recapture the feeling of discovery I had while playing the original on Nintendo 64. Instead, it was a black-and-white game that asked me to photograph a deer DJ that brought me back to that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pfSAFP"&gt;Toem&lt;em&gt; launches September 17th on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and PC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Deathloop is an intricate mystery that also happens to be an amazing action game  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/stDMqCO5Hhhr5q9vWNRL88UGTVk=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69850900/Deathloop_Map_of_Blackreef_863726099713bed9a51.13118819.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Hard to explain, easy to get lost in&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="27LVGS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; is the first game to make me risk my life for an audiolog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rLbyYN"&gt;It’s the latest release from Arkane Studios, a studio best known for helping keep the lineage of “immersive sims” alive through first-person action games like &lt;em&gt;Dishonored&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Prey&lt;/em&gt;. And &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; most certainly fits into that lineage, with its stealth-focused exploration, supernatural abilities, and open-ended gameplay that almost always gives you a handful of ways to tackle a problem. On a moment-to-moment basis it’s as tense, thrilling, and creative as any Arkane release should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mWZvBg"&gt;That’s just the start with &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;, though. What makes the game so interesting is its structure, which has players — in the role of an assassin named Colt — reliving the same day over and over again. (Between this, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22630397/12-minutes-review-steam-xbox"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twelve Minutes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22408468/returnal-ps5-dualsense-3d-audio"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I’m not sure what it is with game developers and time loops lately.) This conceit turns &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; into a game where investigation is as important as combat. You aren’t just fighting to survive, you’re doing it to learn new information that will help you unravel the strange and complex mystery at the heart of the game. It’s that mystery that will help pull you through the same day repeatedly, digging through dangerous locations in search of scraps of crucial information to hopefully make the next loop just a little easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3vB9wa"&gt;I’ll do my best to summarize &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;’s premise, but it’s not easy. It starts when Colt wakes up on a beach of what turns out to be an island called Blackreef, which looks like a supervillain’s lair from the 1960s. Quickly he learns that Blackreef is run by a homicidal woman named Julianna and that its residents relive the same day in a loop. A few, like Julianna, keep their memories from loop to loop, and have decided that they want to keep things the way they are. Colt, naturally, does not, and decides he’s going to stop the loop once and for all. In order to do so, he needs to kill Julianna and seven “visionaries” from Blackreef. The twist is that he has to kill them all in a single day without dying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="JFLY4O"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cLIgM8XX1X0?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="69sThj"&gt;The ultimate goal in &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; is basically one big puzzle you slowly piece together. Blackreef is an intricate island divided into four districts, and each day is split up into four time periods: morning, noon, afternoon, and evening. Over the course of the game you’ll explore each area, at different times of day, and steadily Blackreef will open up. Colt retains his memories after each loop, so as you discover shortcuts or passcodes for gated areas, that information sticks with you. Eventually I found myself knowing areas inside and out, able to stealthily make my way through the quickest paths; it’s a very satisfying kind of mastery. The end goal of all of this information-gathering is to learn as much as you can about the island and its visionaries so that you can figure out how to kill them all within the constraints of a single day. Information is, as they say, power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="DRRwRB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s one big puzzle you slowly piece together&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lkZXX6"&gt;This probably sounds pretty confusing, and it is, but the game does an incredible job of easing you along so you don’t get overwhelmed. The main menu is basically an evidence board that lets you track all of the information for each visionary, so that you’re tackling everything in a series of small steps. Likewise, the game is divided into relatively bite-sized chunks, as you explore areas over specific time periods like morning or evening, almost always with a specific goal in mind. Sometimes that could be as big as killing a boss. Other times it just means finding a way into a locked apartment in search of a passcode. Put simply: while the overarching goal is huge and complicated, the steps to get there are clear and direct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u5eW5g"&gt;It’s also important to note that, despite the time looping premise, &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; isn’t a roguelike with randomized levels like &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496904/hades-supergiant-games-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; each area changes depending on the time of day, but otherwise it’s the same each time you visit. And while initially Colt can’t bring weapons or skills with him from one loop to the next, that changes when you’re able to harvest a material to infuse items so that they’ll carry over. This “residual energy” is called, obviously, residuum. This lets you steadily build out an arsenal over time, and grow more powerful by collecting “slabs” from downed visionaries that grant supernatural abilities like invisibility or teleportation. (The structure is almost like a modern day &lt;em&gt;Mega Man&lt;/em&gt;, with bosses that grant game-changing powers when you beat them.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pm5qy9"&gt;The game &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be repetitive at times. In one mission early on, for instance, I had to start up the same set of generators on three different days, in order to divert power to different areas of the island. For the most part, though, I was constantly doing different things. Missions involved everything from decrypting pictograms to infiltrating a masked ball. I also found that when I did have to revisit areas or scenarios, I usually either knew a shortcut to breeze past it or by that point was much more powerful, making it easier to take down whatever enemies I might need to kill. It’s also a very open game. With seven visionaries to kill and a big island to explore, there’s pretty much always something else to do if you get stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZjB3M0OQlYNR5FO3gatAoOVsydE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22846279/Deathloop_Shift_8637261279a70e6e756.01266203.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zPU6Fx"&gt;That I’ve gone this far without even talking about the shooting should tell you something: &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;’s central mystery is such a fun and satisfying thing to pull apart and solve that it almost overshadows the action. That said, the action &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; amazing. This is clearly an Arkane game, which means it’s less a straight shooter, and more a game where you sneak into dangerous places and use a combination of stealth, creativity, and luck to kill everybody. I barely even used guns, instead relying primarily on my arsenal of superpowers and, more than anything else, a machete for quiet takedowns. (Kills in &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; are extremely gory, with lots of decapitated heads and needlessly large splashes of blood.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xi5oWr"&gt;But, in true Arkane fashion, there always seemed to be multiple ways to tackle a problem, whether it was a different combat technique or a hidden passageway that sidestepped violence altogether. I should also note that on the PS5 the game makes great use of the DualSense controller, so combat really does feel better, thanks to realistic vibrations and different trigger tension depending on your weapon. The controller’s speaker, in particular, is put to good use, with Julianna constantly pestering you with messages over a walkie talkie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wdMCrR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There always seemed to be multiple ways to tackle a problem&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0u0pT"&gt;I really only have a few small nitpicks with &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;, and they mostly have to do with some artificial techniques the game uses to create tension. The first has to do with saves. Despite being a primarily single-player experience, you can’t save &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; mid-mission; instead, the game only saves when Colt leaves an area. Many of the missions are short, so it’s not always a problem, but some can drag on quite a bit, particularly when it comes to finally taking down the visionaries. It’s really frustrating to not be able to take a pause when real life interferes with playing the game. Likewise, &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; has an interesting take on multiplayer. While the story puts you in the role of Colt, you can also play as Julianna and wreak havoc on another player’s game. It’s a cool concept, but I mostly just found it annoying to be on a good run and have someone jump in and kill me in the middle of a carefully planned mission. It’s also unavoidable; if you aren’t playing online, an AI-powered Julianna will pop in on occasion instead. In my pre-launch experience, this always seemed to happen at the worst possible moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IdFk2T"&gt;The most remarkable thing about &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; is how all of its elements — the intricate, stylish world of Blackreef; action that encourages experimentation; a mystery dense with ideas and surprises; the entertainingly hostile relationship between Colt and Julianna — fit together so seamlessly. You could spend the morning tip-toeing around guards to find a password hidden in a desk, which helps you steal a sniper rifle in the afternoon, which you then use to take down a boss in the evening. And right after, Julianna is going to call you on a walkie for a charmingly expletive-laced tirade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Vf8rPT"&gt;Each of those elements feels not only cohesive, but necessary. In most games, audiologs are throwaway lore meant for the most hardcore fans. Here they can be the difference between success and failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IiXkA"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Deathloop&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; launches September 14th on the PS5 and PC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
