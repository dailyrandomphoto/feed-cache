    <title>New Trailers: The Green Knight, Wish Dragon, Venom 2, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CaSxAbVzJ3tblaIACu3K3GiUqeQ=/60x0:1469x939/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69296162/dev_patel.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Dev Patel stars as Sir Gawain in The Green Knight | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS6ksY8xWCY&amp;amp;ab_channel=A24" target="_blank"&gt;A24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D4g5So"&gt;So since &lt;em&gt;The Handmaid’s Tale&lt;/em&gt; isn’t dark enough (honestly give us &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;, show writers), I also started watching &lt;em&gt;Mare of Easttown&lt;/em&gt; (HBO Max) and over the weekend watched &lt;em&gt;The Woman in the Window&lt;/em&gt; (fine, gritty anti-heroines are my thing, I guess). &lt;em&gt;Mare&lt;/em&gt; is so far reminding me a lot of &lt;em&gt;Broadchurch&lt;/em&gt;, another not-very-uplifting but great show, and Kate Winslet is going all-in on the accent and the look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0SRYGK"&gt;But wow what a disappointment&lt;em&gt; The Woman in the Window &lt;/em&gt;was. It has an all-star cast (Amy Adams, Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman, Brian Tyree Henry, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Anthony Mackie) and a screenplay by Pulitzer Prize winner Tracy Letts, based on AJ Finn’s 2018 novel (which BY THE WAY, &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/02/11/a-suspense-novelists-trail-of-deceptions"&gt;read the bonkers backstory&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; guy). It follows the mostly successful (but sort of irritating) trend of movies based on books about unreliable female narrators who get caught up in criminal activity (&lt;em&gt;Gone Girl, &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; The Girl on the Train). &lt;/em&gt;It even has the bones of the Hitchcock classic &lt;em&gt;Rear Window. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9c2waR"&gt;Maybe it’s just one of those books that doesn’t translate well to the screen, or maybe the &lt;a href="https://theplaylist.net/joe-wright-woman-in-the-window-reshoots-screenings-20210108/"&gt;reshoots&lt;/a&gt; undid too much, but the movie felt like it just couldn’t figure out what it wanted to be; a thriller, a mystery, a story about devastating loss, or something else. And why underuse that great supporting cast?! Unfortunately, I think it was too predictable, and not helped by weird pacing and a twist at the end that was more annoying than surprising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yMkyli"&gt;On to this week’s trailers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FoXynG"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sS6ksY8xWCY?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="d21BFa"&gt;The Green Knight&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LOFoQw"&gt;Dev Patel stars as Sir Gawain, one of the Knights of the Round Table from King Arthur lore.  The film is based on the &lt;a href="https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Sir_Gawain_and_the_Green_Knight"&gt;poem&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight &lt;/em&gt;but the movie version looks a bit more sinister than I remember. What we see in the trailer hews pretty faithfully to the Middle English poem: The Green Knight challenges Gawain to strike him, provided Gawain will let the Green Knight strike him back in a year and a day. Gawain beheads the Green Knight, who picks up his head and saunters away. See you in a year, buddy! &lt;em&gt;The Green Knight&lt;/em&gt; is in theaters July 30th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xBH35Z"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uWIRyU5fuzU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="AEtx5x"&gt;Wish Dragon &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LnYemR"&gt;I needed something a little cute and funny because this week’s lineup seems kinda gruesome otherwise. &lt;em&gt;The Wish Dragon&lt;/em&gt; is an Aladdin-like tale of a magical being who can grant three wishes, but instead of being bound in a lamp, he’s trapped in a teapot. He’s freed by a young man named Din, who’s searching for his childhood friend Lina. John Cho, Constance Wu, and Jimmy Wong star in &lt;em&gt;The Wish Dragon&lt;/em&gt;, which was released in &lt;a href="https://ew.com/movies/netflix-wish-dragon-trailer-john-cho-constance-wu/"&gt;theaters in China&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, and will debut on Netflix June 11th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RLCNb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zPlquR"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-ezfi6FQ8Ds?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DqueHh"&gt;Venom 2: Let There Be Carnage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4iOXBA"&gt;Tom Hardy returns as Eddie Brock and he seems to have come to an understanding of sorts with the Venom symbiote, who cooks him an absolutely disgusting-looking breakfast and has to be reminded not to eat people. This is another of the many films whose release was delayed by the pandemic. Venom 2 is slated to be in theaters September 24th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iXt8sS"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xOrXpK-rUaI?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="VIyJLY"&gt;The Forever Purge &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="1EjWmL"&gt;At some point doesn’t the purge run out of people to purge if it is “forever”? It’s quite convenient that most of the baddies wear scary masks so you can easily identify them, I guess? This is the fifth &lt;em&gt;Purge&lt;/em&gt; film, and may be the final one (in which case the “forever” makes more sense). It picks up after &lt;em&gt;The Purge: Election Year&lt;/em&gt; and stars Ana de la Reguera, Josh Lucas, Tenoch Huerta, Leven Rambin, Will Patton, and Cassidy Freeman. &lt;em&gt;The Forever Purge&lt;/em&gt; will be in theaters July 2nd&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uxH4ch"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTuber Jake Paul being investigated for driving on protected Puerto Rico beach</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Jake Paul v Ben Askren - News Conference" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B0LjJVrI44ElJtf4P-T_i4btwDc=/0x579:2530x2266/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69295915/1309409409.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xzuGg0"&gt;Officials in Puerto Rico are reportedly investigating an incident involving YouTube star Jake Paul, after he was seen in a now-deleted video riding in a vehicle on a beach that’s a nesting area for turtles this time of year, the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/05/15/puerto-rico-investigating-jake-paul-after-viral-video-sparks-turtle-outrage/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zjg9S9"&gt;“I have ordered an investigation to determine the circumstances surrounding the use of two motor vehicles on beaches that are presented to be in Puerto Rico,” secretary of natural and environmental resources Rafael Marchargo said &lt;a href="https://www.tmz.com/2021/05/15/jake-paul-puerto-rico-investigation-turtles-beach/"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt; (h/t TMZ). “Some media have published today a video of the influencer Jake Paul in a motor vehicle on the beach, an activity that is prohibited, apart from law enforcement agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mEPAKj"&gt;“Although the video does not establish where or when it was carried out, the DNER reminds citizens that this type of activity is prohibited by law to protect the environment and the species that can nest or live on the beaches. Those who violate the law face fines and other penalties, if applicable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nmp7yx"&gt;The back-and-forth between social media influencers seeking the perfect outdoor photo or video, and environmentalists who fret that the amount of attention isn’t good for the natural world has gone on for years. Some popular tourist spots have tried to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/travel/instagram-geotagging-environment.html"&gt;persuade influencers not to geotag their photos&lt;/a&gt;, lest followers try to recreate their shots and trample fragile ecosystems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2QfGd"&gt;That doesn’t appear to be the case with Paul in Puerto Rico; &lt;a href="https://www.tmz.com/2021/05/15/jake-paul-puerto-rico-investigation-turtles-beach/"&gt;according to TMZ&lt;/a&gt;, Paul wasn’t aware of the nesting turtles and planned to cooperate with authorities.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bVLfcU"&gt;Paul and his brother Logan, who some media outlets reported may have been in one of the vehicles in the video, are well-known for performing rule-defying stunts in their videos; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/2/16841260/logan-paul-youtube-suicide-controversy-carelessness-online-celebrity"&gt;Logan was widely criticized&lt;/a&gt; and later apologized for, a video where he showed the body of a man who had died by suicide. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18172657/jake-paul-bird-box-challenge-youtube-blindfold-netflix"&gt;Jake participated in the Bird Box challenge of 2019&lt;/a&gt;, walking around blindfolded for 24 hours while on video, which later prompted &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/16/youtube-bans-dangerous-pranks-after-bird-box-challenge"&gt;YouTube to bar creators&lt;/a&gt; from showing “dangerous challenges and pranks” in their videos. And last year, police in Scottsdale, Arizona &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/06/04/jake-paul-youtube-riot-looting/"&gt;charged Jake Paul with criminal trespass&lt;/a&gt; and unlawful assembly when he was seen on video at a mall that was looted during a wave of protests over the death of George Floyd. Those charges were later dropped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3wvBCS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clubhouse expanding its new Android app to more countries this week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration the Clubhouse logo is seen on a smartphone screen" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DE7GNBNm6SD0zBi4WvQsbLZOTD8=/0x0:3888x2592/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69295570/1232816107.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S2IDzm"&gt;After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/9/22424399/clubhouse-android-app-release-date-news-features"&gt;launching its Android app&lt;/a&gt; a week ago, social audio platform Clubhouse said Sunday it will roll out to more countries in the coming week. The Android app will be available in Brazil, Japan, and Russia on Tuesday, India and Nigeria by Friday, and the “rest of the world” throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nLgOaW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Android rollout continues! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;        Japan, Brazil &amp;amp; Russia coming Tuesday&lt;br&gt;     Nigeria &amp;amp; India on Friday AM&lt;br&gt;  Rest of world throughout the week, and available worldwide by Friday afternoon&lt;/p&gt;— Clubhouse (@Clubhouse) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Clubhouse/status/1393968237239545856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Lpc4Ow"&gt;For the first year, Clubhouse was only available on iOS devices. Despite its early limited access Clubhouse grew to 10 million users in its inaugural year, and was recently &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/andreessen-horowitz-values-clubhouse-at-4-billionwith-dst-tiger?irclickid=30y0-83Z5xyLRMDwUx0Mo3EtUkBxIu02cSPvSM0&amp;amp;irgwc=1&amp;amp;utm_source=affiliate&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpa&amp;amp;utm_campaign=10078-Skimbit+Ltd.&amp;amp;utm_term=theverge.com"&gt;valued at $4 billion&lt;/a&gt; after a new funding round. Whether it can keep up that momentum remains to be seen, as competitors— Twitter’s Spaces, Discord’s Stage Channels, and other better-known social media platforms—enter the audio market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bzBIa8"&gt;Clubhouse remains invite-only and has been &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LiamODellUK/status/1393968691855953924?s=20"&gt;criticized&lt;/a&gt; for not providing automatic captions for Deaf and hard-of-hearing users. The platform has lately focused on creators, and recently announced the results of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420644/clubhouse-creator-first-pilot-program-season-audio-social"&gt;an accelerator program&lt;/a&gt; which will fund 50 audio Clubhouse shows. CEO Paul Davison said during the weekly &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CH_Townhall/status/1393977750361419782"&gt;Clubhouse town hall&lt;/a&gt; that next on the company’s roadmap are in-room tipping for creators, paid events, and subscriptions. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T is reportedly in talks to merge its media business with Discovery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lEIbzCpdGrzvXV40hGeiICItzxU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69295421/acastro_180322_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vlDm8s"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Discovery are in talks that would combine AT&amp;amp;T’s media business with Discovery’s reality-TV dynasty to create a massive new entertainment entity, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-16/at-t-is-said-in-talks-to-combine-content-assets-with-discovery-kor6r2uj?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, citing sources. &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2021-05-16/why-att-is-spinning-off-hbo-cnn-warner-media-discovery"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; corroborated the story&lt;/a&gt;, noting that “many Warner Media executives were stunned by the news.” Neither company confirmed the deal, but if it came to pass, the combined company would be a potentially significant competitor for streaming brands like Netflix and Disney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Gm5ih"&gt;But as &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes, AT&amp;amp;T only recently added some major entertainment brands to its portfolio when it &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-time-warner-m-a-at-t/att-closes-85-billion-deal-for-time-warner-idUSKBN1JA36U"&gt;acquired Time Warner for $85 billion&lt;/a&gt;, a deal that was finalized in 2018. And while AT&amp;amp;T’s streaming channel HBO Max has performed relatively well since its somewhat &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21268490/hbo-max-launch-price-warnermedia-att-dc-harry-potter-friends-disney-netflix-peacock"&gt;messy launch last May&lt;/a&gt;, it’s still not quite as robust as older streamers like Netflix. In January, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212963/new-discovery-plus-streaming-channel-roku-hbo-peacock"&gt;Discovery launched its own streaming platform&lt;/a&gt; Discovery Plus, which launched with shows spun off from its Discovery Channel catalog, including a new &lt;em&gt;House Hunters&lt;/em&gt; series and new series from the creators of &lt;em&gt;Fixer Upper&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yUuVmy"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s WarnerMedia unit owns cable channels CNN, HBO, Cartoon Network, TBS, TNT, and the Warner Bros. movie studio. Discovery’s offerings include cable networks HGTV, Food Network, and TLC. But as more people migrate away from traditional cable TV and to streaming options, most media companies are trying to find new ways to reach audiences.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ODc2pC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s sources indicated a deal could be announced as early as this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ib44Au"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, Sunday May 16th, 9:15PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added mention of the LA Times’ corroborating report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon debuts free video-streaming service MiniTV in its India app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/daax4VVbei9pNl5bRSAQsR2MRj4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69295132/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H06VAa"&gt;Amazon has launched an ad-supported, free video streaming service called MiniTV within the Amazon India app, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/15/amazon-minitv-free-streaming-service-india/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a different offering than its separate Amazon Prime Video service, as MiniTV is contained within Amazon’s traditional shopping app, rather than its own standalone app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D0VhbT"&gt;Only available to users in India, MiniTV’s catalog includes mostly older content which its content partners made originally for YouTube and other platforms. The lineup includes beauty and fashion content, tech news, and cooking shows, and Amazon’s partners for the channel include Indian web content studios Pocket Aces and TVF, and  list of well-known Indian comedians. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wyz1dN"&gt;The company says it’s planning “new and exclusive videos” in the coming months, but didn’t provide a timetable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4AsACx"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; notes, the channel should serve as a competitor to Flipkart Video, the free streaming service launched in 2019 by Walmart-owned Flipkart, one of Amazon’s biggest rivals in India. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fu4oRr"&gt;Amazon is still marketing its Prime Video to consumers in India as it competes with Netflix, which has &lt;a href="https://qz.com/2002038/netflixs-big-plans-in-india-may-be-slowed-by-covid-and-censorship/"&gt;plans to launch&lt;/a&gt; more than three dozen new movies and shows in India this year. The free MiniTV will help Amazon test whether streaming content can drive sales on its shopping app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LqiQVI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eGKPHe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New leak ahead of Google I/O claims Android 12 may include changes for widgets and notifications </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kdTvT_cLRm-gr8gouPHYteBvyqY=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69294807/VRG_1777_Android_12_005.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ClIYju"&gt;Just ahead of Google I/O, which gets underway on Tuesday, a new leak purporting to be a preview of what’s coming during the annual developers’ conference gives some insight into what Android 12 might look like. A new &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRd8v2eRAA&amp;amp;ab_channel=FRONTPAGETECH"&gt;video from Jon Prosser&lt;/a&gt; shows what appear to be slides from a presentation of Android 12.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qzHcVl"&gt;The first slide sets up what to expect: “A beautiful new experience,” “Stronger privacy and security protections,” and “All of your devices work better together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKLg96"&gt;The usual caveats about leaked materials apply, of course; there’s no guarantee this is what the final interface will look like, or how much may be announced during I/O. But the most interesting slide in Prosser’s video shows what appears to be a new user interface for Android 12, including a new media widget, a brightness toggle, a weather widget, an analog clock widget, a snooze/dismiss toggle, and stacked notifications (in the lower right corner of the screen grab):&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sD1Kno0uAE6ev-fPhH8zd-IBrdA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22518083/prosser_slide_fpt_android_12.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRd8v2eRAA&amp;amp;ab_channel=FRONTPAGETECH" target="_blank"&gt;Jon Prosser/Front Page Tech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;A slide purporting to be part of a Google I/O presentation for new Android 12 features shows new UI elements.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gVbSuP"&gt;Previous leaks of Android 12 have &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1362543670050881543"&gt;shown stacked widgets&lt;/a&gt;, which look similar to the Smart Stacks introduced in iOS 14. We’ve also seen earlier &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274071/google-android-12-ui-screenshots-privacy-indicator-conversations-widget-leak-rumor"&gt;leaks via XDA Developers&lt;/a&gt; that showed new themes and a conversation widget for Android 12. And Google’s own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288084/android-12-developer-preview-available-google-pixel"&gt;developer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395383/android-12-developer-preview-3-haptics-camera-sensors-beta-release-date-features"&gt;previews&lt;/a&gt; of Android 12 have included &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289976/android-12-developer-preview-roundup-notifications-redesign-tweaks-emergency-sos"&gt;a lot of small tweaks&lt;/a&gt; and developer-focused features, while hinting at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291296/android-12-developer-preview-ui-changes-widget-stacks-lock-screen-notifications"&gt;some significant UI changes&lt;/a&gt; that have been rumored, including the stacked widgets and a new lock screen with larger clock text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7yyVpS"&gt;Prosser shows a what he says is a video from I/O that shows updated notifications, a new keyboard design, and a new lock screen with a larger clock, which seem to confirm the earlier leaked info. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3VZnjm"&gt;If the details in the latest leak roundup are accurate, Android 12 could be the biggest overhaul of the OS in several years. We’ll find out more in a few days when the annual I/O conference kicks off. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cloudflare says it’s time to end CAPTCHA ‘madness’, launches new security key-based replacement</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2_SHlkE8mjS_Vw3NWwyJtyiB7Fg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69294752/akrales_190220_3226_0034.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dIXSKy"&gt;Cloudflare, which you may know as a provider of DNS services or the company telling you why the website you clicked on won’t load, wants to replace the “madness” of CAPTCHAs across the web with an entirely new system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KAkTSp"&gt;CAPTCHAs are those tests you have to take, often when trying to log into a service, that ask you to click images of things like busses or crosswalks or bicycles to prove that you’re a human. (CAPTCHA, if you didn’t know, stands for “Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart.”) The problem is, they add a lot of friction to using the web and can sometimes be difficult to solve — I’m sure I’m not the only person who has frustratingly failed a CAPTCHA because I didn’t see that corner of a crosswalk in one image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RPiWUF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cryptographic Attestation of Personhood&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JSTsix"&gt;In a blog, Cloudflare says it aims to “&lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cryptographic-attestation-of-personhood/"&gt;get rid of CAPTCHAs completely&lt;/a&gt;” by replacing them with a new way to prove you are a human by touching or looking at a device using a system it calls “Cryptographic Attestation of Personhood.” Right now, it only supports a limited number &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/22/18235288/two-factor-authentication-security-key-how-to"&gt;of USB security keys&lt;/a&gt; like YubiKeys, but you can test Cloudflare’s system for yourself right now &lt;a href="https://cloudflarechallenge.com/"&gt;on the company’s website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wzJqFf"&gt;I tried it out, and it worked great. All I had to do was click the prominent “I am human (beta)” button on the site, then follow a few prompts to select my security key, then tap it, and then allow the site to access the make and model of the key. When I did, the system waved me through (though it just took me back to the blog).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U295Fq"&gt;The whole process took all of a few seconds, and I have to admit that it was really nice not to puzzle over grainy images of busses and bus-looking objects. And in addition to the speed of it all, this new method could have a major accessibility benefit, as those with visual disabilities may not be able to complete CAPTCHAs in their current form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IYS7nX"&gt;Here is the company’s “elevator pitch” of what’s going on behind the scenes to establish that you’re a human via its new method:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="y1EQMC"&gt;The short version is that your device has an embedded secure module containing a unique secret sealed by your manufacturer. The security module is capable of proving it owns such a secret without revealing it. Cloudflare asks you for proof and checks that your manufacturer is legitimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="qXZ2o9"&gt;You can read a much more extensive explanation on &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cryptographic-attestation-of-personhood/"&gt;the company’s blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jodkX4"&gt;While it’s all an intriguing idea, it may not be the end to CAPTCHAs as we know it just yet. For one thing, you probably won’t see the prompt in many places, as Cloudflare says this is only an experiment right now, available “on a limited basis in English-speaking regions.” And in its current state, it only works with a limited set of hardware: YubiKeys, HyperFIDO keys, and Thetis FIDO U2F keys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7Q3w8"&gt;Cloudflare promises it will “look into adding other authenticators as soon as possible.” That could possibly expand to your phone: Cloudflare suggests the possibility of tapping a phone to their computer to pass a wireless signature using NFC. Google can now treat &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21066768/google-iphone-ios-security-key-2-factor-authentication"&gt;both iPhones&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/10/18295348/google-android-phone-fido-webauthn-phishing-two-factor-authentication"&gt;and Android phones&lt;/a&gt; as physical security keys; If Google and Apple got on board with Cloudflare’s method, it could significantly reduce the barrier to entry to using it, since smartphones are much more common than security keys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fHCgsZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cloudflare’s system may actually be a worse solution&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SDc914"&gt;However, Cloudflare’s system may actually be a &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt; solution, according to one critic. As Ackermann Yuriy (CEO of the consulting firm Webauthn Works) &lt;a href="https://herrjemand.medium.com/why-cloudflares-captcha-replacement-with-fido2-webauthn-is-a-really-bad-idea-d5487f6c7566"&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt;, “attestation does not prove anything but the device model,” meaning that it doesn’t actually prove if someone using a device for authentication is, in fact, a human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PC09Bm"&gt;Cloudflare essentially admits this itself in its own blog, saying that a drinking bird (those &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCKC-QVcVn0"&gt;bird toys that dip their beaks into water repeatedly&lt;/a&gt;) could press a touch sensor on a security key, thereby passing the authentication test. If the point of CAPTCHAs is to prevent bot farms from overrunning websites, we may need to consider whether bot farms equipped with with jury-rigged security key devices (or worse) will take advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sRkLlj"&gt;Cloudflare &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/benthompson/status/512900170967576576"&gt;isn’t always positively associated&lt;/a&gt; with CAPTCHAs; in a recent example, the company moved from Google’s reCAPTCHA to a service from hCaptcha &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/moving-from-recaptcha-to-hcaptcha/"&gt;in April 2020&lt;/a&gt;, and some people &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/katebevan/status/1250904759499882497"&gt;weren’t fans&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WUZbcg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Lordy, if you thought clicking squares that show a traffic light was a pain, Google and Cloudflare have had a spat and the latter now has its own Captcha, which looks absolutely designed to put humans off bothering with sites that deploy it &lt;a href="https://t.co/odLTbZSAyZ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/odLTbZSAyZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kate Bevan (@katebevan) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/katebevan/status/1250904759499882497?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 16, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x62Hn7"&gt;CAPTCHAs also assume that website owners want to allow relatively anonymous traffic, but anonymous identity may be irrelevant if an website has your actual identity through login information you’ve provided. And with the recent push against ad targeting, driven in large part by Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;huge new privacy feature in iOS 14.5&lt;/a&gt; that asks users if they want to let each app track them around the web, it’s possible that website providers will move more toward logins anyway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uwzYUb"&gt;Though it certainly sounds like a hassle to have to potentially deal with &lt;em&gt;even more&lt;/em&gt; logins (which is much easier to do with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311182/best-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password"&gt;great password manager&lt;/a&gt;!), that shift could, counterintuitively, have the potential benefit of pushing us toward a passwordless future even sooner. If more services are pushing for direct logins, that could lead to more of them supporting security keys instead of a password. And more sites supporting security keys could put pressure on others to support them as well, like the trend we see toward two-factor authentication with phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VBZBjm"&gt;While we’re not at that passwordless future just yet, Cloudflare’s potential replacement for the CAPTCHA could be a first step in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this look at how Clubhouse’s blocking system is problematic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration the Clubhouse logo is seen on a smartphone screen" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vSBa-42nkkLrr3HsumM29jx2uG8=/0x0:3888x2592/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69292986/1232816107.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lRKsUn"&gt;Anyone who’s spent more than five minutes on social media can tell you that most platforms have plenty of trolls, reply-guys and other people who may just be unpleasant to interact with. On big platforms like Twitter, Faecbook, and Instagram, the option to block another user allows you to keep someone out of your feed. Blocking is far from a perfect solution, but at least it gives users a way to continue to use the platforms and avoid (some) nasty interactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fsBh1h"&gt;But as &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/05/clubhouse-has-blocking-problem/618867/?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"&gt;Will Oremus writes for &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the year-old audio chat platform Clubhouse has a different mechanism for blocking, one that affects more than just the blocker and the blockee (I know, but what would you call it?): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Ugrqj0"&gt;When you block someone on Clubhouse, it doesn’t just affect communications between the two of you, as it would on Facebook or Twitter. Rather, it limits the way that person can communicate with others too. Once blocked, they can’t join or even see any room that you create, or in which you are speaking—which effectively blocks them for everyone else in that room. If you’re brought “onstage” from the audience to speak, anyone else in the audience whom you have blocked will be kept off the stage for as long as you’re up there. And if you’re a moderator of a room, you can block a speaker and boot them from the conversation in real time—even if they’re mid-sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xLO8ce"&gt;So in essence, a “black badge” on Clubhouse can limit who speaks, where, and when on the platform. As Oremus notes, it’s a social act to block another person on Clubhouse, one that affects multiple interactions. And members of underrepresented groups said that blocking can be “weaponized” on Clubhouse, to squelch certain points of view or restrict conversations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="MelgiJ"&gt;One, a Black woman in her 20s who’s studying medicine, said she has been barred from rooms discussing vaccination in Black communities, because one influential anti-vaxxer who frequents those rooms blocked her. She also found herself abruptly shut out of a weekly &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; watch-party club that had become her favorite experience on the app, evidently because one member had blocked her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="LdPKni"&gt;The buzz around Clubhouse— which attracted 10 million users in its inaugural year— has &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/04/the-clubhouse-party-is-over"&gt;started to fizzle out&lt;/a&gt; a bit; it only recently released a version for Android devices, and new users can only join when invited by a current user. Add to that the rising popularity and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22413033/twitter-spaces-android-ios-ticket-schedule-clubhouse-captions"&gt;superior accessibility of Twitter’s audio chat platform Spaces&lt;/a&gt;, and it seems Clubhouse may be in for a bumpy ride ahead. &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/05/clubhouse-has-blocking-problem/618867/?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"&gt;Go read this analysis&lt;/a&gt; of why its unusual blocking system may ultimately contribute to the platform’s decline. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Colonial Pipeline says operations back to normal following ransomware attack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Atlantic Gasoline Flows Surge On Colonial Spill" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/06OaLnSDtg4VorIrGoec8nZJvJg=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69292718/608064472.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CeagMe"&gt;Colonial Pipeline said Saturday that all of its systems are back to operating normally, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22426158/cyberattack-forces-shutdown-major-us-fuel-colonial-pipeline"&gt;pipeline it shut down a week ago&lt;/a&gt; amid a ransomware attack. The pipeline is now servicing all its markets including Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Washington, DC, Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey, the company tweeted. Colonial carries 45 percent of the fuel supplies for the eastern United States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YprrWR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;As we previously reported, Colonial Pipeline initiated the restart of pipeline operations at approximately 5 p.m. ET on Wednesday, May 12. Since that time, we have returned the system to normal operations, delivering millions of gallons per hour to the markets we serve. &lt;a href="https://t.co/UJG7SqUxSQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/UJG7SqUxSQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Colonial Pipeline (@Colpipe) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Colpipe/status/1393529174598504454?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KbuwkZ"&gt;The company reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434381/colonial-pipeline-darkside-hacker-ransomware-ransom-oil"&gt;paid a $5 million ransom&lt;/a&gt; to DarkSide, the group responsible for the incident. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428996/colonial-pipeline-ransomware-attack-apology-investigation"&gt;DarkSide has since apologized&lt;/a&gt; for the “social consequences” of the attack, which included fuel shortages in many of the markets that the 5,500-mile-long pipeline services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ifimv3"&gt;It remains unclear which parts of the Colonial Pipeline were at risk, but a company spokesperson suggested it did not appear that the company’s operational systems were affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="rs8Q6F"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The cybersecurity ‘pandemic’ that led to the Colonial Pipeline disaster","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22429433/colonial-pipeline-cyber-security-ransomware-attack"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="LiAURW"&gt;Colonial &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Colpipe/status/1393529184174198787"&gt;said on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that it has invested “meaningfully” in its IT and cybersecurity, and said it would “continue to put safety and system integrity first.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="z64CK8"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Since this incident began, we have been clear that our focus was on the safe and efficient restoration of service to our pipeline system. That is what we have achieved through the commitment and dedication of the many Colonial team members.&lt;/p&gt;— Colonial Pipeline (@Colpipe) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Colpipe/status/1393529181447852032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yd4uNR"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/15/colonial-pipeline-resumes-normal-operations-after-hack.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC,&lt;/em&gt; there are still fuel shortages&lt;/a&gt; in many of the markets the affected pipeline serves; it reported 80 percent of gas stations in Washington, DC were still without fuel as of Saturday morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LOFbLz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="i3amtd"&gt;Facebook has reportedly upheld a ban on many organizations in Myanmar that have joined forces to resist the military coup that occurred back in February, &lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/facebook-is-still-censoring-groups-fighting-the-military-coup-in-myanmar/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The bans were put in place back in 2019, when organizations like the Arakan Army, and many of its allies, were classified as terrorist organizations by the democratically-elected government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IE5Jnd"&gt;Things have changed in Myanmar since then. After the military coup and government takeover by the Tatmadaw (carried out after an election which &lt;a href="https://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/election-fraud-01282021184631.html"&gt;the military claims was fraudulent&lt;/a&gt;), the political situation has become extremely complex. There is, however, one thing that is seemingly clear: the Arakan Army is no longer classified as a terrorist organization, either by the &lt;a href="https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/burma/myanmar-military-regime-removes-arakan-army-list-terrorist-groups.html"&gt;current military-led government&lt;/a&gt;, or by the &lt;a href="https://www.myanmar-now.org/en/news/myanmar-military-not-eaos-only-terrorist-organisation-in-myanmar-crph-says"&gt;elected government currently in exile&lt;/a&gt;. Yet, according to &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt;, the Arakan Army is still not allowed on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vy9M8F"&gt;The AA isn’t the only group that’s found itself unable to communicate through Facebook. There are apparently many ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) active in the country, some of which &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22412118/myanmar-coup-protesters-rohingya"&gt;have banded together as a resistance&lt;/a&gt; to the coup government, which has been &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/3/13/22329081/myanmar-protests-killed-casualties"&gt;violently cracking down on pro-democracy protestors&lt;/a&gt;. Many of their Facebook pages were also restricted back in 2019, under orders of the democratically elected government, which has since been overthrown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eLgycN"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt;, the ban of EAOs was controversial before the coup as well: some argue that it prevented the spread of information about human rights violations, like &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-41566561"&gt;the genocide against the Rohingya Muslims&lt;/a&gt; carried out by the Tatmadaw. Now, EAOs and journalists in the country argue that Facebook’s bans prevent them from showing what’s happening in the struggle against the current military government. The director of a human rights organization told &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt; that the bans are “like trying to close the people’s eyes and ears.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OdlxGy"&gt;Facebook also &lt;a href="https://time.com/5943151/facebook-myanmar-military-ban/"&gt;banned pages associated with the Tatmadaw&lt;/a&gt; following the coup, but human rights activist Thinzar Shunlei Yi tells &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt; that the company has still failed to react to the political changes that have occurred in Myanmar since then, and called on the company to create an official oversight board for the country.&lt;/p&gt;
