    <title>Twitter is launching its new verification process on January 20th</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Svlkv2"&gt;Twitter’s revamped verification process is &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/our-plans-to-relaunch-verification-and-whats-next.html"&gt;launching on January 20th, 2021&lt;/a&gt;, bringing back the ability to request a blue checkmark after Twitter pressed pause on the formal application process for more than three years. The &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/about-twitter-verified-accounts"&gt;new policy&lt;/a&gt; was refined with input from tens of thousands of user responses after Twitter confirmed in November it would be relaunching verification. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UbDY7I"&gt;Some of the new changes include more lax profile information requirements to be eligible for verification, more granular and defined categories for verification badges, and new guidelines around when a verified account may lose its blue checkmark if inactive or if found in violation of Twitter’s policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vFbDmC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;thank you to everyone who shared feedback - we got over 22,000 responses to our survey which helped us make significant changes to the policy you see today&lt;/p&gt;— B (@iamb) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/iamb/status/1339649561996918785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 17, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k9P9uT"&gt;At some point next year, Twitter plans to introduce a way to label accounts that are either automated or once belonging to a person who has died. “We are not planning to automatically remove the verified badge from inactive accounts of people who are no longer living, and are working on building a way to memorialize these accounts in 2021,” reads Twitter’s blog post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GiPVO8"&gt;Twitter says “this will also come with an updated policy for memorialization and a new application flow to request the memorialization of an account,” while automated accounts will at some point in the future be differentiated from human-run ones “to make it easier for people to know what’s a bot and what’s not.” Twitter isn’t yet disclosing what these labels will look like or how proactively it will enforce its label requirement on bot accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vTseaL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Twitter is planning new labels for automated and memorial accounts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gPxRtK"&gt;For human-run accounts, the company says as long as the account holder makes changes before January 20th to bring the account in line with its new verification requirements, there’s no risk of losing an existing badge. Those include ensuring an account has a verified email address or phone number, a profile image, and a display name. The company also plans to inform individuals at risk of losing their badge what they need to change to keep it before it takes action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kondGk"&gt;Twitter is reserving the right to remove verification. “Under our policy, we may also remove verification from accounts that are found to be in severe or repeated violation of the Twitter Rules. We will continue to evaluate such accounts on a case-by-case basis, and will make improvements in 2021 on the relationship between enforcement of our rules and verification,” the blog post continues. “As always, everyone on Twitter is subject to the Twitter Rules, and you can read more about our range of enforcement actions here.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xiQnAl"&gt;For users who want to apply to be verified, Twitter will launch a new “self-serve application process” within the app that will let applicants select a category for verification and confirming their identity. Twitter says it will use both human review and an automated system to wade through requests starting on January 20th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tenet is a complete misfire </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gyV7g36ptM374JnFiTBi0rX1kRg=/231x124:1209x776/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68544016/Screen_Shot_2020_12_17_at_3.20.15_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Warner Bros.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ilGjLJ"&gt;Christopher Nolan’s success is the sort of paradox that would be at the center of a Christopher Nolan movie. His films — often characterized as puzzle boxes — are meticulous works that walk the line between indulgent labyrinths and satisfying spectacle. They’re brainier than any superhero movie would dare to be, but they still find comparable success. This blue chip status has made Nolan the patron saint of guys who say, “I like movies that make you &lt;em&gt;think,” &lt;/em&gt;even if said thinking is just a question with an extremely clear answer — like “Was the Joker right?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vou2ij"&gt;Nolan’s films occupy a unique space in pop culture. The director of &lt;em&gt;The Dark Knight&lt;/em&gt; is one of the only filmmakers in Hollywood who is able to make an original nonfranchise film and have it be as big as &lt;em&gt;The Dark Knight&lt;/em&gt;. This makes it fascinating when a movie like &lt;em&gt;Tenet &lt;/em&gt;comes along because &lt;em&gt;Tenet &lt;/em&gt;is a complete misfire that underlines how charmed the director’s career has been. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z0Ke2i"&gt;Laid out on paper, though? &lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt; sounds awesome. The film follows a man known only as The Protagonist (John David Washington), a CIA agent who finds himself on the hunt for an arms dealer with an unusual weapon: bullets that fire backward through time. It’s called “inversion,” and with the right hardware, it can be done to anything, including cars and people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rwYM4V"&gt;Inversion is the hinge on which &lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt;’s mind-bending twists pivot. Unfortunately, it’s quite poorly explained (“Don’t try to understand it,” one character says, helpfully), and while it leads to some &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; action — an early fight scene between an “inverted” character and a “normal” one absolutely rules — the obfuscated plot robs the movie’s showstoppers of badly needed momentum. These scenes are few and far between, anchored by characters who are more puzzle pieces than people. There’s very little to hold on to as you hope for &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; good to pop up in the movie’s 2.5-hour runtime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7nU4AG"&gt;Some bright spots: Robert Pattinson, who plays the Protagonist’s handler, Neil, is tremendously fun to watch, even if he’s not in the film much. (He’ll make a great Batman.) Likewise, Elizabeth Debicki is terrific as a player in the movie’s espionage plot, but she’s mostly reduced to a damsel in distress. And the whole thing is set in remarkably drab locales; the film goes &lt;em&gt;so many &lt;/em&gt;places but loves none of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bT2d3n"&gt;That’s perhaps the biggest disappointment of &lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt;: it wants to be an unusually clever spy film, but Nolan isn’t terribly invested in the fun of spy movies. You know: cool outfits, flashy gear, people pushed to their absolute limit and managing to wear it incredibly well. And because the mechanics of the film’s plot require a lot of explanation just to follow what people are doing in a scene, it’s very easy to miss &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; they’re doing it. This is a shame because the reason for all this time-warping and subterfuge is actually compelling as hell!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EUM7aZ"&gt;Just so we’re clear: I am &lt;em&gt;pretty good&lt;/em&gt; at watching movies. I’ve put in my 10,000 hours, per Malcolm Gladwell’s absolutely airtight metrics, and that makes me an expert. Yet, I was still confused by the time the credits rolled. That isn’t necessarily a bad thing. One of the beautiful things about movies is how they can immerse us in stories that are bigger than us that defy easy comprehension. What unmoors me is the nature of my confusion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gojs7b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tenet &lt;/em&gt;is a film that explicitly encourages you to feel a thing and not think about it, but it  doesn’t offer any emotional anchors. It’s a disorientation that comes when you don’t feel you’re in the hands of someone with complete control over the narrative. You might be able to call some twists before they happen, but even if you do, it’s no more satisfying than a coin toss. Sure, you may have been right. But unless you had money on it, does it matter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HGxFCc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tenet &lt;/em&gt;is an absolute mess of a movie that stumbles doing all of the things I like about Christopher Nolan films. Directors are allowed missteps, obviously — this one is even pretty humanizing — but the whole situation is complicated by the circumstances surrounding the film’s release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MnM9p2"&gt;For months, &lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt; was Hollywood’s last holdout, delayed three times in the hopes that it might somehow have a blockbuster release even as the COVID-19 pandemic showed absolutely no signs of abating and other studios pushed their releases into 2021. That means, in some ways, &lt;em&gt;Tenet &lt;/em&gt;was seen as a foregone conclusion. It was an ambitious film from Christopher Nolan, the guy who turned a cerebral romp like &lt;em&gt;Inception&lt;/em&gt; into legitimately popular culture; &lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt; would offer the pleasures and profits his filmography is known for, with a fiercely loyal following buoying ticket sales even amid a pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n4k9I1"&gt;But now we know how the story ends. &lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt; is now available to buy on-demand, and it earned very little at the box office when it was released over Labor Day weekend — even as it kept movie theaters open and hemorrhaging money. The movie business leveraged all of its goodwill and hype in the service of Keeping Movies Alive by worsening a public health emergency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="13L2GX"&gt;The quality of the movie does not change the immoral nature of a release strategy like this, but knowing Hollywood wanted me to risk getting terribly sick to see this goddamn mess? It’s insulting.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New colors for the Galaxy S21 revealed in leaked renders</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5ILfqckS7PBJHh8BH58EZVZMDSE=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68544014/video_image_53PZcZnf_.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="00IONF"&gt;Samsung’s new Galaxy S21 line will come in several new colors, according to leaked press renders &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120106.html"&gt;acquired by &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Based on the images, the new colors will include light purple / violet, gray, black, white, and rosy pink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yIKuWd"&gt;Some of the colors will be limited to specific phones in the S21 line, &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/11/14/exclusive-specs-and-features-of-samsungs-galaxy-s21-smartphones/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung will also apparently add the word “Phantom” to the front of each color, maybe to reflect their more muted look. It’s rumored that the base 6.2-inch S21 will be available in phantom violet, phantom pink, phantom gray, and phantom white. Meanwhile the 6.7-inch S21 Plus will offer phantom gray, phantom black, and phantom violet. Finally, the high-end 6.8-inch S21 Ultra will come in just two colors, phantom black and phantom silver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7iNVNv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10239755"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HKhEU2"&gt;The camera bump for these new phones appears to be part of the metal rail that runs along the edge, and it will feature metallic finishes that pair with the new colors. &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; also dug up some &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120114.html"&gt;renders of the S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; that give a pretty good look at the back of the device, which appears to be loaded with cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BtRoS2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10239876"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6T0ttn"&gt;Along with the leaked images, both &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; say that the S21 Ultra will offer S Pen support. We received confirmation that the S Pen would be expanding beyond the Note based on &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-defies-one-size-fits-all-mobile-experiences/"&gt;a blog Samsung shared&lt;/a&gt;, but now we have a slightly better idea where it will head first. It’s rumored that the S Pen will be sold separately, and Samsung will reportedly offer a case it can be slotted into for phones that don’t feature the Note’s S Pen slot. Even with the rumored change, Samsung says the Galaxy Note will be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22177972/galaxy-note-21-still-happening-yonhap"&gt;sticking around for now&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YDT22A"&gt;We essentially now have a full picture of what Samsung’s new Galaxy line will bring in January. To highlight just a few features &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/11/14/exclusive-specs-and-features-of-samsungs-galaxy-s21-smartphones/"&gt;A&lt;em&gt;ndroid Police &lt;/em&gt;has collected&lt;/a&gt;, there’ll be 5G and Wi-Fi 6 support across the line, a range of battery sizes from 4,000mAh to 5,000mAh, and a new Snapdragon 875 or Exynos 2100 processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7BRceB"&gt;Samsung’s event, where these new Galaxy phones and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22180111/galaxy-buds-pro-360-view-samsung-wireless"&gt;leaked new Galaxy Buds&lt;/a&gt; will likely make an appearance, is set for January (with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167208/samsung-galaxy-s21-january-14th-launch-india-plus-ultra-s-pen"&gt;a rumored January 14th launch&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tL2uym"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best iPad deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tK0LbEtEShHQh97Hs1ENU1d_fQg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66899976/bking_200322_3945_0023.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1E6t41"&gt;Deals on Apple’s iPad are more common than you might think. Whether you’re after the most affordable iPad, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or iPad Mini, there’s usually some sort of price cut happening somewhere. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers. But that’s what we’re doing each day when we hunt for deals, so let us help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzVhpS"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each of the current iPads available for purchase. Sometimes, there just isn’t a deal happening. In that case, we’ve mentioned how much the most recent sale price was for, so you know when to take the plunge. But most of the time, there’s some sort of deal going on, be it on a new or refurbished model. When there is a deal we think is worth telling you about, you’ll find it mentioned with any and all context you need to hear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLLRFN"&gt;If you need a little help figuring out exactly which iPad is best for you, we’ve got you covered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21280856/apple-ipad-mini-air-pro-comparison-how-to-choose"&gt;with a comparison post featuring all of the latest models here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rFr0TF"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="iPad 2020 review: here we go again, again|95745" data-volume-uuid="d243cb26d" data-volume-id="95745" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-699" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;This is Apple’s most affordable iPad, usually costing $329 for the tablet with 32GB of storage or $429 for the 128GB model. Each has a 10.2-inch display and features the A12 Bionic processor, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="T559mJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The new 2020 iPad isn’t enough for Zoom school","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5m6ZrK"&gt;Currently, you can get the base iPad with 128GB of storage for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B08J61NFNR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$380 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;Apple released a new iPad mini in early 2019, carrying forth the same 7.9-inch display and design from previous iterations with refreshed internal specs within. It has the A12 Bionic processor found in the base iPad. Apple makes a 64GB and 256GB model of the iPad mini with Wi-Fi support, set at $400 and $500, respectively. If you want LTE connectivity, the starting price is $530.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="X7SsrD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s new iPad mini is a terrific small tablet with no competition","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="QD0sMe"&gt;Sales on this model are a little rarer, but you can buy the 64GB iPad Mini in gold for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07PQ8VVG4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$350 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, or for $394 at &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1468029-REG%2Fapple_muqy2ll_a_7_9_ipad_mini_early.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The 2020 iPad Air has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to last year’s 10.5-inch display and features thinner bezels around the display and has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, which is located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="u6ZCyC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple iPad Air 2019 review: happy medium","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/27/18282956/apple-ipad-air-2019-review-ios-features-specs-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="VGT87b"&gt;Like its predecessor, this year’s iPad Air model comes in 64GB or 256GB storage configurations. The Wi-Fi models start at $599 and $749, making the starting price slightly more than last year’s models. However, the model that also supports LTE starts at $729. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fzykEb"&gt;If you’re looking for the latest iPad model, B&amp;amp;H Photo has select colors on sale. You can get the 64GB configuration in &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1594485-REG%2Fapple_myfn2ll_a_10_9_ipad_air_wi_fi.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Silver for only $569&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1594484-REG%2Fapple_myfm2ll_a_10_9_ipad_airwi_fi_64gb.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Space Gray model for $579&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7jir3Q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546269"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oBFocq"&gt;If you don’t mind the last generation model, Best Buy is discounting the 3rd Gen 2019 iPad Air by &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724958762425958680" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$70 off for the 64GB model&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the price down to $430. Or, you can get a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724958787565478388" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model, which is down to $600&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="X1XOEB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737683"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="nFcTiz"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="iPad Pro (2020) review: beyond the trackpad|75424" data-volume-uuid="a90d1f137" data-volume-id="75424" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-86" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VbsKiA"&gt;Apple’s 2020 iteration of the iPad Pro looks a lot like the one that came in 2018, aside from its dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike the less-expensive models, this one ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of Lightning. It also has Face ID to unlock instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor and has a high refresh display. The iPad Pro has the most stacked spec sheet of Apple’s entire iPad lineup, and that comes through in the price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="B73hce"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple iPad Pro review 2020: small spec bump, big camera bump","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="MHHxDV"&gt;The 11-inch model with 128GB of storage starts at $800, and bumping up the screen size to 12.9 inches raises the price to $1,000. Each size supports up to 1TB of storage, with the top-spec model going for $1,299 (11-inch) and $1,499 (12.9-inch). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g8em56"&gt;If you are looking to pick up the 11-inch model at a discounted price, the 128GB model with Wi-Fi is on sale starting at &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1553825-REG%2Fapple_my252ll_a_11_ipad_pro_early.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$769 at B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B08637NV8M?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$794 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Judge orders Tim Cook and Craig Federighi to testify in Epic’s Fortnite case</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LLOyYKdEXy0px7Nx11YRGIKtlWs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68543592/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q5ZZTi"&gt;The latest development in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"&gt;ongoing lawsuit between Epic Games and Apple&lt;/a&gt; over the iPhone maker’s App Store policies and its removal of the iOS version of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;is a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fdocument%2F488521365%2FApple-Versus-Epic-Federighi-Must-Testify%23from_embed&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F17%2F22187339%2Fepic-apple-fortnite-lawsuit-testimony-tim-cook-craig-federighi#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new order&lt;/a&gt; from Judge Thomas Hixson outlining rules for Apple CEO Tim Cook and software engineering chief Craig Federighi’s testimony in the case. The court order, spotted on Thursday by &lt;a href="https://www.imore.com/apple-must-hand-over-craig-federighi-documents-epic-games-lawsuit-court-rules?utm_source=im_tw&amp;amp;utm_medium=tw_card&amp;amp;utm_content=72410&amp;amp;utm_campaign=social"&gt;&lt;em&gt;iMore&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/12/17/judge-orders-tim-cook-and-craig-federighi-to-testify-in-epic-case"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, gives us our first glimpse into how Apple’s executive leadership may be involved in the ongoing antitrust lawsuit, which is scheduled to go to trial as early as July of next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AuKda0"&gt;The order, issued on Wednesday following a December 15th hearing, says Apple will not be able to limit Cook’s testimony to four hours, as the company had sought. Only after Apple provides the necessary documents requested by Epic’s lawyers on the App Store’s operations can the length of testimony be determined, the order states. Hixon also shot down a request from Apple to replace Federighi with one of his lieutenants, Erik Neuenschwander.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qU9Y2q"&gt;“The Court rules for Plaintiffs and orders Apple to make Federighi a document custodian instead of Neuenschwander. First, Plaintiffs have shown that Federighi is a higher-level decision maker whose documents are more likely to go to the heart of Apple’s business justification defense,” reads the order. “Second, if Plaintiffs have guessed wrong, and Federighi’s documents are not as relevant as Neuenschwander’s are, that hurts Plaintiffs. Assuming the requests are relevant and proportional, it is up to Plaintiffs to decide what discovery they want to take to prove their claims, and if they make bad choices, that’s their problem.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BoQxdL"&gt;The case is still in the preliminary stages, and much of the public back-and-forth criticism from Apple and Epic that erupted in August has quieted as both sides’ lawyers have begun preparing for the next stages of the lawsuit. An upcoming deadline for new filings is set for January 6th, 2021 with a hearing two days later. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram is rolling out new notifications about COVID-19 information </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WIf0sjyC9zRFMclft7Ncbw-vMiQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68543590/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0002.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2Vj8b3"&gt;Instagram is announcing two new features to help combat COVID-19 misinformation: users in areas with surging cases will see a link to their local health authority at the top of their feed and anyone searching for vaccine information will also be directed to credible health sources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U2ROAF"&gt;These measures will be taken in addition to the social network &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/9/18553821/instagram-anti-vax-vaccines-hashtag-blocking-misinformation-hoaxes"&gt;blocking hashtags that contain vaccine misinformation&lt;/a&gt;, which also got a mention in announcement tweets. The features come as many platform companies take steps to keep coronavirus misinformation from spreading at a vital time for the US, as health institutions struggle with record hospitalizations and the first of the approved COVID-19 vaccines &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174075/coronavirus-vaccinations-begin-first-pfizer-health-care-workers"&gt;start to roll out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zDM7GP"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Second, in addition to removing widely debunked claims about the COVID-19 vaccines, when people search for terms related to vaccines or COVID-19, we’ll direct them to information from credible health authorities. &lt;a href="https://t.co/J5AUx3pJ4w"&gt;pic.twitter.com/J5AUx3pJ4w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Instagram Comms (@InstagramComms) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/InstagramComms/status/1339641503602397187?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 17, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tpe0KM"&gt;Facebook, Instagram’s parent company (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22165534/instagram-facebook-antitrust-ftc-lawsuit-monopoly-case-opportunity"&gt;for now&lt;/a&gt;) has rolled out it’s own misinformation-combatting feature, sending users notifications &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22177085/facebook-covid-19-misinformation-notifications"&gt;if they’ve interacted with posts that contain it&lt;/a&gt;. YouTube has started adding cards below videos about the pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573019/youtube-information-panels-fact-check-boxes-covid-19-vaccination-misinformation"&gt;linking to sources like the CDC and WHO&lt;/a&gt;, the same organizations that Instagram uses as examples. Twitter has also just recently announced that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22179074/twitter-coronavirus-misinformation-covid19-vaccine-vaccination-label"&gt;it will be removing misinformation&lt;/a&gt; about the COVID-19 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Get one-year of PlayStation Plus for $33 today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D5c3ng-nWdTqNlaVSdKfNNMK_i4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68528952/vpavic_4261_20201023_0104.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5b53xh"&gt;I always enjoy this time of the year. Usually, I take some time off of work and use it as a golden opportunity to tackle my ever-growing backlog of games. With the year wrapping up and a ton of great games already available (and even more coming over the next few years), it’s truly a great time to be a gamer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SYuaN0"&gt;Today’s deals spotlight an incredible deal for PS4 and PS5 owners, a sale on Dell’s 27-inch 1440p gaming monitor, plus a few deals on some great headphones and wireless earbuds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fHdAxM"&gt;Get $27 off a year of PlayStation Plus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1npEWm"&gt;If you were one of the lucky ones to grab a PS5, I recommend taking advantage of this &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation Plus subscription deal, which is $33&lt;/a&gt; at Eneba.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E6mJZw"&gt;This is a great price if you want online multiplayer, free monthly games, and access to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440388/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-games-titles"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, a digital compilation of “generation-defining” PS4 games available exclusively for PS5 users with an active PlayStation Plus membership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V1PkT7"&gt;And yes, this membership will still work on PS4 consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="57p3e9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vUaxRi"&gt;Grab a 27-inch Dell 1440p gaming monitor for $450&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="TfrSK0"&gt;If you recently upgraded your PC gaming rig to deliver a 1440p resolution gaming experience and need a monitor to support the higher resolution, &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fdell-27-gaming-monitor-s2721dgf%2Fapd%2F210-axeh%2Fmonitors-monitor-accessories%3FAID%3D4485850%26cjevent%3D1604740b406c11eb83c600aa0a240614%26gacd%3D9694607-23736398-5750457-266319267-127795103%26dgc%3Daf%26VEN1%3D12578053-4485850-162f05da406c11eba4e79633568f93140INT%26dclid%3DCOHZjoKQ1e0CFcnmKAUdgZcBwA#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell’s S2721DGF gaming monitor is down to $450&lt;/a&gt; (usually $610) on the company’s direct website. This monitor supports Nvidia G-Sync, includes a 16:9 aspect ratio IPS panel, and supports HDR400 with a 98 percent DCI-P3 color gamut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4Tiuch"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10232615"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="71kLdg"&gt;Save $100 on Sennheiser’s Momentum 3 Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rPuSg7"&gt;If you want a comfortable pair of noise-canceling headphones and are okay with spending a pretty penny for better sound quality, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20843395/sennheiser-momentum-wireless-3-review-release-date-news-specs-features-noise-cancelling-headphones"&gt;Sennheiser’s third-generation Momentum Wireless headphones&lt;/a&gt; are excellent. Over at Amazon, you can get these wireless headphones for as low as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-Momentum-Cancelling-Headphones-Functionality/dp/B07VW98ZKG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=b205e0761da348f87244cc7c77f67222&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$300 in black&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-Momentum-Cancelling-Headphones-Functionality/dp/B08B3MJBW8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=84f04a510180642cbea1d89730b0446b&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="oahnAZ"&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro are under $200 (again) at Woot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="bXlgAF"&gt;This is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2020/11/25/21719200/apple-airpods-pros-black-friday-deal-sale-walmart"&gt;not the lowest price&lt;/a&gt; we have seen Apple’s flagship wireless earbuds go, but getting these for under $200 is still a great bargain. The AirPods Pro are on sale at a few places, but &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-airpods-pro-19" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the lowest right now is $190 at Woot&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Walmart will have the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S available online again at 3PM ET today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PPN47ioM_w1V_CHAhbWquMRSgT4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68543346/vpavic_4261_20201023_0155.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zHKeIC"&gt;If you’re still hoping to secure a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X / S before the end of the year, Walmart is giving you another shot to purchase one of these next-gen consoles. Today, the retailer confirmed that it would restock the consoles at 12PM PT / 3PM ET on December 17th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="enEvIS"&gt;When you visit the product pages for the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/PlayStation-5-Console/363472942&amp;amp;sharedid=verge&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Be%5D21940780%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/seort/443574645&amp;amp;sharedid=verge&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Be%5D21940780%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/seort/606518560&amp;amp;sharedid=verge&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Be%5D21940780%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series S&lt;/a&gt;, you should see a message showing that a restock is confirmed for today. Due to these consoles’ high demand, they will likely sell out quickly, so if you want one, don’t hesitate to bite the bullet and hit purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XYug5W"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226833"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2hzqGS"&gt;Like previous restocks done at both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174265/ps5-xbox-series-x-s-restock-best-buy"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176739/ps5-xbox-series-x-s-restock-walmart-time-date"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week, you can only purchase a PlayStation 5 or an Xbox Series X / S through Walmart’s website. It’s unknown when exactly Walmart plans to sell these gadgets in stores due to the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s a first look at Samsung’s upcoming midrange Galaxy A72 5G</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung Galaxy A72 5G leak" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GC7lNClBlSK3CEVqe2vogn6Ko5w=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68543208/samsung_a72_5g_render_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An alleged render of the Galaxy A72 5G suggests few external changes from the A71.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Steve Hemmerstoffer / OnLeaks&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oiWIPH"&gt;The leaks are coming faster as we near 2021, which is when Samsung is expected to announce a new batch of smartphones. We’ve seen glimpses of what the flagship Galaxy S21 might look like, and &lt;a href="https://www.voice.com/post/@onleaks/samsung-galaxy-a72-5g-exclusive-5k-renders-1608138938-255512246"&gt;thanks to serial-leaker OnLeaks / Steve Hemmerstoffer&lt;/a&gt;, it seems we have our first look at the top of the budget-friendlier A-series. These alleged renders of the Galaxy A72 5G hint that, at least on the outside, the changes from its A71 predecessor are subtle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Samsung Galaxy A72 5G front and rear" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zb3wGApNzjxgRkeDdxj9CWjO3Qg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22179747/samsung_a72_5g_render_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Steve Hemmerstoffer / OnLeaks&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy A72 5G appears to offer a 6.7-inch display like its predecessor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gJDSn6"&gt;The images show a 6.7-inch display with a centered hole-punch camera, which is consistent with the A71. That device used a very nice 1080 x 2400 pixel Super AMOLED Plus panel. The A72 appears to offer three rear-facing cameras plus a depth sensor, which is also consistent with the previous model, though the positioning of the flash and depth camera has shifted slightly. For reference, the A71 offered a 64-megapixel main camera (one of its chief differentiators from the step-down A51 5G) along with a 12-megapixel ultrawide, 5-megapixel macro, and 5-megapixel depth-sensing imager.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Samsung Galaxy A72 5G leaked renders" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tcktCYmg00X30R-ovbJLI3QNJJE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22179755/samsung_a72_5g_render_4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Steve Hemmerstoffer / OnLeaks&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It looks like Samsung isn’t completely doing away with the 3.5mm audio jack&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tbep5n"&gt;And lo, in the Year of Our Lord 2021, it looks like we will still be able to buy phones with a 3.5mm headphone jack. The A71 offered one, and it looks like the feature is sticking around for the next generation at least. And naturally, we can expect to see the phone’s headline feature, 5G compatibility, offered in the next generation as well. The A71 provided both mmWave and sub-600MHz spectrum 5G connectivity, so it’s more than reasonable to assume the A72 will, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="mGwPVx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung’s Galaxy A51 has two good things going for it: the screen and the price","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21251569/samsung-galaxy-a51-review-price-screen-camera-battery-life"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="RNnItj"&gt;Again, we don’t have confirmation of an official launch date or price for the Galaxy A72 5G. It’s looking more and more likely that we’ll see at least the Galaxy S21 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167208/samsung-galaxy-s21-january-14th-launch-india-plus-ultra-s-pen"&gt;in a few weeks&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s less clear if the A-series devices will be debuting then as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FhkVIG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Kindle deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VfQnBwLbLIeiZEVOPMuNUumuNok=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67715739/akrales_190723_3560_0016.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MyfWR7"&gt;When it comes to finding a device to use to read your ebooks, you have a few options to choose from. You can always buy a tablet or simply use your smartphone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doom-scrolling through Twitter. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while a niche piece of tech, is designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with no other functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDKHVT"&gt;Amazon has dominated the space for years with its Kindle products. Right now, there are three Kindle models you can choose from, each with pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRHBaM"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each of the current Kindles available for purchase. Sometimes, there isn’t a deal for one or, in some instances, all of the products. In that case, we’ve mentioned the most recent sale price so you know when is a good time to buy the e-reader at a discounted rate. But most of the time, there’s some deal going on. Whether you’re looking for a new model or to grab a bundle that includes a few extras, these are the best Kindle deals right now.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pkAGJ6iYjGrpA-YsqWJjBBYbkTY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16018841/akrales_190408_3351_0016.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kindle (2019).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jqPttv"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/4/10/18302177/amazon-kindle-base-model-low-resolution-screen-backlight-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kindle (10th Generation)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mXAcFi"&gt;This is Amazon’s most affordable e-reader, usually costing $90. Released in 2019, this base Kindle model includes a front light, comes in one storage configuration of 8GB, and comes with or without ad support. Despite including the same 167ppi resolution as its predecessors, this model has a slightly higher contrast than earlier models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIAlEv"&gt;Right now, you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Essentials-including-Amazon-Printed-Adapter/dp/B08C6NDPFM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=08c9fedb17174c7a7fe940944cd78418&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Essentials Bundle&lt;/a&gt;, which is $120 ($15 off its usual price), and it includes a printed cover and a power adapter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="JypT34"&gt;The entry-level Kindle and Oasis models were not the only ones that received a refresh in 2019, Amazon also announced and released a Kindle Kids Edition Bundle, which provides age-appropriate content for younger readers who prefer digital books for $109 ($20 more than the base Kindle). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LlYfl"&gt;The Kindle Kids Edition consists of five items: the device, a case, a two-year extended replacement guarantee (in the event the device breaks), and one year of Amazon’s FreeTime Unlimited service. The latter is the biggest selling point of this device, as it allows parents to grant access to a digital library of kid-friendly books like &lt;em&gt;Percy Jackson&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit &lt;/em&gt;at no additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7AYlh"&gt;Right now, Amazon is offering the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Essentials-including-Protector-Adapter/dp/B07XW24MVK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Kids Edition Essentials Bundle, which is $128&lt;/a&gt; and includes all of the things previously mentioned above, plus a power adapter. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kindle Paperwhite (fourth-generation).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="t6m9om"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/7/18065960/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2018-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kindle Paperwhite (Fourth Generation)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="P1C5xu"&gt;Amazon released the fourth-generation Kindle Paperwhite in 2018. Starting at $130, the Paperwhite comes in three different configurations: 8GB Wi-Fi, 32GB Wi-Fi, and a second 32GB model that drops the ads from the lock screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qneu65"&gt;The Paperwhite features a six-inch, pin-sharp backlit display, which is the main reason to get one over the base Kindle. The 2018 model added a few useful features normally found on Amazon’s flagship reader, the Oasis, such as water resistance and Audible audiobook support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Emeowb"&gt;Amazon has knocked $20 off its Kindle Paperwhite Essentials Bundle, which includes either an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HKWNVSD/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=261395a0382ce2c0aecf3c9f9e099dcc&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HKX97CR/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=3a5cb4645a5b1f86f9b8e704cc584654&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB&lt;/a&gt; Paperwhite (with ads), plus a leather cover and a power adapter. If you are a fan of &lt;em&gt;The Hunger Games&lt;/em&gt; book series, the e-commerce giant has four bundles that include the Paperwhite (with ads) and exclusive covers designed by the series’ author, plus a power adapter for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Bundle-including-Ad-Supported/dp/B087NMH2F7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$160 if you buy the 8GB&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Bundle-including-Ad-Supported/dp/B087NM77FC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$190 if you buy the 32GB&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vOUHwk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552401"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/50C1xWX4q-mLYmoXmHAKkoXLX1s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18329976/akrales_190723_3560_0055.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kindle Oasis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="X5jbTU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707619/amazon-kindle-oasis-2019-e-reader-review-price-specs-features-display"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kindle Oasis (Third Generation)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IByP4u"&gt;The Kindle Oasis is the most expensive of the lineup, starting at $250. The device comes in two storage configurations: 8GB or 32GB, and like the other models, you can get the product with or without ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1AvXZM"&gt;The Kindle Oasis 2019 model looks very similar to its previous model. It still maintains its waterproof, seven-inch, 300ppi E Ink display and supports Audible audiobooks by connecting to Bluetooth. Yet, the biggest change to the Kindle Oasis 2019 is that it can adjust the color temperature to a yellow-toned display, making it easier to read at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxP7sb"&gt;In the past, we have seen the Kindle Oasis go down to as low as $200 if you get the 32GB model, which is the lowest it has ever been for that configuration to date. While there are no deals on just the Oasis itself, Amazon is currently offering an Essentials Bundle for $30 off its normal price. You can get either the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087YZGRGQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=e940143295b150503dca7aa3985b2fd5&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087Z7Z3DF/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=7b5fe424246439c89a69b3302267e073&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB&lt;/a&gt;, and it will also include a leather cover, a power adapter, plus three months of Kindle Unlimited.&lt;/p&gt;
