    <title>Samsung teases Exynos 2200 with AMD’s RDNA 2 graphics coming January 11th</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KEgTJsb_Jz7ZuWI64xcM6kx_z5E=/266x0:1985x1146/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70331839/Screen_Shot_2021_12_30_at_5.17.19_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wRBqpn"&gt;Samsung has &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/minisite/exynos/playtime-is-over/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;started teasing its next flagship smartphone SoC&lt;/a&gt; — expected to be called the Exynos 2200 — ahead of a January 11th announcement with a tantalizing tidbit of information: the new chipset will feature a GPU powered by AMD’s RDNA 2 graphics architecture, better known for powering the next-gen graphics on the Xbox Series X, PlayStation 5, and AMD’s RX 6000-series graphics cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="TNfkkr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung’s leaked Galaxy S22 Ultra is just straight up a Galaxy Note now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22860479/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-leak-official-image-note-design"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="lLMoxs"&gt;Of course, given that the Exynos 2200 will be powering a smartphone, the new GPU won’t be magically enabling next-gen graphics on par with the most powerful consoles and gaming PCs. But it likely will enable some improvements in graphics, along with whatever other upgrade Samsung has up its sleeve for its latest flagship chip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HjFMkm"&gt;

Stay tuned for the next &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Exynos?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Exynos&lt;/a&gt; with the new GPU born from RDNA 2. January 11, 2022. &lt;a href="https://t.co/0H2MeVUbeS"&gt;pic.twitter.com/0H2MeVUbeS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Samsung Exynos (@SamsungExynos) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SamsungExynos/status/1476538563235831810?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bZz6Yi"&gt;As a successor to 2021’s Exynos 2100, the Exynos 2200 will likely power some of Samsung’s most powerful phones in 2022, including the presumed Galaxy S22 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22860479/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-leak-official-image-note-design"&gt;S22 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;. As is usually the case, though, it’s likely that phones using Samsung’s in-house designs will be limited to international models of its upcoming flagships, with the US variants presumably set to use Qualcomm’s recently announced Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tWTdkT"&gt;Fortunately, we won’t have to wait long to get more details on the Exynos 2200 (or whatever Samsung calls it), given that the company is promising a formal debut on January 11th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s leaked Galaxy S22 Ultra is just straight up a Galaxy Note now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zbSEqAa5HvBi6XrDoYApqqsUvCE=/15x0:1065x700/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70331734/s22U.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1476660792527306754" target="_blank"&gt;evleaks (Twitter)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZL2j1N"&gt;It looks like Samsung’s next flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S22 Ultra, will borrow more heavily from the Galaxy Note’s DNA than ever before. In fact, a newly leaked official render &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1476660792527306754"&gt;published by Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt; confirms that the phone is pretty much a Note in every way except for its name. Wider screen with more surface to write on? Check. S Pen silo? Check. Flat top and bottom? Yep. Around back is a camera array that sticks closely to the layout from the S21 Ultra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JjmHlF"&gt;Personally, I think the S21 Ultra was one of the boldest, best-looking phones Samsung has ever produced — especially that sleek matte black version. It owned the large camera bump in a way that actually looked &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Galaxy S21 Ultra, in Phantom Black" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hqNHCbYQFfkdxl7hLhCT0VijTvk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248897/vpavic_210118_4377_0090.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra put a unique spin on the camera bump. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9xbO2A"&gt;While I’m glad to see Samsung has found room for the sensors in a way that keeps the back of the device uniform, there’s definitely something a little more bland about this design. It looks every bit like a Note 10 Plus or Note 20 Ultra with a revamped camera system, but maybe that’s exactly what some Samsung fans want. &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s22-ultra-black-images-awesome/"&gt;Real-world shots of the S22 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; have also leaked out recently, and yet again, it’s looking pretty great in black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OLi9Xg"&gt;Whatever can help boost sales of the company’s traditional phones is probably the right move. The company is happy to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22859804/samsung-foldable-phone-sales-shipments-2021-forecast"&gt;talk up the momentum of foldables&lt;/a&gt;, but the S21 lineup reportedly disappointed in its retail performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AuSiwk"&gt;Based on past history, Samsung should announce the S22 family sometime in February. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel and Samsung’s new demo shows how blisteringly fast a PCIe 5.0 SSD setup will be</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OmhMgDCrvVO-2q_HnT7td3Pme8M=/0x21:1000x688/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70331436/PCIe_5.0_SSD_main2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GWroGG"&gt;PCIe 5.0 SSDs have already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/23/22851422/samsung-adata-pcie-5-0-ssd-ces-speed-date"&gt;started to get announced&lt;/a&gt; ahead of CES 2022, with Samsung and Adata teasing early hardware that supports the new standard. But it’s not just theoretical: Intel has released a new demo video showing off Samsung’s new PM1743 PCIe NVMe SSD in action (together with Intel’s Core i9-12900K CPU, of course) to hit data speeds over 13GB/s in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YH3LX7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Perks of the job! Was going to save this demo for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CES2022?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#CES2022&lt;/a&gt; but with that off the table, why not just share it with everyone right now?! Here’s a 12th Gen ⁦&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/intel?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@intel&lt;/a&gt;⁩ Core i9-12900K system paired with a new ⁦&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Samsung?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Samsung&lt;/a&gt;⁩ PM1743 PCIe 5.0 SSD getting over 13GB/s!! &lt;a href="https://t.co/oyL08KzDtV"&gt;pic.twitter.com/oyL08KzDtV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ryan Shrout (@ryanshrout) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ryanshrout/status/1476609814402945029?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HdrgbT"&gt;To put that in perspective, the PlayStation 5 touts a PCIe Gen 4 SSD as one of its main selling points, with Sony arguing that the ultra-fast speeds on its solid-state drive enable the near-instant load times on its consoles. &lt;em&gt;That &lt;/em&gt;drive tops out at about 5.5GB/s, or more than half of the speeds that the Intel / Samsung system can manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="xxaDcV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"First super fast PCIe 5.0 SSDs teased ahead of CES","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/23/22851422/samsung-adata-pcie-5-0-ssd-ces-speed-date"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="WYC2i1"&gt;Of course, that kind of data transfer rate isn’t exactly the most feasible set up right now, given that it requires a rig with Intel’s latest, most powerful processor and an enterprise-grade SSD that isn’t even out yet (and, presumably, will come with a pretty hefty price tag whenever consumer-grade versions do hit shelves sometime in the future). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eh5OWq"&gt;Still, the demo is an impressive one that shows off the potential of what next-generation storage setups could offer once PCIe 5.0 drives do become the norm down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c41wbB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Plans to capture CO2 from coal plants wasted federal dollars, watchdog says</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Operations Inside The NRG Energy Inc. Coal Power Plant" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e7W9uT-1pNS9Aszswgz-VWra69U=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70331211/643866618.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Water vapor rises from the NRG Energy Inc. WA Parish generating station in Thompsons, Texas, U.S., on Thursday, Feb. 16, 2017. The plant was home to the Petra Nova Carbon Capture Project, until it shut down in 2021 because of high costs.&amp;nbsp; | Luke Sharrett/Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="36YVlb"&gt;The Biden administration wants to shove more money into projects that are supposed to capture CO2 emissions from power plants and industrial facilities before they can escape and heat up the planet. But carbon capture technologies that the Department of Energy has already supported in the name of tackling climate change have mostly fallen flat, according to a recent &lt;a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-22-105111"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by the watchdog Government Accountability Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hO15jY"&gt;About $1.1 billion has flowed from the Department of Energy to carbon capture and storage (CCS) demonstration projects since 2009. Had they panned out, nine coal plants and industrial facilities would have been outfitted with devices that scrub most of the CO2 out of their emissions. Once captured, the CO2 can be sent via pipelines to underground storage in geologic formations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcylDn"&gt;That’s not what happened. The DOE doled out $684 million to coal six coal plants, but only one of them actually got built and started operating before shuttering in 2020. Of the three separate industrial facilities that received $438 million, just two got off the ground. Without more accountability, “DOE may risk expending significant taxpayer funds on CCS demonstrations that have little likelihood of success,” the GAO says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="9guAAj"&gt;&lt;q&gt; There ought to be more congressional oversight &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OTp64u"&gt;To stop that from happening, the GAO says there ought to be more congressional oversight of DOE-funded demonstration projects. The GAO report also recommends that the DOE do a better job of choosing which projects to fund and that the DOE should establish more consistent “scopes, schedules, and budgets” for projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tLreGg"&gt;It’s a critical time to figure all these things out, because CCS projects in the US are about to get a big boost. In November, Congress passed a bipartisan infrastructure bill that included $2.5 billion for CCS demonstration projects. It also includes another $6 billion for large-scale CCS projects and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22606395/pipeline-battle-co2-removal-carbon-capture-bipartisan-infrastructure"&gt;pipelines to transport CO2&lt;/a&gt; to storage sites. Altogether, the new infrastructure law marks the largest investment in carbon capture and storage in the history of the technology, &lt;a href="https://www.globalccsinstitute.com/news-media/latest-news/us-congress-passes-bill-with-the-single-largest-ccs-infrastructure-investment-ever/"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the think tank Global CCS Institute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3R7ftj"&gt;More money could be on the way if Democrats successfully push through their budget reconciliation bill, a $1.75 trillion environmental and social spending package. The bill could increase tax incentives for carbon capture technology, giving power plants outfitted with it a maximum of $85 per ton of CO2 captured compared to the current $50 maximum under the current 45Q tax credit. Power plants would need to capture at least 75 percent of their emissions in order to qualify for the tax credit, under the new parameters in the bill. It’s a requirement that some CCS advocates &lt;a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/big-payout-more-co2-greens-split-over-dems-ccs-plan/"&gt;want to eliminate&lt;/a&gt;, because they think the high standard could chill investment in the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N0F7uP"&gt;Investors’ cold feet doomed CCS demo projects at coal plants that the GAO studied, says the Clean Air Task Force. The nonprofit, which supports CCS technology, is one of the groups pushing to get rid of the 75 percent requirement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lCSb8K"&gt;“Coal power projects were not great candidates for demo dollars not primarily because of technical issues with the plants but because they couldn’t secure outside investor support,” Lee Beck, international director of carbon capture at the Clean Air Task Force, said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YW14Ok"&gt;Falling natural gas prices and uncertainty around markets for carbon credits “negatively affected the economic viability” of coal plants with carbon capture technologies, the report says. Adding CCS to power plants also increases the cost of electricity production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hu1fPY"&gt;Compared to power plants, capturing carbon from industrial facilities — for example, those that make ammonia used in fertilizer — can be more cost effective because they often produce more concentrated streams of CO2. Because the CO2 in coal plant emissions is relatively diffuse, carbon capture devices hooked up to coal plants require more energy to run. Beck called the DOE’s spending at industrial sites a “big success” since two of the three projects got up and running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZDuh9"&gt;In comments sent back to the GAO, the DOE said that developing CCS technologies for new coal plants is important because “current trends indicate that globally many &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22641178/global-power-sector-emissions-rise-pandemic"&gt;new coal power plants will continue&lt;/a&gt; to be built in coming decades.” The GAO also says that the US “will need to rely on CCS as an essential mitigation option” for climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="i2rz6l"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They are simply fossil fuel subsidies by another name.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VJMP0e"&gt;Other environmental advocates are much more skeptical of the technology and say the GAO report only shows that CCS projects are a bad investment. “We should stop deploying hundreds of millions of dollars to prop up the industries responsible for the climate crisis through fantasy technologies like CCS,” Adrien Salazar, policy director at the nonprofit Grassroots Global Justice Alliance, wrote to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email. “Federal investments for CCS are greenwashing – they are simply fossil fuel subsidies by another name.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kWlAKE"&gt;CCS paired with a polluting power plant has yet to be rolled out at a commercial scale, according to the GAO report. For the most part, Salazar points out, the technology has been used by the fossil fuel industry &lt;a href="https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/fossil-gas/world-cannot-meet-climate-targets-relying-carbon-capture-and-storage/"&gt;for a process called enhanced oil recovery&lt;/a&gt;. Fossil fuel companies shoot captured carbon dioxide deep into the ground to push out hard-to-reach oil reserves. So critics of CCS say the technology is just a tactic to keep the oil and gas industry afloat even as the world increasingly turns to renewable energy to stave off the climate crisis. Even if the captured CO2 isn’t used for enhanced oil recovery, they worry, the technology might extend the life span of gas and coal power plants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imqqrO"&gt;Development in any new oil, coal, and gas infrastructure needs to completely stop in order to avoid catastrophic climate change, the International Energy Agency warned in a landmark &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; this year. That’s coming from an agency that formed in the 1970s to safeguard the world’s oil supply but has more recently heeded urgent calls from the scientific community to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/"&gt;within a few decades&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Two NFT copycats are fighting over which is the real fake Bored Ape Yacht Club</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="PHAYC leftward-facing Bored Ape Yacht Club avatars" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p_uWUfl1t3tugia26lqE2D3MTug=/0x0:1352x901/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70331194/Screenshot_2021_12_30_140753.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4cnebo"&gt;A pair of non-fungible token projects are testing the boundary between plagiarism and parody. Digital marketplace OpenSea has banned the PHAYC and Phunky Ape Yacht Club (or PAYC) collections, both of which are based on the same gimmick: selling NFTs with mirrored but otherwise identical versions of high-priced Bored Ape Yacht Club avatars. Now the dueling projects are selling their apes while dodging bans from other marketplaces, becoming the latest example of how the NFT world handles copied art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SvitS4"&gt;Bored Ape Yacht Club (or BAYC) NFTs are some of the most expensive crypto art assets — they recently overtook CryptoPunks as the &lt;a href="https://decrypt.co/89060/bored-ape-yacht-club-nfts-flip-cryptopunks-floor-price-in-ethereum"&gt;highest-priced NFT avatars&lt;/a&gt; with the cheapest available ape selling for $217,000. Like other avatars, though, anybody can technically copy or modify the associated ape picture. So PAYC and PHAYC simply flip the right-facing BAYC avatars to face left, associate them with cryptocurrency tokens, and resell them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="untLg0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6MdGmz"&gt;PAYC announced its launch &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/phunkyApeYC/status/1467946301748748292"&gt;in early December&lt;/a&gt; with a loose mission statement &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/phunkyCaesar/status/1468896212019400704"&gt;promoting decentralization&lt;/a&gt; and denigrating “rich douchebags” who had (allegedly) taken over the original ape market. It called back to CryptoPhunks, &lt;a href="https://editorial.superrare.com/2021/08/19/cryptophunks-cryptopunks-parody-or-copycat/"&gt;a similar project&lt;/a&gt; that flipped and resold expensive CryptoPunks images earlier this year. Early arrivals could mint left-facing apes for free starting December 28th, while others paid a fee of .042 ETH (currently around $157).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYbn62"&gt;PHAYC launched shortly after with a tongue-in-cheek website describing the project as “a limited NFT collection where the token itself offers no membership and no allegiance,” an inversion of the promise made by BAYC creator Yuga Labs. One PHAYC community member &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/30/nft-project-bored-ape-yacht-club-spawns-left-facing-copycats/"&gt;described the project to &lt;em&gt;CoinDesk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;as “a satirical take on the current state of NFTs and members of the NFT community who might be taking the NFT market a little too seriously.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Zl8yG"&gt;Somewhat ironically, PAYC and PHAYC have since fought on Twitter over which one is the &lt;em&gt;authentic &lt;/em&gt;Bored Ape Yacht Club ripoff, with PAYC’s founder &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ape_musa_i/status/1476472038491508736"&gt;referring to PHAYC&lt;/a&gt; as a “cash grab fraud project.” PHAYC charged people to mint its apes, and &lt;em&gt;CoinDesk&lt;/em&gt; reports that it took in around 500 ETH (or around $1.8 million) in sales. By contrast, it says PAYC earned around 60 ETH (or roughly $225,000) from its paid sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="odlAfx"&gt;Both projects may be in legally dicey territory. It’s common for NFT lineups to copy each other’s art styles or use similar names. But Yuga Labs owns the copyright on its ape images, and PAYC and PHAYC were booted from OpenSea apparently for violating its rules against copyright infringement. (PAYC was also removed from competing markets Rarible and Mintable, although PHAYC is still listed on Rarible.) If Yuga Labs files a formal legal complaint, PAYC and PHAYC could potentially defend their apes as transformative fair use, following the footsteps of people like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/18/17979422/richard-prince-instagram-lawsuit-fair-use-defense-guide"&gt;appropriation artist Richard Prince&lt;/a&gt;. But there’s very little legal precedent surrounding NFTs at all, let alone their copyright implications specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K7t2m8"&gt;Yuga Labs didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on whether it might file such a complaint, and PHAYC didn’t respond to a Twitter message about the issue. PAYC &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/phunkyApeYC/status/1476609081209069568"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that it hasn’t received any legal threats from the BAYC team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VM3ZmA"&gt;So far, both projects appear more concerned with trying to make their apes tradeable online. NFTs are theoretically supposed to live outside any given platform, but markets like OpenSea have become huge bottlenecks by simplifying the selling process. While the sites have hosted plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/20/22334527/nft-scams-artists-opensea-rarible-marble-cards-fraud-art"&gt;NFT projects based on stolen art&lt;/a&gt;, they’ve delisted copycats like CryptoPhunks in response to complaints from companies like CryptoPunks creator Larva Labs, and they’ve banned some &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/calvinbecerra/status/1454892316200562692"&gt;individual NFTs&lt;/a&gt; that were stolen from their owners. Both &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/phunkyApeYC/status/1476412719704068097"&gt;PAYC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/phaycbot/status/1476310090735099905"&gt;PHAYC&lt;/a&gt; have tweeted that they’re working on alternative marketplaces that can sell the leftward-facing apes — although, by the time you read this, someone else might have started selling an even &lt;em&gt;faker &lt;/em&gt;fake ape.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>BMW, IBM, Panasonic, and Mercedes to skip planned in-person events at CES 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Attendees walk through the Las Vegas Convention Center January 10, 2020 on the final day of the 2020 Consumer Electronics Show (CES)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eMGvZxqSubxFb3b2WJ-BhDTYvAk=/5x0:4996x3327/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70330060/1192992530.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Nb0HqF"&gt;BMW has announced it will no longer be showing up in person for media events at CES 2022 — the giant electronics show that’s typically held each January in Las Vegas, attracting well over 100,000 attendees per year from around the world. It’s the latest company to at least partially bail on the show, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22849223/ces-2022-t-mobile-bailed-keynote-meta-pinterest-twitter-iheart"&gt;following announcements from Intel, AMD, GM, Google, T-Mobile, Amazon, Meta,&lt;/a&gt; Waymo, and a large number of tech publications, including &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;as COVID cases rise in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="EggSjj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Reports indicated BMW will show a car with color-changing paint and a “Theater Screen” for in-car cinematic experiences&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PPzBBN"&gt;A statement from BMW says, “Out of an abundance of caution, BMW will move all planned media activities at CES to a fully online program from Germany on January 5.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qBJICy"&gt;CTA, which produces the event, says in a statement today that “CES is excited to return ‘home’ to Las Vegas for a physical event in just a few days. Construction of exhibitors’ show floor space is well underway and over 2200 companies will be participating in person. For those attendees who are unable to join us in Las Vegas, they can participate digitally. Important details on &lt;a href="https://www.ces.tech/Logistics/Health-Protocols.aspx"&gt;updated health protocols&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ces.tech/Logistics/CES-2022-Know-Before-You-Go.aspx"&gt;show entry process&lt;/a&gt; can be found at &lt;a href="https://www.ces.tech/"&gt;CES.tech&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vfckIt"&gt;While BMW’s media events are a late scratch compared to some other announcements, it’s not the only featured exhibitor recently announcing a change of plans, as IBM said it will forgo in-person appearances. In a statement, an IBM spokesperson says, “Due to the evolving COVID conditions - and out of an abundance of caution - IBM has recently decided not to participate on-site in Las Vegas this year. We do still look forward to participating virtually.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="esTeSB"&gt;On Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/ces-2022-amid-covid-surge-mercedes-amd-and-oneplus-drop-out-joining-microsoft-google-intel/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported that fellow German automaker Mercedes-Benz is going to skip the in-person event as well, while &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/article/ces-2022-covid-dropouts"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mashable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said Panasonic, which usually has a massive central hall booth, is shifting to a virtual press conference showing with “limited on-site staffing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N96vro"&gt;In a statement, Panasonic North America CEO Megan Myungwon Lee says, “The health and safety of our employees, partners and customers remains our top priority. With this commitment in mind, we have updated our hybrid CES activation plans maintaining a modified physical footprint, with limited on-site staff, following CTA’s health safety protocols as well as our own proactive measures to ensure the health and well-being of attendees. We have shifted our press conference to a fully-virtual platform and will continue with our plan to deliver a seamless, virtual experience highlighting our newest technology products, solutions and innovations across Sustainable Energy, Smart Mobility, Immersive Experiences, Food Tech Solutions, Lifestyle Technologies and Healthy Environments.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="u0NUAb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"CES 2022 in-person exhibitor list continues to shrink as AMD and MSI drop out ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22849223/ces-2022-t-mobile-bailed-keynote-meta-pinterest-twitter-iheart"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wfe0FL"&gt;Some companies had already reduced their presence at the show over safety concerns. Over the last few years, BMW has had a significant showing at CES in recent years, demonstrating cars around the outside of the Las Vegas Convention Center while also showcasing innovative demos inside, like at the last pre-pandemic show in 2020 where attendees could customize their own concept car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZjwSg"&gt;This year at CES, &lt;a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/43494/bmw-will-show-car-paint-that-changes-color-with-the-touch-of-a-button-at-ces"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Drive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports BMW said it would have a car with color-changing paint, while &lt;a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2021/12/15/bmw-theater-screen-ces-2022/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMW Blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said we should also expect to see a new Theater Screen that “really gives an immersive, cinematic experience in the vehicle” that could launch in high-end models like the 7 Series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZuXmmH"&gt;Mercedes will continue with &lt;a href="https://media.mbusa.com/releases/release-bb71195b68ec7523e1b4dfa8cc0e738b-digital-world-premiere-of-the-vision-eqxx-the-most-efficient-mercedes-benz-ever"&gt;an all-digital premiere of its new Vision EQXX&lt;/a&gt;, which it says is “the most efficient vehicle the brand has ever built.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="20hoUH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Mercedes-Benz says it will go all-electric in 2030, but with a major caveat ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588587/mercedes-benz-electric-ev-2030-caveat"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="nE3F6H"&gt;As of Thursday, LG, Sony, and Samsung told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; they were still planning to attend in person. CTA president and CEO Gary Shapiro &lt;a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/commentary-ces-will-and-must-go-on-in-las-vegas-2502202/"&gt;published a Christmas Day op-ed in the&lt;em&gt; Las Vegas Review-Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that says, among other things, “CES 2022 will kick off 2022 in messy fashion, but it will be chock full of innovation and full of entrepreneurs and businesses. We will all be taking risks. But without risk there is no innovation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IBIgSb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 30th, 10:26AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Noted that BMW and Panasonic will maintain a presence on the show floor, and added statement from Panasonic North America CEO.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nvvAVt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 30th, 2:15PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added statement from the CTA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google pulls back the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro December update to fix dropped calls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xik8yFqTkuaY5qhOedcK19CeChI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70331126/akrales_211020_4802_0082.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WUeh6c"&gt;The rollout of the first major update for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;Google’s Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; has been slow and plagued by reports of problems. Now the company says it paused releasing the December 2021 update to investigate reports of calls dropping and disconnecting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="voe159"&gt;The news arrived &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/143183382/december-2021-update-paused?hl=en"&gt;in a post on the Google Support forums&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://www.droid-life.com/2021/12/30/google-confirms-pixel-6-december-update-pause/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Droid-Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) that says a new version with all the previously announced features and a fix for the disconnection issue should be ready by late January. If you’re not having any problems, then you can keep using the new software for now, but for those afflicted by the connection issues, Google only suggests reverting and factory resetting your device as an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="poCwHS"&gt;Hey Pixel Community,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGpYCX"&gt;The Pixel team paused the December software update to Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro devices after some users reported calls were dropping or disconnecting. We have now identified a fix that will roll out in a software update by late January. This update will also include all the fixes and improvements that were originally planned in December. If you received the December software update on Pixel 6 or Pixel 6 Pro and are still experiencing mobile connectivity issues, you can revert to the previous software version using the Android Flash Tool (&lt;a href="https://flash.android.com/welcome"&gt;flash.android.com&lt;/a&gt;) and performing a factory reset. Please back up your phone before restoring to the previous software version. If you are not experiencing mobile connectivity issues, no action is required. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and appreciate your patience as we roll out the fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="krEjx5"&gt;Your Pixel Community Manager,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S9HGZG"&gt;Camille&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="EntWbn"&gt;The December update &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22832212/google-pixel-6-pro-december-update-bug-fixes-fingerprint-sensor"&gt;was packing a long list of eagerly anticipated fixes already&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22788072/google-pixel-6-stand-wireless-charging-fast-23w-qi"&gt;fast 23W wireless charging with the Pixel Stand 2&lt;/a&gt;. It also included new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820593/google-pixel-december-feature-drop-quick-tap-to-snap-shortcut-ultra-wideband-nearby-share"&gt;features like&lt;/a&gt; the “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22734993/pixel-6-snapchat-feature-tap-camera"&gt;Quick Tap to Snap&lt;/a&gt;” Snapchat integration Google touted during the phone’s launch, plus digital car key support and file sharing for the ultra-wideband chip in the Pixel 6 Pro. Now most owners of Google’s latest flagship phones will have to wait a little longer (or risk updating manually with the flawed patch that’s available) before experiencing all the new stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Wondercise Studio wants to replace Zoom for connected fitness classes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A woman doing a Wondercise pilates workout" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dE6pu8aBAzYbDcPF9lbi-NklGUo=/0x141:3508x2480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70331116/210908_CES_Studio_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wondercise Studio is a mish-mash of a social media network and Apple Fitness Plus.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Wondercise&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FHtKcJ"&gt;At CES 2022, Wondercise is looking to shake up connected fitness with a series of intriguing launches, including a new stationary bike, TV app, and trackers. However, the Taiwanese company’s most intriguing launch is Wondercise Studio — a social media platform for fitness that lets anyone livestream their own class, complete with real-time metrics and performance feedback from fitness trackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KjpifC"&gt;Wondercise describes Studio as a “social media platform with a fitness focus,” but the reality is it’s more of a mish-mash of every bit of fitness tech currently out there. Users can voice and video chat with each other during livestreamed classes. Anyone can host their own class, and users also “follow” other users or instructors as you would on social media. If you have an Apple Watch, Garmin, or Wondercise’s own wearables, you can also see your metrics on-screen — along with the metrics of everyone else in the class. (And yes, your instructor can see them, too.) Classes can also be viewed either on a smartphone or cast to smart TVs with Google Chromecast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wa8hmg"&gt;“We have transformed from only on-demand classes to a social platform, and now we’re becoming a platform for the instructor and the user,” Wondercise CEO Eric Chuang told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Chuang went on to say that the next step after launching Studio will be an online booking system. The idea is for instructors to be able to put their classes on Wondercise, which can then be directly searched for and booked by users. He also noted that Wondercise was exploring multiple payment options to allow users to either subscribe to the entire service or pay for individual classes a la carte. Currently, the Wondercise app can be downloaded for free, though users can upgrade to an ad-free version for $9.99 per month.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screencap of Wondercise Studio" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/licsvESjxkD3srJy74yOKxU3NS8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23134595/CES_Studio__for_press_release_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wondercise&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uuQ3Y4"&gt;Wondercise also highlighted its proprietary Live Motion Matching tech, which was introduced last year at CES 2021. It uses motion data recorded from wearables to evaluate your technique and form during a workout. According to Chuang, instructors wear four wearables — two on the arms and two on the legs — while recording classes. Those movements are then fed into an algorithm. When users follow along while wearing an Apple Watch, Garmin, or the Wondercise trackers, their movements are then compared to the instructor’s and graded on a 1-100 scale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QlDGpg"&gt;The company is also launching the Wondercise Cycle Studio. The Cycle Studio is a system made up of the company’s new Flex Cycle — a 4-in-1 exercise bike with four training modes and two seat configurations — and the Wondercise Timeless Band, a screenless fitness tracker to measure heart rate. Classes are provided via Wondercise Studio and tracked metrics include heart rate, elapsed time, distance, RPM, watts, and calories burned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sIEk7D"&gt;Wondercise’s final CES launch is the Wondercise Trilogy — a combination of a TV app, the Timeless Band, and the Wondercise tracker. Users can compete in up to four-player video game-like battle modes while getting feedback on their technique. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A render of the Wondercise Flex Cycle" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/22F5Sql3PK0t9Y_QGaX9H1l2VN4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23134598/210903_CES_Wondercise_Cycle_Studio_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wondercise&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wondercise’s Flex Cycle is part of its Cycle Studio system.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="G3R9bC"&gt;Nothing that Wondercise is bringing to the table is inherently new. Fitness startup Tempo has multiple gadgets that grade your form. Apple Fitness Plus and a handful of other apps display wearable data live on-screen. Peloton pioneered live and on-demand classes with leaderboards (as well as linking expensive hardware to expensive memberships). ClassPass has been hooking up users with studio classes for ages. During the pandemic, fitness instructors and influencers &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/tmrw/how-virtual-fitness-classes-are-providing-much-needed-community-right-t210531"&gt;flocked to Zoom, TikTok, and Instagram&lt;/a&gt; to directly connect with customers. The novel thing here is how it’s all mushed together into a single platform. Right now, connected fitness has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22778851/peloton-growing-pains-connected-fitness-tonal-hydrow-mirror"&gt;a major ecosystem problem&lt;/a&gt;. If you wanted to get all these features, you’d have to shop around for multiple gadgets — most of which are expensive — and possibly pay multiple subscriptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cUaH8j"&gt;Wondercise’s success depends on whether it can convince people to take a gamble on a relatively untested fitness brand. Wondercise didn’t immediately respond to questions about pricing, but so far its products have been relatively affordable. Its original tracker retailed for $79, and Chuang also told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Wondercise’s products are purposefully open-source and aim to be less expensive than the competition. Hey, at least it’s a little more interesting than some other Peloton clones. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EMp8N7"&gt;Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and the holidays may have come and gone, but there are still some great discounts available on Apple’s AirPods. In fact, we’ve actually been seeing some deals that are even better than they were during the recent shopping holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SziSp1"&gt;Since Apple launched the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22671344/apple-new-airpods-3-spacial-audio-specs-price-release-date-features"&gt;third-gen AirPods&lt;/a&gt; in October and unveiled its new AirPods lineup, we’ve seen the starting price of the second-gen, entry-level model drop from $159 to $129. Even better, we’ve seen many retailers starting to heavily discount the second-gen AirPods as well as the more expensive AirPods Pro and Max, which offer noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard model. We’ve even recently seen some significant discounts on the third-gen AirPods, despite how recently they launched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the best deals available on each model, including the entry-level AirPods, the AirPods Pro, the third-gen AirPods, and the AirPods Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Si36Ca"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"},{"title":"Which AirPods should you buy?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22733797/airpods-2-3-pro-max-which-to-buy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="VFDHZw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10742787"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ej2msf"&gt;The best entry-level &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt; (second-gen) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eg29V6"&gt;Once $159, Apple recently lowered the list price of the second-gen AirPods — now the entry-level model — to $129. It only sells the model with a wired charging case, however, which charges via a standard Lightning cable. Despite their age, we found these easy-to-use earbuds offer great wireless performance and reliable battery life, making them a great pick if you can live without a wireless charging case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OtXs0h"&gt;Although we’ve recently seen Apple’s most affordable pair of AirPods drop to $90 — their lowest price to date — the second-gen earbuds are currently only on sale at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/619717/9383?subId1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals123021&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-2nd-Generation%2F604342441&amp;amp;_be_shelf_id=66025&amp;amp;search_sort=100&amp;amp;facet=shelf_id%3A66025&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1155135/2092?subId1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals123021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-2nd-generation%2F-%2FA-84852693"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeStaples123021/https://www.staples.com/apple-airpods-mv7n2am-a-in-the-ear-bluetooth-earbuds-white/product_24395231" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Staples&lt;/a&gt; for around $119, which is $10 less than their typical asking price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"&gt;AirPods (third-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="d2yjBK"&gt;The newest pair of wireless earbuds support Apple’s MagSafe technology. The short stems yield a more subtle design, while improved sound and features like sweat and water resistance, support for spatial audio with dynamic head tracking, and improved battery life render them a nice improvement over the last-gen model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QiPrKN"&gt;Deals were once hard to come by on the third-gen model, but we finally started seeing some significant deals starting around Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Sadly, like the second-gen AirPods, they’re currently only available for slightly less than MSRP. At the moment, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MME73AM-A-AirPods-3rd-Generation/dp/B09JQL3NWT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAirPods-3rd-generation%2F510546422&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeBestAirPodsdeals1222021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgjCdFggZzV" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; are selling the third-gen earbuds for $169, just $10 off the full retail price and a far cry from their all-time low of $139.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q2OXRZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10744075"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Iewbkw"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="S8o5q4"&gt;We think Apple’s premium true wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, are the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; an iPhone owner can buy, regardless of the price. They have better sound quality than the models above, offer active noise cancellation, and come with a wireless charging case. The earbuds also support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s spatial audio&lt;/a&gt; feature, which adds an immersive surround sound effect to select content, and come with swappable silicone tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bM8uVd"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733183/apple-magsafe-charging-case-airpods-pro-qi" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recently launched a new version&lt;/a&gt; of the AirPods Pro with a wireless charging case that supports Apple’s MagSafe technology, just like the third-gen AirPods. These retail for $249, but you can buy them right now for $197 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQMJHXY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/612734/9383?subId1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals123021&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro-with-MagSafe-Charging-Case%2F975690481&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $199.99 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-pro-with-magsafe%2F-%2FA-77603773&amp;amp;subid1=Verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. That’s not nearly as low as the $159 price we saw this model drop to during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but it’s still more than $50 off what you’d pay if you were to purchase the earbuds directly from Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="THtgJp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="x5NHYH"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ESUeUd"&gt;The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ear style that has become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, comprised of aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and a wide, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response. They’re not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for most people — blame the $550 sticker price — but it’s hard to find a pair of Bluetooth headphones that sound better and feature more intuitive controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KBAAwB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="irGZgJ"&gt;Although the AirPods Max were discounted to $429 at Amazon during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, prices have since increased. Still, the Max are currently selling for $479 in most colorways at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZHYWJS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1610235-REG%2Fapple_mgyn3am_a_airpods_max_green.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21302051%2Fbest-apple-airpods-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, saving you $70. You can also &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/search/search_results.aspx?Ntt=airpods+max" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reserve them at Micro Center for $429.99&lt;/a&gt;, one of their best prices to date, though they’re only available or in-store pickup in select states.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NYC orders nearly 200 Mustang Mach-Es for police and first responders</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ojOKDk"&gt;On Wednesday, New York City announced it has &lt;a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/dcas/news/21-020/nyc-taking-another-step-towards-achieving-all-electric-municipal-fleet"&gt;ordered 184 fully electric Ford Mustang Mach-Es&lt;/a&gt; for use by law enforcement and emergency response workers. The vehicles are set to be delivered by June 2022, as part of an $11.5 million contract that will remain in place for five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uudz0v"&gt;The city said the Mach-Es would be used by the New York Police Department, New York City’s Sheriff’s Office, the Department of Correction, the Department of Parks and Recreation, the Department of Environmental Protection, and other emergency management and response departments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0m7YJ"&gt;New York City plans to buy over 1,250 electric vehicles in 2022, transitioning all law enforcement vehicles to electric ones by 2035.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cM5DuJ"&gt;“Law enforcement vehicles are the largest and most visible part of our City’s fleet,” Keith Kerman, NYC chief fleet officer, said in a Wednesday statement. “This order of all-electric Mach-Es will enable our law enforcement agencies to put electric models to the full test and work out maintenance, lights and sirens, charging, and other operational issues. It is a critical step towards our goal of a fully electric fleet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FM07e8"&gt;This year was set to be a huge year for EVs, but many automakers have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22846960/electric-vehicles-car-companies-promises-ship-dates"&gt;struggled to scale production&lt;/a&gt;. The Mach-E had its own shaky rollout in March, and Ford was forced to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22311594/ford-mustang-mach-e-delays-quality-free-charging-cash-back"&gt;delay deliveries to some 4,500 customers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cSTU90"&gt;New York’s order is part of a broader push to integrate electric vehicles into government fleets. In January, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22249237/biden-electric-vehicle-government-fleet-ev"&gt;Biden said that his administration&lt;/a&gt; would work to phase out the government’s use of gas-powered vehicles in its fleet of more than 600,00 vehicles. Earlier this year, President Biden signed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22783684/biden-infrastructure-bill-bipartisan-broadband-ev-electrical-grid-climate"&gt;a historic $1 trillion infrastructure bill&lt;/a&gt; that invested billions into building a network of electric vehicle chargers across the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Udluij"&gt;“Every single City vehicle we electrify is one step forward to advance clean air and a climate-friendly New York City,” said Ben Furnas, head of the mayor’s office on climate.&lt;/p&gt;
