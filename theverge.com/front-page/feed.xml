    <title>Surprise! Facebook’s climate denial problem got worse this year </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z3ZvcR"&gt;As world leaders scramble to forge global agreements &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/30/22753391/glasgow-climate-change-summit-cop-26-covid-restrictions"&gt;in Glasgow&lt;/a&gt; this month in a last-ditch effort to avert the worst of the climate crisis, there’s a threat to meaningful climate action lurking on social media. Climate denial on Facebook has gotten even worse this year, according to a new &lt;a href="https://stopfundingheat.info/facebook-in-denial/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; led by climate advocacy group Stop Funding Heat and the Real Facebook Oversight Board, a watchdog group made up of academics, journalists, and activists. It’s evidence that Facebook’s efforts to stomp out lies about climate change are failing, the study’s authors say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AJd5V2"&gt;Reactions, comments, and shares per post from Facebook pages and groups dedicated to spreading climate misinformation jumped a whopping 77 percent since January, the report found. Each day, it found, climate misinformation on the platform gets between 818,000 and 1.36 million views. Less than 4 percent of the posts it analyzed had been fact-checked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5xRVYJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Facebook is the Big Tobacco of our generation”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3Ykr2F"&gt;“Facebook is the Big Tobacco of our generation, greenwashing to avoid responsibility and sewing [sic] confusion and doubt about climate change in the global conversation,” Real Facebook Oversight Board wrote in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GNcd3p"&gt;The authors analyzed a dataset of 195 pages and groups and 48,700 posts written in English between January and August. That included 41 accounts focused entirely on climate misinformation, like a page called ‘Friends of Science’ that today posted a photo of a cake with icing that says “COP26 Much Ado About Nothing”— a reference to COP26 the high-profile United Nations climate summit taking place in Glasgow. Other pages and groups also have a history of posting false information about climate change. Fox News, Breitbart, and Sean Hannity were the three most prolific spreaders of climate misinformation identified in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kv5ERZ"&gt;The study also scrutinized advertising on the platform and found 113 instances of Facebook making money from ads pushing climate misinformation. More than three-quarters of the spending came from just seven pages, all of which had previously been flagged in an &lt;a href="https://influencemap.org/report/Climate-Change-and-Digital-Advertising-86222daed29c6f49ab2da76b0df15f76#"&gt;October 2020 investigation&lt;/a&gt; of disinformation ads on Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rxo1At"&gt;“Facebook has been told over and over, through public reports and in private meetings, that its platform is a breeding ground for climate misinformation. Either they don’t care or they don’t know how to fix it,” Sean Buchan, chief researcher for Stop Funding Heat, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kam0a6"&gt;Facing pressure from activists, Facebook launched a “Climate Science Center” last year that shares information, videos, and quizzes about climate change and is now available in more than 100 countries. But environmental activists &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22677376/facebook-climate-change-misinformation-fossil-fuel-advertising"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; it’s a paltry effort that doesn’t stop the spread of climate lies in the first place. Facebook says that its Science Center gets more than 100,000 visits daily, far less than the number of views garnered by misleading climate posts analyzed in the new report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="FsPciO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Either they don’t care or they don’t know how to fix it.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZhovRL"&gt;The company, which recently rebranded itself as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22745234/facebook-new-name-meta-metaverse-zuckerberg-rebrand"&gt;Meta&lt;/a&gt;, has faced even more heat recently with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22740969/facebook-files-papers-frances-haugen-whistleblower-civic-integrity"&gt;massive document leak&lt;/a&gt; that revealed failures to stop harmful content related to everything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/30/22754046/facebook-tighter-restrictions-vaccine-misinformation-children"&gt;vaccines&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739"&gt;body image&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UpNLjf"&gt;The study adds to a steady stream of damning findings on Facebook’s handling of misleading climate information. Earlier this week, a separate &lt;a href="https://www.counterhate.com/toxicten"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; traced 69 percent of all interactions with content denying climate change back to just 10 publishers. In September, an &lt;a href="http://foe.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Texas_Disinfo_Report_final_v4.pdf"&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt; into misinformation around this year’s &lt;a href="https://windommedia.com/blog/2021/05/27/go-read-this-investigation-into-the-real-death-toll-from-the-texas-freeze-justine-calma/"&gt;deadly cold snap&lt;/a&gt; in Texas found that less than 1 percent of interactions with the “highest-performing” content that falsely blamed wind turbines for blackouts were with posts that carried Facebook’s fact-checking labels. And in 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.eenews.net/stories/1063436369"&gt;&lt;em&gt;E&amp;amp;E News&lt;/em&gt; published&lt;/a&gt; an investigation into a de facto loophole for opinion content in Facebook’s fact-checking practices that triggered an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368136/facebook-climate-change-fact-check-senators-warren"&gt;inquiry from Democratic senators&lt;/a&gt;. The company works with independent fact-checkers to review and rate how accurate content is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UV8Alz"&gt;A Facebook spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email that the new report uses “flawed methodology” to inflate the number of posts and ads containing climate misinformation. “It’s really just posts these groups disagree with politically,” the spokesperson added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WPYwlg"&gt;But while the report authors acknowledge that their definition of climate misinformation included content which has no overt factual inaccuracies but is misleadingly packaged, the report also flagged many outright lies. For example, the study found a quote from botanist and climate denier &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/12/david-bellamy-obituary"&gt;David Bellamy&lt;/a&gt; that says, “Global warming is part of a natural cycle and there’s nothing we can actually do to stop these cycles.” The quote from 2008, “does not reflect scientific consensus” that &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/"&gt;humans are to blame&lt;/a&gt; for climate change, according to &lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/nov/03/viral-image/2008-quote-does-not-reflect-scientific-consensus-h/"&gt;Politifact&lt;/a&gt;, one of the independent fact-checking groups with which Facebook partners. While some Facebook posts sharing the quote have been taken down or labeled as “&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/198600623557681/posts/4541752425909124"&gt;false information&lt;/a&gt;,” the viral quote can still be found in other posts without the fact-checking label. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yK5vTY"&gt;“Clearly Facebook’s Third-Party Fact-Checking Program, and its Climate Science Center, has failed,” Buchan said in a press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bbp8AX"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ji4qUe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HSUhRk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Flex drivers will start getting checks for $60 million in withheld tips</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ybo6r9uYe_amZGBtZv4UJA1MZy8=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70094541/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0001.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EeD01z"&gt;The Federal Trade Commission will send out more than $60 million to drivers for Amazon’s Flex program, representing tip money that the commission says was illegally withheld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z2rVe4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/11/ftc-returns-nearly-60-million-drivers-whose-tips-were-illegally"&gt;According to the official announcement&lt;/a&gt;, the FTC is preparing 139,501 checks and 1,621 PayPal payments to drivers who had more than $5 in withheld tips. The highest back payout going to a single driver is more than $28,000, while the average repayment is $422. Nearly 20,000 drivers will receive checks for more than $600, the FTC said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vSmweo"&gt;Drivers are expected to receive their tips before January 7th, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2cn6OU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The highest back payout going to a single driver is more than $28,000”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WHn8N1"&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262294/amazon-flex-wage-theft-allegations-ftc-fine-drivers-gig-tips"&gt;the FTC sued Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for withholding tips in its Flex program between the years 2016 and 2019. Amazon continued to collect portions of the drivers’ tips up until the government filed its lawsuit outlining the alleged illegal behavior in 2019, according to the FTC’s investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ABkrRY"&gt;“Rather than passing along 100 percent of customers’ tips to drivers, as it had promised to do, Amazon used the money itself,” said Daniel Kaufman, acting director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, in February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kqIVrq"&gt;In February, &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/02/amazon-pay-617-million-settle-ftc-charges-it-withheld-somehttps://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/02/amazon-pay-617-million-settle-ftc-charges-it-withheld-some"&gt;Amazon agreed to settle the case&lt;/a&gt; and surrender all of the tip money, totaling more than $60 million, to the FTC. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="raka46"&gt;Amazon Flex contracts with individual drivers to deliver packages in their own vehicles, primarily delivering Prime Now and Amazon Fresh goods. In its February lawsuit, the FTC said that customers and drivers were told by Amazon that the drivers would receive 100 percent of any tips paid. This practice ended in 2016 after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262294/amazon-flex-wage-theft-allegations-ftc-fine-drivers-gig-tips"&gt;Amazon allegedly lowered the minimum hourly pay&lt;/a&gt; for drivers and made up the difference with their tip money. The FTC said drivers were not notified of this change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQgolv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c0s8mE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twelve South’s new Apple Watch sweatband doesn’t work with every watch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MTIdoD-N7yRTXXZsd_ECb5hiYwQ=/40x0:1510x980/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70094331/Header_Image_Alt_1920x.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twelve South’s new ActionBand for Apple Watch.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Twelve South&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CZRMxW"&gt;One of the defining features of the Apple Watch is the vast number of bands you can buy to make it fit your needs and style. That can be particularly useful for workouts. You might not want to wear a leather band during a long run, but you can easily swap in bands made of other materials that can better withstand sweat. If you’ve been looking for a full-on wrist sweatband to use alongside your Apple Watch, though, accessories maker Twelve South now has you covered with &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.twelvesouth.com%2Fproducts%2Factionband-for-apple-watch%3Futm_source%3DKlaviyo%26utm_medium%3Dcampaign-email%26utm_campaign%3DActionBand%2520Apple%2520Watch%2520Launch%2520%25282021-11-04%2529%26utm_content%3DProduct%2520Launch%26_kx%3DWNYk2ScXZZeZl25hceRvBiPt-VjkAjdGEPkerJ_q6N-dP4mjJhn-rRC0jGSKN8OD.MWj2bN&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F4%2F22763533%2Fapple-watch-twelve-south-actionband-wrist-sweatband" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.twelvesouth.com%2Fproducts%2Factionband-for-apple-watch&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F4%2F22763533%2Fapple-watch-twelve-south-actionband-wrist-sweatband" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ActionBand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.twelvesouth.com%2Fproducts%2Factionband-for-apple-watch%3Futm_source%3DKlaviyo%26utm_medium%3Dcampaign-email%26utm_campaign%3DActionBand%2520Apple%2520Watch%2520Launch%2520%25282021-11-04%2529%26utm_content%3DProduct%2520Launch%26_kx%3DWNYk2ScXZZeZl25hceRvBiPt-VjkAjdGEPkerJ_q6N-dP4mjJhn-rRC0jGSKN8OD.MWj2bN&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F4%2F22763533%2Fapple-watch-twelve-south-actionband-wrist-sweatband" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; for Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5PglZr"&gt;The ActionBand is a terry cotton band that sits tight on your wrist and has a frame for you to slot in the watch part of your Apple Watch. The frame is designed in such a way to let you access the Digital Crown and the watch’s side button, so you won’t have to rely entirely on the touchscreen if you need to navigate around your watch while working out. To clean a pair of the sweatbands (when you buy the ActionBand, you get one with an Apple Watch cradle and one without), Twelve South says you can just toss them in the washing machine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="F0E9BK"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IQAEPFe7-FU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zGnFJA"&gt;While the ActionBand does seem well-designed and comfortable, if you’re not already someone who uses sweatbands, I don’t know if it’s worth picking up. In my experience, Apple’s standard Sport Band is already quite comfortable for long workouts, so switching to a sweatband wouldn’t have a benefit for me there. I’d argue that the Sport Band is easier to clean than the ActionBand; just run it under some water. And if I used the ActionBand while doing yoga, I’d worry that the sweatbands could make poses where I have to grab my wrist more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lN3EIu"&gt;The ActionBand also has a big catch: unlike Apple’s own watch bands, the ActionBand isn’t compatible with every Apple Watch. Right now, only the Apple Watch Series 4, 5, 6, and SE can be slotted into the ActionBand, though Twelve South says Apple Watch Series 7 compatibility is “coming soon.” Unfortunately, the Apple Watch Series 3 isn’t compatible with the ActionBand at all, which presumably means older models with a largely similar design aren’t, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Nig36"&gt;If you are interested in the ActionBand, though, you can pick one up now for $30 from &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.twelvesouth.com%2Fproducts%2Factionband-for-apple-watch&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F4%2F22763533%2Fapple-watch-twelve-south-actionband-wrist-sweatband" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Twelve South’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft warns Windows 11 features are failing due to its expired certificate</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A user types on the Surface Pro 8 from behind. The screen displays the Windows 11 start menu on a white and blue background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CLkkl78LmA1JaVWadijxDFb2jDA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70094217/bfarsace_211004_4777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pZHyn0"&gt;Microsoft has started warning Windows 11 users that certain features in the operating system are failing to load due to an expired certificate. The certificate expired on October 31st, and Microsoft warns that some Windows 11 users aren’t able to open apps like the Snipping Tool, touch keyboard, or emoji panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imJv8p"&gt;A patch is available to fix some of the issues, but it’s currently in preview, meaning you have to install it manually from Windows Update. The patch, &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/october-21-2021-kb5006746-os-build-22000-282-preview-03190705-0960-4ba4-9ee8-af40bef057d3"&gt;KB4006746&lt;/a&gt;, will fix the touch keyboard, voice typing, emoji panel, and issues with the getting started and tips sections of Windows 11. You’ll be able to find this patch by checking for updates in the Windows Update section of Settings in Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="z84dE2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft still needs to fix the Snipping Tool&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u40ii1"&gt;Microsoft’s patch doesn’t address the problems with the Snipping Tool app, though. “To mitigate the issue with Snipping Tool, use the Print Screen key on your keyboard and paste the screenshot into your document,” &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-21h2#2739msgdesc"&gt;recommends Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;. “You can also paste it into Paint to select and copy the section you want.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OFWsMW"&gt;It’s not clear how many Windows 11 users are affected by these issues, and we haven’t been able to replicate the Snipping Tool problems on multiple patched systems. If you are having issues, some &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; readers have reported being able to change the system date back to October 30th, and then launching Snipping Tool to get it working again. You can then change the system date back once the app has loaded ok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJrSqy"&gt;The expired certificate is also causing issues with the accounts page in the settings section of Windows 11 with S mode enabled and the input method editor UI. It’s not clear when the Snipping Tool and S mode issues will be addressed. “We are working on a resolution for Snipping tool and the S mode only issues and will provide an update when more information is available,” says Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="siGlD0"&gt;Microsoft’s latest Windows 11 issues come just two weeks after the company had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22732336/microsoft-windows-11-amd-cpu-performance-issues-fix-release"&gt;issue a patch to fix AMD CPU performance in the OS&lt;/a&gt;. A bug was slowing performance on Ryzen processors by up to 15 percent in certain games.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alphabet is launching a company that uses AI for drug discovery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3fvTWcIK-44RTqVs2-txzT6ervE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70094150/msingleton_180612_2663_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Micah Singleton / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X7ReMi"&gt;A new Alphabet company will use artificial intelligence methods for drug discovery, Google’s parent company &lt;a href="https://www.isomorphiclabs.com/blog"&gt;announced Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. It’ll build off of the work done by DeepMind, another Alphabet subsidiary that has done groundbreaking work &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22586578/deepmind-alphafold-ai-protein-folding-human-proteome-released-for-free"&gt;using AI to predict the structure of proteins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="81Rhb0"&gt;The new company, called Isomorphic Laboratories, will leverage that success to build tools that can help identify new pharmaceuticals. DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis will also serve as the CEO for Isomorphic, but the two companies will stay separate and collaborate occasionally, a spokesperson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3mS2A8"&gt;For years, experts have pointed to AI as a way to make it faster and cheaper to find new medications to treat various conditions. AI could help scan through databases of potential molecules to find some that best fit a particular biological target, for example, or to fine-tune proposed compounds. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been invested in companies building AI tools over &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d43747-021-00045-7"&gt;the past two years&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s6obUf"&gt;Isomorphic will try to build models that can predict how drugs will interact with the body, Hassabis &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/11/04/alphabet-launches-drug-discovery-company-building-on-deepmind/?utm_content=buffer1a72c&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=twitter_organic"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Stat News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It could leverage DeepMind’s work on protein structure to figure out how multiple proteins might interact with each other. The company may not develop its own drugs but instead sell its models. It will focus on developing partnerships with pharmaceutical companies, a spokesperson said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hGIvcw"&gt;Developing and testing drugs, though, could be a steeper challenge than figuring out protein structure. For example, even if two proteins have structures that fit together physically, it’s hard to tell &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41573-021-00161-0"&gt;how well they’ll actually stick&lt;/a&gt;. A drug candidate that looks promising based on how it works at a chemical level also &lt;a href="https://www.icr.ac.uk/blogs/the-drug-discoverer/page-details/reflecting-on-deepmind-s-alphafold-artificial-intelligence-success-what-s-the-real-significance-for-protein-folding-research-and-drug-discovery"&gt;might not always work&lt;/a&gt; when it’s given to an animal or a person. Over 90 percent of drugs that make it to a clinical trial end up not working, as chemist and writer Derek Lowe &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/more-protein-folding-progress---what-s-it-mean"&gt;pointed out in &lt;em&gt;Science &lt;/em&gt;this summer&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the problems aren’t because there was something wrong at the molecular level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43Kgc7"&gt;The work done at DeepMind and the proposed work at Isomorphic could help bust through some research bottlenecks but aren’t a quick fix for the the countless challenges of drug development. “The laborious, resource-draining work of doing the biochemistry and biological evaluation of, for example, drug functions” will remain, as Helen Walden, a professor of structural biology at the University of Glasgow, previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22586578/deepmind-alphafold-ai-protein-folding-human-proteome-released-for-free"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Square is letting the teens use Cash App</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ilG83eC4cQslWnp2eT1FnlsKHpI=/329x0:2321x1328/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70094118/Screen_Shot_2021_11_03_at_18.29.40.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Cash App&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0PF6tG"&gt;Square &lt;a href="https://cash.app/13+"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; that people over 13 years old can use Cash App to deposit and spend money or send it to friends. The app was previously only available to people aged 18 or older, and while minors will have to get their parent or guardians’ permission to use the app (and that parent-figure will have significant oversight), they’ll still be able to use some of the app’s most popular features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ic8Dyc"&gt;Teens won’t be able to do just &lt;em&gt;anything &lt;/em&gt;with Cash App, though — they won’t have access to the investing &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1455944391604850689"&gt;or Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; features, despite Jack Dorsey’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22617551/jack-dorsey-bitcoin-unite-country-world-peace-cryptocurrency"&gt;passion for crypto&lt;/a&gt;, and Square says they won’t be able to deposit checks. That last one really feels like a missed trick, as I remember getting a lot of checks as gifts or payments for odd jobs as a teen. However, the app will give them access to the peer-to-peer transactions that made the app famous, as well as a customizable debit card they can use at real-life locations and support for Apple and Google Pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CGHQcp"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Not yet...&lt;/p&gt;— jack⚡️ (@jack) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1455944391604850689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LafSOl"&gt;One of Square’s biggest competitors, Venmo, doesn’t allow people under 18 to use its service, though it’s &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/24/venmo-teen-debit-card/"&gt;reportedly testing a similar teen-oriented debit card&lt;/a&gt;. Cash App is far from the first to offer online banking or payment services to 13-year-olds, though: &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211324"&gt;Apple Cash has a family option&lt;/a&gt; that you can use with Apple Pay (though there’s no physical debit card option), and there are a host of online banks that offer checking accounts to teens, complete with parental supervision. Child accounts are also often &lt;a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/banking/teen-checking-accounts"&gt;offered by more traditional banks&lt;/a&gt; and credit unions as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rV9dSM"&gt;Still, Cash App’s popularity (especially on Twitter, also founded by Jack Dorsey) could help make it the choice for teens. Of course, teens aren’t the only people Square has to convince — minors still need their parent or guardian’s permission to use Cash App. After they get it, the parent or guardian will &lt;a href="https://cash.app/help/us/en-us/6486-authorized-users-under-18"&gt;technically be the legal owner of the account&lt;/a&gt; (the teen will be an authorized user), and they’ll be able to see any transactions made. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon and AT&amp;T delay crucial 5G expansion over aircraft interference concerns</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SKhuTLlvOCWA4ClbJtBF3P9odDs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70094027/acastro_180430_1777_5G_0001.0.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MR2uYu"&gt;Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T are delaying the rollout of their wider 5G networks after the Federal Aviation Administration warned that the new wireless technology could interfere with the safety systems of some aircraft, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-t-verizon-to-delay-5g-rollout-over-faas-airplane-safety-concerns-11636039555"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBNlyf"&gt;The two companies planned to light up new 5G networks that use so-called “C-band” frequencies on December 5th. That rollout will now be delayed until at least January 5th, the companies said Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jQLr73"&gt;Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T still currently offer ultra-fast 5G connectivity in specific areas using high-band millimeter-wave technology and much slower 5G over low-band frequencies. But the two companies have been banking on using the C-band — which covers midrange frequencies with good-to-great speed — to dramatically expand access to 5G across the country. The two companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;collectively spent nearly $70 billion earlier this year to gain access to a bunch of C-band spectrum&lt;/a&gt; that was up for auction. T-Mobile, the other major player in the wireless market, already has a lot of mid-band spectrum that doesn’t operate in the C-band (though it will in a few years).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="inoXgW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T need this spectrum to keep pace with T-Mobile&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k7AlJO"&gt;The aviation industry has voiced concerns over C-band interference for a while now. In an &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/faa-has-deep-concern-about-5g-network-plan-aviation-safety-letter-2021-10-29/"&gt;August meeting&lt;/a&gt; with the Federal Communications Commission, for instance, industry reps said that “major disruptions to use of the National Airspace System can be expected” with the rollout of C-band 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BDKp1g"&gt;Those concerns &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-faa-warns-potential-interference-new-5g-technology-2021-11-02/"&gt;came to a head this week&lt;/a&gt; when the FAA released a “&lt;a href="https://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgSAIB.nsf/(LookupSAIBs)/AIR-21-18?OpenDocument"&gt;special information bulletin&lt;/a&gt;” about potential interference issues with safety equipment that relies on radio altimeters. While the agency said that there have been no documented incidents of “harmful interference” in other countries to date, it nonetheless warned aircraft operators that they “should be prepared for the possibility that interference from 5G transmitters and other technology could cause certain safety equipment to malfunction, requiring them to take mitigating action that could affect flight operations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5QOcq"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T said Thursday that it is working with the FAA and FCC to better understand the aviation industry’s concerns. “It is critical that these discussions be informed by the science and the data,” the company said in a statement provided to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “That is the only path to enabling experts and engineers to assess whether any legitimate co-existence issues exist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bfFHfJ"&gt;The major wireless trade group, the CTIA, said last week that companies should be able to use C-band 5G “without causing harmful interference to aviation equipment,” &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/faa-has-deep-concern-about-5g-network-plan-aviation-safety-letter-2021-10-29/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. The group pointed to the many successful C-band deployments in other countries as evidence. “Any delay in activating this spectrum risks America’s competitiveness,” the group wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blue Origin loses lawsuit against federal government over NASA’s human lunar lander contracts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mNNEIC7plHd3BMgzxHQeUNH9dkk=/0x0:900x600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70093956/blue_origin_blue_moon_lander_reveal_web.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nMfIlO"&gt;Jeff Bezos’ spaceflight venture Blue Origin has &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.uscfc.44185/gov.uscourts.uscfc.44185.74.0.pdf"&gt;lost out on its lawsuit against NASA&lt;/a&gt; over a contract to build the space agency’s next human lunar lander. The judgement puts an end to Blue Origin’s monthslong quest to receive government funding to develop the company’s lander, called Blue Moon, for NASA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iFhxwD"&gt;Judge Richard Hertling, who oversaw the federal court case, issued a short ruling today, noting that Blue Origin’s motion for judgement had been denied. The opinion has not been issued publicly yet. All the parties involved will propose which parts they want redacted before the opinion is released openly on November 14th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KWDTTD"&gt;Blue Origin had hoped to be involved in NASA’s ambitious plan to return humans to the Moon, an initiative called the Artemis program. To achieve this goal, NASA is working with various companies in the space industry to build rockets and spacecraft that would help send the first woman and the first person of color to the lunar surface. A critical part of that plan entails building a privately made lunar lander that can safely carry people to and from the lunar dirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kQv5sE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;NASA surprised everyone by awarding just one contract to SpaceX&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vp5DRQ"&gt;Prior to giving out contracts for the lunar lander, NASA publicly hinted that it would select two companies to build these vehicles as a way to have redundancy and some competition. The agency eventually narrowed down the selection to three finalist companies, including Blue Origin, SpaceX, and a company called Dynetics. Then in April, NASA surprised everyone by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387887/elon-musk-spacex-win-nasa-lunar-lander-contract-artemis"&gt;awarding just one contract to SpaceX&lt;/a&gt;, which asked for $2.9 billion to develop the company’s monster Starship spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xcRUoB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Not the decision we wanted, but we respect the court’s judgment, and wish full success for NASA and SpaceX on the contract. &lt;a href="https://t.co/BeXc4A8YaW"&gt;pic.twitter.com/BeXc4A8YaW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/1456311095761637384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PFas6T"&gt;NASA attributed its decision to select one company instead of two to a lack of funding for its lunar lander program. NASA had requested $3.2 billion for its human lunar lander program for this year, but Congress only gave the space agency $850 million, about a quarter of what NASA had hoped for. Meanwhile, NASA has been striving to reach the lunar surface as early as 2024, an incredibly ambitious deadline that seems all but impossible with the budget shortfall. Given the lack of funding, NASA opted to stick with the company that proposed the cheapest option. Blue Origin requested $5.9 billion &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/9/18550258/blue-origin-moon-lunar-lander-jeff-bezos-space"&gt;for its Blue Moon concept&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="vbO0X1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Blue Origin has pulled out all the stops to somehow reverse the decision&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UTtnMe"&gt;Since losing out on the contract, Blue Origin has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22457893/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-nasa-spacex-senate-competition-bill-nasa-moon-lander"&gt;pulled out all the stops&lt;/a&gt; to somehow reverse the decision. Initially, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404528/nasa-bezo-blue-origin-protest-spacex-contract"&gt;the company protested through the Government Accountability Office&lt;/a&gt; (GAO), but the GAO ultimately denied Blue Origin’s request. It also rejected a similar protest from Dynetics. The GAO argued that NASA “reserved the right to make multiple awards, a single award, or no award at all,” &lt;a href="https://www.gao.gov/press-release/statement-blue-origin-dynetics-decision"&gt;according to the office’s statement on its decision&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rMV2HO"&gt;Then this summer, Bezos wrote a letter to NASA Administrator Bill Nelson, proposing to build Blue Moon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594038/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-nasa-lunar-lander-2-billion"&gt;for a discount of $2 billion&lt;/a&gt; over the next two years to bridge the “funding shortfall.” The extra money would have been provided by Bezos himself, who is currently the second wealthiest person in the world. However, NASA wasn’t swayed by the offer. As a last-ditch effort, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22623022/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-sue-nasa-lawsuit-hls-lunar-lander"&gt;Blue Origin sued in federal court&lt;/a&gt; to have the decision reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rwgTEi"&gt;NASA argued that Blue Origin “gambled” with its bid for the lunar lander program, which it ultimately lost. The company “made an assumption about the Agency’s [lunar lander] budget, built its proposal with this figure in mind, and also separately made a calculated bet that if NASA could not afford Blue Origin’s initially-proposed price, the Agency would select Blue Origin for award and engage in post-selection negotiations to allow Blue Origin to lower its price. All of these assumptions were incorrect,” NASA attorneys wrote in legal filings dated May 26th and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22689729/blue-origin-moon-lunar-lander-price-nasa-hls-foia"&gt;obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; through a Freedom of Information Act request&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tpFg2U"&gt;In response to today’s ruling, NASA noted that there will be opportunities in the future for companies to work on the Artemis program. “In addition to this contract, NASA continues working with multiple American companies to bolster competition and commercial readiness for crewed transportation to the lunar surface,” NASA said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “There will be forthcoming opportunities for companies to partner with NASA in establishing a long-term human presence at the Moon under the agency’s Artemis program, including a call in 2022 to U.S. industry for recurring crewed lunar landing services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BCHYyq"&gt;Both Blue Origin’s protest with the GAO and its lawsuit wound up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632990/spacex-lunar-lander-contract-paused-blue-origin-nasa-lawsuit"&gt;temporarily halting NASA’s contract with SpaceX&lt;/a&gt;. Now that the final decision has been made, NASA says that work will resume under SpaceX’s contract. On Twitter, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk made a joke about the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="X6irdZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/deqktTvS3U"&gt;pic.twitter.com/deqktTvS3U&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1456275627221393409?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g6mce5"&gt;In response to today’s ruling, Blue Origin said it looks forward to continuing to work with NASA on potential future contracts. “Our lawsuit with the Court of Federal Claims highlighted the important safety issues with the Human Landing System procurement process that must still be addressed,” the company wrote in an emailed statement. “Returning astronauts safely to the Moon through NASA’s public-private partnership model requires an unprejudiced procurement process alongside sound policy that incorporates redundant systems and promotes competition. Blue Origin remains deeply committed to the success of the Artemis program, and we have a broad base of activity on multiple contracts with NASA to achieve the United States’ goal to return to the Moon to stay.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YIfzcJ"&gt;Bezos also weighed in saying that the ruling was “not the decision we wanted, but we respect the court’s judgment, and wish full success for NASA and SpaceX on the contract.” The statement hinted that Blue Origin might not appeal the decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bJhpfc"&gt;It’s also possible that NASA could award future contracts to Blue Origin and Dynetics, depending on the funding the agency receives in the future. Former NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine testified before the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee that he thinks the agency should have at least two lunar lander providers. The Senate Appropriation Committee’s draft budget bill for NASA issued in October would also direct NASA to pick a second provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qggfdi"&gt;Earlier this year, Administrator Nelson had requested an extra $5.4 billion for NASA’s human lunar lander program, with the aim of getting the money through President Biden’s proposed infrastructure policy. “I think at the end of the day, after all the shouting is over, after all the pushing and tugging, a lot of which has nothing to do with NASA, you will see that NASA will have the funds that it needs,” he said, &lt;a href="https://spacenews.com/nelson-remains-confident-on-nasa-funding-for-artemis/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Space News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. However, after multiple revisions to Biden’s Build Back Better Act, &lt;a href="https://rules.house.gov/sites/democrats.rules.house.gov/files/Section_by_Section_BBB.pdf"&gt;the latest version of the bill&lt;/a&gt; would only provide an extra $1.1 billion for NASA, mostly aimed at repairing and modernizing the agency’s facilities and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lX4XAR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 4th, 1:30PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was updated to include a statement and information from NASA, as well as a statement from Jeff Bezos.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best wireless earbuds to buy right now</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Sony holds on to the top spot, and the Powerbeats Pro have been finally been toppled&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="BaOA2o"&gt;It’s hard to buy a bad pair of wireless earbuds these days. The market has come a long way since the early era of true wireless earbuds when we had to deal with mediocre sound quality and unreliable performance, all for the sake of ditching wires. Things are much different now. After several product generations of learned lessons, companies like Sony, Apple, Samsung, and others are releasing their most impressive earbuds yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H0HzJg"&gt;You can get phenomenal noise cancellation and sound quality in the premium tier of earbuds if you’re willing to spend big. But those aren’t always the most important criteria for everyone: maybe you’re looking for the perfect fitness earbuds or for a set that works just as well for Zoom calls as for playing your favorite playlists and podcasts. Tech companies are increasingly making their earbuds &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22627099/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-apple-airpods-pro-ecosystem-lock-in-features-companion-app"&gt;work best with their own products&lt;/a&gt; through exclusive features and functionality, so that’s another thing to consider as you shop around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lVXiJ0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10600158"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pqS6dl"&gt;In terms of overall excellence, the best wireless earbuds you can get are Sony’s WF-1000XM4. They’ve got an unbeatable combo of top-notch active noise cancellation, wonderfully detailed audio, and long-lasting battery life. But we’ve also got a number of other picks based on other factors that you might rank higher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="pNy3BT"&gt;The best wireless earbuds in 2021&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="zlQO6t"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lSw46_F71FYZ50eLPQxU31hsJGw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22644193/DSCF4085_Edited.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s WF-1000XM4 are the best overall wireless earbuds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tmCflo"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523584/sony-wf-1000xm4-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review"&gt;Sony WF-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mSCWfZ"&gt;Best overall wireless earbuds&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iRpJZT"&gt;Though they come at a hefty price, the best overall wireless earbuds you can buy are Sony’s WF-1000XM4. They offer superb, warm, detailed sound quality and top-tier active noise cancellation. And their impressive battery life can stretch to eight hours of continuous listening with noise cancellation turned on, enough to outlast all of Sony’s top competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SHOmBh"&gt;The WF-1000XM4s have a premium, matte black (or light gray) design with stylish rose gold accents. Most earbuds come with standard silicone ear tips, but Sony includes foam-style tips that expand in your ears to create an excellent seal that, together with the noise cancellation, do an impressive job at hushing the outside world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="de0Fag"&gt;On Android phones, the 1000XM4s support Sony’s LDAC codec for higher-quality music playback. But even when used on other platforms, they’re up there with the very best audio-focused premium earbuds like Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 2 — with much better noise cancellation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T49ehN"&gt;The only thing preventing the 1000XM4 from being the perfect set of wireless earbuds is their lack of multipoint / two simultaneous Bluetooth connections. They’re also on the larger side compared to some of the competition. But with their best-in-class mix of features (including bonuses like 360 Reality Audio support), improved voice call performance, and impressive battery endurance, you can’t do much better. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Jabra Elite 3 are the best wireless earbuds under $100.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DOsyHK"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22676362/jabra-elite-3-wireless-earbuds-review"&gt;Jabra Elite 3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="wRf3xs"&gt;Best earbuds under $100&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="xyCMjr"&gt;Sometimes all you need are the fundamentals, and that’s where Jabra’s Elite 3 earbuds manage to rise above the crowded field of sub-$100 competition. Their sound puts some emphasis on the bass but still manages to come through nicely balanced overall with very good clarity for this price range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Fs6sYM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10844228"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F63F5J"&gt;The earbuds last for up to seven hours of continuous playback, and the compact case holds three additional charges. Their large physical buttons are easy to use, and the earbuds are rated IP55 for dust and water resistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YdhZzT"&gt;The Elite 3s lack the multipoint feature that Jabra has long been known for — that’s the main sacrifice you make for the price — but in an improvement from past models, either earbud can be used standalone in mono mode. And they’re extremely comfortable to wear for long stretches. You don’t get features like active noise cancellation or wireless charging (though Jabra does include a so-so transparency mode), but the Elite 3s perform reliably with a strong Bluetooth signal. They’re a terrific value for the money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="hWu3Jv"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ds_HnWvvgrCsv6J7sKcYODjSnto=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21946559/IMG_0720-1.0.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bose’s QuietComfort Earbuds have the best noise cancellation you’ll find in any earbuds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EGS3sY"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507552/bose-quietcomfort-earbuds-review-best-noise-cancellation"&gt;Bose QuietComfort Earbuds&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="AGqjBz"&gt;Best noise-canceling earbuds&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="0TWUxd"&gt;Bose’s QuietComfort Earbuds are neck and neck with Sony when it comes to the effectiveness of their active noise cancellation — and probably a hair better. Like their main rival, the QC Earbuds have a fit and finish that exudes quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Aar5Ga"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386455"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zicZdh"&gt;With Bose’s mobile app, you can dial in the level of noise cancellation that’s perfect for the environment you’re in. Their charging case is a bit chunky, but it supports wireless charging. The QC Earbuds also handle voice calls better than most, so that’s another plus in exchange for their pricey cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="iU0gjj"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rqULYd7Vneck60NRlyx1aucD5Hc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22973267/DSCF6021_Edited_2.JPG"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beats Fit Pro are the best earbuds for running and working out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Phouot"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22753158/beats-fit-pro-earbuds-review-apple"&gt;Beats Fit Pro&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="MJaN1M"&gt;Best earbuds for working out&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="xk3ZRx"&gt;The long-reigning champ of fitness earbuds, the Powerbeats Pro, have finally been defeated. And fittingly, they’ve been outdone by Beats’ latest earbuds. The Beats Fit Pro trade the ear hooks of the Powerbeats for a new wing tip design that keeps them securely locked in your ears during even the most vigorous workouts. As a result, these earbuds have a much smaller form factor — and their carrying case is mercifully far more manageable. The way these earbuds magnetically latch into the case also means you don’t have to worry about one or both buds failing to charge in the case, which was a common annoyance with the Powerbeats Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XPJTnP"&gt;Unlike the Powerbeats Pro, the Fit Pros include active noise cancellation. And they’re on par with the AirPods Pro in that department, so you’ll be able to exercise without distraction. When you do want to stay alert to your surroundings, the transparency mode is also as natural-sounding and clear as on the AirPod Pros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8NgG5q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10844241"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sfx8aI"&gt;The earbuds are rated IPX4 for water resistance. While that’s not as robust as some other fitness-focused buds, it should be sufficient to survive sweat and outdoor runs in various conditions. The Fit Pros have easy-to-use physical button controls, and although they lack the dedicated volume rocker of the Powerbeats Pro, you’ve got the option to remap a long-press of each earbud to adjust volume instead of toggling noise cancellation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W7gkOl"&gt;If you’re an iPhone owner, the Fit Pros offer Apple-only features like dynamic head tracking for spatial audio, auto device switching, Find My integration, and more. For Android users, Beats has an app that will let you adjust settings and see the battery status of the earbuds and case, among other functions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="UrdVrj"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro remain the best earbuds for people who own several of the company’s other devices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5DaumO"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;Apple AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DkEuTL"&gt;Best earbuds for Apple fans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="lLBDNk"&gt;For those invested in Apple’s ecosystem, the AirPods Pro offer an appealing mix of powerful noise cancellation, good-enough sound quality, and an array of features that make them the ideal companion to the company’s other devices. They’re also the only AirPods that come with different sizes of ear tips for a customizable fit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kqPPhS"&gt;The AirPods Pro have a compact case that supports wireless charging. Setting them up is as simple as holding the open case near your iPhone. The earbuds are lightweight and fit snugly in most ears. Their force sensor pinch controls are easy to get down, and they rank among the very best wireless earbuds when it comes to voice call quality. Their ANC can’t match Bose or Sony but is enough to quiet your surroundings a fair amount, and the transparency mode almost makes it feel like you’re not wearing earbuds at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pqRzuC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mxfus6"&gt;Where the AirPods stand out is with their Apple-only features like head tracking for spatial audio, automatic pairing with all of your Apple iCloud devices, auto device switching, extensive Find My support, and so on. They also support audio sharing, and if you’ve got an Apple TV and need to keep things quiet in the living room or bedroom, you can use the AirPods for private listening. The AirPods Pro are pretty standard in other areas like sound quality and battery life, but their deep intertwining with Apple’s world is reason enough to give them serious consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="9rJ372"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’ve got a Samsung Galaxy smartphone, the Galaxy Buds 2 are the best earbuds to go along with it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="q3cBQl"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="5YAL6G"&gt;Best earbuds for Samsung fans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="FuVr9O"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 2 are so good that there’s little reason to shell out more money for the Galaxy Buds Pro. They’ve got a small, discreet design that won’t stick out of your ears like other buds. They sit more comfortably over long stretches of time than the company’s Pro buds. And the Buds 2 produce balanced, vibrant sound that’s quite close to the sound signature of the Pros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="q9Ybgn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10844268"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2LdugR"&gt;If there’s one downside, it’s the below-average IPX2 water resistance, which makes them less than ideal for workouts or getting caught in the rain. The Buds Pro have a more worry-free IPX7 rating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="j12RRo"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus Buds Pro are the best earbuds if you’re a loyal OnePlus customer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9LHtPH"&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22637548/oneplus-buds-pro-review-specs-price-features"&gt;OnePlus Buds Pro&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aYIRNs"&gt;Best earbuds for OnePlus fans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="pJYhX6"&gt;OnePlus has come a long way since its original OnePlus Buds. The OnePlus Buds Pro are the company’s most refined earbuds yet, with a sleek stemmed design that’s right on par in comfort with Apple’s AirPods Pro. There’s no denying that these are AirPod clones, but their noise cancellation is slightly even better than Apple’s, and there’s a satisfactory transparency mode to go along with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NawWim"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10844490"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yaWD39"&gt;The controls are pretty much an exact copy of the AirPods Pro squeeze gestures, but OnePlus manages to best Apple at durability: these are rated IP55 for dust and water resistance. Voice call performance is also above most earbuds that cost the same $150 as the OnePlus Buds Pro. For that price, you also get wireless charging in the case. And when it comes to calls, the OnePlus Buds Pro are among the very best performers out there with clear voice reproduction and excellent background noise cancellation so others can hear you perfectly. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s AirPods 3 are the best earbuds for voice calls and sound much better than their predecessors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MMWh6V"&gt;8. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"&gt;Apple AirPods (third generation)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="zUT2zw"&gt;Best earbuds for voice calls on iPhone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="2Yu1aA"&gt;Apple’s third-generation AirPods have a new design with shorter stems than the original model. But even with their mics now being farther from your mouth, they still perform very well on calls — and there are bigger improvements to sound quality and fit / comfort that make upgrading to the so-called AirPods 3 worthwhile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="J0qCuz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10844500"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lZKllk"&gt;Apple has also added new features that were previously exclusive to the AirPods Pro, like head tracking spatial audio and deeper Find My integration for hunting down your misplaced buds. And the case is now optimized to work with Apple’s MagSafe wireless charging system. The AirPods still have a one-size-fits-most hard plastic form factor, so you’ll want to try them before buying to make sure they’re the right match for your ears. But if they are, these are Apple’s best regular AirPods yet by a wide margin.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6kvmL6"&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rEED6p"&gt;Best earbuds for voice calls on Android&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="8OHWyv"&gt;Okay, so maybe there’s one not-insignificant reason to get the “Pro” Galaxy Buds instead of the Galaxy Buds 2: they’re fantastic at handling voice calls. The Galaxy Buds Pro hardware includes a windshield chamber that helps prevent distortion and annoying wind noise if you’re taking a call outside. And if you watch &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVIuRJ-2P-s&amp;amp;t=1s"&gt;our video review&lt;/a&gt; of the Galaxy Buds 2, you’ll hear that it actually works quite well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4BKuAJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10844513"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cXdPCx"&gt;Noise cancellation on the Galaxy Buds Pro is slightly better than the Buds 2, and they also include bonus tricks like 360 audio and a voice detect feature that drops the volume and activates transparency mode if you start speaking to someone nearby. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Razer’s Hammerhead True Wireless earbuds have flashy RGB lighting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PcGTEM"&gt;10. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22632338/razer-hammerhead-true-wireless-earbuds-2nd-gen-review"&gt;Razer Hammerhead True Wireless (2021)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="6ic0rB"&gt;Best earbuds for mobile gaming&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PG68TP"&gt;The Hammerhead True Wireless earbuds have decent sound quality and active noise cancellation for their price. But likely, what’s equally as important to avid mobile gamers is their low latency gaming mode that cuts response time down to 60ms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2TSOzc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10844522"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KcYx9m"&gt;And then there’s the Chroma. Unlike the first-gen Hammerhead True Wireless, these ones have fully customizable RGB lights on each earbud. It’s an eye-catching effect, though it does eat into battery life a little. Razer’s mobile app for the earbuds allows for control remapping and extensive EQ adjustment. The Hammerhead True Wireless earbuds are average in metrics like battery life, and their transparency mode is merely passable, but if you’re big on Razer gear, now you can flash the brand while playing your favorite mobile games at the coffee shop.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nothing Ear 1s have a very cool look, but they can be buggy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9AzthM"&gt;11. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22598920/nothing-ear-1-earbuds-review-features-specs"&gt;Nothing Ear 1&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nhE8Ll"&gt;Best earbuds for standout style&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="0pKVp1"&gt;Though they can be buggier than we’d like, and their noise cancellation is run of the mill, there’s no denying that the first earbuds from Nothing have a unique look. With their semi-translucent design and unique charging case, the Ear 1 earbuds will catch some attention when lined up with earbuds from more established brands. And at $99, you don’t have to break the bank for that added style — and maybe that price will make it easier to overlook the areas where Nothing came up short with its debut pair of earbuds. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The UE Fits can mold to the contours of your ear for a perfect fit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tbqWHp"&gt;12. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21537150/ue-fits-review-wireless-earbuds-review-custom-fit-ear-tips"&gt;UE Fits&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="MAbkyl"&gt;Best earbuds for a perfect fit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="0VNbge"&gt;They mold to the shape of your ears in 60 seconds. That’s really all that needs saying for you to know why the UE Fits surpass all other wireless earbuds at nailing the right fit. Short of visiting an audiologist and having custom IEMs made, you’re not going to do much better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="X9garq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386604"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZfliz"&gt;But the Fits are really only worth it if you often struggle with keeping other earbuds in your ears. If you’ve exhausted all options (including trying memory foam tips), then definitely give these a try. The molding sensation — the tips warm up in your ears as they adapt their shape — is certainly unlike anything you’ll get from other earbuds. &lt;/p&gt;
