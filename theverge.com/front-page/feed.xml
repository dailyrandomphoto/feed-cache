    <title>Microsoft Teams is down worldwide</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Od4mhF_Z7ZCezs6tDdjeC14bRoQ=/0x0:2640x1760/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69191527/microsoftteams.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NfZPUT"&gt;Microsoft Teams is down and experiencing an outage worldwide. The issues started at around 6:30AM this morning, and are blocking connectivity for many Microsoft Teams users across Europe and Asia. Microsoft is aware of the issues and is currently investigating the route cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RQy6Aj"&gt;“We’ve confirmed that this issue affects users globally,” says Microsoft’s 365 status account on Twitter. “We’re reviewing monitoring telemetry and recent changes to isolate the source of the issue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="73LpIF"&gt;Some Microsoft Teams users are reporting 401 error codes when attempting to access the service via the web, while others appear to see Teams and channels but are unable to send messages. Others may still be logged into the service, but Microsoft warns they “may experience degraded performance with multiple features” and that “any user could be affected by this issue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XEnOGT"&gt;This is the second Microsoft Teams outage this month, following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22362975/microsoft-teams-xbox-live-down-outage-issue"&gt;issues with the service at the beginning of April&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft also experienced Teams problems for more than four hours last month, after an authentication change &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22332539/microsoft-teams-down-outage-connectivity-issues"&gt;knocked out access to the communications app&lt;/a&gt;. Azure Active Directory also experienced issues as part of last month’s outage, alongside Office web apps, Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and other Microsoft services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wJs8ld"&gt;It appears Microsoft’s service issues are limited to Teams this morning, with no other signs of Azure, Xbox Live, Office, or other services experiencing issues.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ADT sues Ring over ‘virtually indistinguishable’ blue octagon design</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sNKVE0A4KivSUlz6FZUkC8na25Q=/6x0:2994x1992/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69191406/510658996.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;ADT’s octagonal blue sign.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gXzGWL"&gt;Home security company &lt;a href="https://investor.adt.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/ADT-Brings-Trademark-Suit-Against-Amazons-Ring/default.aspx"&gt;ADT is suing Amazon subsidiary Ring&lt;/a&gt;, claiming its recent designs are a “brazen” copy of ADT’s octagonal blue symbol. The firm cites Ring’s blue octagonal &lt;a href="https://ring.com/collections/accessories/products/alarm-outdoor-siren"&gt;outdoor siren&lt;/a&gt; as a recent example. In the filing, ADT lists a dozen of its trademark registrations dating back to the late 90s that feature a combination of blue and octagonal designs, and claims millions of its customers display this symbol to show that their homes use ADT’s security systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V3BOOf"&gt;ADT claims Ring’s use of blue octagons risks confusing customers and misleading them into thinking the two companies are affiliated or associated. In &lt;a href="https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/e36bab66-adb7-42d5-85fa-e30082efed42"&gt;its filing&lt;/a&gt;, ADT says “the striking similarity” is evidence that Ring is trying “to reap the benefit of the goodwill associated with ADT’s brand and reputation.” It adds that “this type of confusion seriously undermines the goodwill that ADT has cultivated in its Famous Blue Octagon and irreparably harms ADT.“&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zC8MnDwVjLfbIwKj_qL53r2v438=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22472686/msedge_hdavxHV40l.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: ADT LLC v Ring LLC court filing&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;ADT’s filing compares the design of one of its signs with Ring’s Alarm Outdoor Siren.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GKvqrT"&gt;As well as the outdoor siren (pictured above), ADT cites an octagonal “Protected by Ring” yard sign that the company started selling in 2016. However, after ADT complained about the sign, Ring agreed to &lt;a href="https://ring.com/collections/accessories/products/solar-security-sign"&gt;make it less blue&lt;/a&gt;, and ADT took no further action at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oORNQ1"&gt;In the lawsuit, which was &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-27/adt-sues-amazon-s-ring-over-brazen-copies-of-blue-octagon-sign?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, ADT is asking the federal judge in Florida to order Ring to stop using the allegedly similar symbols in its products, and to pay ADT cash compensation. When contacted for comment, a spokesperson from ADT said that the company “is determined to protect its customers, its employees, and its investors, along with its intellectual property and its reputation.” Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7R5sJY"&gt;The two companies have butted heads before. Back in 2017, before Ring was acquired by Amazon, ADT filed a lawsuit that claimed Ring had benefited from its trade secrets after acquiring a company ADT had previously invested in. The lawsuit led to a judge issuing a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/5/16609880/ring-barred-from-selling-security-system-adt-lawsuit-z1"&gt;preliminary injunction&lt;/a&gt; on the sale of Ring’s security system. The two companies reportedly ended up &lt;a href="https://www.securitysales.com/automation/smart-home/ring-reaches-settlement-with-adt-in-zonoff-lawsuit-plus-other-developments/"&gt;settling the suit&lt;/a&gt; the following year for $25 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mfV7XS"&gt;Prior to these legal battles, the two companies had worked together on making their security systems compatible, and ADT showed off Ring’s Video Doorbell working with its security system back in 2016. ADT says it no longer “actively promotes” the Ring Video Doorbell, but will purchase it for customers who want to use it with its security system. However, &lt;a href="https://www.adt.com/alexa"&gt;ADT still advertises&lt;/a&gt; that its system is compatible with Amazon’s Alexa assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="how72L"&gt;While its relationship with Amazon’s Ring has faltered, ADT recently received &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352360/google-adt-investment-nest-smart-home-security-alarms-machine-learning-alerts"&gt;a $450 million investment from Google&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21523967/google-discontinues-nest-secure-alarm-system"&gt;until recently&lt;/a&gt; sold a home security system under its own Nest sub-brand. Going forward, Google said it hopes its Nest devices will become the “cornerstone” of ADT’s smart home offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iSL1uY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 27th, 7:15AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated with statement from ADT.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will reportedly face EU antitrust charges this week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q4GwVxJLGZYoi4O8bBiGe2akZVk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69191330/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pqoXp2"&gt;The European Commission will issue antitrust charges against Apple over concerns about the company’s App Store practices, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/df07e3f2-2d6e-4ced-a819-779e743d85ff"&gt;the&lt;em&gt; Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The commission has been investigating whether Apple has broken EU competition rules with its App Store policies, following an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/13/18263453/spotify-apple-app-store-antitrust-complaint-ec-30-percent-cut-unfair"&gt;initial complaint from Spotify&lt;/a&gt; back in 2019 over Apple’s 30 percent cut on subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bCD0Ib"&gt;The European Commission &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21292651/apple-eu-antitrust-investigation-app-store-apple-pay"&gt;opened up two antitrust investigations&lt;/a&gt; into Apple’s App Store and Apple Pay practices last year, and the&lt;em&gt; Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; only mentions upcoming charges on the App Store case. It’s not clear yet what action will be taken. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOPots"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/6/18530894/apple-music-monopoly-spotify-app-store-europe"&gt;Spotify has previously claimed&lt;/a&gt; Apple uses its App Store to stifle innovation and limit consumer choice in favor of its own Apple Music service. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21292625/apple-rakuten-kobo-app-store-antitrust-complaint-europe"&gt;Rakuten filed a similar complaint&lt;/a&gt; to the EU last year, alleging that it’s anti-competitive for Apple to take a 30 percent commission on ebooks sold through the App Store while promoting its own Apple Books service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zcTxKN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s all about the Apple tax&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XZSIfm"&gt;Known as the “Apple tax,” this 30 percent cut has long been targeted by companies like Netflix and Spotify. Apple has defended its policies, arguing that the revenue it earns contributes toward the costs of maintaining the App Store and enforcing its content, privacy, and security guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iKWX5p"&gt;Epic Games also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22286998/epic-games-apple-european-comission-antitrust-complaint-app-store-fortnite"&gt;filed an antitrust complaint&lt;/a&gt; with the EU earlier this year, as part of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know/archives"&gt;ongoing dispute with Apple&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;developer has publicly criticized Apple’s App Store policies around distribution and payments, resulting in Epic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366259/epic-fortnite-vbucks-mega-drop-discount-iphone-android"&gt;attempting to circumvent&lt;/a&gt; Apple’s 30 percent cut on in-app purchases in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. Apple quickly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;removed the game from its App Store&lt;/a&gt;, and a legal battle is now in progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTHG8Z"&gt;Despite Apple’s defense of its App Store, the iPhone-maker has already sought to ease pressure from regulators and developers with App Store policy changes over the past year. Apple now lets some video streaming apps &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21203630/apple-amazon-prime-video-ios-app-store-cut-exempt-program-deal"&gt;bypass the App Store cut&lt;/a&gt;, and it has reduced its App Store &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;commission rate to 15 percent&lt;/a&gt; for any developer that earns less than $1 million in annual revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JiDk0I"&gt;These changes alone haven’t been enough to ease the fears of EU regulators if the report from the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; is accurate, and we’ll now find out later this week exactly how the European Union will respond to one of the United States’ biggest tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon is making in-garage delivery an option for all grocery delivery orders</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/43Psy3h-dn9gSdsSQ71Sj8mKkTI=/0x0:8256x5504/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69191196/Key_In_Garage_Grocery_Delivery_4.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fzIIdf"&gt;Amazon is expanding its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18167425/amazon-key-garage-business-home-deliveries-prime-ces-2019"&gt;in-garage delivery option&lt;/a&gt; today to every city where it offers grocery deliveries. According to the company, that’s now over 5,000 US cities where Key by Amazon Garage Grocery Delivery can be used to have Amazon Fresh or Whole Foods orders left directly in your garage. You can check to see if the service is available near you by &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?node=21480997011"&gt;entering your ZIP code on Amazon’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nnFk1c"&gt;Garage Grocery Delivery was initially only available in Chicago, Dallas, San Francisco, Seattle, and Los Angeles &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562447/amazon-in-garage-delivery-service-available-areas-key"&gt;in November 2020&lt;/a&gt;, but this expansion should reach even more Amazon customers. Along with living in a supported city, you’ll also need a MyQ-enabled garage door opener or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08GD3D9YJ/ref=s9_acss_bw_cg_GroLP2_2b1_w?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;amp;pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-7&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=R6201ZG6TQTNRQE263Z0&amp;amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;amp;pf_rd_p=8d864092-7fb4-4ad6-8df3-78177d2cd1e9&amp;amp;pf_rd_i=21480997011&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a MyQ Smart Garage Hub&lt;/a&gt; to participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tGnNKp"&gt;With all of those boxes checked, you can select “Key Delivery” at checkout and have the groceries sent straight to your garage without having to get up and answer the door. If you’re not at home, you can watch deliveries happen live with a smart home camera from Ring or LiftMaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3duTE"&gt;Since getting into the grocery business in a serious way in 2017 with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/16/15816174/amazon-whole-foods-acquisition-supermarket-stores"&gt;$13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon’s main focus has seemed to be making it as easy to spend money on groceries as it is to purchase something for delivery. Allowing someone to physically bring food into your home is an obvious end point for that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bUBZaS"&gt;As of late, Amazon has also been trying to streamline the in-store experience: the company has opened several &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22324948/amazon-fresh-grocery-stores-chain-usa-dash-carts"&gt;Amazon Fresh stores over the last year&lt;/a&gt; that use its high-tech &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21323421/amazon-dash-cart-smart-grocery-shopping-woodland-hills-store-cashierless"&gt;Dash shopping cart&lt;/a&gt;, and it has announced plans to introduce a way &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395441/amazon-one-palm-scanning-payments-whole-foods-seattle"&gt;to pay with your palm&lt;/a&gt; in Whole Foods stores.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla claims someone was in the driver’s seat in deadly Texas crash</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3XCqjqfjimJ0w2o-rNFCdicASf8=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69189993/fatal_crash_tesla.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/KPRC2/status/1383787158297726985?s=20" target="_blank"&gt;KPRC2 Houston&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R3LmG2"&gt;A Tesla Model S that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/18/22390612/two-people-killed-fiery-tesla-crash-no-driver"&gt;crashed and caught fire&lt;/a&gt; recently in Texas, killing two men, may have had someone in the driver’s seat, according to Tesla’s top executives. Their comments in an earnings call Monday contradict statements made by local law enforcement in the immediate aftermath of the crash, and could complicate the efforts by federal crash investigators who are also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391890/tesla-driverless-crash-texas-nhtsa-investigation"&gt;examining the incident&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8LKZb8"&gt;Lars Moravy, Tesla’s vice president of vehicle engineering, said that company representatives were able to inspect the crash, along with local law enforcement and investigators from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). Moravy said the company was able to determine that the steering wheel was “deformed,” leading them to conclude there was someone in the driver’s seat at the time of the crash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bEAqe0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“All seatbelts post-crash were found to be unbuckled”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e3H3CD"&gt;“All seatbelts post-crash were found to be unbuckled,” Moravy added. Tesla’s advanced driver assist system, Autopilot, can only operate when the seatbelts are buckled. (&lt;em&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/em&gt; recently was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397546/tesla-autopilot-consumer-report-test-no-driver"&gt;able to prove&lt;/a&gt; that Tesla’s vehicles can easily “tricked” into thinking a person is in the driver’s seat.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6QYIt9"&gt;If the government is upset with Tesla’s disclosures, it isn’t saying so. A spokesperson for the NHTSA declined to comment, while a representative for the NTSB did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JeN50h"&gt;Moravy said that Tesla was unable to recover the SD card from the vehicle, but that local law enforcement was working on getting that to the company. “We continue to hold safety in a high regard and look to improve our products in the future, through this kind of data and other information from the field,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pj9pZf"&gt;The crash took place on Saturday, April 17th, in Spring, Texas. &lt;a href="https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/tesla-spring-crash-fire/285-c28a4993-5b5f-43f4-a924-e39638390647"&gt;According to KHOU&lt;/a&gt; in Houston, investigators at the scene were “100 percent certain” that no one was in the driver’s seat at the time of the crash. Minutes before the crash, the wives of the men were said to overhear them talking about the Autopilot feature of the vehicle, which was a 2019 Tesla Model S, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/18/business/tesla-fatal-crash-texas.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The two victims were identified as Everette Talbot, 69, and William Varner, 59, a prominent local anesthesiologist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dMwnmk"&gt;In the aftermath of the crash, Tesla CEO Elon Musk claimed that “data logs recovered so far” indicate that Autopilot was not engaged, nor had the vehicle owner purchased the company’s “Full Self-Driving” option that may have allowed the use of Autopilot on local roads. Today, the company took its comments a step further, directly contradicting law enforcement’s initial assessment of the incident. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X29rNm"&gt;It is not, however, the first time that Tesla has made public statements about a crash under investigation by the federal government. Musk has also been highly critical of media coverage about incidents involving Tesla vehicles, saying journalists are unfairly focusing on his company for sensationalist reasons and questioning why the numerous standard road deaths that occur every day are not covered as vigorously. (For a good counter argument, please read &lt;em&gt;Jalopnik &lt;/em&gt;journalist &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/why-we-write-about-tesla-crashes-1846715628"&gt;Jason Torchinsky’s explanation&lt;/a&gt; about why Tesla crashes are newsworthy.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNWNem"&gt;In the call on Monday, Musk reiterated his critique of “deceptive media practices,” claiming that Autopilot was not in use at the time of the Texas crash, and slamming journalists for saying otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HnHQHm"&gt;“Those journalists should be ashamed with themselves,” Musk said. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk says Tesla made ‘significant mistakes’ with solar roof project</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IzvNfREJxlwPuvtRoWLK19hljDw=/550x655:3351x2522/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69189983/0x0_Solar_Roof_05.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Tesla&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4bAO4j"&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Monday that his company made “significant mistakes” in its solar roof tile project that have led to further cost overruns and delays. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/28/13463236/tesla-solar-roof-battery-new-elon-musk"&gt;product was originally revealed back in 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k2BZOe"&gt;Tesla is currently still trying to meet significant demand for the solar roof, but has yet to widely roll out the product, Musk said in a conference call with investors following the release of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404198/tesla-q1-results-earnings-profit-model-s-x-y-3-bitcoin-delay"&gt;Tesla’s financial results for the first quarter of 2021&lt;/a&gt;. Tesla reported $494 million in sales of its energy generation and storage products in the first quarter, but the overall division is still not profitable. Musk’s comments come as irate customers have told &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22380057/tesla-solar-roof-price-increase-contract-amount"&gt;outlets like &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/03/29/tesla-drastically-increases-price-solar-roof/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that Tesla is increasing the price of the solar tiles when it comes time for installation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ddMKQa"&gt;Musk said Tesla has run into trouble “assessing the difficulty of certain roofs,” and said that the “complexity of roofs varies dramatically.” If an existing roof has protuberances, or problems with the underlying structure, or is not strong enough to hold Tesla’s solar tiles, then the cost can be two or three times higher than Tesla’s initial estimates, Musk said. Tesla is refunding customers’ deposits if they don’t want to pay the price increase, Musk said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4EUUdW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The solar roof was revealed nearly five years ago&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sHBRs7"&gt;Musk unveiled the Tesla solar roof in 2016 on the set of &lt;em&gt;Desperate Housewives. &lt;/em&gt;At the time,  he was trying to acquire Solar City, a solar energy company formed by his cousins. Musk was also chairman of Solar City at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5XSPmQ"&gt;The roofs he showed off at the event weren’t fully working, &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40422084/inside-steel-pulse-the-mysterious-project-that-became-elon-musks-solar-roof"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fast Company&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; later reported, and Musk allegedly had said prototypes of the tiles were a “piece of shit.” Still, the vision for the solar roof — replacing regular roof shingles with photovoltaic tiles that could collectively capture even more of the sun’s energy than traditional solar panels, and storing that energy in Tesla’s Powerwall home battery — was crucial to the merger, he wrote in his second “master plan” for Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PhfTDe"&gt;“We can’t do this well if Tesla and SolarCity are different companies, which is why we need to combine and break down the barriers inherent to being separate companies,” he wrote. “That they are separate at all, despite similar origins and pursuit of the same overarching goal of sustainable energy, is largely an accident of history. Now that Tesla is ready to scale Powerwall and SolarCity is ready to provide highly differentiated solar, the time has come to bring them together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ve47se"&gt;The merger eventually went through, though it’s still the focus of a shareholder lawsuit in Delaware. Since that 2016 event, the solar roof has gone through multiple revisions but has yet to be widely rolled out. Musk even once said that 2019 would be the “&lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/elon-musk-this-is-the-year-of-the-solar-roof-and-powerwall"&gt;year of the solar roof&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5v8eTH"&gt;Musk now says Tesla will expand solar roof installations this year, and on Monday he talked up the company’s recent decision to more bundle Tesla’s home battery with its solar products. “This is the long term solution to a sustainable energy future,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s how the Internet Archive digitizes 78rpm records</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Close up of a record player stylus sitting on a record. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ie3RA-pE5qWHfw9YJn0pITVpPMg=/3x0:2037x1356/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69189828/DSC02082.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2pmjRp"&gt;The Internet Archive, in partnership with George Blood LP, has been working since 2016 to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/12/16126346/50000-digitized-vinyl-internet-archive-great-78-project"&gt;digitize thousands of 78rpm records&lt;/a&gt;, some of which were made in the early 1900s. Over 250,000 records have been preserved, and the archive posted &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/internetarchive/status/1386423512810721284"&gt;a Twitter thread &lt;/a&gt;yesterday detailing how each record is cleaned and filed away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N6oabJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;At the Internet Archive, this is how we digitize #78 rpm records. &lt;br&gt;Our partner &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/georgeblood_lp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@georgeblood_lp&lt;/a&gt; has perfected this technique, digitizing with 4 different styli at once. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We put as much effort into capturing the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/metadata?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#metadata&lt;/a&gt; as we do digitizing the music. &lt;a href="https://t.co/dn4EjXTS9z"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dn4EjXTS9z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Internet Archive (@internetarchive) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/internetarchive/status/1386423512810721284?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Wn0bFx"&gt;Each record is cleaned on a machine that sprays distilled water onto its surface. A little vacuum arm then sucks up the water, along with whatever dirt and nastiness has built up in the record’s grooves over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1XNpqY"&gt;The discs are then photographed, and the photos are referenced to pull info from the discs’ labels and add it to the archive’s database by hand. While most of the records are from the biggest record labels like Columbia, RCA Victor, and Capitol, the archive has found 1,700 other labels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xvy2Om"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;4/ ...but along the way, we've uncovered 1700 other music labels + some pretty beautiful picture discs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From 1898-1950, this was THE way music was recorded &amp;amp; shared. Shouldn't we preserve this part of our musical history?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To learn more or get involved:&lt;a href="https://t.co/n741BM382p"&gt;https://t.co/n741BM382p&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/OdpsP5NQFR"&gt;pic.twitter.com/OdpsP5NQFR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Internet Archive (@internetarchive) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/internetarchive/status/1386428088049836034?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OMISv4"&gt;Some of the 78s are a treat to look at, including &lt;a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=subject%3A%22picture+disc%22"&gt;picture discs&lt;/a&gt; that have an image printed across the entire surface of the record. I recommend “&lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/VemVemTheCubanKissingGame"&gt;Vem Vem (The Cuban Kissing Game)&lt;/a&gt;” from 1947 and “&lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/NightHerdingSong"&gt;Night Herding Song&lt;/a&gt;” from 1949.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MBEMBC"&gt;78s don’t have standardized groove sizes, so recordings taken with various stylus tips will each sound slightly different. Here, you get four: the records are digitized with custom-built turntables that have four arms, each with a different stylus. Each version is available to download separately, with the file name showing “3.3_CT” for a recording from a 3.3 mil truncated conical stylus and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUmB8X"&gt;Four styli might make you nervous when we’re talking about preserving fragile records, some of which are over a hundred years old. But most of these 78s are made of hard shellac, which makes them prone to shattering if mishandled, but is also tough enough that the grooves won’t be damaged by a stylus. Modern equipment with diamond tip styli also exert much less force than old players with steel needles, George Blood LP &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/internetarchive/status/1386453127881117700"&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LG5QND"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/georgeblood"&gt;whole collection&lt;/a&gt; is a little overwhelming to dig through, but you can narrow your browsing by year, genre, and artist. If you’d prefer to be surprised, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/great78project"&gt;@great78project&lt;/a&gt; Twitter account posts a new record from the collection every hour.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will now let you add virtual lasers and confetti to your Clips videos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0bKlTv"&gt;Apple now lets you add augmented-reality lasers, confetti, and more to your Clips videos, thanks to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fclips-adds-immersive-new-arspaces%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F26%2F22404413%2Fapple-ar-lidar-clips-video-effects-sparkle-lasers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an update to the short-form video app&lt;/a&gt;. The feature, called AR Spaces, will let users with LIDAR-equipped Apple devices (so far, that’s the iPhone 12 Pros and iPad Pros from 2020 or later) add room-filling effects that can interact with walls and floors. (If you watched Apple’s April 20th event, you may have spotted &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/JdBYVNuky1M?t=2697"&gt;a brief look at the update&lt;/a&gt; ahead of today’s release.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7C22qp"&gt;You can get an idea of what this will look like in action with this GIF taken from Apple’s demo video. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wy6r-Dc-R5X2JAdmGgL-9cg-pCM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22471539/apple_clips_ar.gif"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Prism and Dance Floor effects.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QOP8L0"&gt;Apple says that the AR Spaces effects should work with the other effects built in to Clips, such as the animated stickers and emoji, if you want to add even more to your videos. The update to the app can be downloaded now from the App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XK2MkR"&gt;The Clips update is Apple’s latest experiment with AR, in which the company has a keen interest. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22278780/apple-augmented-reality-ar-app-for-all-mankind-tv-plus"&gt;released an AR experience tie-in&lt;/a&gt; for its show &lt;em&gt;For All Mankind &lt;/em&gt;in February, and CEO Tim Cook discussed some of his thoughts about AR tech in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22367715/tim-cook-augmented-reality-apple-car-hints-interview"&gt;an interview earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;. There are also rumors that Apple is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346564/apple-mixed-vr-virtual-augmented-reality-headset-light-ming-chi-kuo"&gt;working on a full-fledged AR / VR headset&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California will be able to set its own tailpipe standards again</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="SFChronicleVirusTraffic" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JuFCSiEB-QqJKXfppadObyUmu08=/0x1:5043x3363/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69189535/1312394406.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Morning commuter traffic backs up on Interstate 80 westbound in Berkeley, Calif. Tuesday, April 6, 2021.&amp;nbsp; | Jessica Christian/The San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lKXzOt"&gt;California is on track to regain its power to set tougher vehicle emissions standards than the rest of the US. The Environmental Protection Agency announced today that it’s reconsidering a Donald &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20872304/trump-california-emissions-pollution-rollback-waiver-clean-air-act"&gt;Trump-era edict&lt;/a&gt; that sought to strip California of that ability. The EPA plans to rescind the Trump decision altogether after a public comment period ends on July 6th, the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2021-04-26/epa-california-emissions-waiver-reversing-trump?utm_id=28019&amp;amp;sfmc_id=765815"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. Last week, the Department of Transportation &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/cafe_preemption_nprm_04222021_1.pdf"&gt;moved&lt;/a&gt; to repeal a related Trump-era rule that barred individual states from setting their own tailpipe standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="5mN4kb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;California has essentially set the tone for the country&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HEzeDu"&gt;California has been able to set its own tailpipe standards since it was granted a waiver under the 1970 Clean Air Act. At the time, the Golden State was grappling with an air quality crisis that it sought to solve, in part, with tougher standards for tailpipe pollution. Since then, California has essentially set the tone for the country. In order to sell in California, the nation’s biggest auto market, automakers have had to adhere to the state’s stricter standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1TB5ux"&gt;“I am a firm believer in California’s long-standing statutory authority to lead. The 2019 decision to revoke the state’s waiver to enforce its greenhouse gas pollution standards for cars and trucks was legally dubious and an attack on the public’s health and wellbeing,”  EPA Administrator Michael Regan &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-reconsiders-previous-administrations-withdrawal-californias-waiver-enforce"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in a statement today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hdmZjs"&gt;Former President Trump sought to take away California’s Clean Air Act waiver and weaken fuel efficiency and emissions standards. While the Obama administration sought to increase average fuel efficiency by 5 percent each year between 2021 and 2026, the Trump administration lowered that standard to a 1.5 percent annual increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qZTrOT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ford, Volkswagen, Honda, and BMW all struck a deal with California&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MBhTTI"&gt;But Trump faced opposition &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21272179/attorneys-general-sue-trump-administration-fuel-efficiency-standard-rollback"&gt;in court&lt;/a&gt; and, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21611607/gm-trump-california-car-emission-pollution-biden-fuel-efficiency-standards"&gt;increasingly&lt;/a&gt;, from automakers. Ford, Volkswagen, Honda, and BMW all struck a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/20727261/trump-emissions-rollback-ford-volkswagon-honda-bmw-california-deal"&gt;deal&lt;/a&gt; with California in 2019 to increase fuel efficiency and cut emissions regardless of whatever weaker&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;federal standards the Trump administration set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ntFsw"&gt;So California never fully lost its outsize influence over the auto industry. But with its legal authority to set separate standards fully restored, the state will have an even bigger voice as the Biden administration considers new federal standards &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/04/22/transportation-climate-change/"&gt;expected in July&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New White House task force will look for ways to boost union organizing</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OupgVV"&gt;President Biden &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/04/26/executive-order-on-worker-organizing-and-empowerment/"&gt;issued an executive order today&lt;/a&gt; to create a new labor task force in support of worker organizing in the United States. The effort will be led by Vice President Kamala Harris. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I8vxII"&gt;“Despite the importance of unions to our economy and democracy, and nearly 60 million workers today saying they would join a union if given the chance, American workers have faced increasing barriers to organizing and bargaining collectively with their employers,” the order reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sFfBXH"&gt;The task force, which includes a long list of cabinet members and policy advisers, will make recommendations on how the federal government can help workers organize and join unions. This could include helping contractors in industries that have been difficult to organize, such as the so-called gig economy, &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/26/fact-sheet-executive-order-establishing-the-white-house-task-force-on-worker-organizing-and-empowerment/"&gt;according to a White House fact sheet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cI4cVn"&gt;The move comes after decades of declining union membership. In 2020, just 10.8 percent of the US workforce was unionized, down from more than 30 percent in the 1950s, according to the White House. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VHkiEh"&gt;In the executive order, Biden wrote that this decline has led to a “host of negative consequences for American workers and the economy, including weakening and shrinking America’s middle class.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmePON"&gt;The task force can’t create new policies or pass laws, so the immediate effect of the executive order will be minimal. But the new group could help to spur President Biden to take stronger action in support of collective bargaining. Already, the White House has voiced its support for the Protecting the Rights to Organize Act, which would strengthen organizing protections. The bill is currently awaiting a vote in the Senate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="66D5z3"&gt;The task force now has 180 days to come up with policy recommendations to increase union membership in the public and private sectors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DaKnxQ"&gt;President Biden has been a vocal supporter of the labor movement, a break from previous Democratic presidents who were more measured in their support. In February, the President publicly voiced support for Amazon warehouse workers in Bessemer, Alabama, who were in the middle of a closely watched union drive. Workers eventually voted against unionizing, though the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/10/22377142/bessemer-amazon-labor-union-loss-warehouse-rwdsu"&gt;is contesting the result&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
