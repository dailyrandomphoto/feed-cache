    <title>Twitter’s voice DMs arrive in India</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OWPiaY"&gt;Twitter has rolled out support for voice direct messages on iOS and Android in India starting today, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterIndia/status/1361900922465644544"&gt;company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/twitter-begins-testing-voice-dms-india-brazil-japan?utm_source=ac_tw&amp;amp;utm_medium=tw_card&amp;amp;utm_content=99269&amp;amp;utm_campaign=social"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Central &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that the audio messages are now available in three countries worldwide: India, Brazil, and Japan. Plans for voice DMs were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452932/twitter-voice-audio-direct-messages-test-brazil"&gt;first announced last year&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter says the feature, which it’s calling an “experiment,” will roll out in India in phases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGMx9D"&gt;In a statement, Twitter India’s managing director, Manish Maheshwari, said voice messages are designed to “give people a new way to express themselves and help them connect through the nuances, emotion, and empathy built by hearing someone’s voice.” Similar features are already available on other services like Messenger, Instagram DMs, and WhatsApp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YZhasD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt; test, test: Starting today, you'll be able to record and send voice messages in DMs   Here’s how &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS. The experiment will be rolled out in phases. &lt;a href="https://t.co/aqQM6h9sof"&gt;pic.twitter.com/aqQM6h9sof&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter India (@TwitterIndia) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterIndia/status/1361900922465644544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RfNzR6"&gt;A video released by Twitter India shows how the feature works. Users can start recording using a small icon to the right of the message box, and voice messages can be up to 140 seconds in length. There’s an option to review a voice message before sending it. Although it isn’t possible to send voice messages from the web at the moment, browsers can reportedly still play back the audio clips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="94O2Wy"&gt;While Twitter has traditionally been a text-based platform, it’s tested a number of audio-centric features over the last year, including audio tweets the company has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21294481/twitter-audio-tweets-now-available-iphone-ios"&gt;testing on iOS&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22187490/twitter-spaces-test-voice-chat-rooms"&gt;Twitter Spaces&lt;/a&gt;, which are voice chat rooms similar to what Clubhouse offers. However, Twitter’s audio ambitions faced criticism for their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296032/twitter-audio-tweets-accessibility-volunteers"&gt;lack of accessibility options&lt;/a&gt;. In response, the company announced it was setting up &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/making-twitter-more-accessible.html"&gt;new accessibility teams&lt;/a&gt; within the company and that it would be adding automated captions to audio and video on the platform in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fcIBJW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Super73 is the latest e-bike company to land a huge investment </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cr1eNFDk1vKzA3b4LOk1PmTBUos=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68829465/sokane_1842_super_73_scout_9173.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oRi4cs"&gt;Super73, the Southern California e-bike company popular among YouTubers and film celebrities, announced that it has raised an impressive $20 million from investors, making it the latest company to benefit from growing venture capital interest after a record year of e-bike sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="23vEYt"&gt;The funding round is Super73’s first and was led by equity firm Volition Capital, which was an early investor in Chewy before its acquisition by PetSmart for $3.35 billion in 2017. With these new funds, the direct-to-consumer e-bike company plans on growing its 75-person staff, improving its customer service operation, and expanding its product lineup, said Super73 co-founder and CEO LeGrand Crewse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dtnRhU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Super73 helped popularize a retro, mini-bike style of e-bike&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KMahh1"&gt;“It was never about bikes, it was never about transportation, it was really about building a lifestyle, a true lifestyle brand,” Crewse said, “and one that stood for the values that we had.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r5kcoa"&gt;Founders love to extoll the virtues of their “community” of loyal customers, and Crewse is no different. “We have this incredible community of people that [see] Super 73 and our products [as] much much more than, you’re getting from point A to point B, or we’re getting out of a car or anything else,” he said. “It’s about getting together with other people and forming these new experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y5KVVl"&gt;With their long banana seats, parallelogram-shaped frames, upright handlebars, fat tires, and oversized headlights, Super73 helped popularize a style of e-bike that was influenced by the mini-bikes or mopeds of the 1960s, ‘70s, and ‘80s. The company’s relaxed, SoCal vibe has helped it earn a following from a growing cadre of A-list celebrities, musicians, and influencers, whose social media posts featuring the bikes are typically as good, if not better, than any paid advertisement. (Please watch Jack Black’s Thor-inspired adventures on his Super73 bike that’s embedded below. It’s so good.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MQQrEf"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J02iZ3FvRoc?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UJ45WN"&gt;Crewse said he is proud of the fact that Super73 has never had to pay for any of these celebrity endorsements. The company has always aspired to be more than just an e-bike business, he said. “It was never about bikes, it was never about transportation,” he said. “It was really about building a true lifestyle brand, one that stood for the values that we had.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0iJNVW"&gt;But since Super73 emerged several years ago, mini-bikes have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/24/20875870/juiced-scorpion-ebike-price-specs-release"&gt;exploded in popularity&lt;/a&gt;, with retro-influenced models found all over Instagram and other social media platforms. But as the market becomes flooded with similar-looking designs, Super73 is trying to stay focused on making sure its e-bikes are always the best, Crewse said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UsPTcw"&gt;“There’s going to be a race to the bottom, there’s going to be a commoditization that’s going to happen,” he said. “I think that there’s big players out there that are racing towards that. But we’re taking a very different path.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lixIsP"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@jackblack/video/6926316028972502278" data-video-id="6926316028972502278" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@jackblack" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jackblack"&gt;@jackblack&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;⚡️The New God of Thunder ⚡️ ⚡️ ⚡️ ⚡️ ⚡️  @taylor &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Jack Black" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-6926316047062584069"&gt;♬ original sound - Jack Black&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EOy9hP"&gt;That different path appears to lead to faster, more powerful e-bikes like the R-series models unveiled in early 2020. More inspired by dirt bikes than Super73’s previous models, the R-series bikes have front and rear suspension, peak 2,000-watt motors, 960Wh batteries, and a top speed of 28 mph. They’re also not cheap, retailing for around $3,250, and not lightweight, tipping the scales at 80lbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ezyOeN"&gt;Bikes, both traditional and electrified, are experiencing a boom in popularity &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22178543/bike-bicycle-boom-covid-pandemic-2020-sales-cities-infrastructure"&gt;over the past 12 months&lt;/a&gt;, thanks in part to the pandemic lockdowns. A staggering $4.1 billion worth of bikes (excluding e-bikes) were sold in the US between January and October 2020, a 62-percent increase over the same period in 2019, according to the NPD Group, which tracks retail trends. E-bikes showed even more momentum, with $490.8 million in US sales for a 144-percent increase year over year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VOBJgy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Bikes, both traditional and electrified, are experiencing a boom in popularity&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bVmxI9"&gt;Consulting firm Deloitte &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/21016306/electric-bike-ebike-sales-us-numbers-deloitte-cars"&gt;estimated in a report last year&lt;/a&gt; that the number of e-bikes in circulation worldwide should reach 300 million by 2023 — a 50-percent increase over 2019’s 200 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zdt7DS"&gt;Investors see a clear opportunity in continuing to fuel that growth. Rad Power Bikes closed on a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rad-power-bikes-closes-25-million-in-funding-to-grow-direct-to-consumer-electric-bike-business-300999573.html"&gt;$25 million deal&lt;/a&gt; last February, and then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266143/rad-power-bikes-investment-electric-ebike"&gt;secured a whopping $150 million&lt;/a&gt; investment just a week ago. Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21437704/vanmoof-interview-s3-electric-bike-issues-delays-mobile-service-network"&gt;Dutch e-bike brand VanMoof landed $40 million&lt;/a&gt; in September. In total, European VCs poured $165 million into e-bikes in 2019 and 2020, more than the previous four years combined, according to data from PitchBook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SWE0LL"&gt;With its investment money in the bank, Super73 plans on rolling out new products in the near future, and while Crewse wouldn’t say specifically what the company is working on, he promised it would expand beyond the company’s current lineup of mini-bike and scrambler-inspired models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rkc0Ns"&gt;“If it’s on two wheels, you know we’re certainly looking at it,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to check how much free Google storage you have left</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MTHFTQOgUx6KDH1aiGEOr9sydoM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68829474/acastro_210104_1777_google_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4jIz0a"&gt;It seems like the days of free apps are slowly grinding to a halt. Just recently, password manager LastPass announced that it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285531/lastpass-free-tier-mobile-computer-device-premium-family"&gt;drastically limiting the usefulness of its free app&lt;/a&gt;, and now, Google has sent out emails reaffirming that it is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21560810/google-photos-unlimited-cap-free-uploads-15gb-ending"&gt;ending its free unlimited photo storage policy&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="OTnDg5"&gt;Starting June 1, 2021, all new photos and videos backed up in &lt;a href="https://notifications.google.com/g/p/AD-FnEyR8jsullXkrSTswG7ZPbQQNksSJr10HUd-aLavsdAtjwQyOZfjNDoVgSorQcUstUwN-MFfdBz70-Z7gtBoC2DF0frY1V5CgkzeiOXQj_Chh9zqXLaoYhVkrzduPO1773ycvqzs0KgZ9x5z-XeQrjqOP05XZz4"&gt;High quality and Express quality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; will count toward the free 15 GB of storage that comes with your Google account or any additional storage you may have purchased, the same way other Google services like Google Drive and Gmail already do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="40gBma"&gt;While this isn’t a surprise — Google announced its new policy back in November 2020 — it is still depressing to be reminded of the upcoming storage crunch. Of course, until June 1st, you can still add as many “high quality” photos as you like, so if you’re planning to upload a lot of old photos, this is the time to do it. Meanwhile, though, you may want to figure out just how much space you’re already using, so you can figure out if you need to upgrade. It’s not difficult, and there are several ways of doing it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="pBVs5O"&gt;Go to &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/settings/storage"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;, and you’ll see a breakdown of how much storage you’re using and how it’s been divided between Google Drive, Gmail, Google Photos, and your device backup. (Note: how the page looks may vary, depending on the type of Google account you have.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/19/18271015/google-drive-photos-storage-space-how-to-get-more" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9AFU60NdFKQ-cNPty3RC2E6F204=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22308171/Screen_Shot_2021_02_16_at_2.28.24_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google will let you know how much storage space you have left and what it’s being used by.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="cqhxBs"&gt;You can also see how much storage you have left by going to your Google Drive page and looking at the Storage statistic showing at the bottom of the left-hand column&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zxwYkd"&gt;Google has also created a page that estimates, based on your current usage, how long it will be before you need to increase your storage. You can find it &lt;a href="https://photos.google.com/storage"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="QHEH8k"&gt;Once the June 1st deadline has passed, Google says it will send reminders when you’re nearing your limit. It also intends to provide a tool that will identify what it calls “dark, blurry, and otherwise unwanted content.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cp8aOp"&gt;Now that you know how much space you have left, you can try to figure out what you want to do next. If you’re getting close to your limit, do you want to &lt;a href="https://one.google.com/about"&gt;pay Google for more storage space&lt;/a&gt;? (Prices start at $1.99 per month for 100GB.) Find a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561171/photo-storage-service-google-amazon-flickr"&gt;different service to store your photos&lt;/a&gt;? It’s up to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tKA5Di"&gt;One word of advice: before you do anything else, try to get rid of any old, unwanted, or duplicate files that are hanging around in your Google storage. You’d be amazed at how much space you might save. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="o36Eac"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to get more space in your Google storage","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/19/18271015/google-drive-photos-storage-space-how-to-get-more"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="eNyhrY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung forced to halt chip production in Austin due to power outages</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fFD1B5S7gXShNiDutNyBrx0iQ2w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68829398/acastro_190503_1777_samsung_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q9bWvA"&gt;Samsung has temporarily halted chip production at its facilities in Austin, TX in response to the &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/2/16/22284140/texas-blackout-outage-winter-storm-uri-ercot-power-grid-cold-snow-austin-houston-dallas"&gt;region’s power outages&lt;/a&gt; brought on by Winter Storm Uri, the &lt;a href="https://eu.statesman.com/story/news/2021/02/16/austin-energy-shuts-power-off-samsung-other-major-users/6771267002/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Austin American-Statesman&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. “With prior notice, appropriate measures have safely been taken for the facilities and wafers in production,” Samsung said in a statement, “We will resume production as soon as power is restored.” On Tuesday, Austin Energy confirmed it had ordered its biggest customers to shut down, although it’s unknown how long they were without power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cOUtIi"&gt;The shutdowns were ordered as some &lt;a href="https://eu.statesman.com/story/news/2021/02/15/austin-power-outage-40-without-power-amid-austin-energys-rolling-blackouts/6752667002/"&gt;200,000 Austin homes&lt;/a&gt; were without power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="udWW1x"&gt;What’s unclear at the moment is whether production of Apple’s Mac Pro, which &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2019%2F09%2Fapples-new-mac-pro-to-be-made-in-texas%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F17%2F22287054%2Fsamsung-chip-production-halted-austin-winter-storm-uri-power-blackouts#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is manufactured in Austin&lt;/a&gt;, has also been affected. A spokesperson from Apple did not immediately return a request for comment. Other big Austin manufacturers, including NXP Semiconductors and Infineon Semiconductors, were also reportedly shut down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2jMAmh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Appropriate measures have safely been taken for the facilities and wafers in production”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FAX9jM"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Statesman&lt;/em&gt; reports that the shutdown has the potential to cost Samsung millions, especially if manufacturing processes were suddenly interrupted. &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/samsungs-chip-fabs-in-texas-ordered-to-shut-down-due-to-power-shortage"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that in March 2018 an unplanned 30 minute outage at one of Samsung’s plants in South Korea resulted in damage to tens of thousands of wafers, equivalent to 11 percent of its NAND flash output for the month. However, given Samsung had prior notice of the Austin shutdown, it presumably avoided any damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GWeYxi"&gt;Samsung’s Austin factory started mass manufacturing memory chips in the late 90s, and over the years has produced DRAM, NAND, and mobile processors. &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/sas/Business/Overview" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s website notes&lt;/a&gt; it’s primarily focused on producing chips with a 14nm process. A recent report said the company is considering &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22243994/samsung-chipmaking-texas-plant-3nm-10-billion-report"&gt;building a new chipmaking plant&lt;/a&gt; in the region, capable of producing processors as advanced as 3nm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HX5yVQ"&gt;Austin Energy General Manager Jackie Sargent said in comments reported by the &lt;em&gt;Statesman&lt;/em&gt; that the energy company had initially asked industrial users to try to conserve energy, and had also tried using backup generators to help the situation. However, eventually Sargent says the manufacturers had to be asked to shut down completely. “We reached out to our largest customers, and in partnership with them, they shut down their facilities,” Sargent said. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft hid its new Xbox headset in the Series X launch trailer months ago</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o9TEBO_AQA2zASXwWNqzFtgbOc0=/22x0:534x341/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68829199/xboxheadset.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3KG6Ju"&gt;Microsoft’s new Xbox Wireless Headset appeared in the company’s Xbox Series X and S launch commercial all the way back in October. British actor Daniel Kaluuya picked up the headset &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21508979/microsoft-xbox-series-x-tv-commercial-ad-marketing-campaign-power-your-dreams"&gt;early on in the ad&lt;/a&gt;, but nobody noticed it was an unannounced accessory at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XGNgkr"&gt;Microsoft announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285247/microsoft-xbox-wireless-headset-release-date-price-features"&gt;new Xbox Wireless Headset on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; which features rotating ear cup dials that let you adjust volume and game / audio chat balance. The new headset will be available for $99 on March 16th.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_V5twfVfOfYJm1cuwNPbo8cJJPg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22309428/xboxwirelessheadset.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s new Xbox Wireless Headset.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dRrbVr"&gt;Aaron Greenberg, general manager of Xbox games marketing, confirmed the new Xbox Wireless Headset was part of the launch commercial during a Clubhouse audio call attended by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last night. It’s not the first time Microsoft has openly teased unannounced Xbox products. Xbox chief Phil Spencer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21433228/microsoft-xbox-series-x-hidden-video-phil-spencer-july-2020"&gt;hid the Xbox Series S on his shelf last year&lt;/a&gt;, before Microsoft had even announced it was working on a second next-gen console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nNESg0"&gt;Microsoft has a habit of hiding secret messages and clues in its Xbox videos. The company originally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/7/15754260/microsoft-xbox-e3-project-scorpio-teaser-trailers"&gt;teased its Xbox One X console&lt;/a&gt; with videos that hinted at its 6 teraflops of GPU performance. Even the latest Xbox Series X console was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/8/18658147/microsoft-xbox-scarlet-teaser-e3-2019"&gt;teased in videos&lt;/a&gt;, under its Scarlett codename. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N8Embq"&gt;If there’s one thing we’ve learned from all of this: always take a real close look at Microsoft’s Xbox videos.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic Games brings Apple fight to the EU with new antitrust complaint</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3FfoJ2jwG5QC9WTDp8EHNXq33q8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68829189/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="owZZU4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; developer Epic Games has made a formal antitrust complaint about Apple to the European Commission, the &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/epic-games-files-eu-antitrust-complaint-against-apple"&gt;company announced today&lt;/a&gt;. Epic alleges that Apple’s “carefully designed anti-competitive restrictions” have “completely eliminated competition in app distribution and payment processes.” It says this leads to consumers playing higher prices, and gives Apple too much control over developers on its platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="geMeM2"&gt;The complaint is the latest legal action taken by Epic in its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know/archives"&gt;ongoing dispute with Apple&lt;/a&gt;. The developer has criticized Apple’s control over software distribution with the App Store, as well as its policies around payments, which often result in Apple taking a 30 percent cut of in-app purchases. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney has called this 30 percent cut a “tax,” and Epic claims Apple’s policies give its own services an unfair advantage over other iOS developers. In November, Apple said it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;reduce its App Store commission rate to 15 percent&lt;/a&gt; for any developer that earns less than $1 million in annual revenue, in an apparent response to pressure from developers and regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="e2iCJC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Epic wants “timely and effective remedies” from the EU&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zuHcZa"&gt;In its announcement, Epic Games said it’s not seeking damages from Apple in the EU. Instead, it says it wants “timely and effective remedies” to address what it claims are Apple’s anti-competitive practices. “We just want to see prohibition on these platform companies using their control over the hardware to exert control over secondary markets and force them to compete on equal terms with every competitor,” Epic CEO Tim Sweeney &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e1259614-d954-400f-9265-f39a36c8c0c6"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when asked what these remedies should include. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bwDVCL"&gt;Epic’s dispute with Apple erupted last summer when the developer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366259/epic-fortnite-vbucks-mega-drop-discount-iphone-android"&gt;attempted to circumvent&lt;/a&gt; Apple’s 30 percent cut on in-app purchases in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. Apple responded by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;removing the popular game from its App Store&lt;/a&gt;, only for Epic Games to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367963/epic-fortnite-legal-complaint-apple-ios-app-store-removal-injunctive-relief"&gt;file a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; in response. Epic has subsequently &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/freefortnite-australia-press-release"&gt;launched legal proceedings in Australia&lt;/a&gt;, and earlier this year &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-14/epic-widens-fortnite-access-dispute-with-apple-google-in-u-k?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;complained to the UK’s antitrust tribunal&lt;/a&gt; about Apple’s actions. Epic Games and Apple are due to meet in court in May, according to the &lt;em&gt;FT. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4qICjs"&gt;As well as challenging Apple, Epic also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368363/epic-google-fortnite-lawsuit-antitrust-app-play-store-apple-removal"&gt;sued Google&lt;/a&gt; after it removed &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; from Android’s Google Play Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ruv2OL"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/euiSHuaw6Q4?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qg8auo"&gt;Responding to Epic’s latest filing, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-17/epic-games-attacks-apple-in-complaint-to-eu-antitrust-watchdog?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that Epic had intentionally violated its App Store policies, and that these “apply equally to every developer and protect customers.” It said Epic’s actions “made pawns of customers, and we look forward to making this clear to the European Commission.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D8sosu"&gt;Epic’s new complaint follows the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21292651/apple-eu-antitrust-investigation-app-store-apple-pay"&gt;EU’s announcement last year&lt;/a&gt; that it has opened a formal antitrust investigation against Apple over its App Store and Apple Pay practices. The EU is concerned that Apple’s policies stifle and distort competition in cases where Apple’s own services compete with other developers on its App Store. Messaging app Telegram &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/88589fc5-8410-4274-859c-d27b3d83fe20"&gt;has also complained to the EU&lt;/a&gt; about Apple’s policies, demanding that it allow users to download software outside of the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SpaceX reportedly raised the best part of a billion dollars to fund future missions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="SpaceX" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AbzxlnkuUcsAosditoRYyfNdxrs=/3x0:1017x676/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68828334/spacex1_1020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XEPznM"&gt;SpaceX has &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/16/elon-musks-spacex-raised-850-million-at-419point99-a-share.html"&gt;reportedly raised $850 million in a round of funding&lt;/a&gt;, in transactions that would value shares of the company at $419.99 each. According to &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;, this would mean the company is worth around $74 billion. It would also mean that the company has money to continue on with its future projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iEKgcA"&gt;As one could imagine, some of SpaceX’s projects are deeply unprofitable before they start making money — for instance, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274385/musk-spacex-starlink-deposit-price-satellite-internet"&gt;earlier this month Elon Musk said that there’s a “deep chasm of negative cash flow”&lt;/a&gt; between the company’s satellite-based internet service provider Starlink and profitability. The company’s plan to send &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21419841/spacex-starlink-internet-satellite-constellation-download-speeds-space-lasers"&gt;enough satellites to create a global, high-speed internet network&lt;/a&gt; is expensive, and since the service is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274385/musk-spacex-starlink-deposit-price-satellite-internet"&gt;still in the beta and pre-order stage&lt;/a&gt;, it’s not going to be bringing in a ton of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ybYVLv"&gt;The company is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/4/20895056/elon-musk-starship-spacex-human-health-life-support-radiation"&gt;working on a spaceship&lt;/a&gt; with a cargo capacity that rivals the Saturn V, the rocket that took us to the Moon. A project like that requires many failed test flights, which can sometimes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262937/spacex-sn9-starship-test-flight-successful-explode-landing"&gt;crash and blow up&lt;/a&gt;. While SpaceX aims for Starship to eventually be reusable like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/30/15117096/spacex-launch-reusable-rocket-success-falcon-9-landing"&gt;some of its current rockets&lt;/a&gt;, recent crashes suggest the company will have to build a few more before it has a product that can be profitably sent into space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bwuyjB"&gt;With SpaceX being a private company, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/7/18129539/spacex-falcon-9-rocket-water-landing-valuation-investors"&gt;its financials can often be difficult to figure out&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s likely that investors (at least the ones who paid &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/teddyschleifer/status/1361841578378100737"&gt;almost $420&lt;/a&gt; a share) believe that the company will be successful, both with future endeavors and current ones like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22150947/spacex-second-dragon-capsule-space-station"&gt;making deliveries to the International Space Station for NASA&lt;/a&gt;. While Musk has said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/16/7569333/elon-musk-wants-to-spend-10-billion-building-the-internet-in-space"&gt;Starlink alone might cost $10 billion to create&lt;/a&gt;, having $850 million more in the bank account certainly doesn’t hurt the company’s odds.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Valve’s Dota 2 will become a Netflix anime series on March 25th</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5kYUX8"&gt;Netflix is making an anime series based on Valve’s hugely-popular game &lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt;. The 8-episode series, titled &lt;em&gt;Dota: Dragon’s Blood,&lt;/em&gt; launches on March 25th, and you can watch the first trailer at the top of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fjtcHT"&gt;“The upcoming fantasy series tells the story of Davion, a renowned Dragon Knight devoted to wiping the scourge from the face of the world,” according to a &lt;a href="https://media.netflix.com/en/only-on-netflix/80994336"&gt;Netflix press release&lt;/a&gt;. “Following encounters with a powerful, ancient eldwurm as well as the noble Princess Mirana on a secret mission of her own, Davion becomes embroiled in events much larger than he could have ever imagined.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oxUEsj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We're excited to announce a brand-new anime series exploring the Dota universe like never before. As fellow fans of Dota and its passionate global community, we look forward to sharing this new adventure with you when it premieres on Netflix March 25.&lt;a href="https://t.co/rHcL5QSi5b"&gt;https://t.co/rHcL5QSi5b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— DOTA 2 (@DOTA2) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DOTA2/status/1361829031755190276?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eoSesv"&gt;Animation for the show will be done by Studio MIR, which made &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Korra &lt;/em&gt;and Netflix’s&lt;em&gt; Voltron: Legendary Defender. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VbMw7N"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt; isn’t the only huge free-to-play MOBA getting its own TV show. Riot Games is working on an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20915338/league-of-legends-animated-series-fighting-game-cards-arcane-runeterra-project-l-trailers"&gt;animated series&lt;/a&gt; set in the &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; universe called &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt;. The show was delayed from its original 2020 release and is now scheduled to come out &lt;a href="https://eune.leagueoflegends.com/en-pl/news/dev/an-update-on-arcane/"&gt;sometime this year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google reportedly shut down its Stadia studios a week after praising them</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ryi4MrVaRwvqQP7egJLohX85B34=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68827472/akrales_191113_3779_0319.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a3HuTO"&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260803/google-stadia-game-development-studio-shut-down-jade-raymond"&gt;made the surprise announcement&lt;/a&gt; on February 1st that it would be shuttering its in-house Stadia game development studios. But the news wasn’t just a surprise to Stadia customers; it was a bolt from the blue for the Stadia development team, which, just a week prior, had been told that the studios were making “great progress,” &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/stadia-leadership-praised-development-studios-for-great-1846281384"&gt;according to a report from &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfllWt"&gt;“[Stadia Games and Entertainment] has made great progress building a diverse and talented team and establishing a strong lineup of Stadia exclusive games,” said Phil Harrison, a vice president at Google and general manager for Stadia, on January 27th in an email to staff obtained by &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;. The email promised more news on the Stadia studios’ strategy and goals for 2021. But instead of new development objectives, Harrison announced just days later on February 1st that the studios would be shutting down entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="VWonme"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google is shutting down its in-house Stadia game development studios","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260803/google-stadia-game-development-studio-shut-down-jade-raymond"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="GLGje6"&gt;The biggest question — both from outside observers and Stadia team members alike — is what changed. Harrison’s blog post announcing the shutdowns cites “exponentially” rising costs of “creating best-in-class games” as a factor, for example. But given Google’s $1.4 trillion market cap, it’s hard to imagine that as the sole reason for shutting down the company’s game development studios entirely, especially when they were given so little time to prove themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AVPzP7"&gt;In a Q&amp;amp;A with staff on February 4th, Harrison reportedly admitted that Google’s execs already knew the shutdown was coming when he sent the email praising the team’s progress. &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; also reports that Harrison variously cited Microsoft’s acquisition of Bethesda and the ongoing challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic as factors in the shutdown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p3tvWw"&gt;Whatever the case may be, one thing is clear: by shutting down its studios before they even managed to ship any major first-party exclusives for Stadia, Google has shown not only its staff but also the world that it isn’t as serious about its gaming initiatives as it once appeared. And ultimately, that’s a disappointing thing to see, both for Stadia’s future and for the industry at large. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft starts new program to help make more accessible games</title>

  &lt;p id="asQZMp"&gt;Microsoft is expanding its accessibility efforts with a new program for evaluating Xbox and PC games. Today, its gaming accessibility team announced that developers can send their games to be evaluated for accessibility and tested by players with disabilities. The program was announced alongside updates to the &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/accessibility/guidelines"&gt;Xbox Accessibility Guidelines&lt;/a&gt; that were released in early 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aGrOW2"&gt;“Developers now have the option to send Microsoft their Xbox or PC title and have it analyzed and validated against the recommendations provided in the XAGs,” says &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/02/16/xbox-accessibility-guidelines-and-testing/"&gt;an Xbox blog post&lt;/a&gt; published today. The Xbox Accessibility Guidelines include thorough explanations of inclusive design considerations for developers, and they are now updated to include clearer language, additional context, and implementation examples. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LaJuEW"&gt;Game test reports will include feedback from players with disabilities, as well as links to information on inclusive design, relevant nonprofits, and accessibility experts. Any issues found during testing will be “noted with reproduction steps, screenshots, and other information to help the developer understand what aspect of a given experience may be challenging for certain gamers with disabilities,” says the post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WtTlie"&gt;More companies have been focusing on game accessibility in recent years — including Microsoft with the &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/17/17363528/xbox-adaptive-controller-disability-accessible"&gt;Xbox Adaptive Controller&lt;/a&gt; — but there are still few high-profile examples &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21274923/the-last-of-us-part-2-accessibility-features-naughty-dog-interview-ps4"&gt;besides &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us Part II&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. A program like this could potentially lead to more games with a similarly wide variety of accessibility options. It’s also significant for players with disabilities to be able to provide insight, rather than being left unconsidered or designed for without their input. &lt;/p&gt;
