    <title>Samsung will now let you design your own Galaxy Z Flip 3</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WL7XQtHCaY8XIag1QldWSLZCWlg=/105x0:1151x697/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70020323/60aaea24_159d_4298_8796_f8918ffa9918.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Z Flip 3 Bespoke Edition.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="leuHcQ"&gt;Samsung released the Galaxy Z Flip 3 in August, but if none of the colorways were exactly what you wanted, the company will let you make your own design with the new Z Flip 3 Bespoke Edition. The new phone was announced at the company’s Unpacked Part 2 event on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2mkvx8"&gt;You won’t be able to customize the Bespoke Edition with &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; color you want, but Samsung is offering a lot of options. You’ll be able to choose a black or silver phone frame and front and back colors (aka the top and bottom, if the phone is open) of blue, yellow, pink, white, or black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3wNONt"&gt;If you get tired of your color combination, you’ll be able to make a slight change down the line by swapping out the colors on the back glass panel of the phone for a fee with the Bespoke Upgrade Care service. Samsung says the panel costs vary but start at $79, and that the service will be available starting in November. And no matter what, you’ll have to have some black on the phone because of the cover screen, so you might want to keep that in mind as you’re designing your color combo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s5ZiDL"&gt;We asked if Samsung might bring this level of customizability to future phones, and it sounds like that might be on the table, based on a statement from the company:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="9hTW4t"&gt;&lt;em&gt;For the past year, Samsung has committed to openness – a dedication to create technologies that help our users eliminate boundaries in their lives. We believe technology should reflect each customers’ individuality and Mobile devices are everyday technologies that users spend the most time with. We wanted customers to use them as self-expression tools in and out too. Starting with the Galaxy Z Flip3 Bespoke Edition, Samsung is expanding this initiative to other devices moving forward.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="3mZwVt"&gt;If you’re interested in a Z Flip 3 Bespoke Edition, you’ll be able to make one on Samsung’s website starting Wednesday. You’ll have to pay a premium for the customizability, though, because the Bespoke Edition costs $1,099, which is $100 more than the base model phone. And you won’t just be able to personalize the Z Flip 3; Samsung is also launching the Galaxy Watch 4 Bespoke Studio so you can tailor a Galaxy Watch 4 to your liking.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung is adding new watchfaces to the Galaxy Watch 4</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Galaxy Watch 4 Classic has a rotating bezel" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nYWLjXj7NPnrm4R7ygh4bfYfVeQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70020329/dbohn_210816_4717_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ytPdts"&gt;Samsung is bringing some new features to its Galaxy Watch 4 smartwatches in a new update, the company announced Wednesday. Perhaps the most significant change is four new watchfaces, which include a basic dashboard and a weather-focused one. You can see them in the GIF below from Samsung.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jBPuIzS9sL5zX6EvRcI9HdslxKk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22940537/Galaxy_Watch4_MR_Update_watch_face__1_.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="55t0o6"&gt;New faces aren’t the only updates headed to the new watches; you’ll also be able to use a “knock-knock” motion in the air to launch a preset app or feature. Fall detection has also been improved so that if you’re standing still and you fall, the watch will still detect it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IK0CnS"&gt;The update adding the new features will roll out starting Wednesday for Bluetooth versions of the Galaxy Watch 4 and Galaxy Watch 4 Classic, while the LTE versions will get it shortly after, Samsung says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3QfQDA"&gt;The company is also announcing designer versions of the Galaxy Watch 4 and its Galaxy Buds 2 made in collaboration with the brand Kitsuné. They come in a nice-looking taupe color, and like the company’s collaborations with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/10/21131178/thom-browne-galaxy-z-fashion-edition-foldable-handset"&gt;Thom Browne&lt;/a&gt;, the Kitsuné-branded devices have some special design touches that make them stand apart from the standard Watch 4 and Buds 2. You can see pictures of the new devices below from Samsung:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iE2GuIVhWx4tsGXmHkItbyTR3ho=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22940574/71bd0853_064f_4d38_84c6_be12c14e1ed4.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Watch 4 Maison Kitsuné Edition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UYWWwmtMrcu4YtmZn_QGhFo8Mx4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22940575/91454ca3_75ad_403d_a58b_3877c501a63b.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Buds 2 Maison Kitsuné Edition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7xhbQe"&gt;If you want to pick these up, though, you’ll want to act fast, as Samsung says there will only be a limited number of them available in select markets. The Galaxy Buds 2 Maison Kitsuné Edition will cost $249.99 (a $100 premium over the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22619796/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-features-price"&gt;standard Buds 2&lt;/a&gt;), while the Galaxy Watch 4 Maison Kitsuné Edition will come in a 40mm Bluetooth aluminum version for $399.99 (a $150 jump from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22629459/galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-bixby-google-wearos"&gt;base Watch 4&lt;/a&gt;). They’ll both be available for preorder starting Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alphabet’s Wing is bringing its drone delivery service to Dallas-Fort Worth</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9Pfwv_40ciq1Vor8dUghTcQgGgY=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70020368/Walgreens_Wing_07.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jiksKY"&gt;Drones will soon be buzzing overhead in Dallas-Fort Worth, bearing small containers filled with Tylenol and Band-Aids. Wing, a subsidiary of Google parent company Alphabet, is bringing its drone delivery service to the Texas city, its first densely populated market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dHUDSz"&gt;Wing is starting small, making deliveries from just one Walgreens to the city of Frisco and town of Little Elm. The company says it will be utilizing its new operational model, in which small shipping containers parked next to the store act as tiny hangers from which Wing’s drones will be deployed. Walgreens employees, rather than Wing technicians, will be trained in how to attach the packages to the company’s drones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HSQlTy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Drone deliveries were supposed to revolutionize the movement of goods around cities&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ET8sYm"&gt;Drone deliveries were supposed to revolutionize the movement of goods around cities, with companies like Amazon and Uber promising to set up large-scale operations in the near future. Instead, the technology has mainly focused on small scale experiments, delivering vaccines and blood to remote locations. In the US, drone delivery has generally been limited to smaller towns, where land usage is less crowded and complex. And some companies have faltered in their progress, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607267/amazon-drone-delivery-program-uk-operations-failure-oversell"&gt;Amazon’s program in the UK shedding dozens of employees&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GgFSA5"&gt;Wing has been able to rack up a series of minor successes, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22640833/drone-delivery-google-alphabet-wing-milestone"&gt;recently completing its 100,000th delivery&lt;/a&gt; while operating in three countries: the US, Finland, and Australia. Its biggest success has been in Logan, Australia: a suburb of Brisbane where more than 50,000 of its total deliveries have been carried out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kDk1AI"&gt;Wing aims to grow even faster with its launch in Dallas. In addition to the Walgreens, the company will set up a facility at Frisco Station, a mixed-use development and local tourism destination north of Dallas. That facility will have delivery capabilities and, according to Wing, “will initially be dedicated to exploring new use cases, community demonstrations, and public tours.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B5TmGl"&gt;Wing’s drones can operate as both fixed-wing aircraft and hovering copters. Unlike Amazon’s delivery drones, the aircraft also don’t need to land to drop off goods. Wing’s craft fly to their location, descend to a height of 23 feet (seven meters), and then lower their packages on a tether, automatically releasing them onto the ground. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to create virtual desktops with Windows 11</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HORorXqzioV4D6Ui-FBVeuQuIbc=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70020237/Screenshot__116___1_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UCnhDd"&gt;Virtual desktops aren’t new to Windows. In Windows 10, it was a simple matter to create a separate desktop so that, for example, you could have one desktop for one project and a second for another, or one for your work and a second for your personal apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GmrsgO"&gt;However, in Windows 11, there has been an upgrade. Now, you can also have a different wallpaper for each desktop, making it easier to distinguish one from another (and offering you a different mood, depending on what you’re using it for). And there are a number of other features that make the use of virtual desktops easy and efficient. Note that some of these were actually introduced in Windows 10, but together with the new features of Windows 11, they make a handy toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="v09Ap2"&gt;Create a virtual desktop&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oawJDM"&gt;To create a new virtual desktop:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="wWK5Ik"&gt;Hover over or click on the “Task view” icon in your taskbar (it’s the one that looks like one square superimposed on another). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uQmnvX"&gt;Click on the “New desktop” thumbnail. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="After clicking the “Task view” icon, you can create a new desktop." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QF1A_tbOXRlBj6oDCjvSbUHBWu8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22938619/Screenshot__105___1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;After clicking the “Task view” icon, you can create a new desktop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2ovPJn"&gt;You can also use key combination Win+Ctrl+D; in that case, you’ll immediately find yourself in your new desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z8dqoA"&gt;You can now place different apps in your separate desktops. Move from one desktop to the other by clicking the “Task view” icon. (You can also move around by using the familiar Alt-Tab key combination, which will take you to all the apps in one desktop and then to the apps in the next.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LItW9A"&gt;To remove a desktop: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="cixCDB"&gt;Hover over or click the “Task view”icon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JdTQMn"&gt;Hover over the virtual desktop you want to remove and click the “X” in the upper right corner. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SfObR9"&gt;Personalize your desktops&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xotocc"&gt;With Windows 11, you can now personalize your desktops, making it easier to dedicate each one to a separate function. There are several ways to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Ug8ojd"&gt;Choose different wallpaper&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="lAEJJe"&gt;You can have a different background for each virtual desktop. It’s quite simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="LM2NXt"&gt;Click on the “Task view” icon in the taskbar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XGhWmF"&gt;Right click on the desktop you want to change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="y3qpVl"&gt;Click on “Choose background.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="After clicking on the “Task view” icon in the taskbar, right click on a desktop thumbnail to change its background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qRBBNSKkf3XxPu_7UKEXv7TWVa0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22938633/Screenshot__108_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;After clicking on the “Task view” icon in the taskbar, right-click on a desktop thumbnail to change its background.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="szby5N"&gt;This will bring you to the Personalization &amp;gt; Background page, where you can choose either an image for your background, a solid color, or arrange for a slideshow. You can then browse your photos for your choice of image(s) to use and decide the type of fit you want for your image (for example, you can tile or stretch image).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Background page lets you use a pre-set background image or upload your own." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/760rV0a2BMw4V4-bKpejlo16vZA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22938631/Screenshot__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Background page lets you use a preset background image or upload your own.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YKoGj9"&gt;Name your desktop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="wibosP"&gt;Your desktops will be automatically assigned the rather boring titles of “Desktop 1,” “Desktop 2,” etc. You can change that easily by giving each desktop a name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="BEEgrS"&gt;Click on or hover over the “Task view” icon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JbSF0D"&gt;Click on the name of the desktop you want to change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="skrCeH"&gt;Type in the new name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="After selecting the “Task view” icon, you can change the name of your desktops." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m9hOQMmptVyXRkfpK8rdy2MacjY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22938625/Screenshot__112_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;After selecting the “Task view” icon, you can change the name of your desktops.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ZGyHNh"&gt;Rearrange your desktops&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="oIEtza"&gt;You may want to change the order of the desktops in order to make it easier to remember which to use when. This is also very simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="x1aDcF"&gt;Click on or hover over the “Task view” icon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mOkpDa"&gt;Click and hold on the desktop you want to move and drag it to its new position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Change the order of your desktops by using click-and-drag." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i08-iG0RmnnTnlFXmriTi648YY4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22938623/Screenshot__113_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Change the order of your desktops by using click-and-drag.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="UP7L61"&gt;Use the same app on different desktops&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="lb5d0F"&gt;If you are already using an app on one desktop and open it in another, you will be using a different version of that app — for example, you can use Chrome to look at Twitter on one desktop and to do some work research on another. (Be aware that some apps may not work this way yet — for example, when I tried to open Notion in a second desktop, my computer jumped to the desktop where it was already open.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h9Ukiv"&gt;While this is handy, you may want to run the same app with the same data in both — or all — of your desktops. (Note: this is not new to Windows 11, but it’s good to know.) To do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="V8vwhd"&gt;Click on the “Task view” icon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zI35Tk"&gt;Right-click on the app you want to use in the other desktop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YCvMtl"&gt;Select “Show this window on all desktops” if you want to duplicate a single window from that app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MRO07L"&gt;Select “Show windows from this app on all desktops” if you want to duplicate any window that you use in that app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Use “Show this window on all desktops” to use the same app and content in your other desktops." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/phm8_LA9zRZoyuU6WIdolBZt8Po=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22938621/Screenshot__115_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use “Show this window on all desktops” to use the same app and content in your other desktops.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5aoFYF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KsBl7L"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Typically $1,199, the retailer is offering the Wi-Fi-only version in space gray for $999 instead, which is an appealing price since it’s the current cost of the 128GB version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oWJfvT"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we praised the iPad Pro’s beautiful Mini LED screen, the fast M1 processor, and the Center Stage camera, which follows faces while you make video calls. The iPad also offers good dual rear cameras that are paired with lidar, excellent microphones, support for the second-gen Apple Pencil, and more. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZdRwfE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10474637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NOpvli"&gt;Android phone owners feeling left out while the tech world goes nuts over the latest AirPods 3, fear not: we’ve got something for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gC5zXR"&gt;Samsung’s entry-level wireless &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Wireless-Cancelling-Bluetooth-Lightweight/dp/B0942DM32W?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt; are the company’s smallest and lightest true wireless earbuds yet. Typically $150, right now Amazon is selling them for $130, the lowest price it’s offered on the well-reviewed earbuds yet. The discount applies to all styles, ranging from white and graphite to olive green. You can also add a Galaxy SmartTag, paying $155 in total instead of the $180 that it usually costs to buy both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SUZRFZ"&gt;We loved that it offers features like active noise cancellation, wireless charging, and a small, low-profile design with good audio quality and performance. It’s so good and affordable that, in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we predicted it would become the default pick for many Android users — especially when the sales start to hit, which it seems they are. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vXnixU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10815939"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jQ08n2"&gt;Razer’s Basilisk V2 wired gaming mouse is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse"&gt;one of the best mice you can buy&lt;/a&gt;. It’s already a good deal in and of itself, offering many of the features that comes with the more expensive Basilisk Ultimate, Razer’s wireless version, but for an affordable price. Today, however, it’s a better deal given you can get it for over half off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="irxDLw"&gt;Typically $80, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082G5BDNC/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfPnd39G8ta" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; are selling the mouse for $35 instead. For a nearly 60 percent discount, you can buy a mouse that offers a scroll wheel with adjustable tension, tactile buttons, a thin SpeedFlex cable, customizable LEDs, and fast performance. What’s more, Best Buy is also throwing in $10 off a three-month digital subscription to Xbox Game Pass for PC when you buy it there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="s8e5U1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10221776"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bxVsxx"&gt;You can currently grab a pair of the Jabra Elite 75t earbuds for just $80 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-75t-Earbuds-Comfortable/dp/B07X9VG6ZJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfDfEmv2ecW#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Jabra has since released an updated version of these earbuds, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22676362/jabra-elite-3-wireless-earbuds-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Jabra Elite 3&lt;/a&gt;, but we still consider the 75t to be a decent alternative to the AirPods, thanks to their solid sound quality and comfortable design. These earbuds come in black or gray and can last a little over five hours on a single charge. The on-ear mics can be used for calls, as well as for summoning Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant — and you can connect them to two devices at once, an unusual feature for this price. The matte-finished case can hold an extra 18 hours of juice and can be topped off via USB-C. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21066947/jabra-elite-75t-review-wireless-earbuds-airpods-alternative" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HYXLcL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386608"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5SPZ8U"&gt;Another fine deal is on a curved gaming monitor, this time for the lowest price ever. You can currently &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfO4JTzLnAq#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;save $150 on the Samsung CRG5 curved gaming monitor at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Normally $399.99, it costs $249.99. The CRG5 has a 27-inch 1080p panel with a 240Hz refresh rate and Nvidia G-Sync compatibility, both of which should provide stellar performance in the gaming space that's tough to match at this price. The monitor has HDMI and DisplayPort outputs, but it lacks support for peripheral USB connectivity. Another small pain point is the stand, which has limited adjustment options. Though the CRG5 does have a built-in 75 x 75 VESA mount if you need to make the panel more suitable for your desk setup.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="P0C0fE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10816293"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5wi7Os"&gt;Dell’s Alienware lineup may have greater curb appeal, but the Dell G15 brings similar performance, just without the extraterrestrial aesthetic. Right now, you can &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfO4Uf74Sb2#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;save $270 on this excellent gaming laptop at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. It costs $880 instead of its usual $1,150 price. This 15-inch laptop manages to pack in a Ryzen 7 5800H CPU, an Nvidia RTX 3050 Ti, and a 512GB SSD. These specs should provide excellent performance for the 1080p high-refresh panel on the G15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SQrNyL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10816306"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="ieW5Na"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Best Gaming Laptop in 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="cnKbBq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;is turning 10, and you’re invited to the party taking place in New York City on the 22nd and 23rd of October (that’s this weekend!). On The Verge is going to be a celebration of everything we’ve accomplished over the past decade, and we want you to be a part of it. Right now you can &lt;a href="https://voxmediaevents.com/ontheverge/evite" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;snag tickets for just $99 with the &lt;strong&gt;promo code $99NOW&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which gets you admission for both days and four complimentary drink tickets. The event will include speakers from &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;and from the wider world of tech, as well as musical performances and interactive experiences. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>No Man’s Sky’s newest expedition adventure features lots of worms</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/To8gI2EdAXTqBU7TdK1Ln2XsAcg=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70020006/No_Man_s_Sky_Emergence_Expedition_Screen_1.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1jC5Er"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Man’s Sky&lt;/em&gt; is getting its fourth seasonal update with a new expedition called &lt;em&gt;Emergence&lt;/em&gt;. Just in time for spooky season (and, coincidentally, the theatrical release of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22587655/dune-new-trailer-hbo-max-warner-bros-sandworm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;em&gt;Emergence&lt;/em&gt; focuses on discovering, taming, and battling giant sandworms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Umfd7r"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Yrn2qEAGDM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8ldX1c"&gt;The trailer for &lt;em&gt;Emergence&lt;/em&gt; features some of the wormy updates coming to &lt;em&gt;No Man’s Sky&lt;/em&gt;. Existing sandworms will come in more varieties, players can obtain a grotesque Sarlacc pit-looking helmet, and, perhaps most importantly, players will be able to tame and ride giant &lt;em&gt;flying&lt;/em&gt; sandworms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xFUkIR"&gt;Since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22358926/no-mans-sky-expeditions-update-hello-games"&gt;expeditions launched in March&lt;/a&gt; of this year, Hello Games says &lt;em&gt;Emergence&lt;/em&gt; is the first one to feature a dedicated narrative. Starting on the sand-blighted planet of Wasan, explorers will unravel the mysteries of an ancient cult as they unlock milestones, complete expedition phases, and hunt the dreaded titan worms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3cwwBh"&gt;Expeditions began as a way of introducing timed, seasonal content to &lt;em&gt;No Man’s Sky&lt;/em&gt;. There have been three expeditions this year, with each &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22446499/no-mans-sky-mass-effect-normandy-starship"&gt;offering exclusive rewards&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;No Man’s Sky&lt;/em&gt; has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21450919/hello-games-no-mans-sky-next-game-sean-murray-interview"&gt;undergone a radical transformation&lt;/a&gt; since its launch five years ago. Players can experience the space exploration game on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21537078/no-mans-sky-next-generation-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-announcement"&gt;next-gen consoles&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/2/18285578/no-mans-sky-vr-preview-sean-murray-interview"&gt;and in VR&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qjVxjZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="KpDUs7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Resident Evil 4 in VR shouldn’t work — but somehow it does</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Resident Evil 4 VR - El Gigante fight" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fufXH2gF1v9RNBLEE14w4DOr8OI=/314x0:2474x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70019560/RE4_SCREENSHOTS_ELGIGANTE_TMP_007_2560X1440_LEGAL.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Oculus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ykKZdo"&gt;I didn’t have stellar hopes going into &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt;’s virtual reality adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XV2OI2"&gt;VR versions of non-VR games are often at best superfluous and at worst painful — sometimes literally if you’re prone to motion sickness. &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 7&lt;/em&gt; supported VR &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/24/14369624/resident-evil-7-ps4-playstation-vr"&gt;to questionable effect&lt;/a&gt; in 2017. And &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt; in VR, an Oculus Quest 2 version of Capcom’s 2005 GameCube game, makes a lot of tradeoffs that sound compromising on paper. But the weirdest part by far? It mostly works. &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt;’s VR version retools a horror classic with VR combat satisfying enough to make up for its myriad rough edges, producing something surprisingly fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bW7kFJ"&gt;Unlike Capcom’s recent &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;3 &lt;/em&gt;console remakes, which were heavily reimagined versions of their source material, &lt;em&gt;RE4VR&lt;/em&gt; (technically simply named &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt;) is a nearly beat-for-beat copy of the original’s narrative, enemy encounters, and level layout. It’s got crisper textures and spatial audio upgrades, but if you’ve seen the game’s high-definition rerelease or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22309983/resident-evil-4-hd-project-remake-remaster-mod-pc-textures-graphics"&gt;even more HD fan-made remaster&lt;/a&gt;, it’s not an extraordinary graphical overhaul. Instead, port developer Armature Studio has focused on translating a third-person console shooter into a first-person headset-based game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="A2bWaL"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qTIizcuSdHg?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HCyiCJ"&gt;More accurately, Armature is translating &lt;em&gt;part&lt;/em&gt; of the game. The bulk of &lt;em&gt;RE4VR&lt;/em&gt;’s gameplay turns your over-the-shoulder view of protagonist Leon Kennedy into a first-person experience with a pair of disembodied hands — wearing Leon’s trademark fingerless gloves, of course. The game’s heads-up display is a wristwatch with details like your health and ammo count, and the inventory menu is lightly revamped with a more 3D look. If you’ve played a single-player VR shooter like &lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;Arizona Sunshine&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;you’ll probably find this mode familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aafxLf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Resident Evil 4’s design puts the most promising elements into VR and cordons off the rest&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TqD8wt"&gt;But &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt; hasn’t been totally VR-ified. During cutscenes, the game throws you — virtual hands and all — into a black void to watch the action on a flat screen. (You know those dreams where you’re watching a person from the outside, but you also &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; that person? It’s sort of like that.) Many of these scenes originally had quicktime events that involved pressing buttons, and in &lt;em&gt;RE4VR&lt;/em&gt; you’ll see a flat overlay telling you to shake your controllers or pull the triggers at those moments. Outside of cutscenes, kicking an enemy or pushing an object will also briefly shift your viewpoint to a third-person camera so you can see what Leon is doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gXW4rH"&gt;The clunky mix of formats feels almost retro, but I think it’s the right choice. Armature effectively cordons off the parts of &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt; that would be least compelling as first-person motion-controlled experiences, then puts its efforts toward building a VR shooting experience that’s smoother than many native VR shooters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s8c8r5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;RE4VR&lt;/em&gt;’s combat is tactile and satisfying without being punishingly difficult or complicated. It uses the original’s familiar outlay of handguns, long guns, and a knife for close-range fighting. But in addition to selecting them from your inventory, you can map individual weapons onto different parts of your body, grabbing a chosen rifle or shotgun by reaching behind your back or a pistol by reaching to your side. You can also dual-wield weapons — which usually isn’t productive but enables specific scenarios like shooting your pistol at a zombie on your left while knifing one off a ladder to your right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0xTPDJ"&gt;The system is natural and makes swapping between weapons — and assembling the right loadout — an integral part of fights. Physically slashing at boxes or zombies feels exactly right. The game ramps up tension by making you grab ammunition and feed it into guns, lending more interactivity to &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt;’s delightful &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2XEyUJL5u4"&gt;reloading animations&lt;/a&gt;. What’s more, &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt;’s original levels are compact and don’t come off as designed for traversing at inhuman speeds, a common hazard for VR versions of non-VR games. &lt;em&gt;RE4VR &lt;/em&gt;lets you pick between teleporting around and using an analog stick for free motion, but I much preferred the former — which more closely mimics the original’s cadence of running, stopping, and shooting zombies while stationary.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot of the Del Lago boss fight from Resident Evil 4 in VR" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V9bB1AmJFzqdNc1amWlyNugA9uc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22939926/RE4_SCREENSHOTS_DELLAGO_001_Legal.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6PkEo7"&gt;Armature’s careful design and the game’s source material set &lt;em&gt;RE4VR&lt;/em&gt; apart from the &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 7 &lt;/em&gt;VR mode. &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt; was already at the more action-oriented end of the franchise, and &lt;em&gt;RE4VR&lt;/em&gt; adapts it to fit an established VR shooter formula instead of going for a grueling survival horror experience, which makes the game’s dozen-plus hours a lot less stressful. (I played the game’s HD version on PlayStation 4 a few months before this review, and I’m pretty sure this iteration is also far more generous with item and money drops.) It’s based on a substantially older game that the Oculus Quest 2 seems totally capable of rendering, while the PlayStation VR’s low resolution and muddy screen hamstrung &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 7&lt;/em&gt;’s VR mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2cICep"&gt;Most importantly, &lt;em&gt;RE4VR&lt;/em&gt; is promising a genuinely different experience — not just a VR retread of the same systems. It’s not a replacement for the flatscreen original, and if you’re &lt;em&gt;absolutely&lt;/em&gt; a purist, the developers have removed a few (honestly cringeworthy and missable) lines from the cutscenes. If anything, it’s the kind of thing that’s great to play after you’ve worked through the game’s puzzles and boss strategies outside VR, so you can focus on the new elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rupSPl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s an effective VR shooter, if not a revolutionary one&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nMVMKi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;RE4VR&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t revolutionize VR shooters the way &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt; transformed console games. There’s nothing as distinctive as &lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt;’s gravity gloves, &lt;em&gt;Phantom: Covert Ops&lt;/em&gt;’&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;kayak combat, or the obsessive gunophilia of &lt;em&gt;Hot Dogs, Horseshoes &amp;amp; Hand Grenades&lt;/em&gt;. Features like firearm reloading, which can confer a sense of mastery in games like &lt;em&gt;Alyx&lt;/em&gt;, are more like additional flavor than complex mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VQx3iE"&gt;There are a few minor but legitimate misfires. A couple of the game’s already frustrating scripted sections, including its very last scene, become even less fun with motion controls that aren’t quite as intuitive as you’d hope. Miming the use of two-handed guns is a little bit awkward. In a more literal example, you can accidentally pull grenade pins while trying to put the grenades in your inventory, a fact I learned repeatedly the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="twZwto"&gt;Moments like these remind you that VR’s conventions are still in flux, and the fluidity of motion controls can also make them seem unreliable. But those exceptions notwithstanding, the game feels undeniably good. &lt;em&gt;RE4VR&lt;/em&gt; is a new twist on the bizarre and atmospheric world of &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt; and a solid addition to the still comparatively short list of robust headset-based shooters, as well as evidence that a VR adaptation doesn’t have to be seamless — it just has to find a core element that really works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eH2CQ4"&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;em&gt; for VR will be released October 21st exclusively for Oculus Quest 2. The game includes the &lt;/em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;em&gt; story mode; it does not include the &lt;/em&gt;Separate Ways&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; Assignment Ada&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;or &lt;/em&gt;Mercenaries &lt;em&gt;add-ons.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Brave browser replaces Google with its own search engine</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t5nq2mDdz775UnPGUvQGALJAMkw=/0x0:1244x829/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70019452/image2_1_980x829.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brave Search launched in beta earlier this year.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Brave&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XFlq9C"&gt;Brave, the privacy-focused browser that blocks third-party ads and trackers by default, is switching to using its own search engine by default, &lt;a href="https://brave.com/search-and-web-discovery/"&gt;the company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. The change will be applied for new users, and will affect which search engine is used via the browser’s address bar. Brave Search will replace Google in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada, Qwant in France, and DuckDuckGo in Germany. More countries will be switched over in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mG9AvH"&gt;It’s a significant step for Brave’s fledgling search engine, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547158/brave-search-beta-browser-private-independent-index"&gt;launched in public beta&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, since most people just take what they’re given. The search engine set as the browser default is a valuable promotion tactic, and so important that the practice has become a significant focus of antitrust scrutiny. In Europe, Google now offers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525688/google-europe-android-search-provider-selection-choice-screen-pay-to-play-auction"&gt;a choice of search engines&lt;/a&gt; for Android users after it was fined &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/18/17580694/google-android-eu-fine-antitrust"&gt;$5 billion by EU regulators&lt;/a&gt; for, among other things, illegally tying Google search to Android. Over the years, Google has also paid companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21310591/apple-google-search-engine-safari-iphone-deal-billions-regulation-antitrust"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/15/21370020/mozilla-google-firefox-search-engine-browser"&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; to be the default search engine in their browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lwI2wT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“As we know from experience in many browsers, the default setting is crucial for adoption”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IYBvni"&gt;“As we know from experience in many browsers, the default setting is crucial for adoption, and Brave Search has reached the quality and critical mass needed to become our default search option, and to offer our users a seamless privacy-by-default online experience,” Brave’s co-founder and CEO Brendan Eich said in a statement. He added that its search engine now handles “nearly 80 million queries per month.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mkCwnt"&gt;Although the switch will boost Brave Search’s prominence with Brave users, the browser’s marketshare is so small that it doesn’t even register against established competitors like Chrome, Safari, Edge, and Opera, according to &lt;a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share#monthly-202105-202105-bar"&gt;data from StatCounter&lt;/a&gt;. Nevertheless, as of September 2021, &lt;a href="https://brave.com/transparency/"&gt;Brave claims&lt;/a&gt; that its browser had almost 40 million monthly active users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eNOxJT"&gt;As well as boosting the prominence of Brave’s search engine, the move is a sign of its confidence in the new privacy-focused service. Brave Search is notable for being built on Brave’s own independent index of the web, whereas many competitors rely on a mix of results from larger indexes like Microsoft’s Bing (although Brave has said it will pull in results from other providers where it can’t produce enough of its own). The company says its search engine does not track “users, their searches, or their clicks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KFzJ21"&gt;Alongside the change in default search engine, Brave is also launching a new opt-in system for users to contribute their data and help improve its search results. Brave claims its Web Discovery Project collects search and browsing data in a way that can’t be linked to individual users, and that cannot be sold to advertisers or handed over to the authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XkUHQ0"&gt;Brave Search is currently free to use and does not show any ads, but the company says that it plans to roll out ads in its free version in the future, as well as launch an ad-free premium service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1P62nz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How NFTs are creating a generational divide between platforms  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lbyBZicF2WurRzWSfUKeTjt3YFA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70019384/acastro_210319_1777_nft_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RrQZNW"&gt;Today, let’s talk about a fault line that’s beginning to open up in the gaming world, one I suspect will soon be coming to most platforms and app stores. It’s a divide that begins with a simple question: will your platform allow NFTs? Crypto payments? You know … &lt;em&gt;blockchain stuff&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldZEbU"&gt;Like it or not, the rise of non-fungible tokens as an engine for fun and profit has been one of the tech world’s big stories in 2021. Using &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22654785/blockchain-explained-cryptocurrency-what-is-stake-nft"&gt;the blockchain&lt;/a&gt; to create unique digital objects with verifiable, transferrable ownership has opened up new possibilities in art, digital trading cards, and gaming. At least for the moment, it seems likely that other forms of media will follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n6IMGp"&gt;Recently I’ve written about ways in which NFTs are challenging the current generation’s assumptions about gaming: building a game from the bottom up rather than the top down, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22655077/loot-social-network-open-source-nft"&gt;as the Loot project is doing&lt;/a&gt;; or enabling players to make money directly from their gameplay, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22725083/axie-infinity-sky-mavis-blockchain-economy-game-pokemon"&gt;as Axie Infinity is&lt;/a&gt;. Aleksander Larsen, chief operating officer of Axie’s parent company, told me that he hopes the game will come to mobile app stores, including Apple’s, within the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wMGAWb"&gt;But on Friday, it became clear that such games won’t be welcome everywhere. Here’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728425/valve-steam-blockchain-nft-crypto-ban-games-age-of-rust"&gt;Mitchell Clark here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Wljyvf"&gt;Games that use blockchain technology or let users exchange NFTs or cryptocurrencies won’t be allowed on Steam, according to a rule added to &lt;a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding"&gt;Valve’s “What you shouldn’t publish on Steam” list&lt;/a&gt;. The change &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpacePirate_io/status/1448713803680473089"&gt;was pointed out by SpacePirate&lt;/a&gt;, a developer working on an NFT-based game, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpacePirate_io/status/1448713807312801796?s=20"&gt;who said&lt;/a&gt; that the change was because the company doesn’t allow game items that could have real-world value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="qKCfIF"&gt;Steam, if you’re not familiar, is the largest distributor of PC gaming software in the world. With &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-01-14-steam-has-over-120m-monthly-active-users"&gt;more than 120 million monthly users&lt;/a&gt;, it’s the default place for most PC gamers to buy digital downloads. And last week, as some blockchain-based games had begun to appear on the platform, Steam pulled out the rug from underneath them. Parent company Valve has yet to make a comment beyond its update to the Steam rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HI1me2"&gt;The developer of &lt;em&gt;Age of Rust&lt;/em&gt;, a forthcoming adventure game that will award NFTs to players who solve puzzles, was among those whose titles were removed from the platform. The developer, SpacePirate Games, lamented the move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fi6Zuu"&gt;“Steam’s point of view is that items have value and they don’t allow items that can have real-world value on their platform,” the game’s official account &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpacePirate_io/status/1448713805723099137?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1448713807312801796%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F15%2F22728425%2Fvalve-steam-blockchain-nft-crypto-ban-games-age-of-rust"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. “While I respect their choice, I fundamentally believe that NFTs and blockchain games are the future. It’s why I started this journey with all of you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vEOGEW"&gt;But when one app store door closes, another opens. The Epic Games Store, a Steam rival that the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; maker introduced in 2018, quickly said that it is “open” to considering NFT-based games. Here’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22729050/epic-game-store-open-to-blockchain-cryptocurrency-nft-games"&gt;Clark again&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="CfWzy8"&gt;When we asked about allowing games that featured NFTs, Epic told us there’d be some limitations, but that it’s willing to work with “early developers” in the “new field.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uHGuVM"&gt;Epic says that the games would have to comply with financial laws, make it clear how the blockchain is used, and have appropriate age ratings. It also says that developers won’t be able to use Epic’s payment service to accept crypto; they would have to use their own payment systems instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="53fGLF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="laAM25"&gt;Among the reasons this came as a surprise is that just weeks earlier, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney had seemed to wash his hands of the blockchain altogether. “We aren’t touching NFTs,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1442519522875949061"&gt;he tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, “as the whole field is currently tangled up with an intractable mix of scams, interesting decentralized tech foundations, and scams.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ao6tU5"&gt;Sweeney is well within the mainstream of tech commentary when he worries that NFTs are scammy. When I wrote about &lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt; last week, a lot of you shared similar sentiments with me in the &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/announcing-sidechannel-a-new-community"&gt;Sidechannel Discord server&lt;/a&gt; and in your email replies. Aren’t these NFT projects fundamentally pyramid schemes, you wondered; Why does any of this have to be on the blockchain at all? There are other ways to represent digital scarcity beyond the blockchain, you told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iAqySP"&gt;In any case, grinding for several hours a day to make money playing a &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; clone hardly sounds like most people’s idea of a good time. If it’s a full-time job, can you really even call it a game?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="geyIdM"&gt;Despite those objections, though, the development continues. Each day brings with it a fresh round of funding announcements for blockchain-based projects, with hundreds of millions of dollars being allocated into crypto-focused startups and VC funds. Games, which have proven to be one of the first crypto projects to attract a user base that does something other than trade money back and forth, often figure significantly in those fundraising announcements. (Here’s $4.6 million for &lt;a href="https://medium.com/yield-guild-games/ygg-raises-4-6m-from-a16z-to-accelerate-play-to-earn-gaming-7f5cbccce657"&gt;a company that rents &lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt; monsters to players in exchange for a slice of their income&lt;/a&gt;, for example.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HWfXJh"&gt;All of which is soon going to put platforms into the same position that Steam found itself in. Do we let these things into the store or not? The easy thing to do is to say “no” — but doing so creates an opportunity for anyone willing to say yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KALzk9"&gt;To be sure, the sale of in-game items has a checkered history. Blizzard’s popular dungeon crawler &lt;em&gt;Diablo III&lt;/em&gt; set up an official in-game auction house a decade ago to let players sell rare swords, armor, and other goods that they had earned in virtual battle. These items weren’t unique in the way NFTs are, but they were rare and had real-world value. Unfortunately, though, Blizzard found that its auction house broke the game entirely: all of a sudden, people could simply pay to win it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5YG9TG"&gt;Here’s &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/09/diablo-auction-house/"&gt;Bo Moore writing in &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; in 2013, when the auction house was shuttered&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="zRO779"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t have more dungeons, more bosses, etc. Players just play the same procession of levels on harder and harder difficulty levels, picking up better and better loot. In other words, the loot isn’t just a helping hand towards their ultimate goal – better loot &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the ultimate goal. And with the auction house, players found that the best way to obtain it was to just buy it. […]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PJvGPu"&gt;And the next thing you know, they’re not playing the game anymore. Why would they, when the reward structure that would otherwise motivate them to play was no longer there? Without the promise of better stuff, &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt; was all stick and no carrot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="k6XffQ"&gt;Games that develop this “pay to win” dynamic are among the most-loathed titles around — but they are &lt;a href="https://fictionhorizon.com/best-pay-to-win-games/"&gt;very much around&lt;/a&gt;. Games that offer free downloads, as many mobile games do, often allow players to pay to gain advantages over their freeloading rivals, even as it worsens the experience for most of the user base. More respectable games, like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, sell only cosmetic items. But the pay-to-win economy is real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R7tPv7"&gt;Of course, there’s no reason that in-game NFTs bought from third parties have to give players advantages in gameplay. A unique &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; skin created by a popular artist might have value to both the person who sold it and the person who bought it, and the balance of gameplay wouldn’t change at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="98piSU"&gt;But even for platforms inclined to support blockchain integrations, there remain a number of hurdles to clear on the policy and user experience side. How and where does the buying and selling take place? Does the platform get a cut of the sale? And if NFTs do affect how the game is played, rather than simply how it looks, how does the developer ensure the game is balanced and accessible to a large number of players?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Kjp5Jj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Platforms will be faced with a choice&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UcoQSg"&gt;The questions are coming to gaming first, but it’s easy to imagine them cropping up elsewhere in the new economy. And when they do, platforms will be faced with a choice: shut it all down, as Steam did, and bet that the whole crypto craze will some day fall into the ocean; or be curious about it, the way Epic is, and see if there’s a way to channel all this developer enthusiasm into something creative and profitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mex7uP"&gt;It’s worth noting that most big believers in the tech world’s &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; big prediction about the future this year — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701104/metaverse-explained-fortnite-roblox-facebook-horizon"&gt;the metaverse&lt;/a&gt; — come down firmly on the side of NFT integration. Mark Zuckerberg described for Facebook employees this summer a world in which people would one day rent NFT art as decorations for parties in virtual reality. The idea of unique NFT skins that people can dress up their avatars in, and take from place to virtual place, is foundational to the metaverse as futurists most often describe it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="adcdTS"&gt;Maybe that will all fall into the ocean, too. But one way or another, I think digital scarcity is coming to platforms. And when it does, they’ll have a lot of re-thinking to do. For now, Valve loses nothing by leaving NFTs behind. But there may come a day soon when it’s companies like Valve getting left behind, and developers like SpacePirate laughing all the way to the bank. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix boss says he “screwed up” over Chappelle special fallout</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pBxNE5fsWQNw8aJuMe2O8JuGU3o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70018988/acastro_181101_1777_netflix_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fMxCI1"&gt;Mere hours before a planned walkout from Netflix’s trans and allied workers over comments made by Dave Chappelle in a recent special, co-CEO Ted Sarandos has said he “screwed up” over his response to employees over outrage from within the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ryo4xU"&gt;Chappelle’s special &lt;em&gt;The Closer&lt;/em&gt; debuted on the streaming service earlier this month and immediately came under fire from members and allies of the LGBTQ+ community as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22720724/netflix-suspends-trans-employee-tweeted-dave-chappelle-the-closer"&gt;Netflix employees&lt;/a&gt; who criticized the special as being transphobic. Sarandos, for his part, has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22720724/netflix-suspends-trans-employee-tweeted-dave-chappelle-the-closer"&gt;stood by the special&lt;/a&gt;, telling employees that Netflix doesn’t allow titles on its service “that are designed to incite hate or violence, and we don’t believe &lt;em&gt;The Closer&lt;/em&gt; crosses that line.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8JERKz"&gt;In an interview with &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/dave-chappelle-netflix-ted-sarandos-i-screwed-up-1235093098/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published on the eve of the planned walkout, the Netflix executive says he “should have led with a lot more humanity” in his internal responses to his employees, though he continues to defend the special on the grounds of “creative freedom and artistic expression.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RhvFi3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I should have led with a lot more humanity.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0NuYa5"&gt;“Meaning, I had a group of employees who were definitely feeling pain and hurt from a decision we made. And I think that needs to be acknowledged up front before you get into the nuts and bolts of anything,” Sarandos tells the publication. “I didn’t do that. That was uncharacteristic for me, and it was moving fast and we were trying to answer some really specific questions that were floating. We landed with some things that were much more blanket and matter-of-fact that are not at all accurate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XvzbKQ"&gt;When asked to define how Netflix defines hate speech, Sarandos said that the company draws the line “on something that would intentionally call for physically harming other people or even remove protections. For me, intent to cause physical harm crosses the line, for sure.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WgW4qh"&gt;Separately, Sarandos spoke with &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/netflix-ted-sarandos-dave-chappelle-walkout-1235033910/?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — also for an interview published late Tuesday ahead of the planned walkout. As he did in his interview with &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;, Sarandos makes it clear that he stands by the special but characterizes his response to criticism of &lt;em&gt;The Closer&lt;/em&gt; as a “just very clumsy, internal communications that went public.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2EoE9"&gt;In both interviews, Sarandos says he’s been meeting with Netflix employees about their position on the special. But he reiterates repeatedly in both that the company heavily values what he characterized as “artistic expression” and adds that Netflix would continue to stand by that position as part of its ethos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDGwTh"&gt;Sarandos spoke with other publications as well, including &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/10/netflix-ted-sarandos-speaks-up-dave-chapplle-the-closer-controversy-interview-1234858762/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/netflix-co-ceo-says-he-screwed-up-when-defending-dave-chappelle-special-11634696007"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. His comments remain, by and large, the same in all of his quoted conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
