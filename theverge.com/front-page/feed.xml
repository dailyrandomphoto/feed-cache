    <title>Welcome to Infrastructure Week</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LK0waq"&gt;For years, “infrastructure week” was a kind of running joke in Washington — a stand-in for all of the boring but popular rebuilding work that could happen if Donald Trump ever decided to get serious. Under Joe Biden, this idea has become something more tangible: the trillion-dollar American Jobs Plan, which lays out investments in everything from bridges to broadband.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oMdP0L"&gt;But while Congress grinds away on the details, we still want to think bigger. The pandemic showed just how shaky America’s foundation really is, whether it’s having enough hospital beds to survive a pandemic or having a connection fast enough to support a Zoom call. Fixing our infrastructure means looking at all of that — even the stuff like power grids and credit systems that only get noticed when they break. It also means building out infrastructure for the next generation of technology, whether it’s satellite internet uplinks or a nationwide EV charging network. If we’re going to live in the future, we need to take a close look at the infrastructure we’ll need to get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jTys0C"&gt;So starting today, we’re doing just that. All week, we’ll be running down the hidden structures that make our world work — in interviews, on video, and even in a live event focusing on how we can build a better internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xzvizH"&gt;Welcome to Infrastructure Week. It’s been a long time coming.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Venom cooks human food but not humans in first Let There Be Carnage trailer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kNUcJ3Ni_aKxpnFxuW2KB4y_KEc=/91x0:900x539/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69262691/Screen_Shot_2021_05_10_at_9.27.43_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yAJAHo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Venom: Let There Be Carnage, &lt;/em&gt;the extremely on-the-nose &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/2/17929154/venom-movie-review-tom-hardy-marvel"&gt;sequel to 2018’s &lt;em&gt;Venom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, has gotten its first trailer ahead of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/24/21235283/spider-man-spiderverse-homecoming-delay-release-date-trilogy-marvel-venom-doctor-strange-thor"&gt;pandemic-delayed&lt;/a&gt; September 24th release date. It promises more of the peculiar buddy cop comedy and Tom Hardy’s over-the-top acting that made the original a surprisingly fun watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PzC9fa"&gt;Picking up after the last movie, the trailer shows that Eddie Brock and the Venom symbiote have achieved a sort of domestic peace: a “no eating people” sign is tacked up on the wall of Brock’s apartment, and Venom helps Eddie make breakfast in what might be the worst &lt;em&gt;Ratatouille&lt;/em&gt; impression of all time. He’s trying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="J8viW4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“No eating people”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nkPRyF"&gt;Things shift focus to Cletus Kasady, a murderous serial killer (Woody Harrelson, doing his best &lt;em&gt;Dark Knight&lt;/em&gt; Joker impression) who gets a hold of his own symbiote, the titular Carnage, setting up the movie’s headline brawl. (Presumably, the film will have some sort of explanation for why on earth Kasady is being selected, of all people, to be the test subject for an incredibly powerful alien symbiote.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CcH4qb"&gt;Despite the almost-exclusive focus on Spider-Man villains in the trailer, there’s still no sign of the heroic web-slinger himself (whether played by Tom Holland, Andrew Garfield, Tobey Maguire, or any of the &lt;em&gt;Spider-Verse&lt;/em&gt; crew). That’s presumably due to the intricate corporate negotiations around the character’s appearance in Disney’s Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. (&lt;em&gt;Venom&lt;/em&gt; and its sequel are made by Sony, not Kevin Feige’s Marvel Studios, which produces the Holland &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; films and almost every other major live-action Marvel film these days.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hb6hhu"&gt;Also of note: the trailer prominently focuses on the fact that &lt;em&gt;Venom: Let There Be Carnage&lt;/em&gt; will debut exclusively in theaters. With vaccines rolling out and theaters starting to reopen, it seems that Sony is betting heavily on the fact that crowds will be ready to come out in person to see the movie on September 24th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer PC gaming gear is up to 25 percent off at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Naga Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AoxU5_UzB4Pnt3x3uj-lfmOTGo0=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69262528/nagaprohero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FdV2GA"&gt;Best Buy has an attractive deal on Razer gaming gear, including headsets, keyboards, mice, and mouse pads. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740160956824871654#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;If you buy any two listed on the site&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll get 20 percent off the total at checkout. But if you get three, you’ll get 25 percent off the total. This deal seems especially great if you just got a gaming PC and are looking to get set up with all of the peripherals you need. For around $50, you can get the BlackShark V2 wired headset, the excellent Viper ambidextrous mouse, or the DeathAdder V2 wired gaming mouse. Near the $100 level, you’ll be opened up to deals on wireless gaming mice, keyboards, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="8KFhLo"&gt;
&lt;p id="gMMfWX"&gt;Digital storefront Eneba is selling copies of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22420738/resident-evil-village-review-playstation-xbox-pc" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for PC (redeemable on Steam) &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fsteam-resident-evil-village-resident-evil-8-steam-key-global%2Fgames-federation&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F5%2F10%2F22428452%2Frazer-pc-gaming-sale-mouse-keyboard-headset-re-village-apple-watch-deal" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for around $43&lt;/a&gt; when you use the offer code &lt;strong&gt;REVILLAGE &lt;/strong&gt;(per &lt;a href="https://slickdeals.net/f/15014047-resident-evil-village-pc-digital-download-code-45-45?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+SlickdealsnetFP+%28Slickdeals+Frontpage%29" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slickdeals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). This game just came out last week, and it regularly costs $60 for a new copy. &lt;em&gt;Slickdeals&lt;/em&gt;’ page says this deal has expired, but the offer code still worked at the time of publishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gyY2df"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10492101"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lVH1SD"&gt;I’m resurfacing a good deal from last week on the Apple Watch SE that’s still happening at B&amp;amp;H Photo. You can get the Nike edition of the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1594568-REG%2Fapple_myyu2ll_a_watch_nike_se_gps.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F5%2F10%2F22428452%2Frazer-pc-gaming-sale-mouse-keyboard-headset-re-village-apple-watch-deal" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;40mm Watch with GPS and LTE connectivity for $289&lt;/a&gt;. This configuration usually costs $329, so you’re getting a decent discount. Considering this is just $10 more than the GPS model, it’s a no-brainer of an upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dd4m7o"&gt;Even as the Series 6 drops in price (we saw the all-red 40mm GPS model selling for $250 a few weeks ago), this is still a good deal because of the cellular connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="u8ZbMf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="imZZYO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="dZGQoR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This is a map of America’s broadband problem</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U-onBBskQ7SSnKRxp_fysZIUroo=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69262492/VRG_ILLO_4550_002.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A county-by-county look at the broadband gap&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="Q3Dxlz"&gt;&lt;div class="vrg-map" style="max-width:1100px;padding:0 16px;margin:0 auto;}"&gt;
&lt;iframe title="" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-Ol08y" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Ol08y/15/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="487"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&amp;&amp;(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="pkB6MQ"&gt;If broadband access was a problem before 2020, the pandemic turned it into a crisis. As everyday businesses moved online, city council meetings or court proceedings became near-inaccessible to anyone whose connection couldn’t support a Zoom call. Some school districts started providing Wi-Fi hotspots to students without a reliable home connection. In other districts, kids set up in McDonald’s parking lots just to get a reliable enough signal to do their homework. After years of slowly widening, the broadband gap became impossible to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="opvGeY"&gt;So as we kick off our Infrastructure Week series, we wanted to show the scope of the problem ourselves. This map shows where the broadband problem is worst — the areas where the difficulty of reliably connecting to the internet has gotten bad enough to become a drag on everyday life. Specifically, the colored-in areas show US counties where less than 15 percent of households are using the internet at broadband speed, defined as 25Mbps download speed. (That’s already a pretty low threshold for calling something “high-speed internet,” but since it’s the Federal Communications Commission’s standard, we’ll stick with it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OQrYcf"&gt;Maps like this are important because, for much of the past decade, the scale of the problem has been maddeningly difficult to pin down. Most large-scale assessments of American broadband access rely on FCC data, a notoriously inaccurate survey drawn from ISPs’ own descriptions of the areas they serve. Even as the commission tries to close the broadband gap, its maps have been misleading policymakers about how wide the gap really is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="36j3aR"&gt;Instead of the FCC’s data, we drew on an anonymized dataset collected by Microsoft through its cloud services network, published in increments by the company over the past 18 months. If the FCC monitors the connections that providers say they’re offering, this measures what they’re actually getting. You can roll over specific counties to see the exact percentage of households connected at broadband speed, and the data is &lt;a href="https://github.com/microsoft/USBroadbandUsagePercentages"&gt;publicly available on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; if you want to check our work or drill down further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="8sbZaX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10454209"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="11Rod4"&gt;The disparity between FCC reports and the Microsoft data can be shocking. In Lincoln County, Washington, an area west of Spokane with a population just a hair over 10,000, the FCC lists 100 percent broadband availability. But according to Microsoft’s data, only 5 percent of households are actually connecting at broadband speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yMGRSp"&gt;Other areas stand out for the sheer scale of the problem. Nine counties in Nevada fall under the 10 percent threshold, covering more than 100,000 people and the bulk of the area of the state. Most of Alaska is a similar dead zone — understandably, given how rugged the state’s interior is — but similar gaps pop up in southwest New Mexico or central Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sulBfq"&gt;Because it’s measuring usage, this data doesn’t distinguish between people who can’t buy a fast connection and people who simply can’t afford one, and in other places, you can see the connectivity problem as one more consequence of accumulated neglect. In Arizona, Apache County stands out as a long thin stripe in the northeast corner of the state, showing just 5 percent broadband usage. More than 70,000 people live there, most of them members of the Navajo, Apache, or Zuni tribes. According to the census, more than 23,000 of them are living in poverty, by far the highest poverty rate in the state. Across the border, San Juan County, New Mexico, shows 29 percent broadband usage, so the problem isn’t that the county is too remote or that the terrain is too difficult to manage. Apache County is simply poor, and the slow progress of the broadband buildout seems like a promise it will stay that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OD5uMi"&gt;With the right eyes, you can even see the broadband gap as a dividing line for the US at large. Counties on the wrong side of the line are poorer and more remote, losing population even as the country grows. This is why there’s no broadband, of course: from a business perspective, building out fiber in Apache County is a losing bet. But the lack of fiber also stifles economic activity and makes young people more likely to leave, creating a cycle of disinvestment and decay that has swallowed large portions of our country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="NLpI93"&gt;In theory, this is a problem the federal government is getting ready to fix. President Biden has proposed $100 billion in broadband funding as part of the American Jobs Plan, more than twice what the FCC estimated would be necessary to bring broadband to 98 percent of households. But it will be a long walk from appropriating that money to actually laying fiber in places like Apache County. That road starts with taking a long look at the shaded parts of this map and thinking about what it will take to truly get them online.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Secretary Pete Buttigieg on the future of transportation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pete Buttigieg, United States secretary of transportation, photographed at The Department of Transportation headquarters in Washington, D.C.." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/txHhQOTmZSgLd73EydM3UoupSwM=/0x1:2040x1361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69262193/cmay_20210504_4553_0020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;‘This is a major, major investment in setting America on the right path for the years ahead’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="MBOsjK"&gt;Pete Buttigieg was not an obvious choice for secretary of transportation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KCvceu"&gt;As mayor of South Bend, Indiana, he oversaw a public transportation system with an annual ridership of about 2.5 million. As a 2020 presidential candidate, he rose to fame as one of the youngest and the first openly gay candidate to run for the highest office. But he wasn’t the first pick &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21069382/bernie-sanders-numtot-endorsement-facebook-meme-transit-election"&gt;for many of the most transportation-minded voters&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nJXcpw"&gt;After President Joe Biden’s victory, Buttigieg’s name was mentioned for a number of cabinet positions, including Veterans Affairs, United Nations ambassador, or ambassador to China. But in the end, Biden picked him to run the Department of Transportation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="YGdbtN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Biden clearly wants to leverage Buttigieg’s political celebrity&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eO9g0L"&gt;It would turn out to be a prescient choice. It sent the signal that Biden clearly wanted to leverage Buttigieg’s political celebrity to advocate for his $2 trillion plan to shore up the nation’s infrastructure and create millions of jobs. So far, Buttigieg has been an eager player, sitting for dozens of interviews, holding public events, beating the bully pulpit on the need for a massive overhaul of transportation infrastructure, and even participating in a few &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/USDOT/status/1384558471702528000"&gt;cringe-worthy attempts at going viral&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qAdyMr"&gt;Sec. Buttigieg sat down with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;senior transportation reporter Andrew J. Hawkins to discuss the most important elements of the plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="JgCeQe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10454209"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vIVKpu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for clarity. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A4PcXm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ve spoken to a lot of experts over the years about infrastructure, and they always tell me that the goal should be to “future-proof” infrastructure against the possibility of disruptive change. And so I just wanted to start by asking you: in what sense do you feel that the president’s jobs plan future-proofs our infrastructure? What elements do you think are sort of the most forward-thinking?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mefaWf"&gt;Yeah, that’s a big part of it. I mean, that’s one of the reasons you see $50 billion committed to the idea of resilience. When we fix things, let’s fix them right, not just redo the status quo. And let’s be ready for a future where the right answer is going to look a little different than it did in the past, especially in a changing climate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JUgJpE"&gt;Of course, future-proofing also means accounting for the fact that a lot of our means of getting around are going to evolve and change over time. We’re trying to focus on things like transit-oriented development, active transportation, different kinds of mobility — things that are going to make sense even as we have a shifting future and shifting patterns of life, as the pandemic showed us in an accelerated fashion. Then, of course, you have the investments in electric vehicles, preparing for the electric vehicle future by deploying a charging network of half a million chargers around the country, creating the kind of rebates or tax incentives that are going to be needed to make sure that electric cars are not a luxury item. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="1U92n2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Preparing for the electric vehicle future”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J4Uka7"&gt;And really recognizing that has to go hand-in-hand with improvements to our energy grid and our energy generation in general, so that we can capture the benefit of that. And those are just some of the &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/"&gt;things that are in this&lt;/a&gt;. I would also point to the R&amp;amp;D dimension. It’s not getting as much attention. But the idea of creating real research assets above and beyond what we’ve had in the past on everything from stuff people could imagine off the top of their heads like, you know, new transportation technologies, to some really unsexy, incredibly important stuff like pavement, where you have a lot of promising forms of concrete that could be carbon negative, permeable pavements that help with stormwater issues. There’s so much that we’re just beginning to discover in terms of things as basic and unnoticed as the surfaces that we walk and drive on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m8LJDz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The top-line figure is $2 trillion. I’ve heard some folks on the Republican side say, “That’s too much. It’s going to riddle the country with debt.” But I’ve heard a lot more credible folks say, “It’s not enough.” I’m wondering if you think that this is actually a number that could go higher as this bill winds its way through Congress?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IBQQ1C"&gt;Let’s remember that this represents the largest investment in American jobs since World War II. And this is not a minor proposal. This is designed to sit on top of what already happened in terms of surface transportation reauthorization. Not all of America’s spending on infrastructure for the future is going to be federal spending, right? This is part of a bigger picture where we continue to see work happening at the local and state level. And to the extent that we can support the mobilization of private capital to where we know it’s not going to happen without good federal leadership. This is a major, major investment in setting America on the right path for the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Gj4T1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So the administration came out with a very ambitious goal about &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22394366/joe-biden-pledge-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-2030"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;halving the amount of carbon emissions by the year 2030&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. Transportation is a huge driver of carbon emissions. You’ve spoken about electrification, but what are some of the other elements of the plan that would help get the carbon out of transportation? It seems like it’s just going to be an enormous challenge.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rDSZ1J"&gt;Yeah, I mean, this is a huge issue for every country, certainly for ours. When I’m talking to counterparts about climate and transportation around the world, we see how these things go together. And &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions#:~:text=Transportation%20(29%20percent%20of%202019,ships%2C%20trains%2C%20and%20planes."&gt;in the US, the transportation sector is the single biggest contributor to greenhouse gases&lt;/a&gt;. I’m enthusiastic about the implications of that — meaning we are the potentially biggest source of solutions as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="A1t9XZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We talked about electrification, but a lot of it is also mode shifting the way people get around.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="foSANN"&gt;We talked about electrification, but a lot of it is also mode shifting the way people get around. If you’re going to be in a vehicle, we want that vehicle to be low and zero emissions. But we also need to create some alternatives so that you don’t have to drag two tons of metal with you everywhere you go. That’s why we’re making sure that we improve our support for transit. This plan doubles funding for transit at a federal level. It’s why things like that matter — things like rail, rail for passengers obviously, a great alternative, especially on short and medium routes, to more carbon-intensive ways of getting around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PooD3W"&gt;But [it’s] also making sure we support the movement of freight on waterways and rails where that’s the most carbon-efficient solution for cargo. All of these things have to fit together. It’s an incredibly networked and layered set of solutions. Because the reality is we can’t just rely on a paradigm from 100 years ago about how we move around. And then you look further into the future, ways to decarbonize the maritime and aviation sectors, including sustainable aviation fuels. You know, there’s a lot of good technology out now that exists, but they’re nowhere near the scale that’s going to make it possible to drive the cost down and to get the most benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bBQEhL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Climate change is such an existential threat to our way of life. It’s hard to wrap our heads around the idea that, in the future, [we] won’t be driving or taking planes as much. Is that something you feel needs a psychological shift in the American public? How’s that going to look do you think?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CKEVnm"&gt;I think it’s about balance. It’s about making sure that people can get to where they need to be, but maybe in different ways. I mean, even over time, thinking about commuting distances when we design cities and design housing in the first place. So yeah, it’s not just taking the manner and length of trips that we have today, assuming it’ll be the same way forever, and trying to make it more environmentally friendly. It’s also about imagining the kind of trips that we have to take now and making them more manageable, shorter, or sometimes making them obsolete. But look, people and goods will always need to move around the communities, the country, and the world. So we have a responsibility to make sure that every mode of getting around is cleaner than it used to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9kbryM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You mentioned transit. Transit was facing a lot of really stark challenges, even before the pandemic happened. I’m wondering what you think transit needs in order to not only expand and become as convenient and reliable as we’d like it to be, but also as safe in order to encourage those people who do use transit to come back and continue to use it? And with the pandemic having an effect on the way we work and where we work, how is that going to make things even more challenging?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ELX6ZH"&gt;We know that commuting patterns are going to change after the pandemic. And I think only time will tell exactly how we need to become a country in a society where transit is a means of choice for getting around. I heard somebody pose the question of what real development looks like. Is it where every low-income person has a car? Or is it wherever the high-income person would prefer to take the subway or the bus? We want to make sure that you can get around and choose to get around in ways that are more efficient, not just in terms of pollution, but also in terms of congestion. And transit, obviously, is a big part of that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZoY0nS"&gt;Transit is also changing, right? We’re getting smarter about it. You look at the variety of options that are emerging, in addition to what we’re used to, with subways and buses and light rail. We have [bus rapid transit] becoming more and more prevalent in some communities. Any time you can get the majority of the benefit for a fraction of the cost, we’ve got to look into those possibilities, too. And of course, you have micromobility, which we don’t necessarily think of as transit, but active transportation, that kind of overlaps between active transportation and whatever we decide to call things like scooters and e-bikes. All of these things, I think, hold a ton of potential for breaking us out of the old paradigm of how you get around.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Pete Buttigieg, United States secretary of transportation, photographed at The Department of Transportation headquarters in Washington, D.C.," data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6Uk9CbQetEOXnDjk83P7zYUgNfo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22497066/cmay_20210203_4553_0005.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CcVn1d"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’ll get to micromobility in a second, but really quick first, I wanted to ask you about &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://visionzeronetwork.org/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vision Zero&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. It’s something that has become very popular in some cities around the country. Would you support a national Vision Zero goal? No traffic or road deaths by, say, 2050?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2wwZcf"&gt;I certainly believe in national support for that concept of zero fatalities. I think the most promising way to get there is to build up from the community level. It sounds to some people like pie in the sky, except you see communities that are actually doing this or making incredible progress. Recently, Oslo, [Norway], I think, had a year with zero vehicle deaths and almost zero pedestrian deaths. I’ve got to double-check the numbers there. But if communities can do it at the community level, that gives us tools to build into a national picture. As a former mayor, it won’t surprise you that one of my favorite tools to deploy is federal support for local action because I don’t believe we’re going to cook up all of the solutions here in Washington. But we’ve got to support the people at the local level and then cross-pollinate them when somebody hits on something good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UqPrhT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to ask you kind of a weird question, and I don’t know how you’re going to respond to this. But we saw last year during the election how cars, and especially large trucks and SUVs, would showcase in our larger political and cultural conflicts that we were having in this country, with certain people using &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/11/02/trump-caravan-biden-bus/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;vehicular intimidation against their political opponents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fqg7bw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EVs are often dismissed out of hand by people who prefer large emissions-belching vehicles. And there’s an academic who calls this phenomenon &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0305829818775817"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“petro-masculinity.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; I was wondering if you have any thoughts on whether we can reverse this trend of vehicular intimidation and petro-masculinity and what the federal government can do about that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t7qwNY"&gt;That’s actually a new word for me. Look, for Americans, cars have always been more than a means to an end. And that’s okay. I mean, they have cultural significance. They have emotional significance. And we don’t have to do away with that. But it does have to evolve. And I think we can get to a place where we take a lot of pride in the evolution of our cars, especially when you look at where EVs are now. I think some people picture EVs, and they think of small cars for getting around urban neighborhoods. And that’s one kind of EV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wrv2bW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Look, for Americans, cars have always been more than a means to an end. And that’s okay.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jFmKSr"&gt;But so much of the stuff coming out of Detroit, as well as newer companies, in terms of the kinds of trucks and SUVs that they’re developing on an electric basis, are also really remarkable. And I think they still speak to that itch that I don’t think of as uniquely masculine, but perhaps is particularly American, of wanting to get out there in a muscular way on the open road and have these vehicles perform. But you know, again, I don’t think it has to be locked into the old way. I mean, I think there was probably a time when a man’s relationship with his horse had more cultural signature and social significance than it does today. But it doesn’t mean that we’ve abandoned the special understanding about the way people and horses relate. We just don’t depend on them as a way to get around the way we used to, which is probably better for the horses as well as people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VYKBeN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The jobs plan wants to incentivize manufacturers to make it easier to transition to electrification. Some countries around the world have actually gone so far as to say we want to phase out gas-powered cars at a certain date, and some states have said that as well, California most notably. Do you see a need at the national level to say we need to phase out the production and selling of gas-powered cars by a certain date?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TXf2EW"&gt;That’s not our approach federally, but I will say it’s remarkable seeing how industry is already headed that way. A lot of them are talking about all-EV fleet goals by very specific dates. But the other thing I want to point out is, no matter how good we are at EV adoption, no matter how quickly we get there, there are going to be a lot of internal combustion engines on the road for a long time. It’s one of the reasons why we can’t back off on having rigorous and ambitious tailpipe emission standards. In addition to driving EV adoption, it’s really got to be both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qiryix"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your department has decided to withdraw the rule that would have prevented California from being able to set its own tailpipe emissions. Do you see a need to also address what the prior administration did with regard to the rollback of the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/laws-regulations/corporate-average-fuel-economy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obama-era CAFE standards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;on emissions?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GjWgqB"&gt;We’re actively looking at that, bearing in mind the legal language around &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/corporate-average-fuel-economy/backgrounder-final-safe-vehicles-rule"&gt;“maximum feasible.”&lt;/a&gt; CAFE standards have a remarkable track record of inducing industry to do more than they might themselves [have] thought possible and gaining a business perspective as well as a climate perspective. So [President Biden’s] executive order was clear in challenging us to quickly act, not only on the so-called &lt;a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/09/27/2019-20672/the-safer-affordable-fuel-efficient-safe-vehicles-rule-part-one-one-national-program"&gt;Safe-1 rule&lt;/a&gt;, which is where we saw the notice go out, having to do with preemption, but also &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/corporate-average-fuel-economy/safe"&gt;Safe-2&lt;/a&gt;, which takes a look at the Trump administration’s actions to try to dismantle that level of ambition. And that’s something that we’ll be continuing to evaluate going into the summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="syFEFc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is a bill that’s been introduced in the House that would &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22295115/ebike-tax-credit-congress-bill-blumenauer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;offer a rebate for people who purchase electric bikes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. You mentioned micromobility as a component of the solution of getting more people out of their cars. Your administration supports rebates and tax incentives for electric vehicles. Would you also support rebates and incentives for other types of electric vehicles, smaller ones that are less onerous on the environment?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BHRV4e"&gt;Well, I haven’t seen the specifics of this legislation. But we definitely want to do everything we can to encourage the adoption of bike commuting by more Americans. And that has to do a lot of things. Part of it may be the economics of it. A lot of it is just the ease of getting around and making sure we’re encouraging cities to take on complete streets approaches and safe bike lanes. The other thing we’ve noticed is that there’s data suggesting that you really hit a tipping point, a good tipping point, once you get to a certain level of bike commuting, in terms of safety, because cars learn to expect bikes in a way that, frankly, they still don’t in most US cities. And so all of these things are taken together. Yes, the economics but also the convenience and certainly the safety are what we have to do in order to design for a world where we get not just the climate benefits but the congestion benefits and, frankly, the public health benefits of more people getting around on two wheels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YHJWTD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How’s it been biking around Washington lately?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="7gGDwq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’m trying to mystery shop the bike infrastructure around here.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p075CV"&gt;You know, it’s pretty good. I’m trying to mystery shop the bike infrastructure around here. And I’ll say it’s impressive what the city has done. But you can tell it’s grafted onto a street system that wasn’t originally designed with this in mind, which is fine. I mean, you know, some of the older streets around here probably weren’t designed with cars in mind. It takes work and, you know, whether you’re talking about protected bike lanes or environments where you can safely share the road, when I’m commuting into the DOT here — which I don’t claim to do every day, but I do some days — on a bike, it’s good. But it needs more support from the federal level. And I think that’s true of cities large and small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L1EwfR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaking to the way that our cities are designed, in the first half of the 20th century, the highway system created physical barriers between mostly Black and minority communities. It was destructive, and it showed how transportation can be a civil rights and social justice issue. How do you adopt policies that help address some of those issues?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0txSQ3"&gt;So to me, this is one of the most important things in the jobs plan. And we’re already writing it into things like our approach on discretionary grants here in the department. We made sure that the &lt;a href="https://www.transportation.gov/buildamerica/financing/infra-grants/infrastructure-rebuilding-america"&gt;INFRA grants&lt;/a&gt; that went out earlier this year and the &lt;a href="https://www.transportation.gov/RAISEgrants"&gt;RAISE grants&lt;/a&gt;, formerly known as TIGER, reflect this as well. Precisely because we know it’s often been with federal dollars in federal policies that a lot of communities were destroyed or divided with the transportation infrastructure like highways, but we have a chance to put this right, and when we do, we think everybody benefits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K0jPIY"&gt;Sometimes that might mean removing a structure that caused harm. Sometimes it might mean bridging over and under it. The important thing is to connect where there has been division and to invest where there has been neglect. And that’s important, not just in terms of the kinds of neighborhoods and communities that get the infrastructure delivered to them, but also who gets to do the work. And that’s a real pressing issue that doesn’t get enough attention: getting more diverse participation in skilled trades and union labor and getting more diverse ownership of the businesses that get a shot at the billions and billions of dollars of infrastructure spending that is procured through government dollars in this country. That’s a big lift, but we’ve got to take it seriously so that our choices can actually enhance equity and not [contribute] to the problem, as has happened so often in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ZU5ds"&gt;We also just need to talk about it, and we need to face up to this, not in the spirit of guilt but in the spirit of problem-solving. &lt;a href="https://thegrio.com/2021/04/06/pete-buttigieg-racism-us-infrastructure/"&gt;I made some comments about this a few weeks ago&lt;/a&gt;, and certain pockets of the internet erupted. I was surprised they were surprised, but it revealed that there’s actually a lot of work we’ve got to do just to educate ourselves about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNbqtA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah, be careful about those pockets of the internet. One last question, and I’ll let you go. Thank you so much for your time. The previous two administrations took a very hands-off approach to the development and regulation of autonomous vehicles. Do you expect this administration to follow suit?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JQ4D0i"&gt;I think that we need to have policy catch up to the technology. You know, it feels like a bit of a moving target. I have noticed that the widespread adoption of driverless cars has been exactly seven years away for roughly 10 years. But we are now at a level in terms of the technologies that are out there that we’ve got to be managing the safety implications of it. Not only because it’s so important, obviously, that these be safe. But also, frankly, because the industry is going to need some certainty in order to be able to continue development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="tad62U"&gt;And look, automated vehicles hold out a lot of promise for seniors and Americans with disabilities. And you know, there are implications all the way down to the land use possibilities in a country that doesn’t need as much surface parking. But we’re still a ways away from that. And we want to make sure we get there responsibly, equitably, and safely. And that does, I think, mean that we need to lean in further, using our existing authorities, but also updating them — which, of course, is going to mean working with Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pony.ai unveils its next-gen robotaxi with LIDAR from Luminar</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5yVTnZDqMZs3z7SZN2hsji_1tz4=/160x0:1927x1178/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69262007/Ponyai_Luminar_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gimysB"&gt;Pony.ai’s next-generation robotaxi is distinctive because it appears to be missing the cone-shaped LIDAR sensor perched on the roof that’s typical of most autonomous vehicles. That’s because the startup, which is based in Silicon Valley and Guangzhou, China, is teaming up with Luminar to use the fast-growing LIDAR company’s sleek new sensors that are more flush with the vehicle’s roof. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0A9Tep"&gt;The new vehicles with Luminar’s LIDAR sensor won’t be up and running until 2022, but Pony.ai founder and CEO James Peng said preparation was already underway for mass production of the next-gen robotaxi. After testing the vehicle next year, Peng said it will be ready for the company’s robotaxi customers in 2023. Pony.ai currently offers limited ride-hailing in its autonomous vehicles in five markets: Irvine and Fremont in California; Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="S6ES6C"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new vehicles with Luminar’s LIDAR sensor won’t be up and running until 2022&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RUpWKu"&gt;Pony also announced that it has driven more than 5 million kilometers (3.1 million miles) across an operational domain of 850km and has provided over 250,000 robotaxi rides. The startup claims to be the first company to launch an autonomous ride-hailing operation and offer self-driving car rides to the general public in China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jga9Qf_lbaodknoMa35zDbyy7R8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22498636/PonyFleetinSH.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TxapoX"&gt;The company was also recently approved to test its fully autonomous vehicles, without safety drivers behind the wheel, on public roads in California. Peng said Pony was currently seeking approval to include those vehicles in its robotaxi service in California. “We are actually at the final stage of getting the approval for travelers,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YsFNc0"&gt;LIDAR, the laser sensor that sends millions of laser points out per second and measures how long they take to bounce back, is seen as a key ingredient to autonomous driving. Peng said that Pony would use four of Luminar’s Iris sensors, two on the roof and two more on each side of the vehicle, in order to “generate a very high resolution LIDAR image for our autonomous driving vehicles.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wSeNWd"&gt;Luminar says that its Iris LIDARs have a maximum range of 500 meters (1,640 feet), including 250-meter range with less than 10 percent reflectivity. Luminar’s sensors are also distinctive from most other LIDAR sensors, which were once famously described as looking like “spinning Kentucky Fried Chicken buckets.” In contrast, Iris is only about 10 centimeters tall. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22298001/luminar-austin-russel-ceo-interview-self-driving-cars"&gt;Austin Russell&lt;/a&gt;, founder and CEO of Luminar, described it as a “slim form factor that’s meant to be seamlessly integrated into the vehicle design.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kupN4Z"&gt;Pony.ai was valued at $3 billion after a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21152817/toyota-pony-ai-self-driving-car-investment-valuation-china-silicon-valley"&gt;$400 million investment from Toyota&lt;/a&gt; last year. Luminar, which is based in Florida, went &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/24/21398974/luminar-lidar-startup-spac-ipo-reverse-merge-blank-check"&gt;public last year via a reverse merger&lt;/a&gt; with a special acquisition company, or SPAC. That merger valued the company at approximately $2.9 billion in “implied pro forma enterprise value,” with an equity value of $3.4 billion at closing. In addition to Pony, Luminar is also working with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22399389/luminar-airbus-lidar-aviation-evtol-partnership"&gt;Airbus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21248415/volvo-luminar-lidar-self-driving-highway-pilot-spa2"&gt;Volvo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/18/18144506/audi-self-driving-car-volkswagen-luminar-lidar"&gt;Audi&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/27/16373058/toyota-research-institute-self-driving-car-luminar"&gt;Toyota Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple invests another $45 million in Gorilla Glass maker Corning</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j4n_Ay95t5IS-URje6SNzqrAFuA=/11x0:1949x1292/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69261932/Apple_awards_Corning_an_additional_45_million_dollars_team_member_051021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corning manufactures glass for Apple and many Android device makers.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PU0nfd"&gt;Apple is awarding Corning another $45 million investment from its Advanced Manufacturing Fund, in addition to the $450 million it’s already given to the US-based company over the past four years. According to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F05%2Fapple-awards-corning-45-million-from-its-advanced-manufacturing-fund%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F10%2F22428372%2Fapple-corning-45-million-investment-gorilla-glass-ceramic-shield-foldable-bendable-glass" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s announcement&lt;/a&gt;, the investment will “expand Corning’s manufacturing capacity in the US and drive research and development into innovative new technologies that support durability and long-lasting product life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BFS5I0"&gt;Corning provides glass for a variety of Apple products, including the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. The two companies have a history &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/9/20687299/plastic-iphone-gorilla-glass-origin-story-steve-jobs"&gt;dating back to the original iPhone&lt;/a&gt;. Last year, they collaborated on the iPhone 12 lineup’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509008/apple-iphone-12-pro-max-mini-displays-ceramic-hardened"&gt;Ceramic Shield technology&lt;/a&gt;, which Apple claims is “tougher than any smartphone glass” and makes its latest flagships four times more resistant to damage from drops. As well as Apple, Corning’s Gorilla Glass is used in phones from &lt;a href="https://www.corning.com/gorillaglass/worldwide/en/products-with-gorilla-glass/smartphones.html"&gt;countless Android manufacturers&lt;/a&gt; including Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uh0Yrf1t9rpNe1vgj3Ofrwsth9I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19729421/corning_4k_bendable_glass.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Corning&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corning’s ultra-thin glass.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VmUHFo"&gt;Apple doesn’t say exactly how Corning will use the $45 million investment, but its timing coincides with &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/02/kuo-8-inch-foldable-iphone-2023/"&gt;recent reports&lt;/a&gt; that Apple could launch a foldable iPhone in 2023. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18251328/apple-corning-foldable-display-gorilla-glass-bendable-smartphone"&gt;Back in 2019&lt;/a&gt; we heard Corning was developing a bendable version of its glass, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142728/samsung-foldable-glass-galaxy-z-flip-explained-schott-corning"&gt;last February&lt;/a&gt; the company said it expects devices using the technology to reach the market in 12 to 18 months. If it works, the glass could allow for durable foldable smartphones that don’t require a layer of plastic protection used in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/16/21139897/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-ultra-thin-glass-durability-scratch-test-jerryrigeverything"&gt;Samsung’s latest foldables&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WvSteK"&gt;“Today, when you buy a phone with Gorilla Glass, you’re touching glass … that’s what we’re working towards,” Corning said of its ambitions for bendable glass &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142728/samsung-foldable-glass-galaxy-z-flip-explained-schott-corning"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vivo promises three years of Android updates for upcoming flagships</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a-1Ek8-g9_f1BkB53iUQD41RNAM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69261809/DSCF7692.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vivo X60 Pro Plus.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g9t7Zt"&gt;Vivo’s upcoming X-series flagship phones will receive three years of Android OS upgrades and security updates, &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vivo-commits-to-three-years-of-android-upgrades-for-future-premium-x-series-devices-301286977.html"&gt;the company announ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vivo-commits-to-three-years-of-android-upgrades-for-future-premium-x-series-devices-301286977.html#:~:text=SHENZHEN%2C%20China%2C%20May%209%2C,models%20launching%20after%20July%202021"&gt;ced today&lt;/a&gt;. The policy will come into force for phones launched after July 2021 in Europe, Australia, and India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DDdCFX"&gt;“We are making a promise to our customers that they will be able to enjoy a premium smartphone experience for an extended period and continue to benefit from the latest software features,” Vivo’s CTO and senior vice president Yujian Shi said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qGBMwn"&gt;With today’s announcement, Vivo is joining a small but growing group of Android manufacturers promising three years of OS updates for their flagship smartphones. Google has long had a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705?hl=en-GB#:~:text=pixel%20phones%20get%20android%20version%20updates%20for%20at%20least%203%20years%20from%20when%20the%20device%20first%20became%20available%20on%20the%20google%20store"&gt;similar policy for its Pixel phones&lt;/a&gt;. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355777/samsung-android-os-update-promise-galaxy-phones-3-generations"&gt;Samsung announced&lt;/a&gt; a “three generation” OS policy covering some Galaxy devices, joined by HMD in April with a promise of two years of Android OS updates and three years of security updates on its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22371937/hmd-nokia-x20-x10-g20-g10-c20-c10-android-phones-release-date-news-features"&gt;X-series phones&lt;/a&gt;. Even LG said it would offer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22373088/lg-android-update-three-year-pledge-after-leaving-mobile-business"&gt;three years of Android OS updates&lt;/a&gt; the same week it announced it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22373088/lg-android-update-three-year-pledge-after-leaving-mobile-business"&gt;exiting the smartphone business&lt;/a&gt;. This year, Samsung added that select devices would also get an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates"&gt;additional year of security updates&lt;/a&gt;, for a total of four years of support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xogXxg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A premium smartphone experience for an extended period”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bXcng6"&gt;Three years of OS updates is a big improvement over the two years that’s previously been the standard for most Android manufacturers, but in the future this could extend to as much as four years. Last December, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22178833/google-qualcomm-snapdragon-888-faster-android-updates-four-years"&gt;Google and chip manufacturer Qualcomm announced&lt;/a&gt; they were working to make it easier for manufacturers to offer as much as four generations of Android OS and security updates, starting with devices equipped with Qualcomm’s latest flagship processor, the Snapdragon 888.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YSsGwB"&gt;Vivo’s new policy puts it ahead of fellow BBK Electronics smartphone brands OnePlus and Oppo. &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/oneplus-software-maintenance-schedule.862347/"&gt;As of 2018&lt;/a&gt;, OnePlus’s official policy has been to offer two years of Android version upgrades and three years of security updates. Meanwhile, the most recent statement we could find from Oppo (&lt;a href="https://ausdroid.net/2021/03/22/oppo-find-x3-series-buyers-promised-at-least-2-years-security-updates-and-2-new-android-versions/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;AusDroid&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;says the company offers two years of security updates, and that it’s general policy is to offer two generations of Android OS updates. Today’s announcement will undoubtedly create pressure on Oppo and OnePlus to follow Vivo’s example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WmyzZg"&gt;These figures pale in comparison to Apple’s update history. Last year it released the latest version of iOS, version 14, on devices as old as &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fuk%2Fios%2Fios-14%2F%23%3A%7E%3Atext%3DPlus-%2Ciphone%25206s%2C-iPhone&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F10%2F22428342%2Fvivo-android-updates-three-years-x-series-phones-july-2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2015’s iPhone 6S&lt;/a&gt;, the fifth major update to have come to the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NnJYJm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3GHQiY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony expects PS5 supply issues to continue into next year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BzXvSgENB4poLLnqwKxKVmV08pU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69261764/vpavic_4278_20201030_0206.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZhAL3X"&gt;Sony doesn’t expect the PlayStation 5 supply situation to improve any time soon, according to comments its CFO reportedly made to analysts following the company’s recent earnings report. Hiroki Totoki said that it’s difficult for Sony to keep up with demand for the PS5, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-10/sony-warns-tight-playstation-5-supply-to-extend-into-next-year"&gt;according to Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;, and that the situation is likely to continue into 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GQGnsy"&gt;“I don’t think demand is calming down this year and even if we secure a lot more devices and produce many more units of the PlayStation 5 next year, our supply wouldn’t be able to catch up with demand,” Totoki reportedly said, later adding “We have sold more than 100 million units of the PlayStation 4 and considering our market share and reputation, I can’t imagine demand dropping easily.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cCojzR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I can’t imagine demand dropping easily.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="32DJRC"&gt;Sony is aiming to produce at least 14.8 million PS5 consoles in the financial year beginning April 2021, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407195/sony-ps5-sales-numbers-q4-2020-earnings"&gt;having sold 7.8 million through March 31st&lt;/a&gt;. The company also sold 14.8 million PS4 consoles in its first full fiscal year but didn’t experience severe supply constraints for most of that period, suggesting initial demand for the PS5 is markedly higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EIAGP8"&gt;Totoki’s comments are less optimistic than previous messaging from Sony. PlayStation boss had previously suggested that PS5 supply would “get better every month throughout 2021.” Jim Ryan, president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297039/playstation-ceo-ps5-supply-2021-stock-consoles-jim-ryan"&gt;told the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in February that “the pace of the improvement in the supply chain will gather throughout the course of the year, so by the time we get to the second half of [2021], you’re going to be seeing really decent numbers indeed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="16zcCq"&gt;It’s possible that PS5 supply really will improve at some point, but ultimately what matters to Sony is that Totoki doesn’t expect the company to be able to meet demand in the near term even if production capacity increases. As Ryan himself noted, “there are very few magic wands that can be waved.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="hWdhO3"&gt;The online bank Simple shut down on Saturday and was supposed to seamlessly transition customers’ accounts over to its parent company, BBVA. But instead, many users found themselves unable to access their bank account at all, as BBVA’s website returned an assortment of error messages, from “system error” to warnings that their account information was mismatched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9qdjsh"&gt;The transition has gone so poorly that &lt;a href="https://www.bbvausa.com/"&gt;BBVA’s US website&lt;/a&gt; now opens on a large red banner warning users of extended customer service wait times. Anyone who visits &lt;a href="https://www.bbvausa.com/go/simple.html"&gt;the Simple transition page&lt;/a&gt; will see a different red banner, apologizing for the issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="316iHI"&gt;“To Simple customers converting to BBVA: This has not been a good conversion experience for many of you,” part of the message reads. “We know this, and we sincerely apologize.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A banner on BBVA’s website reading in part, “To Simple customers converting to BBVA: This has not been a good conversion experience for many of you. We know this, and we sincerely apologize. BBVA teams are working around the clock to understand the situation and make it right. Lines have been overwhelmed at our customer service center, leading to the service center being down. Again, we apologize for this and we are working to get it back online as soon as possible.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5CTPvoZvs60gLG64HForm3tYo3Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22502565/bbva_simple_transition.png"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KcRvX7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sPwz8O"&gt;Simple opened to customers in 2012 and was supposed to offer a digital-first approach to banking. In fewer words, it was supposed to be “a bank that doesn’t suck,” to &lt;a href="https://www.al3x.net/blog/2010/05/17/something-new"&gt;quote&lt;/a&gt; one of its co-founders. The service had a website and app that broke down your spending and made it easy to categorize payments, send money, and set savings goals. It was purchased by BBVA in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hg6CzU"&gt;BBVA said in January that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22219271/simple-bank-online-shutting-down-pnc-bbva"&gt;would be shutting down Simple&lt;/a&gt; later in 2021. The decision came from the company “reassessing its goals” as part of a planned sale to PNC Bank, which reached an agreement to acquire BBVA’s US operations in November 2020. The acquisition has not yet closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="716HjN"&gt;Accounts were successfully transitioned from Simple to BBVA on Saturday, but technical issues prevented customers from logging in, a BBVA spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. That led to a cascading series of problems. “Due to the volume of customers attempting to enroll in mobile and online banking simultaneously, there were technical difficulties with the enrollment process, leading to high call volume in our call centers, which overwhelmed the system, and created longer than normal wait times,” the spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1aCxzz"&gt;Debit cards, ATMs, checks, and scheduled transactions still functioned properly, according to the spokesperson. Though online and mobile account access remains unavailable for users encountering issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aBauVJ"&gt;“We know this conversion process was not smooth for our incoming Simple customers and we sincerely apologize to them,” the spokesperson said. “We are working to make it right, including extending hours in our call center and adding staff to handle the incoming calls.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pBGyBG"&gt;It seems that some people have been able to gain access to their accounts after waiting or working with BBVA’s customer service. Judging by reactions on Twitter from Simple’s very online user base, plenty of people still don’t have access though and have been unable to get help from BBVA’s customer service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6crEus"&gt;BBVA hasn’t provided a timeline for when it expects to restore account access for all Simple users. In its banner message, BBVA wrote that the company is “working to get it back online as soon as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
