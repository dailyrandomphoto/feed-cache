    <title>Rep. Jamaal Bowman introduces new bill to lower broadband costs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="JAMAAL BOWMAN" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BwDWryNZBX6dWkTIqx1b15Mc2_4=/0x0:5166x3444/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68975442/1229686078.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xXxnDP"&gt;For years, the broadband debate has centered around connecting people living in rural and unserved areas across the country. But while some rural Americans don’t have the infrastructure necessary to connect to the internet, other families in urban communities face difficulties affording what’s already available. Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-NY) is set to introduce a new measure Tuesday that could help millions of households access more affordable broadband.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="isDiay"&gt;“The more access to broadband people have, the more access and opportunity they have to the world beyond where they currently exist,” Bowman told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on Tuesday. “The internet is a library. It’s an encyclopedia. It’s information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="V7htUt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The internet is a library. It’s an encyclopedia. It’s information.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CFbArj"&gt;Bowman’s “Broadband Justice Act,” co-sponsored by Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-MO) who chairs a housing subcommittee, would require the Housing and Urban Development Department, along with the Treasury and USDA, to update its utility allowance definitions to include broadband so it can be subsidized for families living in government-assisted housing. Other utilities like gas and electricity are already subsidized in this way. The bill would also create a new grant program to help wire buildings and build out other broadband-related infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tYDYPu"&gt;“There’s a lot of momentum and energy around making this a utility, not just from members of Congress but from organizers on the outside,” Bowman told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The grassroots is really behind this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JDRZcj"&gt;The FCC already has subsidy programs, like Lifeline, that make broadband more affordable for qualified households, but it’s been the subject of disinvestment for many years. Many Lifeline subscribers receive poor connections, and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/09/lifeline-broadband-internet-fcc-coronavirus/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, many people who qualify for the program refuse to use it due to its insufficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="82whFV"&gt;As Congress prepares for its next big infrastructure package, money for broadband expansion will likely be included in the process. Last week, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-SC) introduced &lt;a href="https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/news-releases?id=c3c8f0e4-61d4-46fe-a28a-f81a09620a5d"&gt;a sweeping broadband package&lt;/a&gt; that would invest over $94 billion in building high-speed broadband infrastructure in unserved and underserved areas. The Senate Commerce Committee also &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2021/3/recent-federal-actions-to-expand-broadband-are-we-making-progress"&gt;plans to hold a hearing&lt;/a&gt; on broadband expansion this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EoyBLq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pX4qeX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tinder is giving away free mail-in COVID-19 tests</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KHUTiiNBw164I_i5CSFg3sKtQNM=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68975382/TinderEverywell_NEWgradientBG_hand.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Tinder&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bVC0w7"&gt;Tinder is giving 500 users a pair of free mail-in COVID-19 test kits — one for them and one for a Tinder match. The company says it’s a way to help people feel more comfortable meeting up with matches for real-life dates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vKJXu5"&gt;It’s using tests from the medical testing company EverlyWell. People taking &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.everlywell.com%2Fproducts%2Fcovid-19-test%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F16%2F22333930%2Ftinder-covid-test-free-mail-in-everlywell" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;EverlyWell’s coronavirus tests&lt;/a&gt; swab their noses at home and mail the sample to the lab. Results are posted online within one to two days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2HgFpk"&gt;Throughout the pandemic, dating app companies have introduced new features to help people date safely. One main focus was on ways to facilitate &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21324221/tinder-bumble-video-virtual-dating-calls-feature-whyd-you-push-that-button-podcast"&gt;virtual dates&lt;/a&gt;, which are actually a good way to meet people without the risk of spreading or contracting COVID-19. Bumble recently launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325404/bumble-virtual-date-trivia-quiz-social-distancing"&gt;Night In&lt;/a&gt;, a feature that lets users play games together over a video call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RI3RTxfMsza6iFwvi8vFEfoZjrs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22374751/TinderEverywell_phonemock_transparentBG.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Tinder&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hkTKZ5"&gt;Tinder is framing its test kit giveaway as another way to reduce the risks of dating. “We’re excited to be working with Everlywell to make it easier for our members to go and meet their matches safely,” Nicole Parlapiano, Tinder’s vice president of marketing for North America, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W3r524"&gt;But giving out test kits doesn’t make an in-person date entirely safe. Taking a COVID-19 test before meeting up with someone new helps but doesn’t eliminate risk entirely: someone could take the test, send it out, and then catch the coronavirus in the window before the result comes back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ux218z"&gt;Tinder gestures at this in an interface for the giveaway, saying that “a negative test result does not mean you don’t have or cannot transmit COVID-19.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W2KHHq"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/news?item=122492"&gt;According to Tinder&lt;/a&gt;, more and more people are saying in their profiles that they want to go on a date. There are ways to make that safer, like meeting outside, wearing masks, or avoiding other people before and after. Tests can play a role in that overall calculus — but a negative result isn’t a free pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dqekzm"&gt;Tinder users in the United States can claim a code for the tests on March 20th starting at 7PM ET. If you don’t manage to snag one, &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/community-based-testing-sites/index.html"&gt;free COVID-19 tests&lt;/a&gt; are also available at health centers and pharmacies across the country.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google antitrust suit takes aim at Chrome’s Privacy Sandbox</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K4Ec_EvpkBEEJu-jHeyEtonebjU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68975277/acastro_180416_1777_chrome_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Kzpnw1"&gt;State antitrust watchdogs are targeting Google’s plans to phase out third-party tracking cookies, building on a major lawsuit filed last year. The group of 15 attorneys general, led by Texas, updated its complaint about Google yesterday to include a more detailed case against the search giant, including new claims about Google’s strategic use of the Chrome browser. In particular, the new complaint takes aim at recent privacy updates to Chrome, which could better protect users’ personal data while also entrenching Google’s market position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NHbos8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178988/google-antitrust-ad-tech-lawsuit-texas-attorney-general-paxton"&gt;Filed in December&lt;/a&gt;, the Texas complaint is one of three ongoing antitrust cases against Google. That same month, the Colorado attorney general led a group alleging that the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22186994/google-search-antitrust-lawsuit-colorado-nebraska-state-ags"&gt;stifled competition by manipulating search results&lt;/a&gt;. A separate case from the Department of Justice is focused on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21454192/google-monopoly-antitrust-case-lawsuit-filed-us-doj-department-of-justice"&gt;Google’s dominance of the web search marketplace and associated ad business&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bx9nc0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Privacy vs. antitrust&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="chScBL"&gt;Like the original Texas complaint, Tuesday’s updated filing primarily focuses on Google’s technology for targeting ads across the web. The attorneys general argue that Google used its power in search, streaming video, and other markets to stamp out independent advertising platforms, forcing small businesses and media outlets to use its system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yPHGcg"&gt;But in the updated complaint, the states apply this argument to Google’s “Privacy Sandbox” — a tool that’s supposed to replace invasive third-party tracking cookies with a more limited system devised by Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="shVxgH"&gt;“Google’s new scheme is, in essence, to wall off the entire portion of the internet that consumers access through Google’s Chrome browser,” the complaint reads. Blocking cookies might broadly be a good thing — other browsers like Firefox and Safari have already done it. But Chrome dominates the browser market, and it’s part of a much larger Google product suite. The suit argues that Google’s plans would require advertisers to use it as a middleman and would make Google’s own advertising system far more attractive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c7HRs1"&gt;For years, Google has been gradually scaling back its use of tracking cookies, announcing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22310332/google-privacy-replacing-third-party-cookies-privacy-sandbox"&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; that it will not establish an alternate system for tracking users on the web. But critics of the company — including &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/08/dont-play-googles-privacy-sandbox-1"&gt;the Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/a&gt; — have criticized those efforts as self-serving. Now, state regulators seem to be adopting those criticisms and putting new legal pressure on Google’s efforts to block tracking in Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9hiF1F"&gt; “Google is trying to hide its true intentions behind a pretext of privacy,” the suit continues. With Privacy Sandbox, “Google does not actually put a stop to user profiling or targeted advertising — it puts Google’s Chrome browser at the center of tracking and targeting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jUqdwG"&gt;Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA: LastPass’ free offering is changing today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dJQ2g2HYVUh22Vumczq79YDM3_Q=/0x0:2288x1525/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68975067/lpdevicesvault2xmin1png.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: LastPass&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4rzJsY"&gt;LastPass, the popular password manager, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333777/google-play-store-fee-reduction-developers-1-million-dollars"&gt;announced changes&lt;/a&gt; last month to the free version of its software designed to make its Premium paid version much more attractive — and the free one much less so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iddYPN"&gt;“LastPass offers access across two device types – computers (including all browsers running on desktops and laptops) or mobile&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;devices (including mobile phones, smart watches, and tablets),” the company wrote in a &lt;a href="https://blog.lastpass.com/2021/02/changes-to-lastpass-free/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “Starting March 16th, 2021” — that’s today — “LastPass Free will only include access on unlimited devices of one type.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9OTFzY"&gt;What that means: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285531/lastpass-free-tier-mobile-computer-device-premium-family"&gt;if you’re a LastPass free user, you’ll have to choose&lt;/a&gt; whether you want to access your passwords on your computer — in browser or via desktop app — or on your mobile device. You won’t be able to use both, though your passwords will sync across devices regardless. That said, you’ll have the opportunity to switch your main device three times, starting today. (LastPass is also offering a discount on Premium subscriptions for a limited time, presumably to dampen the sting.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OhYGfc"&gt;If, however, you find all of this too onerous and you’d like to just switch password managers entirely, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295354/lastpass-export-delete-bitwarden-1password-zoho"&gt;I have some good news for you: moving your passwords out of LastPass is pretty easy&lt;/a&gt;. I actually did it myself, using (naturally) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295354/lastpass-export-delete-bitwarden-1password-zoho"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s guide&lt;/a&gt;. I chose Bitwarden because it syncs across mobile and desktop and it’s open source. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LzsubY"&gt;Also, if you’ve made it this far and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/24/15921282/best-password-manager-1password-lastpass-dashlane-how-to"&gt;you don’t have a password manager&lt;/a&gt; yet — what are you doing here? &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311182/best-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password"&gt;Get on that&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lu2ZDY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel’s 11th Gen desktop chips are here with faster speeds but fewer cores</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1VXr2aM1xMOheCdlRNphASMD4GA=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68974858/RKL_i9_with_Box.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="W8j3Mp"&gt;Intel’s next-generation desktop chips are finally here: after a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225541/intel-processor-11th-gen-ces-2021-chips-specs"&gt;brief preview at CES&lt;/a&gt;, the company is fully unveiling its 11th Gen Core desktop chips (better known by their codename, Rocket Lake-S.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dVHayt"&gt;Leading the pack is Intel’s new flagship chip, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225541/intel-processor-11th-gen-ces-2021-chips-specs"&gt;Core i9-11900K&lt;/a&gt;, with eight cores, 16 threads, boosted clock speeds up to 5.3GHz, support for DDR4 RAM at 3,200MHz, a total of 20 PCIe 4.0 lanes, and backwards compatibility with Intel’s 400 Series chipsets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fHl4LY"&gt;Eagle-eyed Intel fans might notice that the new chip is, on paper, actually a downgrade from last year’s top model, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/4/30/21242512/intel-10th-gen-desktop-lineup-offers-gaming-processor-speed"&gt;the Core i9-10900K&lt;/a&gt;, which offered 10 cores and 20 threads (and a similar boosted clock speed of 5.3GHz). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VMrgTD"&gt;That’s because Intel is debuting a new desktop core architecture for the first time in over half a decade with its 11th Gen Rocket Lake-S chips called Cypress Cove. Cypress Cove &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; replaces the Skylake microarchitecture, which the company has been using &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/5/9094209/intel-skylake-processor-launch-release-date-price"&gt;since its 6th Gen chips in 2015&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4lvLwV9jYNOecGilzRSPI9kIcww=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22373642/RKL_Family_Shot_2.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2frwpD"&gt;But the Cypress Cove design isn’t actually a whole new microarchitecture — it’s actually Intel’s Willow Cove chip designs and technologies that the company has been using on its 11th Gen 10nm Tiger Lake chips which Intel is backporting to its 14nm production process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lTEtbj"&gt;Since those designs were meant for 10nm chips, though, Intel is limited in the number of cores it can fit when scaling them up to a 14nm size; hence, the reduction in core count year over year. But Intel still says that the new chips will offer better performance (at least, in some cases) than the 10th Gen, with the core architecture enabling up to 19 percent IPC (instructions per cycle) than the previous generation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5YFK78"&gt;Intel’s argument here is effectively that sheer core count isn’t enough on its own — frequency speed and performance matters, too, and thanks to the maturity of the 14nm production process, Intel is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good at cranking out every last drop of performance from these chips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KldjYw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10394413"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LXauO5"&gt;And Intel’s benchmarks (obviously) support that argument: head to head with last year’s Core i9-10900K, the i9-11900K offered between 8 to 14 percent better performance on games like &lt;em&gt;Gears 5&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Grid 2019&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Total War: Three Kingdoms&lt;/em&gt;. Intel also says that its top chip outperforms AMD’s flagship Ryzen 9 5900X processor for those titles, although by slightly smaller margins (between 3 and 11 percent better, according to Intel’s benchmarks). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hbfGf1"&gt;That said, Intel’s tests were all running at 1080p, so we’ll have to stay tuned for more comprehensive benchmarking down the line on a wider range of titles — and particularly, at 4K resolution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="q5HXgI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10395264"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j4sEvJ"&gt;The new architecture also brings other improvements, with up to 50 percent better integrated graphics compared to Gen9 thanks to the company’s new Xe graphics, with one-third more EUs than its Gen9 graphics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f5T3r3"&gt;Given that these are desktop chips that will almost certainly be paired with a high-end discrete graphics card, that’s not the most groundbreaking improvement, however. And  while Intel will be offering several F-series models of the new chips without GPUs, the overall design is still the same on those models. That means that Intel isn’t going to be offering any niche models that ditch integrated GPUs to try to fit in more cores, at least for now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZdGkO4"&gt;The new chips also feature other improvements. The 11th Gen chips add Resizable BAR, for a frame rate boost on compatible Nvidia and AMD graphics cards. There’s built-in support for both USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 at 20Gbps as well as Intel’s own Thunderbolt 4, along with DDR4-3200 RAM. And Intel has added four additional Gen 4 PCIe lanes, for a total of 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qJpJPh"&gt;As is traditional for a major new chip launch, Intel is also introducing its 500 series motherboards alongside the new processors, but the Rocket Lake-S CPUs will also be backwards compatible with 400 series motherboards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E1IB8U"&gt;Additionally, there’s some new overclocking options with the new chips for users looking to squeeze out even more power. Specifically, Intel’s Extreme Tuning Utility software is getting refreshed with a new UI and some updated features alongside the 11th Gen chips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mTEXOO"&gt;The new 11th Gen Intel desktop processors are available starting today. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google will reduce Play Store cut to 15 percent for a developer’s first $1M in annual revenue</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m3q3rP0mZHdCqX8Bv3X0kNapHgA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68974840/acastro_201005_1777_googleAntiTrust_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xe9ZA4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/03/boosting-dev-success.html"&gt;Google is reducing&lt;/a&gt; its long-standing 30 percent cut, which it takes from each Play Store digital purchase for all Android developers around the world, on the first $1 million they make on the digital storefront each year, starting on July 1st. According to Google, that change means that 99 percent of Android developers that “that sell digital goods or services” will see a 50 percent reduction in fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="al4tx8"&gt;Google’s news follows &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;Apple’s announcement of a reduced 15 percent fee&lt;/a&gt; last year as part of a new small business program, with one critical difference: &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/"&gt;Apple’s fee reduction&lt;/a&gt; only applies to developers that make under $1 million per year. But if an app maker goes over the $1 million threshold at any point in the year, they’ll be booted from Apple’s program and subject to the standard 30 percent rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="TGVgNE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple will reduce App Store cut to 15 percent for most developers starting January 1st","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Srf6VB"&gt;Google’s program is a flat cut to the first $1 million developers make each year. That means whether you’re a student making your first app or a multibillion-dollar company, the first $1 million you make on the Play Store each year will only get charged a 15 percent service fee by Google. Any money you make after that will then be subject to the usual 30 percent cut. A Google spokesperson says the company felt that applying the reduced fees equally to all companies was a fair approach in line with Google’s goals of helping developers of all sizes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gpyMF5"&gt;Google has charged a 30 percent cut for any purchases through the Google Play Store since it first launched as the “&lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2008/10/android-market-now-available-for-users.html"&gt;Android Market&lt;/a&gt;” — although originally, the company claimed that “Google does not take a percentage,” with the 30 percent cut going toward “carriers and billing settlement fees.” In its more modern incarnation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/3/6/2848223/google-play-store-rebranded-android-market"&gt;as the Play Store&lt;/a&gt;, Google now puts &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/112622?hl=en"&gt;that 30 percent cut&lt;/a&gt; toward its “distribution partner and operating fees.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mGOg33"&gt;The 30 percent fee has been constant for the lifespan of Google’s storefront. The only exception is subscriptions: in 2018, Google (in another similar move to Apple) announced that it would reduce &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/19/16502152/google-play-store-android-apple-app-store-subscription-revenue-cut"&gt;its cut down to 15 percent&lt;/a&gt; for subscription products after users had been subscribed for a full year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ira93E"&gt;The number of developers that make more than $1 million each year — and will end up still being charged the full 30 percent — is proportionally tiny. Google notes that only about 3 percent of Android developers actually charge for either downloading their apps or for digital in-app purchases to begin with, and only 1 percent of &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; developers make more than the $1 million threshold that would see the 30 percent cut kick in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Ulioxr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Fortnite for Android has also been kicked off the Google Play Store","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368079/fortnite-epic-android-banned-google-play-app-store-rule-violation"},{"title":"Epic is suing Google over Fortnite’s removal from the Google Play Store","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368363/epic-google-fortnite-lawsuit-antitrust-app-play-store-apple-removal"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="RCZbld"&gt;The new policy also comes at a critical moment when Google (and Apple’s) app store policies are under intense public scrutiny, kicked off by the removal of Epic Games’ &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; from both the App Store and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368363/epic-google-fortnite-lawsuit-antitrust-app-play-store-apple-removal"&gt;Play Store&lt;/a&gt; and the game developer’s subsequent antitrust lawsuits against Apple and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368363/epic-google-fortnite-lawsuit-antitrust-app-play-store-apple-removal"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2DBj5"&gt;The issue is also coming to a head in legislation, with states like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22309284/arizona-app-store-bill-2005-apple-30-percent-cut-bypass-legislation"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286234/apple-app-store-north-dakota-bill-sb-2333-failed-vote"&gt;North Dakota&lt;/a&gt; debating new laws that would force Apple and Google to offer more alternative software distribution methods and payment options on their platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DAScal"&gt;Epic Games, however, still says that Google’s new measure isn’t nearly far enough, noting that it “does not address the root of the issue,” and arguing that “Android needs to be fully open to competition, with a genuinely level playing field among platform companies, app creators, and service providers. Competition in payment processing and app distribution is the only path to a fair app marketplace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9YfGJP"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It's scary for the tech industry to that see Google and Apple aligning their monopolistic policies in near lock-step. In a free app market, rates would be much lower for all due to competition, and not subject to their divide-and-conquer tactics.&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1371854312507330561?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nMQfnT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 16th, 11:50am:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added Epic Games statement, and clarified Android developer groups that will see a reduction of fees.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite’s experimental storytelling continues with a brief, thrilling single-player event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WAJHx7vAwjZi8SMNLhIfm_OCljk=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68974775/16BR_Gameplay_Screenshots_Cinematic_Still6_1920x1080_logo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iNWgWF"&gt;I woke up at 3AM this morning so I could help a glowing butterfly save all of reality. At least I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; that’s what happened during the most recent mind-bending &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; event, which kicked off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22332371/fortnite-chapter-2-season-6-primal-battle-pass-tomb-raider-neymar"&gt;the game’s new season&lt;/a&gt; and served as a showcase for its narrative ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vW4tn9"&gt;Epic’s battle royale has become defined in part by its massive in-game events. There was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/30/17521122/fortnite-rocket-launch-epic-games-dimensional-rift"&gt;the original rocket launch in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/20/20701930/fortnite-epic-games-live-event-mecha-monster-battle-showdown-giant-robot"&gt;the sprawling mech vs. kaiju battle&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/14/20913541/fortnite-game-shutdown-black-hole-event-storytelling"&gt;a black hole that erased the original &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; island&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/13/20909812/fortnite-down-black-hole-chapter-2-the-end"&gt;took the game down for several days&lt;/a&gt;. Last season ended with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21747893/fortnite-galactus-event-chapter-2-season-5-release-date"&gt;Marvel villain Galactus fighting millions of players&lt;/a&gt;, creating a rift that caused multiple realities to converge. These events have been exciting in part because they were shared, something that &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; players could experience together. But the most recent was different: an attempt to squeeze a more traditional single-player narrative into one of the world’s biggest multiplayer games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iv70hZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[This story contains light spoilers for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fortnite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;’s latest story event.]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9lZUZf"&gt;It started out, as most video games do, with a cutscene. Players watched as Agent Jones, who is steadily becoming the game’s main character, made his way through a raging battle in an attempt to reach a giant, glowing orb at the center of the island. After getting past terminators and xenomorphs, he’s finally greeted by a mysterious character named The Foundation, who agrees to help him. That’s where you came in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HIbB3h"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xNWaHd8tj2E?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2Skbx0"&gt;Once the game resumed, it wasn’t the regular battle royale. Instead, it was a single-player experience where you had to help Jones — who, at one point, is transformed into a glowing butterfly — close dimensional rifts that are opening up across the island. Gameplay-wise, the sequence was relatively simple. You followed the instructions of butterfly Jones while using a high-tech gun to close dimensional rifts as if you were squeezing a Zip-Loc bag shut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rk8CtJ"&gt;Waves of energy pulsed out, changing reality itself; at various points, my character was transformed into a walking chicken and, later, Lara Croft. You couldn’t die or fail, but there was still a sense of urgency. Battles flicked in and out of existence around you, blockbuster action movie music blared in the background, Jones yelled things like “reality is breaking down,” and the whole thing ended with a strange, mysterious spire rising out of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NqZX9x"&gt;Despite its single-player nature, the season 6 event built off of narrative techniques Epic has been refining for years now. There’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/10/18537469/fortnite-map-island-history-neo-tilted-volcano"&gt;the environmental storytelling aspect&lt;/a&gt;, for starters. In the days leading up to season 6, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; players could see giant ribbons of energy spread across the island, pulsating as if something was about to happen. Meanwhile, that giant orb has been an impossible-to-miss presence the entire season. And now that the event is over, the spire is the island’s new focal point, with a completely changed landscape all around it. The event also made small but notable references to &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s past; longtime players will recognize that butterfly from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/4/18057306/fortnite-fortnitemares-end-cube-gone"&gt;the 2018 event in which a giant cube exploded&lt;/a&gt;, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2up9BA"&gt;It was also heavy on the mystery. I’d be hard-pressed to give you a complete rundown of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; lore, or explain exactly what the “zero point” is, but that doesn’t make hunting down scraps of info any less fascinating. And like its predecessors, the season 6 kickoff was also just a great spectacle. It was short, thrilling, and full of some incredible eye candy, like when the orb blossomed into a stunning flower made of light.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VNm6RVBffklToEWi1Uv8efQkvOI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22374418/Fortnite_20210316040800.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OxBv0X"&gt;There’s a cynical take on all of this. The idea of multiple realities converging also happens to be ideal for a developer that makes money by selling licensed skins, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22242696/fortnite-predator-marketing-brands-cross-promotion"&gt;which were almost overwhelming in number during season 5&lt;/a&gt;. While this season’s battle pass features brand-new characters tied directly to the new storyline, like an assassin obsessed with the spire, there are also skins from &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Teen Titans&lt;/em&gt; and an upcoming virtual rendition of soccer star Neymar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eTSK8m"&gt;But it’s also clear that storytelling is becoming an increasingly important part of the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; experience, and Epic has shown that it’s not afraid to try new things. In the past, tools like audio logs and chatty non-playable characters have been crammed into the frantic battle royale action. Now we have a single-player event. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/30/17521342/fortnite-rocket-launch-one-time-event-killed-twitter"&gt;It doesn’t always work smoothly&lt;/a&gt;, but this experimental approach shows no signs of letting up. And as today’s explosive sequence shows, it’s also making the game more interesting as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Get a one-year Paramount Plus subscription for half off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HMqTABAahq04znOTJnKOHRi4FgQ=/88x0:1033x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68974746/Paramount_Plus.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: ViacomCBS&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gNbBu6"&gt;Earlier this month, streaming service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299615/paramount-plus-launch-date-price-cbs-all-access-shows-movies"&gt;CBS All Access was rebranded as Paramount Plus&lt;/a&gt;, combining the franchises and assets from both Viacom and CBS. It offers a wide range of TV shows and movies available to stream from studios and networks such as CBS, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, and Paramount Pictures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bqt494"&gt;If you are interested in &lt;a href="https://paramountplus.qflm.net/c/482924/1013037/3065?subId1=VergeDeals031621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paramountplus.com%2F"&gt;subscribing to Paramount Plus and want to save some money&lt;/a&gt;, you can get a one-year subscription with ads for $30, or get a one-year subscription with no ads for only $50. There are a few steps you need to follow to apply the code, however. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zCx2Y1"&gt;First, you will need to go to the Paramount Plus website, click “Try It Free,” and choose the plan you want; at the bottom of the subscription plans, check the box that reads “Save over 15% off the monthly price with an annual plan.” Then create an account. When you reach the payment section, apply the promotional code &lt;strong&gt;YEAR&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout, and you will save 50 percent on your one-year subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fbzTQ7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10394994"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HykxKL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07V2BBMK4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734996775790451200#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-lite-gray%2F204518.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt; are running a promotion that lets you get a free $20 gift card when you purchase Nintendo’s compact handheld, the Switch Lite. The $20 gift card you receive will be for whichever retailer you buy the handheld from, and all of the Switch Lite colors (blue, coral, gray, yellow) are all eligible for the promotion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ml5IgN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10394076"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q7IXo5"&gt;If your current Wi-Fi router hasn’t been cutting it or is doing a subpar job at pushing a signal to every corner of your home, it is smart to upgrade your router system. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08M9T9692/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; has a promotion where you can buy a three-pack of Eero 6 dual-band routers for only $279. When planning your setup, keep in mind that the Eero 6 mesh router includes two Ethernet ports per unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="z0NBBT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9536532"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2AxM5K"&gt;Yesterday, we saw Sony’s high-end WH-1000XM4 headphones get discounted to $278 at retailers such as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0863TXGM3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734965648436259588#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and those deals are still available. But &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fsowh100xm4ba.html%3Fsterm%3Dwpoxs3UBGxyLTjVxTSQPxVT4UkEVDW2mWQ-N3A0%26utm_source%3Drflaid914099&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDeals03162021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt; has price-matched these retailers, and it is also throwing in a 20,800mAh power bank for no extra cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="S4HUOt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10303430"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p id="kDNMAO"&gt;Facebook wants to be a part of the newsletter business, and it’s willing to pay for it. &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-paying-writers-journalists-pages-0b96d3cd-e61b-4435-9f54-99aed136f932.html"&gt;reports today&lt;/a&gt; that the company will soon start testing its newsletter product, which will integrate with Pages. As part of that test, Facebook will also court writers, some of whom the company will pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Enshkz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t name any writers and says the product itself is still unnamed, but it also reports the initial user group will be composed of small and independent writers. This newsletter tool will also help writers set up a website outside Facebook. The idea is that writers can charge for subscriptions to their work and potentially create additional revenue streams while relying on Facebook to engage their community. Facebook will let them create Groups for their work as well, and it will also provide metrics on their newsletters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Mxeu4N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The product is still unnamed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p2cV2A"&gt;The push from Facebook comes as the newsletter business is building significant momentum across the industry. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22159571/substack-ceo-chris-best-interview-newsletter-subscription-model-journalism-decoder-podcast"&gt;Substack&lt;/a&gt;, most notably, has paid advances to multiple writers in order to bring them over to its platform. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s former Silicon Valley editor Casey Newton now runs his newsletter, &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/"&gt;Platformer&lt;/a&gt;, through Substack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DLrfxc"&gt;Seeing the success that writers are having on the platform, Twitter acquired newsletter platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250156/twitter-revue-newsletter-acquisition-email-service"&gt;Revue in January&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to keep them in the Twitter ecosystem. The difference between Twitter’s efforts and Substack and Facebook’s is Twitter hasn’t yet specifically sought out writers to pay. Doing so could suggest an editorial slant, although Substack co-founder Hamish McKenzie &lt;a href="https://blog.substack.com/p/why-we-pay-writers"&gt;views them&lt;/a&gt; as “business decisions, not editorial ones.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K7GskE"&gt;Facebook, which already receives criticism from both liberals and conservatives in the US for the way it moderates its platform, might face backlash to its newsletter product, particularly depending on which writers it seeks out for the program.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GoPro relaunches its smartphone app as Quik, adds private feed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CrwZ9aavuhr55J7xu3EqwqAify0=/154x0:2176x1348/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68974451/Screen_Shot_2021_03_16_at_8.43.54_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X1771D"&gt;GoPro is releasing a new version of its main smartphone app that will now be called “Quik.” The new app will remain the main interface for connecting to and controlling GoPro cameras, but it is also getting new features, including one called “mural” that’s sort of like a private Instagram feed meant to help people organize their favorite images and videos — regardless of whether they were taken by a GoPro camera — and save them from the “abyss of your camera roll,” GoPro CEO Nick Woodman says in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OcjzPV"&gt;Close followers of GoPro’s efforts in the software space know that the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/3/11571528/gopro-mobile-video-editing-apps-quik-splice"&gt;already once launched an app called Quik way back in 2016&lt;/a&gt; that was all about auto-editing footage to a beat. But that app has not been supported for a while and will no longer be available to download after today with the launch of the new Quik app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gpODeM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Camera control, video editing, and a private social media-style feed all in one place&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YscBgk"&gt;The auto-editing feature will live on in the new app, which launches on iOS and Android today. It also has a few other features like a video editing suite (including a speed adjustment tool), themes and filters, and unlimited original quality cloud backup of everything posted to the mural feed. GoPro is charging $1.99 per month or $9.99 per year for those features, though the basic camera connection and control side the app will remain free to use for people who don’t want to pay for the new stuff. Customers who already pay for GoPro’s Plus subscription service (which includes unlimited cloud storage, live-streaming functionality, and camera replacement) will get Quik’s features for free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cSmFtI"&gt;Woodman sees the new Quik app as something of a culmination of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/2/11837018/gopro-storyteller-desktop-app-video-editor-ceo-nick-woodman-interview"&gt;a yearslong effort at GoPro to diversify away from hardware&lt;/a&gt; that started around 2013 and 2014. And by gearing the app at a wider audience, not just GoPro users, he thinks there’s great opportunity to be had. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OYvuw0"&gt;In fact, that was&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the strategy with the original Quik app, which let users mash together photos and videos from their camera roll without requiring the use of a GoPro. And it worked: Woodman says that app still had “roughly eight million monthly active users” despite having been essentially abandoned by the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wljOX3"&gt;While he doesn’t expect all of those users to pony up for the paid version of the new app, he thinks many will appreciate the mural feature because he still doesn’t see any good solutions to that camera roll clutter problem — especially not albums. “Albums suck. Albums are just miniature camera rolls,” he says. “You don’t go into albums [thinking] ‘This is going to be a super awesome experience. Hey honey, let’s AirPlay our album to the TV and kick back and reminisce.’ You don’t do that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="g53Rve"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Albums suck.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UBRTcY"&gt;Users can build out the mural feed in the Quik app a few different ways. One is fairly straightforward: after you open the Quik app and give it access to your camera roll, you can scroll through and add photos to the mural feed or to “events” (not albums, of course) on the feed. The more attractive option, in Woodman’s eyes, is to add photos and videos you take on the fly using the share sheet every time you capture a “keeper.” (Users can also text or email photos to the mural feed.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ALqafL"&gt;That said, Woodman thinks people may use the feed in all sorts of ways, like saving images that inspire them or for planning a project, a la Pinterest. Others will just use it for their GoPro footage and photos and nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XmGWzk"&gt;“It can be all of those things,” he says. “I think that what we’re solving for people is like a very relatable and widespread problem: I don’t have a convenient, private place to put content that matters most to me, and you know what, sharing it to your Instagram feed ain’t working because there’s that tension of, ‘Well, this matters to me, but I know it’s not going to really matter to anybody that I would socialize it with.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rmeMLI"&gt;GoPro has carved out a decent supplemental business so far with its Plus subscription service, with nearly 800,000 paying subscribers as of the end of 2020 (the equivalent of just shy of roughly $40 million of annual revenue). But with Quik, Woodman sees not just a great business opportunity or a chance to reach new customers. He sees it serving a higher purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LnucgS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I think that what we’re solving for people is like a very relatable and widespread problem”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GAOzCy"&gt;“Not to bash on social feeds, like there’s a lot of good from them, we get a lot of inspiration from what other people are doing. But damn it, man, you can get a lot of inspiration from just looking at what you’ve been doing with your life. It’s pretty awesome,” he says. “This is the cosmic moment where I point to the deeper meaning behind what it is that we’re doing for people with Quik, because I think we’re really going to help people develop a stronger sense of self-esteem, self-worth, and ultimately happiness. You don’t have to find happiness in what other people are doing. There’s a ton of happiness to be found in what you’re doing with your life and and Quik helps you bring that to the forefront.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sw5dmd"&gt;Philosophical value aside, bringing more customers under the GoPro tent has long been a goal for Woodman; it’s a big part of what inspired the company to make a more concerted push into software. But whether or not GoPro turns the new Quik app into a moneymaker, that it’s attempting another shift in its software strategy is on its own a sign that the company is back on solid ground. It spent the last few years pruning its camera lineup back to the essentials, quickly scuttling a dalliance with the drone market, and focusing more on selling directly to consumers. That has the company back in the black and willing to take chances again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="89QBRw"&gt;“We’re known for enabling amazing content. It’s just until now, it’s always required a GoPro,” Woodman says. “[But it’s] too limiting to just serve people through our hardware alone. Let’s also serve people through software. Meet them where they are. And we can build a phenomenal business.”&lt;/p&gt;
