    <title>Don’t invest in SPACs just because of celebrity endorsements, SEC says</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Shaq wearing Magic Leap One headset" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z-eQTLRNW4O66hvYItDNGdy7dWY=/69x0:980x607/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68943386/Screen_Shot_2018_02_13_at_7.55.37_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.recode.net/2018/2/9/16997086/how-to-watch-live-livestream-rony-abovitz-magic-leap-adam-silver-nba-augmented-reality-code-media" target="_blank"&gt;Recode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mnNtav"&gt;Today, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has found the growing trend of celebrity-endorsed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs)&lt;/a&gt; dangerous enough &lt;a href="https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-alerts/celebrity"&gt;to warn investors in a new statement&lt;/a&gt;: just because a celebrity is participating in or endorsing a SPAC, doesn’t mean you should invest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xf483W"&gt;The terminology can be complicated, but the SEC’s advice is fairly simple. Like if any stranger recommended you invest in a business (in this case, one trying to merge with other companies to take them public), there are a lot of unknowns that should be accounted for. “Celebrities, like anyone else, can be lured into participating in a risky investment,” writes the SEC’s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy. Celebrities, many already being wealthy and successful, “may be better able to sustain the risk of loss.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UzGGJO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Celebrity endorsements don’t make investments any safer&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YEb5XP"&gt;Additionally, as part of the deal to be an initial investor or sponsor for a SPAC, celebrities might have economic arrangements that are different from the average shareholder. As much as I’d want to trust Papa John’s board member and basketball star Shaquille O’Neal’s choice in acquiring a specific “audience aggregation platform” (something &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/korihale/2020/10/20/shaq-moves-into-spacs-with-former-disney-execs--mlk-jrs-son/?sh=41ae8a7c6c77"&gt;he’s apparently looking to get into&lt;/a&gt;), he might be earning far more than you or I ever will off our likely riskier investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kLYyYK"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;“The rapid increase in the volume of SPACs represents a significant change and we are taking a hard look at the disclosures and other structural issues surrounding SPACs,” said John Coates, Acting Director of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance. &lt;a href="https://t.co/3SYLtF2ehj"&gt;https://t.co/3SYLtF2ehj&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— SEC_News (@SEC_News) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SEC_News/status/1369669846670209027?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="snBBtf"&gt;The timing for this warning (noted in the tweet above) is directly connected to the exponential growth in the interest in SPACs, from bringing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266661/genetic-health-23andme-public-spac-richard-branson"&gt;23andMe public&lt;/a&gt; to basically swallowing every &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22247942/faraday-future-spac-merger-public-psac-property-solutions-nasdaq"&gt;electric&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22268085/lucid-motors-spac-merger-public-nyse-cciv-deal-air-sedan"&gt;vehicle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/18/21374272/canoo-ev-startup-spac-ipo-reverse-merger"&gt;startup&lt;/a&gt; you’ve heard of. The SEC has seen fit to step in to warn investors and caution celebrities in these kinds of situations in the past, specifically requiring stars to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/2/16597870/sec-warns-celebrities-endorsement-ico-cryptocurrency"&gt;disclose how much they’re compensated&lt;/a&gt; to advertise cryptocurrency initial coin offerings (ICOs). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lj3guA"&gt;SPACs aren’t going away, and in a culture where many wealthy celebrities are also wealthy investors — or where investors like Chamath Palihapitiya &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-spac-man-chamath-palihapitiya-speaks-reddit-and-wall-street-listen-11615006818"&gt;can wield celebrity-like influence&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/05/chamath-palihapitiya-sells-virgin-galactic-spce-stake.html"&gt;a company and its accompanying value&lt;/a&gt; — seeing past the glamour and bluster is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JUpwaQ"&gt;“Even if a celebrity is involved in a SPAC, investing in one may not be a good idea for you. Before investing, always do your research,” writes the SEC. We all want, nay, &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to be friends with Shaq, but that doesn’t mean our money needs to.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Store will now show you what languages Xbox games support</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YOUNsFQFsWwTzfQm8RFKukEip7U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68943254/acastro_190530_1777_xbox_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4tFllp"&gt;Microsoft is updating its store for Xbox and Xbox Game Pass to include language support, the company &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/03/10/discover-games-on-xbox-in-your-preferred-language/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; today. The Languages label is meant to make it “easier to decide if you’d like to purchase or play that title” by including information on the game’s interface, audio, and subtitles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ID2o9D"&gt;Whatever language console owners have set as their default will display first. The feature applies to 27 languages and displays how localization has been applied to various parts of the game, such as controls, subtitles, or spoken dialogue. “We’ve already added language tags to hundreds of games and will add more over time,” the announcement reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dmEDit"&gt;Fans have previously &lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/dear-xbox-if-you-want-reach-2-billion-gamers-you-need-fix-your-localization"&gt;criticized&lt;/a&gt; Microsoft’s handling of localization, specifically outside of the US. As reported by &lt;em&gt;Windows Central&lt;/em&gt;, players in territories like South Korea have documented which games support Korean languages. Platforms like Nintendo and Steam already support language guides. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZrDKHD"&gt;Microsoft will continue to add updates later this year to “make it even easier for you to find and play games that are right for you.” The company did not specify what those changes would look like. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon withholds its ebooks from libraries because it prefers you pay it instead</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t60rOpIo0uJ9K1qMMEjY4m40X4k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68943228/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lfLnWD"&gt;Amazon is withholding ebook and audiobook versions of works it publishes through its in-house publishing arms from US libraries, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/10/amazon-library-ebook-monopoly/"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, Amazon is the only major publisher that’s doing this, the report states. It’s doing so because the company thinks the terms involved with selling digital versions of books to libraries, which in turn make them available to local residents for free through ebook lending platforms like Libby, are unfavorable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PwORnG"&gt;“It’s not clear to us that current digital library lending models fairly balance the interests of authors and library patrons,” Mikyla Bruder, the global marketing chief at Amazon Publishing, told &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;’s Geoffrey Fowler in an emailed statement. “We see this as an opportunity to invent a new approach to help expand readership and serve library patrons, while at the same time safeguarding author interests, including income and royalties.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3xKa8P"&gt;At the heart of the issue is a debate over whether libraries, which often pay far higher than retail price for physical and ebook copies of books, ultimately harm publisher sales by letting people check out copies for free. In the age of mobile apps and widespread Kindle usage, borrowing an ebook is now easier than ever — you need a library card and the Libby app, and you can then place holds and eventually check out ebooks that can be sent directly to your Kindle e-reader or app to access for a limited time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cDDitd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s not clear to us that current digital library lending models fairly balance the interests of authors and library patrons.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IW7N21"&gt;Yet publishers, not authors, decide the fate of a book’s various distribution deals, and Amazon apparently does not want libraries lending its ebooks, at least not under whatever terms have been discussed. That means many of the authors the company has signed onto its publishing imprints — like Mindy Kaling, Trevor Noah, Andy Weir, and Michael Pollan — are available to read only if you pay the full retail price. That’s true when those same authors have expressed support for libraries and free book lending, as Pollan has to &lt;em&gt;The Post&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fn4uEU"&gt;Amazon is reportedly negotiating with a nonprofit, the Digital Public Library of America, to coordinate the selling of its ebooks to libraries, but &lt;em&gt;The Post &lt;/em&gt;notes that the deal would not include any self-published works or Audible audiobooks. And making matters worse, Amazon is allegedly not negotiating — and hasn’t for years — a serious deal with OverDrive, the maker of the Libby app that’s used by many libraries around the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JrvKF6"&gt;Instead, OverDrive CEO Steve Potash tells &lt;em&gt;The Post &lt;/em&gt;the company and Amazon have an &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;ongoing dialogue” in which OverDerive has communicated its “willingness to innovate in an effort to support their business strategy.” Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GmyAbT"&gt;As Fowler notes in his report, six of the top 10 ebooks sold on Amazon, the dominant ebook platform in the US, were published by Amazon, making them ineligible for library loans because Amazon won’t sell them. Amazon does sell physical copies of books it publishes to libraries (when it’s not running ebook-exclusive promotions), Fowler notes, but the coronavirus pandemic has made Libby and ebook lending a vital source for those interested in borrowing books from the safety of their home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="90zul4"&gt;“The eBook titles from Amazon Publishing are not available to libraries for lending at any price or any terms. By contrast, consumers may purchase all of these titles directly from Amazon,” argued the nonprofit American Library Association in October 2019 as part of a &lt;a href="http://www.ala.org/news/sites/ala.org.news/files/content/mediapresscenter/CompetitionDigitalMarkets.pdf"&gt;congressional testimony&lt;/a&gt; detailing the dangers of publishers’ tightening grip on library access. “This is a particularly pernicious new form of the digital divide; the Amazon Publishing books are available only to people who can afford to buy them, without the library alternative previously available to generations of Americans.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1STtw1"&gt;Amazon’s longstanding decision to prevent libraries from lending its ebooks underscores the company’s immense influence in the world of bookselling and publishing. The company became the dominant online seller of books in the US many years ago, and it cemented that dominance with the Kindle line of e-readers and eventually a robust multifaceted publishing platform for both professional writers and self-publishing authors that includes numerous imprints under the larger Amazon Publishing umbrella. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="g56emx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is a particularly pernicious new form of the digital divide.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="equOpz"&gt;Amazon’s power in the bookselling and publishing worlds has created a contentious relationship between the company and authors, traditional publishers, and various other links in the publishing chain, most notably when Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/11/13/7214703/amazon-hachette-resolve-ebooks-dispute"&gt;engaged in a high-profile and often bitter licensing negotiation&lt;/a&gt; with major book publisher Hachette. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dq1tPL"&gt;Many of these disputes can be drawn back to arguments over the digital distribution of ebooks — specifically the thorny mess surrounding ebook pricing, royalties, and secondary distribution like lending and reselling or sharing. Perhaps you remember the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Apple_Inc."&gt;landmark 2010 antitrust case against Apple&lt;/a&gt; and its book publisher partners over price fixing. It led to a stunning victory for Amazon and sanctioned its strategy of pricing ebooks lower than hardcover and paperbacks, against the wishes of the publishers that felt they had no choice but to sell on the dominant US e-commerce platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="07TCMP"&gt;In this case, Amazon is again setting its own terms and using its dominance as a major US bookseller and publisher to break from industry norms. But instead of lowering prices for customers, which arguably won Amazon public favor in its antitrust fight against Apple and the major book publishers a decade ago, the company is withholding books from libraries. These are often underfunded public institutions geared toward providing access to knowledge and resources to children, the poor, and homeless individuals. But for Amazon, there is apparently a better deal to be had, leaving library users in the lurch. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook adds a path to partnership for its Level Up creators</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The word facebook in white against a blue background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SfIiMIsHT-Yu9oNuvKDxvCM0xcM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68942912/acastro_180522_facebook_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aKsdpL"&gt;Facebook Gaming has announced a &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/622800001735064"&gt;path to partnership&lt;/a&gt; for streamers in its Level Up creators program, which is the site’s equivalent of Twitch’s affiliates. It’s pretty grueling, and eligibility isn’t judged on the same metrics as its Level Up program, which allows streamers to start monetizing their broadcasts. Partners, however, get a slew of benefits, including a direct line to Facebook’s support team, a private Facebook Gaming community group, partner-only invites to Facebook Gaming events, a partner badge, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2478459059124998"&gt;and more&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OFksB5"&gt;Streamers in the Level Up program, on the other hand, are able to monetize their streams with Facebook Stars, a site currency, and fan subscriptions; they also get features like high-quality transcoding (i.e., 1080p 60fps streams) and access to beta products and features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YihCPU"&gt;To be eligible for the Level Up program, gaming creators on Facebook have to stream games for four hours in the prior two weeks on at least two separate days in that same period. They also need at least 100 followers on a page that’s been active for more than two weeks. The admin of said page needs to be older than 18. These metrics are pretty reasonable and just about comparable to Twitch’s program metrics for its affiliate program (reach 50 followers, stream for eight hours on seven different days, with an average of three viewers in a one-month period). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SoqBHh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Eligibility for Facebook Gaming’s partnership program is judged on “engaged followers”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vuqRQj"&gt;Eligibility for Facebook Gaming’s partnership program, on the other hand, is judged on “engaged followers” — Facebook’s way of tracking the people who regularly return to your stream — and Stars revenue. To be considered for the partnership program, a gaming creator needs to have 3,000 engaged followers and earn $2,000 (200,000 stars) in a month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lt1wAU"&gt;Twitch’s partnership program has different requirements: streamers must broadcast for 25 hours on 12 different days with an average of 75 viewers in a month. It also has a reputation for being notoriously difficult to achieve. Those metrics seem fairly reasonable on their face, but in practice, it’s hard to hit those numbers &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;get Twitch to approve your application. &lt;em&gt;Many&lt;/em&gt; streamers apply more than once before making it into &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/partners/faq/"&gt;the 27,000-strong club&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aK8wFK"&gt;What’s most interesting about Facebook’s partnership requirements is that they didn’t have a clear path to being verified as a gaming creator on the site before; it’s also fascinating that there are just two requirements, and one is tied explicitly to how much money a creator earns on the site. ($2,000 works out to about 200,000 bits or 800 $5 subscriptions — Twitch takes a 50 percent cut.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x46EHM"&gt;A spokesperson for Facebook Gaming told me in an email that more than 2,000 creators earn at least $1,000 a month on the site, though they presumably are including the current slate of Facebook Gaming partners — streamers like Cory “King Gothalion” Michael, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20936859/mixer-twitch-king-gothalion-shroud-ninja"&gt;who left Twitch for an exclusive Mixer deal&lt;/a&gt; in October 2019 and who then moved to Facebook Gaming after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21300245/mixer-failed-microsoft-social-media-instagram-streaming"&gt;Mixer shut down&lt;/a&gt; — in those numbers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yJrdOf"&gt;Some Level Up streamers will absolutely hit Facebook’s numbers for partnership immediately, but I wouldn’t be surprised if the requirements become less onerous over time. After all, back in 2015, streamers on Twitch used to have to average more than 500 concurrents a stream to be considered for partnership. As one &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/382yab/twitchs_very_high_requirement_to_be_a_partner/"&gt;Reddit post&lt;/a&gt; from that era lamented: “500... 500 viewers on average, every time you stream. This seems an almost impossibility? Anyone had experience with twitch partnering?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TXk9Z0"&gt;While they still stream — and cast and produce &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt; tournaments — they still haven’t made partner. It’s important to remember that the creator economy is just as unequal as the real one. By Twitch’s own count, there are now around 27,000 partners on its site. &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/partners/faq/"&gt;But that’s out of 2,000,000 other active broadcasters&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8fjJsw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWJ2rT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="taDk8x"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJudr1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kia releases teaser images of its next electric car, the EV6</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N4Q0dQrFUXqlYIjJ1FH6BWSIBbc=/0x27:620x440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68942902/kwcms_620x466_front.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Kia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1OTpnL"&gt;Kia has given its next electric vehicle a name and is getting ready to pull the cover off the new car sometime within the next few weeks. Dubbed “EV6,” it’ll be the first electric vehicle that Kia is building on the new platform it’s sharing with parent company Hyundai — the same platform that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22261893/apple-electric-car-hyundai-ming-chi-kuo-rumor-report"&gt;Apple was reportedly interested in using&lt;/a&gt; to power... whatever it’s building before talks with the Korean automakers broke down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SIJegZ"&gt;Kia released a few images of the car viewed off-angle from the sides, which reveal that the EV6 has a sort of hatchback-style shape. There’s a close-up image of a taillight, which appears to run across the entire rear of the car — a choice that’s becoming quite common in electric vehicle designs. Kia &lt;a href="https://www.kia.com/eu/about-kia/ev6/"&gt;also released a video with shots&lt;/a&gt; of the taillight illuminating, as well as one of the EV6’s headlights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="dayVyp"&gt;The EV6 is the second electric vehicle to be recently announced that’s being built on the shared platform, which is called E-GMP. The other &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296991/hyundai-ioniq-5-electric-suv-ev-battery-range-specs"&gt;was Hyundai’s Ioniq 5&lt;/a&gt;, which broke cover in February. &lt;/p&gt;

The EV6 is supposed to get a full reveal sometime in the first quarter of 2021, according to Kia, which means it’s likely right around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="I84eno"&gt;The Miami Heat has suspended Meyers Leonard indefinitely after he used an anti-Semitic slur during a Twitch stream on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jx8R43"&gt;“The Miami Heat vehemently condemns the use of any form of hate speech,” the NBA team wrote in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MiamiHEAT/status/1369483385882689541"&gt;Twitter statement on Tuesday evening&lt;/a&gt;. “The words used by Meyers Leonard were wrong and we will not tolerate hateful language from anyone associated with our franchise.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zu1rcW"&gt;In a statement apologizing for his actions &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CMN-G35DdD9/"&gt;posted to Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, Leonard says he wasn’t aware of the meaning of the slur when he said it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YbIxkf"&gt;“While I didn’t know what the word meant at the time, my ignorance about its history and how offensive it is to the Jewish community is absolutely not an excuse and I was just wrong,” he said. “I am now more aware of its meaning and I am committed to properly seeking out people who can help educate me about this type of hate and how we can fight it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="st8etE"&gt;The NBA also issued a statement, saying it “unequivocally condemns all forms of hate speech,” &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.espn.com%2Fnba%2Fstory%2F_%2Fid%2F31034606%2Fnba-looking-miami-heat-center-meyers-leonard-use-anti-semitic-slur&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F10%2F22323294%2Fmiami-heat-suspend-meyers-leonard-slur-twitch-faze-clan" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a spokesperson told ESPN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pbDSYj"&gt;Twitch has suspended Leonard, the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We do not allow the use of hateful slurs on Twitch,” Twitch said in a statement. “The safety of our community is our top priority, and per our guidelines we reserve the right to suspend any account for conduct that we determine to be inappropriate, harmful, or puts our community at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZdEPW8"&gt;Other organizations have distanced themselves from Leonard as well. Gaming and esports organization FaZe Clan, which Leonard had &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fupdate%2Furn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6521800750388121605%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F10%2F22323294%2Fmiami-heat-suspend-meyers-leonard-slur-twitch-faze-clan" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;invested in&lt;/a&gt;, said on Tuesday evening that it had severed ties:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2t4XvT"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A statement from FaZe Clan. &lt;a href="https://t.co/ePo1NGEaN5"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ePo1NGEaN5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— FaZe Clan (@FaZeClan) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FaZeClan/status/1369435605034295302?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5pARAx"&gt;And sponsors Origin PC and Scuf Gaming, which are both owned by Corsair, have also said they &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ORIGINPC/status/1369400143448006657"&gt;are&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ScufGaming/status/1369400178109779986"&gt;ending&lt;/a&gt; their working relationships with Leonard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WbDCwx"&gt;While stars saying inappropriate things on stream is relatively new territory for NBA players who dabble in streaming, it’s an unfortunately common problem for the biggest names on Twitch. Turner “Tfue” Tenney, for example, was suspended in 2018 &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/faze-tfue-fortnite-twitch-banned-30-days-notvivid-934858"&gt;for using a racial slur on stream&lt;/a&gt;, though the platform did not take action when he said a different slur &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/4/20849429/fortnite-streamer-tfue-racial-slur-twitch-silence"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; pro Daniel “Dubs” Walsh &lt;a href="https://dotesports.com/news/fortnite-pro-dubs-banned-from-twitch-after-using-racial-slur"&gt;was banned&lt;/a&gt; from Twitch and suspended from FaZe Clan after saying a racial slur in February 2020. (He has since been reinstated.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zp2pOa"&gt;Other celebrities who have tried their hand at streaming have faced real-world consequences for hurtful language as well. NASCAR driver Kyle Larson was fired by his team in April for using the n-word &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/13/21219793/nascar-kyle-larson-slur-iracing-suspended-sim-racing"&gt;during a sim racing stream&lt;/a&gt;, while musician Joel Zimmerman, who you might know as deadmau5, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/13/18223380/deadmau5-joel-zimmerman-deletes-twitch-homophobic-slur-suspension-hateful-conduct-controversy"&gt;deleted his Twitch channel in 2019&lt;/a&gt; after he was suspended for saying homophobic slurs.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="jx8RPW"&gt;The Xbox Series X / S and PS5 consoles haven’t even reached the six-month mark yet, but game modes that favor performance or visual quality are already common. It feels like not a week goes by without a game getting an update to allow players to pick between a demanding 4K resolution or sacrificing some resolution and quality for 60fps or even 120fps modes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1XJSaG"&gt;Last month, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22260905/control-ps5-next-gen-hands-on-preview"&gt;big next-gen update was &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with modes for both performance and visual quality. Today, it’s &lt;a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/overwatch-retail-patch-notes-%E2%80%93-march-9-2021/593440"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; with choices&lt;/a&gt; that let you pick between a 120fps mode or resolution and visual quality. These updates have made us &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163921/ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-old-games-next-gen-consoles"&gt;fall in love with old games&lt;/a&gt; or appreciate how much better they run on modern consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ELXvOo"&gt;This emerging trend brings better choice to console gaming and pushes it closer to the wide range of options and modes that have been available on PC for years. During our review of the Xbox Series X and Series S consoles, we noted that it felt like this trend was emerging, but I’m still surprised to see these game mode updates appear so frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="drZ0YB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The PS5 and Xbox Series X made us fall back in love with old games ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22163921/ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-old-games-next-gen-consoles"},{"title":"Xbox Series X review: a next-gen PC","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"},{"title":"PS5 review: a big, confident step into next gen","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ArBMUn"&gt;So why do these game modes matter? Moving from 30fps to 60fps is obviously a big deal that has been happening in console gaming for years now. It results in much smoother gameplay across a variety of titles, and it’s particularly noticeable in racing games or first-person shooters. Put simply, it makes games feel a lot different and can reduce input lag and improve how you end up playing a title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zJaBvX"&gt;Being able to choose between all of the graphic options turned on or some visual settings disabled with better performance means you can play a game the way you want. If you want a more cinematic experience, turn on the resolution mode. If you want the buttery-smooth feel, turn on the frame rate mode. Some game developers have also introduced balanced modes, but the choices are always relatively simple compared to the myriad options in PC games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="etTu6z"&gt;While most games are trying to target 60fps these days, the promise of ray tracing means the option to play how you want is increasingly important. Ray tracing delivers more realistic scenes in games, with real-time lighting and effects. It’s an addition to this generation that hasn’t been fully explored by developers yet, but it comes at a performance cost that means recent games like &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt; are having to run at 30fps. This is where performance modes and options can help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dRQGTz"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RdbtOKQ1iLo?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G8DtsN"&gt;Insomniac Games has been quick to add new modes to &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man Remastered&lt;/em&gt; on the PS5 to even let you enable ray tracing with a 60fps performance mode. While the game takes a resolution hit in scenes as a result, it’s far less noticeable than if you were running at 30fps instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xud3ED"&gt;Other console game updates are also targeting new 120fps modes. The jump from 60fps to 120fps might feel less significant for some, but I’d argue it’s equally important. It’s the type of change you’ll notice gradually, and if you switch back from 120fps to 60fps you’ll immediately feel the difference. It does require a compatible TV or monitor, though, so a lot of people are missing out right now. A surprising amount of games are offering 120fps support already, including big names like &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IgBY78"&gt;Hitting 120fps reliably means a sacrifice in resolution, so most games will not offer full 4K at 120fps on these consoles. If you have the right TV or monitor, the benefits of a 120fps mode are obvious for certain games. First-person shooters like &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; feel more responsive, and input latency is reduced for racing games like &lt;em&gt;Dirt 5&lt;/em&gt;. If your TV supports variable refresh rate (VRR), then the benefits are even clearer as you get smooth gameplay without screen tearing when the frame rate dips at these higher refresh rates.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M3cwjotOasX_lWgpzzpk6zewAFk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21959023/dirt5modes.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Dirt 5&lt;em&gt;’s game modes.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vLOhxM"&gt;These new 120fps modes aren’t appearing equally, though. While the Xbox Series X offers more than 20 games with 120fps options, the PS5 has less than 10. &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt; all offer 120fps options on the Xbox side, but the PS5 support is lagging behind. &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt; developer Psyonix &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/20/21579166/ps5-120fps-games-support-developer-rocket-league"&gt;revealed last year&lt;/a&gt; that enabling 120fps in Xbox games is a minor patch, but it requires a “full native port” for the PS5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Ctpaf"&gt;This gap is largely on existing popular cross-platform games, and it’s bound to be one we’ll see close as developers have more time to port games and work on modes. Sony is also planning to support VRR on the PS5 with a future update, and once that arrives it should spur developers on to support 120fps more often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dyRMTM"&gt;It’s been encouraging to witness the speed of game updates for these new consoles, though. We might still be waiting on next-gen games and actual stock of consoles, but once you’re able to purchase a new Xbox or PS5, the games you’re already playing will probably offer lots of these new modes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter tries to fix problematic image crops by not cropping pictures anymore</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4gOvrR0-X2nZdOI9bHzEx72IW3s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68942725/akrales_180620_1777_0282.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HE8qby"&gt;Twitter has devised a potential solution to its problematic image cropping issue: no more cropping. The company said on Wednesday it’s now testing a “what you see is what you get” image preview within the tweet compose box and experimenting with displaying full-frame images. That way, images will show up in the Twitter timeline looking just as they did when the user was composing the tweet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CPy8CD"&gt;“Now testing on Android and iOS: when you Tweet a single image, how the image appears in the Tweet composer is how it will look on the timeline –– bigger and better,” the company wrote in its announcement tweet on the new feature test. Twitter also says its testing new 4K image uploading on Android and iOS as part of a broader push “to improve how you can share and view media on Twitter.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Gs69cb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Now testing on Android and iOS: when you Tweet a single image, how the image appears in the Tweet composer is how it will look on the timeline –– bigger and better. &lt;a href="https://t.co/izI5S9VRdX"&gt;pic.twitter.com/izI5S9VRdX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1369680667886444548?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zh1e8t"&gt;With the new image preview change, there should be less algorithmic surprises — like the ones several users &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/20/21447998/twitter-photo-preview-white-black-faces"&gt;brought attention to last fall&lt;/a&gt; that showed how the company’s automated cropping tool quite often favored white faces over Black ones. In many of those cases, irregularly sized images shared on Twitter were automatically cropped behind the scenes using an AI-powered algorithm, but in ways that raised some troubling questions about how the software prioritized skin color and other factors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="k1sqTZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Trying a horrible experiment...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which will the Twitter algorithm pick: Mitch McConnell or Barack Obama? &lt;a href="https://t.co/bR1GRyCkia"&gt;pic.twitter.com/bR1GRyCkia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tony “Abolish ICE” Arcieri   (@bascule) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bascule/status/1307440596668182528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 19, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BvAmEm"&gt;Twitter at the time said the neural network it uses for automated image cropping was tested for racial bias, and the company claims it found none. But it also admitted it needed to perform more analysis and refine its approach to avoid situations like this where even the appearance of bias was a possibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TaGZrA"&gt;“It’s clear that we’ve got more analysis to do. We’ll open source our work so others can review and replicate,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lizkelley/status/1307742267193532416"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; Twitter communications lead Liz Kelley in the aftermath of the controversy going viral. “Just because a system shows no statistical bias, doesn’t mean it won’t cause harm.” Kelley said Twitter would rely “less on auto-cropping so more often the photo you see in the Tweet composer is what it will look like in the Tweet.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aPUBWa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;we are going to rely less on auto-cropping so more often the photo you see in the Tweet composer is what it will look like in the Tweet   =  &lt;/p&gt;— liz kelley (@lizkelley) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lizkelley/status/1311796809652555776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 1, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bjw06K"&gt;Twitter’s Parag Agrawal, the company’s chief technology officer, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498619/twitter-image-cropping-update-racial-bias-machine-learning"&gt;later wrote a blog post delving into the issue at length&lt;/a&gt;, saying at the time that Twitter would be conducting “additional analysis to add further rigor to our testing” and that it was “committed to sharing our findings and... exploring ways to open-source our analysis so that others can help keep us accountable.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="01NJCK"&gt;Now, it looks like Twitter’s proposed solution is here, at least in a test phase. While tweets in standard aspect ratios will be identical when previewed in the compose window and displayed in the timeline, Twitter’s design chief Dantley Davis says extra-wide or tall images will be center cropped for those included in the test. Twitter has not shared a concrete timeline for when this change may be pushed live for all users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eAGrtv"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;With this test, we hope to learn if this new approach is better and what changes we need to make to provide a “what you see is what you get” experience for Tweets with images.&lt;/p&gt;— Dantley Davis (@dantley) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dantley/status/1369682378730389506?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L3fH5t"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Toyota teases an electric car reveal on March 17th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5i5UbUrDD1VUmTeyg2kKhPO4Jlc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68942634/1920_g3xprologue_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sezHhL"&gt;Toyota &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22187113/toyota-electric-vehicles-us-suv-debut-hybrids"&gt;announced earlier this year that it’s gearing up for the release of its first mass-market EVs&lt;/a&gt; for the US, but now it also appears ready to show off one for Europe as soon as next week, according to a new microsite launched Wednesday.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aykcKk"&gt;Called “X Prologue,” apparently, Toyota is merely showing a single headlight of the new electric vehicle beneath a countdown that ends on March 17th. There are no other details as of yet, save for how the hood appears to match the styling of Toyota’s other modern vehicles. There’s also an LED light bar that carries across the nose of the car — a design element that’s becoming increasingly popular in the electric vehicle space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="09ovlx"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/toyota-teases-new-x-prologue-model-ahead-reveal"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Autocar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; points out, Toyota had previously announced plans to reveal a Rav4-sized electric SUV aimed at the European market sometime in 2021, so it’s possible that could be what’s in store. Toyota declined to provide more information beyond &lt;a href="https://newsroom.toyota.eu/x-prologue--a-small-preview-of-whats-next/"&gt;this phenomenally sparse press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b4bXA6"&gt;If it is indeed that vehicle, it will be the first one built on the EV platform Toyota has been co-developing with fellow Japanese automaker Subaru. The two automakers have (somewhat notoriously, to this point) hesitated to embrace all-electric vehicles, though they are planning to build multiple models on this new architecture. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>COVID-19 took disease tests out of the lab — and may keep them there</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="SFChronicleVirusDaily" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xRMjYSB2Wf3-5H6tvYkexIN5_e4=/0x70:2909x2009/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68942570/1261955731.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;It could help us be ready for the next pandemic&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="qMNBaJ"&gt;Just before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, medical technology company Lucira Health was starting to fine-tune its at-home flu test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KNmcLu"&gt;“We found ourselves in January 2020 wondering, wow, we have this platform, should we be looking at COVID-19?” Kelly Brezoczky, executive vice president at Lucira Health, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Most of the technology would transfer; it was just a matter of swapping in the coronavirus for the influenza virus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ILerrx"&gt;By November 2020, Lucira had the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-first-covid-19-test-self-testing-home"&gt;first US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorization&lt;/a&gt; for a fully at-home COVID-19 test. If the company had kept working on its flu test, Brezoczky says she’s not sure if it would have been on the market by then. “Our COVID-19 product leapfrogged our first product,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="V1ud6l"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Our COVID-19 product leapfrogged our first product”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iVbnsf"&gt;Before the pandemic, small companies like Lucira and academic research labs were working on shrinking and speeding up tests that could diagnose someone’s viral infection by detecting a virus’s genetic material in a swab from their nose or throat. They wanted to make it possible for these highly accurate tests to be done in a doctor’s office, at the patient bedside, or at home. But for the most part, those systems were in early stages of development. Most of this kind of testing, known as molecular testing, still had to be done in a lab.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qt4nzx"&gt;Skyrocketing need for COVID-19 testing accelerated all of those nascent efforts. Suddenly, the federal government and private companies were investing millions, and the Food and Drug Administration was using emergency authorizations to get tests on the market. Experts long predicted that at-home testing could be the future, but the pandemic shortened the timeline to get there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aCeEEV"&gt;“Overall, it was a very big opportunity,” says Paul Yager, a professor in the department of bioengineering at the University of Washington who works on rapid test development. “It sounds cynical, but a bad public health problem that gets everyone’s attention — and certainly this got everyone’s attention — pumps money into the field.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4GV6Dn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="jIrYmd"&gt;A year ago, just as the COVID-19 pandemic was starting to accelerate in the United States, it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21184015/coronavirus-testing-pcr-diagnostic-point-of-care-cdc-techonology"&gt;hard if not impossible&lt;/a&gt; for most people in the US to track down a coronavirus test. The country relied on a type of test called a PCR. PCR is the gold standard approach to identifying a virus. It looks for a snippet of the virus’s genetic material in a swab collected from a patient. That’s why it’s also called a molecular test: it searches out a genetic molecule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2egkyu"&gt;Molecular tests are very different from another kind of viral test called an &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/01/rapid-antigen-covid19-tests-unreported/617668/"&gt;antigen test&lt;/a&gt;. Antigen tests look for a protein on the surface of the virus rather than the molecular code of the virus itself. They are cheap and fast, but they can be less accurate than molecular tests like PCR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vXnNQCkFwaIsp9FlkqLXgANpo3M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22359539/device__box_and_instructions.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lucira Health&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z2EQCY"&gt;PCR is typically a good approach: it’s extremely accurate and easy to develop against new viruses. However, it’s finicky, takes training to handle the samples, and requires bulky, energy-sucking, expensive equipment. It’s usually run in hospitals or centralized labs. It also takes a few hours to run. During a health emergency, a few hours is too slow. And when cases spike and labs get a flood of samples, people may have to wait days to get their results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hpNgk6"&gt;A faster test in those situations could make a huge difference in public health officials’ ability to track down infections and cut off the spread of disease. But until the pandemic hit, there hadn’t been significant investment or focus on creating faster, simpler molecular tests. It didn’t seem as necessary. “[Rapid testing] was more on the fringes, because our normal laboratory setup in the United States was already robust,” says Jacqueline Linnes, assistant professor of biomedical engineering at Purdue University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pjldmq"&gt;Small companies and academic research labs were still interested in creating those types of systems and made significant progress on the science and technology behind them. They figured out how to make gene detection energy efficient and cut down the number of steps needed to get a result. They also worked to make them easier to use by people without specialized training. But they didn’t attract interest from big companies that could push them to market at scale, Linnes says. “It was an academic exercise.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="xFBlSL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It was an academic exercise”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9cPPDy"&gt;Yager, for example, had a small molecular test that could be applied to multiple types of diseases ready in 2017. But he couldn’t get a company to work with him to commercialize the product. “It was the commercial market that actually caused the project — which was technically successful — to fail,” he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21184015/coronavirus-testing-pcr-diagnostic-point-of-care-cdc-techonology"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lfXwD8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Out of the lab&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="45dshp"&gt;The pandemic upended that pattern. Suddenly, there was funding for and commercial interest in rapid testing. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) launched the &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/research-training/medical-research-initiatives/radx"&gt;Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics&lt;/a&gt; (RADx) initiative, which funded the development of new testing technologies for COVID-19. The pandemic was a public health emergency, so the FDA cleared tests under Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs), which allows tests to be used after shorter examination periods than usual. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qGa8ke"&gt;“We found out that industry has all of the resources and all of the know-how to make this stuff happen — if only they have the motivation,” Linnes says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DQUbR2"&gt;Because researchers and small startups had already been working on rapid tests, some were able to take the same approach as Lucira and swap out their original target for the coronavirus. Visby Medical had originally developed a rapid sexually transmitted infection test, but it quickly started work on a rapid COVID-19 test that &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-radx-initiative-advances-six-new-covid-19-testing-technologies"&gt;was funded through the NIH’s program&lt;/a&gt;. It got authorization in February 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vt4ZUP"&gt;The FDA authorized the first rapid molecular tests, made by the medical technology companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/23/21191055/rapid-coronavirus-test-hospital-fda"&gt;Cepheid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/28/21197944/coronavirus-test-fast-doctors-office-abbott-fda"&gt;Abbott&lt;/a&gt;, in March 2020. Both can be used in health centers, nursing homes, or urgent care clinics close to patients. They take a specialized machine, but samples don’t have to be sent out to a lab. Many rapid tests use that approach: they have to be done by medical professionals but right at the location where patients get swabbed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KbKsJp"&gt;Visby’s test falls into that category. It has a single-use cartridge that can be used in environments like nursing homes and some schools. Eventually, Visby hopes its tests can be used at home, says Adam de la Zerda, founder and CEO of Visby Medical. The FDA has already cleared a handful of at-home COVID-19 tests, including Lucira’s. Last week, the agency authorized another at-home molecular test from the medical technology company Cue. Unlike Lucira, Cue’s test doesn’t require a prescription. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="FsmMIL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That’s generally the direction that the FDA went”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cNDl8T"&gt;Yager thinks there will be more of a push for at-home testing. “They’re not all approved for home use yet, but that’s generally the direction that the FDA went — and I think it’s a trend,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Ijm7PI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The future of diagnostics &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="yzr1SP"&gt;Rapid molecular tests are still only available in extremely limited quantities. Lucira is still scaling its production lines, and Cue hasn’t announced when its COVID-19 test could be on shelves. But they’ll be more and more available over the next year and could usher in a new approach to disease testing overall. “Today the model is that you schlep your way over to a hospital, or stand in a long line in a waiting room, and it takes a day. That’s not the way we want to go forward,” Yager says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w3mPnA"&gt;The increased interest and money in rapid molecular testing is already making a huge difference for smaller companies and academic labs. Lucira became a &lt;a href="https://www.360dx.com/business-news/home-infectious-disease-test-developer-lucira-health-goes-public-17-share#.YEexopNKjlw"&gt;publicly traded company&lt;/a&gt; in February and is worth over $400 million. That raised a lot of eyebrows, Yager says. “The fact that there’s now a game for the investors to get into is a very exciting thing.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="H7DJQD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The fact that there’s now a game for the investors to get into is a very exciting thing”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BajAHH"&gt;Moving disease testing out of the lab would make diagnoses for diseases other than COVID-19 easier. It would also help people start treatment early. There are treatments for the flu, for example, that work well — but only if people start them within a day or two of feeling symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ta04xu"&gt;Normally, most people don’t go to the doctor in that window, says Lucira’s Brezoczky. That’s what Lucira’s flu test — which the company is still planning to launch — aimed to help with, she says. If people could buy an accurate test when they went out to buy cough medicine, they’d be able to know if antivirals would help. “Then, you actually have a chance to reduce both duration and severity of symptoms,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P53zix"&gt;Visby also hopes to get clearance for its sexually transmitted infection test this year. Like the flu, those types of conditions are easier to treat if they’re caught early. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AeWw4O"&gt;Rapid molecular tests are still expensive, Linnes says. Lucira’s COVID-19 test is &lt;a href="https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/info-2021/at-home-covid-tests.html"&gt;$50&lt;/a&gt;. Cue hasn’t set a price for its newly authorized at-home molecular test. At this point, the price of these tests might be too high for regular cold and flu season use. But eventually, mass production and broader use could lower the price and help them become more commonplace, Linnes says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wBZ0SF"&gt;Apart from price, a big advantage of scaling rapid molecular test manufacturing would be building a foundation for the next public health emergency. If the tests were in regular use for more ordinary viruses, it would be easier to adjust them to test for a pandemic virus, Linnes says. The US wouldn’t be as reliant on the slower in-lab PCR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="4xByqJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The US wouldn’t be as reliant on the slower in-lab PCR tests&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="68xY1N"&gt;That only happens, though, if the investment and interest in these systems continue. Sliding back into the status quo of lab-based testing after the COVID-19 pandemic fades, and not taking advantage of the momentum for at-home testing, would leave everyone in the same position they were in a year ago. “We need to continue the investment,” Linnes says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="528FUi"&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic showed how important it is to be able to quickly and accurately diagnose diseases, de la Zerda says. He thinks there will be more focus on rapid molecular testing so that governments are prepared for new viral threats. They could have made a big difference at the start of this pandemic. “If we had access to these tests in high volumes, we probably would be in a very different position right now,” he says. “We certainly would not be at the level of 500,000 deaths in this country.”&lt;/p&gt;
