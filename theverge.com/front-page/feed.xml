    <title>Trump vetoes $740 billion defense bill after Section 230 complaints </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="72PLxn"&gt;President Donald Trump has vetoed an annual defense bill authorizing billion of dollars in military spending after complaints that the bill did not include changes to Section 230, the provision that gives social media companies legal immunity over much of the content posted by their users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KM8dz7"&gt;Earlier this month, Trump &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22037118/trump-section-230-repeal-ndaa-rider-facebook-twitter-moderation"&gt;threatened to veto&lt;/a&gt; the $740 billion spending bill, the National Defense Authorization Act unless Congress included a provision that would repeal Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Congress approved the measure by veto-proof margins in December, and has been broadly skeptical of efforts to pass 230 reform as part of the bill. House lawmakers will return to Capitol on Monday to override the president’s veto, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/connorobrienNH/status/1341839804485537792?s=20"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="XIxTE6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:8777491"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H8mIiH"&gt;“Section 230 facilitates the spread of foreign disinformation online, which is a serious threat to our national security,” Trump &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/viaCristiano/status/1341840565814644737?s=20"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday. “It must be repealed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u2OxsO"&gt;Amending or repealing Section 230 has become a priority for the Trump administration over the last few months. In May, Trump signed an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21273822/trump-signs-executive-order-facebook-twitter-section-230-social-media-companies"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; urging the Federal Communications Commission to reinterpret the law. The order came in response to Twitter fact-checking a tweet from Trump for the first time over false claims made on voter fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bTMwXi"&gt;Social media companies like Facebook and Twitter have been under immense pressure to moderate the president’s tweets when he posts falsehoods online. The companies’ increasing moderation efforts have led Trump and Republican lawmakers to make misleading claims that the platforms are biased against conservatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4U3Poe"&gt;“Your failure to terminate the very dangerous national security risk of Section 230 will make our intelligence virtually impossible to conduct without everyone know that we are doing at every step,” Trump said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VzDAif"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XSpjPI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I have not played Cyberpunk 2077 but it’s my favorite game of the year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Keanu Reeves as Johnny Silverhand in Cyberpunk 2077" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rBIrpFNVh9Nf_Re3AxahznSv_WQ=/600x0:3840x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68574437/Cyberpunk2077_No_Future_RGB.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PebY1p"&gt;Like many non-gamers, I have experienced Cyberpunk 2077 mostly through news articles and Twitter posts. And I’ve got to say — this is possibly the best way to experience it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aOCAie"&gt;I mean, look — I’ve heard about this game for years, because a lot of my coworkers and friends are gamers. Everyone got all hype! I had to delay the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020-roundup"&gt;end-of-year package&lt;/a&gt; I was project-managing in order to accommodate it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3mwfVr"&gt;But almost immediately after launch, there was &lt;em&gt;drama: &lt;/em&gt;Sony&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188007/sony-cyberpunk-2077-removed-playstation-store-full-refunds-policy"&gt; pulled the game from its store&lt;/a&gt; and started offering refunds! Microsoft is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189059/microsoft-cyberpunk-2077-refunds-xbox-microsoft-store"&gt;also offering refunds&lt;/a&gt;! So are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189238/best-buy-cyberpunk-2077-returns-cd-projekt-red-refund-xbox-one-ps4"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195420/gamestop-cyberpunk-2077-returns-even-if-opened"&gt;Game Stop&lt;/a&gt;! Employees of game maker, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-18/cyberpunk-game-maker-faces-hostile-staff-after-failed-launch?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;CD Projekt Red&lt;/a&gt;, are revolting! If your file gets too big, it’ll &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/20/22192375/cyberpunk-2077-save-file-corrupted-8-mb"&gt;be corrupted and useless&lt;/a&gt;! An &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163783/cyberpunk-2077-epileptic-seizure-warning-permanent-fix-cd-projekt-red"&gt;epilepsy warning&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168295/cyberpunk-2077-twitch-dmca-copyright-strike-music-turn-off-bug"&gt;DMCA strikes&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9bqIaN"&gt;If there are two things I love, they are drama and chaos, and boy, does Cyberpunk 2077 offer both. There’s also this, which I thought was a joke, but then when I read the tweet’s replies, I realized &lt;em&gt;it was not at all a joke&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AKNWPQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Nobody told me there’s a part in Cyberpunk where Keanu Reeves jacks your body to finger some woman in a car thus causing a traffic accident&lt;/p&gt;— merritt k (@merrittk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/merrittk/status/1339346103347638272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 16, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I3H2kw"&gt;One of my friends bought it the day it came out and essentially went into a bunker to play it for a few days. He’s called it “a wonderful mess,” but also said that the weakest part is combat and “the AI is dumb as bricks.” Another can’t finish her Johnny sidequest and is very angry about it. Like, not ironically angry: she desperately &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; to meet Nancy at the goth club, but the NPC she’s supposed to talk to isn’t there. (Also, as a condition of using her story, she asked that I mention that Judy is her wife.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3v1Hy4"&gt;Some of the drama around Cyberpunk is objectively &lt;em&gt;not funny at all&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/4/21575914/cyberpunk-2077-release-crunch-labor-delays-cd-projekt-red"&gt;overworked developers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.them.us/story/cyberpunk-2077-video-game-transphobic-stereotypes-boycott"&gt;stereotypes about trans people&lt;/a&gt;. Our sister site Polygon has gone so far as to post a standard disclaimer on every post about the game just because there’s &lt;em&gt;so much&lt;/em&gt; going on here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="0Iu4eh"&gt;Ahead of the release of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, CD Projekt Red faced &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/4/21575914/cyberpunk-2077-release-crunch-labor-delays-cd-projekt-red"&gt;scrutiny from reporters for its work practices&lt;/a&gt;, particularly with regard to “crunch,” a term referring to long overtime hours lasting weeks or months. Despite &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/4/21575914/cyberpunk-2077-release-crunch-labor-delays-cd-projekt-red"&gt;past promises to the contrary&lt;/a&gt;, the company imposed &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/1/18/21071895/cyberpunk-2077-delay-crunch-cd-projekt-red"&gt;obligatory crunch&lt;/a&gt; on some employees. &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; also faced criticism for its marketing — in particular, the usage of a &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/e3/2019/6/12/18662443/cyberpunk-2077-trans-advertisement-cd-projekt-red-e3-2019"&gt;sexualized trans model in a promotional poster&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/4/22058784/cyberpunk-2077-marketing-cd-projekt-red-transphobia"&gt;the flippant tone used in much of the game’s advertising and social media&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="hUnDe6"&gt;This thing is a fucking fiasco! My main takeaway is that the people who will enjoy this game the most are people who know and love a great many gamers, but are not gamers themselves. And for us, the best part of the game is the glitches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zawA9p"&gt;We have been collecting some of our favorite glitches in a group chat, and I am now going to share them with you. Fair warning: some of these are not safe for work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="2pRWfq"&gt;Last week, Chinese EV startup XPeng &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-16/xpeng-delivers-first-evs-to-norway-in-slow-going-europe-entry?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;began deliveries in Europe&lt;/a&gt;, just a few months after its own successful IPO in the US. Neither company is going to become the apocryphal “Tesla killer” anytime soon. But each has now succeeded at accomplishing major goals once shared by other EV startups that have failed or fallen by the wayside, like Byton and Faraday Future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fyzpvO"&gt;They’re not alone. Despite a major economic downturn brought on by the pandemic, billions of dollars poured into the electric vehicle space during 2020, lifting up companies like China’s Nio and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348057/chinese-ev-startup-li-auto-public-stock-nasdaq-trading"&gt;Li Auto&lt;/a&gt;, and Lordstown Motors, Fisker Inc., and Nikola in the US. That faucet remains open, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KpGoWi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The rush of money into EVs could help some finally prove their worth&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kpsppu"&gt;Not all recipients of that money will survive. But this rush of interest in the space — accelerated by the meteoric rise in Tesla’s stock price this year — has surely provided &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; with enough cash to finally move beyond PowerPoint pitches and investor roadshows and start proving their worth on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bZbALu"&gt;Alibaba-backed XPeng and Tencent-backed Nio are already doing this, having respectively delivered 4,224 and 5,291 vehicles in November. And when XPeng rolled its first exported electric vehicles &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-16/xpeng-delivers-first-evs-to-norway-in-slow-going-europe-entry?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;off a boat in Norway last week&lt;/a&gt;, it accomplished something many of its peers have sought: expansion into new markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="t8d9jC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Byton suspending operations for six months due to financial trouble","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308389/byton-chinese-ev-startup-operations-suspended-furloughs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="2O0MMf"&gt;Selling vehicles in Europe was an explicit goal of Byton, which was also founded in China but fancied itself as a “global automaker,” with offices in Germany and the US. But Byton has now all but shuttered its North American operations, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308389/byton-chinese-ev-startup-operations-suspended-furloughs"&gt;laying off hundreds across 2020&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.electrive.com/2020/10/22/byton-ceo-daniel-kirchert-quits/"&gt;losing its CEO&lt;/a&gt;, and facing a potential roll-up of its Chinese operations into primary backer First Auto Works — the original state-owned automaker in China. In fact, Byton’s North American operation is apparently so destitute that it hasn’t paid its lawyers in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308389/byton-chinese-ev-startup-operations-suspended-furloughs"&gt;a lawsuit against former CEO&lt;/a&gt; (and current Faraday Future CEO) Carsten Breitfeld, &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.767301/gov.uscourts.cacd.767301.47.0.pdf"&gt;according to a previously unreported court filing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="24iP2k"&gt;Byton’s demise was striking, given that it had backing from such a powerful government-owned automaker. At one point not so long ago, that support made the startup seem far more legitimate than the rest. Byton was even the first of the many EV startups to complete its own factory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7AvHM3"&gt;That approach fell into stark relief with Nio’s, which in 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18252244/nio-ev-startup-factory-shanghai-cancelled-jac-motors"&gt;abandoned its own plans for a factory&lt;/a&gt; and instead decided to keep paying a contract manufacturer to make its electric cars. While this left Nio stuck paying a fee for every car it had its manufacturing partner build, it also meant the startup didn’t have to cover the massive cost of building out and running a factory — which was crucial when money got really tight in 2019 and 2020, according to Michael Dunne, head of ZoZo Go, a consulting group focused on the Chinese market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="Am3pwH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Byton’s factory, once an asset, became an albatross&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UTydQb"&gt;“Nio said, ‘We’re not going to go that direction anymore,’ and investors originally said, ‘You’re not serious — you’re not going to have your own plant?’ Byton, meanwhile, goes that route and investors say, ‘I can count on these guys,’” Dunne says. But when both companies ran into financial trouble and the pandemic hit, Dunne says Byton’s factory turned into “an albatross.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGyIrX"&gt;Now, Nio is arguably the second-most successful electric vehicle company behind Tesla (though still a very distant one) and just raised &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Finvesting%2F2020%2F12%2F17%2Fnio-just-raised-3-billion-heres-why%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F23%2F22194330%2Fev-startups-tesla-success-2020-electric-vehicles-spac-public#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;another $2.6 billion&lt;/a&gt;. XPeng is right there with Nio, and just &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-09/china-ev-startup-xpeng-raises-2-2-billion-in-upsized-share-sale"&gt;raised $2.2 billion&lt;/a&gt; itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfQSzZ"&gt;“Nio, a year ago, was in desperate straits and needed a bailout,” says Dunne, referring to a $1.4 billion deal the Chinese EV startup struck &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/5/21274457/nio-q1-earnings-deliveries-chinese-government-investment-bailout"&gt;with the Anhui province earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. “They were right at the edge, and then here comes Tesla with its meteoric valuation and everyone looks around and says, ‘What next?’ Since then, I’ve gotten so many calls from people saying: ‘Should we bet on XPeng? Should we bet on Nio?’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sijUQC"&gt;Most EV startups, like California’s Canoo, are still just trying to get a vehicle into production. But, founded by former BMW executives who split from Faraday Future in 2017, Canoo has now accomplished something its forebear long sought: going public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="97n8mv"&gt;Faraday Future teased an IPO as far back as its earliest days in 2015, though, to be sure, there wasn’t much the startup &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; talk about back then. Buoyed by its tycoon founder Jia Yueting’s fortune, Faraday Future aimed to release a super-luxury car crammed with technology and world-beating performance. The startup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/5/10713718/faraday-future-vpa-iphone-comparison"&gt;said it would make an EV as disruptive as the iPhone&lt;/a&gt;. It passed over cheap, already-built manufacturing facilities — including one that would have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2017/12/12/16651026/faraday-future-investigation-money-debt-finances-yueting"&gt;cost the company just $1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/23/21035192/rivian-funding-1-3-billion-t-rowe-price-amazon-ford"&gt;now occupied by Rivian&lt;/a&gt; — and instead announced it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/5/9674314/faraday-future-electric-car-1-billion-factory"&gt;would build a $1 billion factory in the Nevada desert&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="EyYpfw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Public offerings, global expansions — these were all goals of startups that faltered&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SDLaWF"&gt;Jia became so known for his grand visions that he was derided in China as a “&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6efac122-3170-11e7-9555-23ef563ecf9a"&gt;PowerPoint CEO&lt;/a&gt;.” Those ambitions were ultimately too much for Faraday Future to bear, too, as it has spent the years since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2019/10/30/20879811/faraday-future-ceo-founder-jia-yueting-carsten-breitfeld-bankruptcy"&gt;struggling to make ends meet&lt;/a&gt;. Now, in the twilight of 2020, it’s Canoo that has become a publicly-traded company while Faraday Future languishes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhInX6"&gt;Canoo is one of the many companies to go public this year by merging with a “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;special purpose acquisition company&lt;/a&gt;,” or SPAC. This method of going public allowed companies like Canoo (and Nikola, and Fisker, and many automotive suppliers) to essentially shortcut the typical IPO process by merging with a SPAC that is already traded on one of the stock exchanges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kpK5HB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Faraday Future’s still haunted by the past of its billionaire founder","url":"https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2019/10/30/20879811/faraday-future-ceo-founder-jia-yueting-carsten-breitfeld-bankruptcy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="G7Q2p1"&gt;The urgency to get onto the NASDAQ or the New York Stock Exchange was due in large part to a sort of gold rush kicked off by Tesla, which saw its own &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/teslas-market-cap-zooms-past-500-billion-11606239860"&gt;stock price skyrocket across 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Big announcements from the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22175017/ford-mustang-mach-e-electric-suv-first-drive-specs-review?utm_campaign=theverge&amp;amp;utm_content=chorus&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525290/hummer-ev-electric-truck-gmc-price-specs-range"&gt;GM&lt;/a&gt; surely helped, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EKufmZ"&gt;Whatever the reason, Canoo now has a few hundred million more dollars to play with and, theoretically, easier access to raising more money as it tries to bring its electric delivery vehicle platform to market in the next few years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="llg1BQ"&gt;Canoo is just one example. Lordstown Motors, which didn’t even exist two years ago, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352433/gm-lordstown-motors-electric-truck-startup-public-merger-spac"&gt;went public this year via a SPAC merger&lt;/a&gt; and is targeting a 2021 release of its electric pickup truck. Fisker is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/13/21322573/fisker-vw-meb-modular-platform-architecture-ocean-suv-apollo"&gt;doing the same&lt;/a&gt;. So is &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/18/uk-electric-vehicle-maker-arrival-is-going-public-via-spac.html"&gt;electric bus company Arrival&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/12/08/chargepoint-ceo-on-why-its-going-public-via-spac.html"&gt;charging company ChargePoint&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/spac-merger-becomes-the-trendiest-ev-ipo-route-of-2020-2020-12-08"&gt;list goes on&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ylM58p"&gt;It’s worth noting that these accomplishments — going public, starting deliveries, entering new markets — have not come without a cost. In Canoo’s case, the startup is now in the hands of a businessman who pivoted away from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22179588/canoo-delivery-vehicle-nasdaq-spac-merger-listing-public"&gt;focusing on an electric van for consumers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21277248/canoo-ev-startup-stefan-krause-leaving-evelozcity"&gt;One of its founders is gone&lt;/a&gt;, and while another remains CEO for now, Canoo’s new chairman recently told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; he’s making no guarantees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6mGKsf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nio’s future depends more on the Chinese government than ever","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/5/21274457/nio-q1-earnings-deliveries-chinese-government-investment-bailout"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Z3EiVg"&gt;Nio, which started as an ostensibly independent company (as far as such a thing can exist in China), ultimately &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/5/21274457/nio-q1-earnings-deliveries-chinese-government-investment-bailout"&gt;had to turn to the Chinese government for help&lt;/a&gt;. That relationship only appears to be deepening as &lt;a href="https://investorplace.com/2020/12/nio-stock-11-things-to-know-as-nio-shares-stumble-today/"&gt;Nio’s joint ventures in China get cozier with the government&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, XPeng’s rise in prominence has increased the scrutiny on its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/24/18277168/xpeng-china-tesla-apple-trade-secret-theft-electric"&gt;alleged role in the theft of trade secrets from Tesla and Apple&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jxzeZ7"&gt;Nikola is perhaps the shining example of how quickly the recent rush of cash into the EV space can turn into a “The Monkey’s Paw”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;situation. Nikola was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/3/21162886/nikola-public-nasdaq-merger-hydrogen-electric-trucks"&gt;one of the first EV startups to go through the process of merging with a SPAC&lt;/a&gt;, and that deal vaulted the company from relative obscurity to “hottest new stock” status. But the resulting scrutiny sparked questions about potential self-dealing, financial misdeeds, and fraud. Nikola has since had multiple deals with potential customers fall apart, seen its stock price crash from its summer highs, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448729/nikola-electric-hydrogen-truck-fraud-allegations-executive-chairman-founder-trevor-milton"&gt;its founder has distanced himself from the company&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3NL6of"&gt;Other EV startups on the cusp of production that raised money before 2020, or through the more traditional private investment route, have made tradeoffs as well. After Lucid Motors languished in search of the funding required to build its luxury sedan and a factory in Arizona, it ultimately turned to Saudi Arabia — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21302524/lucid-motors-saudi-arabia-pif-investment-majority-shareholder#:~:text=California%20EV%20startup%20Lucid%20Motors,a%20lawsuit%20filed%20on%20Wednesday.&amp;amp;text=The%20company%20declined%20to%20comment."&gt;which is now the majority owner&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G5X67D"&gt;(The outlier here is Rivian, the Michigan-based EV company that aims to bring an electric pickup truck and SUV to market next year. It has raised &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/10/21319899/rivian-2-5-billion-funding-round-amazon-soros-r1t-r1s-truck-suv-ford"&gt;some $6 billion and counting&lt;/a&gt; after playing things &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/23/17380600/rivian-electric-truck-pickup-suv-interview-rj-scaringe"&gt;&lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; close to the vest since its founding in 2009&lt;/a&gt;. Where startups like Canoo, or Faraday Future, or China’s Nio, loudly sought public offerings, Rivian raised its money in the private markets, finding big institutional partners like Amazon and Ford along the way.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qctiWV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Most EV startups will take some bad with the good, as long as the alternative is oblivion&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SlN1Xd"&gt;Most EV startups will take some bad with the good, as long as the alternative is oblivion, though. The failure of their peers and predecessors to follow in Tesla’s wake is still fresh enough that they know sacrifices are necessary to survive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1W67dr"&gt;There are good reasons to be skeptical about how long this run can last, or whether it’s a “bubble.” How these startups withstand the scrutiny of being a public company, or one that’s finally delivering products to customers, or both in 2021 will help sort things out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7W8akP"&gt;But that wake Tesla has created is bigger than ever, and if it sustains, it could provide cover for startups to falter without imploding, and for others to shoot their own shots as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qgokVh"&gt;To wit, this week I spoke with Fraser Atkinson, the CEO of GreenPower. It’s a small Canadian electric shuttle and bus manufacturer that has toiled away since 2007, surviving in part by securing government grants in the US, and by performing mergers with two different mineral companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YTDrgr"&gt;GreenPower did a traditional IPO this year that yielded about $40 million. Atkinson said GreenPower &lt;em&gt;could &lt;/em&gt;have done a SPAC merger, which could have generated much more cash. But he said he was wary it would bring in &lt;em&gt;too much &lt;/em&gt;money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="EqdLU0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Turning down money, in this economy? &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xyl20H"&gt;“That was funding we couldn’t have possibly spent on any level of production that we have planned for the company over the next number of years,” Atkinson said. “It’s so tempting if you’ve [raised a lot of cash], the pressure is on to do something with that money, to do something transformative, whereas our approach is much more incremental in terms of building the blocks up to a company that can attain profitability.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9gSct4"&gt;It’s hard to imagine any one of these companies striking that kind of tone just a year or two ago. But it makes a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; more sense now, when money is flowing into the industry so freely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="vctfvq"&gt;Turning down money, in this economy? That might be the best sign yet that there’s finally real runway for the myriad startups trying to build a business around electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="82fqiT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hKf0Qw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W7brzx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 leak suggests better battery life is on the way</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cDs1lohe7zoLNw1jfRaZwNTjh5U=/338x0:2162x1216/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68573764/17a1cca82fdaa085e6a7da0895a7b6855c33cd7b5943c466b0f539c1b260d8b4.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/samsung-galaxy-chromebook2-first-images-1608577621-196464122" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass / Voice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XlwoQb"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Chromebook 2 seems like it will improve on the battery life and price of its predecessor, according to leaked Samsung slides (via &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/12/23/galaxy-chromebook-2-specs-leak/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21206151/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-review-android-laptop"&gt;previous Galaxy Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; was an attractively designed 2-in-1 that nonetheless faltered due to its battery life and high $999 price tag. If these slides are to be believed, then next year might hold some Chromebooks to be hopeful about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CC4EoH"&gt;The most important change is that battery life. The slides shared by leaker &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_h0x0d_?s=20"&gt;WalkingCat&lt;/a&gt; say Samsung is targeting 12-plus hours of battery life on this new model. That’s a lot more than the measly 4 hours and 20 minutes (and the 8 hours Samsung promised) we observed in our review of this year’s model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1oLI5V"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;p.s. how about 699? &lt;a href="https://t.co/DDSdmTiDu3"&gt;https://t.co/DDSdmTiDu3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— WalkingCat (@_h0x0d_) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_h0x0d_/status/1341780886954512387?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 23, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yINy07"&gt;Samsung’s slides also note the Galaxy Chromebook 2 will be the first Chromebook with a QLED, or quantum dot LED, screen. The company’s previous Chromebook used a 4K AMOLED, a choice which seemed to hurt the battery life of the device. Switching to QLED would match the change Samsung made in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/29/20938145/samsung-galaxy-book-flex-ion-laptops-design-wireless-charging-qled-hands-on"&gt;its non-Chrome OS laptops in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IqWkFS"&gt;The old Galaxy Chromebook relied on an Intel 10th-gen Core i5 that was more than capable of handling the tasks Samsung imagined customers would use the device for, but this new Galaxy Chromebook 2 is supposedly switching to a 10th-gen Core i3. It isn’t necessarily a step down for browser-based work in Chrome OS, but it is interesting considering &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21505926/intel-11th-gen-rocket-lake-desktop-processors-q1-2021-amd"&gt;the availability of 11th-gen Intel processors in 2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6wctmX"&gt;All these changes may have played a role in the $699 (likely entry-level) price, the final notable tidbit from WalkingCat’s leak. The original Galaxy Chromebook was pitched as something “premium” for “professionals,” and at least &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22194081/samsung-leaked-galaxy-chromebook-2-orange-color-ces-2021"&gt;from the renders we’ve seen&lt;/a&gt;, the Galaxy Chromebook 2 is maintaining that sleek design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="II3XNX"&gt;The Galaxy Chromebook 2’s cheaper price puts it closer to actual high-end Chromebooks than to proper laptops from Apple and others. Swapping to a different processor, and relying on a display it already sources for its other laptops, could help improve sales, especially when combined with a lower price point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OXddwG"&gt;We’ll have to wait till that promised February 2021 launch date from the slide to know for sure. But CES 2021 is right around the corner, and with it comes the possibility of some clarity on Samsung’s Chromebook roadmap for next year and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s deleting ads that mocked Apple for not including a charger in the box</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5xT9k5lmNZP2UHqlY_bVoNIBpos=/313x0:2188x1250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68573712/samsung_mocking_apple_no_charger_iphone_12.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Samsung (via 9to5Google)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ESGDhC"&gt;Samsung has been caught deleting an ad that makes fun of Apple for not including a charging brick with the iPhone 12 — the same thing it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317304/samsung-smartphone-chargers-2021-cost-environment"&gt;rumored to be doing&lt;/a&gt; with its Galaxy S21 phones. The Facebook post was made by Samsung Caribbean back in October, and it had a picture of a charging brick with the caption “Included with your Galaxy” (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/12/23/samsung-apple-charger-removal-post/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A Samsung ad including an image with a phone charging brick captioned “Included with your Galaxy”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zzJi48iA6W98DtXxi-fhFmTHg98=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22193430/samsung_charger_apple_ad_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Samsung (via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Facebook post that has now been deleted, adding even more fuel to the rumors that Samsung won’t be including a charger with its upcoming phones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sT6PeX"&gt;This isn’t the first time Samsung has deleted ads after adopting the same practice it previously mocked Apple for. Back when the Galaxy Note 10 launched without a headphone jack, Samsung &lt;a href="https://bgr.com/2019/08/08/galaxy-note-10-headphone-jack-is-dead-why-and-how-to-embrace-change/"&gt;deleted ads making fun of the iPhone X&lt;/a&gt; for not having a similar plug (ads that were made even more awkward by the fact that the iPhone in the ad was just referred to as the “ten”). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iExgNc"&gt;None of this is to say that doing the same thing as Apple is necessarily a bad thing. Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/7/20758050/samsung-galaxy-note-10-headphone-jack-35mm-usbc-unpacked-event"&gt;had an explanation&lt;/a&gt; as to why it removed the headphone jack, and not including the charger &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21307463/apple-iphone-12-power-adapter-charger-rumor-usb-c"&gt;could very well be good for the environment&lt;/a&gt;. It’s just not a great look when Samsung is posting ads about including a charger &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/12/8/22163632/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-5g-teaser-video-leak"&gt;only a few months before&lt;/a&gt; it’s expected to remove it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Px1gU"&gt;Despite the awkwardness that the marketing could cause, Samsung could handle this better than Apple did. When Apple removed the charging brick, they also changed the cable that came with the phone: almost every previous iPhone came with a USB-A brick, and the cable included in the iPhone 12’s box was USB-C to Lightning. So the argument of “everyone has a charging brick” fell flat because almost any previous iPhone bricks weren’t compatible with the included cable (though&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMHJA3AM%2FA%2F20w-usb-c-power-adapter&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F23%2F22197394%2Fsamsung-deletes-ads-mocking-apple-charger#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; Apple would happily sell customers one for $20&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3UwMgA"&gt;Samsung’s phones, however, use standard USB-C cables for charging, as opposed to Apple’s proprietary Lighting. This means that the cable that comes with Samsung’s new phone will work with the charging brick that came with last year’s model (though it won’t help people who don’t buy new phones every year, as the Galaxy S10 from two years ago &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExI-hp7d-0g"&gt;came with a USB-A charging brick&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Batman: The Animated Series and Batman Beyond are finally coming to HBO Max in January</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/trTXL0hBa7YSRzEvP2N9zFtlL8E=/18x0:918x600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68573641/batman_animated.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g8Md2a"&gt;A number of beloved DC titles are moving from DC Universe to HBO Max on January 1st, including &lt;em&gt;Batman: The Animated Series &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Batman Beyond. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EZh3yh"&gt;Starting in 2021, series and movies like &lt;em&gt;Green Lantern: The Animated Series&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Justice League Dark: Apokolips War&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Batman: Bad Blood &lt;/em&gt;will become available to HBO Max subscribers. Other DC titles available on other streamers, including &lt;em&gt;Superman: Doomsday &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Superman: Man of Tomorrow&lt;/em&gt;, will also be available on HBO Max. The full list can be seen on &lt;a href="https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/us/media-release/hbo-max-highlights-january-2021"&gt;WarnerMedia’s site.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PvyQT2"&gt;The move isn’t too surprising considering DC previously announced its DC Universe streaming service will transform into a comics-exclusive platform, to be called DC Universe Infinite, &lt;a href="https://www.dccomics.com/blog/2020/09/18/dc-universe-transforms-into-dc-universe-infinite-the-ultimate-comic-book"&gt;beginning on January 21st&lt;/a&gt;. Shows and films still on DC Universe will make their move over to HBO Max throughout the month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lnF8m2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Between ‘The Animated Series,’ ‘Batman Beyond,’ and ‘WandaVision’&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;on Disney Plus, it’s a good time for streaming&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TST7T5"&gt;Up until recently, many of the titles were available exclusively on DC Universe, which costs an additional $8 a month. For people who are looking to marathon a bunch of their favorite DC series and films over the holidays, having to maintain two subscriptions — one for DC Universe and another $15 monthly subscription for HBO Max — isn’t ideal. Yet as WarnerMedia puts an additional emphasis on growing HBO Max, offloading DC Universe titles to its newest streaming service will help bolster and keep HBO Max subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xGFjl0"&gt;2021 is an important year for WarnerMedia and HBO Max. The company is simultaneously releasing its movies on HBO Max the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22152626/hbo-max-2021-movies-release-date-matrix-dune-suicide-squad"&gt;same day they’re out in theaters&lt;/a&gt;. Executives are hopeful the move will rapidly accelerate the streamer’s subscriber base, which isn’t growing as fast as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528234/hbo-max-subscribers-activations-att-directv-warner"&gt;industry insiders would have liked&lt;/a&gt;. HBO Max will also play host to some big originals, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21377320/justice-league-snyder-trailer-fandome-first-look-darkseid-cyborg"&gt;Zack Snyder’s &lt;em&gt;Justice League &lt;/em&gt;cut&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;em&gt;Gossip Girl &lt;/em&gt;reboot, among others. Having a number of popular “comfort series” like &lt;em&gt;Batman: The Animated Series &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Batman Beyond&lt;/em&gt; may encourage people to keep their HBO Max subscriptions active even after they’ve watched the latest shows and movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NILJL2"&gt;(This is where I strongly recommend HBO Max’s &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/8/13/21364259/harley-quinn-hbo-max-poison-ivy-animated"&gt;animated &lt;em&gt;Harley Quinn &lt;/em&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; if you haven’t seen it yet. It’s the best TV show I’ve watched all year.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4U9cmP"&gt;Not to mention that, if you’re like me, you’ve been not-so-quietly asking WarnerMedia to move &lt;em&gt;Batman: The Animated Series &lt;/em&gt;over for a while. Between &lt;em&gt;The Animated Series&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Batman Beyond&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562411/wandavision-premiere-date-disney-plus-marvel-studios-elizabeth-olsen-paul-bettany"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;on Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt;, it’s a good time for streaming, for both DC and Marvel fans. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Monitoring COVID-19 vaccine safety means sorting signal from noise  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Scene setter images outside the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Op-nva1AYMOgGpc9ZP9dEcRVX-A=/0x0:2420x1613/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68573357/1230138067.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Jason Armond / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IF3puX"&gt;With the launch of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign, officials expect to see a surge in the number of potential bad vaccine reactions. Their job will be to find out how real those reactions are — finding a signal in the noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zzv3do"&gt;If previous vaccine reports are a guide, the vast majority of the reports won’t end up being real safety issues. But federal officials encourage physicians, especially those who don’t usually give vaccines, to tell the programs about any hint of an issue — because they want to make sure they know about and thoroughly investigate everything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kmUJZH"&gt;To some degree, the problem has to do with large numbers and the relative novelty of the vaccine. The COVID-19 vaccines are also under intense scrutiny, and both recipients and their doctors are on alert for the slightest of side effects. Tens of millions of people are set to be vaccinated over the next few months. In a normal year, the main vaccine safety system in the US gets around 50,000 reports of potential bad reactions. This year, there may be 10 or 20 times more reports, says Grace Lee, a member of the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="coeC95"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s just going to be more cases, period”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ANQPzd"&gt;“There’s just going to be more cases, period, for the COVID-19 vaccine,” says Lee, who is also a professor of pediatrics at Stanford University School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="16J04H"&gt;The backbone of the vaccine safety program is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a 20-year-old federal tool that tracks side effects for immunizations given in the US. Anyone can report a bad reaction to a vaccine to VAERS, which is jointly run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PRPrf3"&gt;Pediatricians tend to be more familiar with the vaccine reporting systems than doctors in other specialties, because they administer childhood vaccinations — and kids get a lot of vaccines. Other types of doctors are less likely to report to VAERS, a study &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X13004283?via%3Dihub"&gt;from the CDC found&lt;/a&gt;. But pediatricians won’t be giving the majority of COVID-19 vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xJhcRr"&gt;The CDC has been working with professional organizations of physicians working with older adults and in long-term care facilities to raise awareness of programs such as VAERS, says Tom Shimabukuro, a member of the Vaccine Safety Team on the COVID-19 Vaccine Task Force. It’s specifically targeting groups of physicians outside of the agency’s normal VAERS partnerships, he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;To reach nursing homes and long-term care facilities, the CDC is leaning on the National Healthcare Safety Network, which normally tracks health care-related infections in around 17,000 long-term care facilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QZQPLm"&gt;Anecdotally, Lee says she’s heard more and more health care providers in her own hospital system asking about VAERS. She takes that as a sign that the outreach programs are working. “They’re asking all the right questions, so they know of its existence, and they know we’re required to report into it,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMeCfv"&gt;Lee isn’t worried that people won’t report to VAERS — she’s more concerned that too many people will, and that the system will struggle with the sheer number of reports. The authorized COVID-19 vaccines cause side effects like fever and headache, and even mild symptoms could seem concerning to people scrutinizing vaccine recipients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="1xp24o"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If we had a system that only picked up signals when they were real, it wouldn’t be looking hard enough”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VsE7wI"&gt;Nine out of ten safety signals end up not being real problems with a vaccine, Lee says. But experts want the safety monitoring programs to be sensitive. “We don’t want to miss anything,” she says. “If we had a system that only picked up signals when they were real, it wouldn’t be looking hard enough.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YPpup8"&gt;Under early tests, the programs seem to be working as they should. In the first week of the US COVID-19 vaccination campaign, health officials flagged six allergic reactions in people receiving the shot. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2020-12/slides-12-19/05-COVID-CLARK.pdf"&gt;Other&lt;/a&gt; reactions were also reported to federal officials, CDC epidemiologist Thomas Clark said during an Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meeting last weekend. After an investigation, officials determined they weren’t true cases of severe allergic reaction — a sign the system is catching reports and figuring out which are relevant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="jp49zF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Under early tests, the programs seem to be working as they should&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eEjAeg"&gt;It’s important to be open about any safety concerns reported, but it’s also important not to raise problems too early that might not end up being real, Lee says. “It’s a really hard balance of when the right time is to let people know there’s been a signal,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bmrmiR"&gt;During the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, VAERS will work in tandem with other safety monitoring systems. Those include v-safe, a new text-message based platform that asks COVID-19 vaccine recipients to report how they feel after they get the shot, and the Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment Project, a national network of experts that consults with doctors on vaccine safety issues. “It’s really all hands on deck,” Lee says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6NVj78"&gt;The integrated network of safety monitoring programs is one way to make sure experts are actually seeing a safety signal. Any problems flagged through VAERS will be checked against the other tools, such as v-safe, Lee says. “We can look in another system and say ‘Hey, are you seeing that?’” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Into the Spider-Verse is leaving Netflix, and it plays into 2020’s biggest streaming problem</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R-abYhsuxcpk67qdx8DHrCr-k6w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68572930/SpiderVerse_cropped.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sony Pictures Animation&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eOpAm0"&gt;Two of the biggest movies people want to talk about this week are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21504152/wonder-woman-1984-release-delay-new-date-warner-bros-disney-black-widow-dune-tenet"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21508491/pixar-soul-disney-plus-release-date-christmas-holidays-streaming-theaters"&gt;Pixar’s &lt;em&gt;Soul&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but there’s another film that can’t be missed: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/28/18115201/spider-man-into-the-verse-movie-review-miles-morales"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YFlJur"&gt;Sony’s critically acclaimed 2018 animated superhero movie, which saw Miles Morales step into the web slinger’s suit and save the world with the help of a few other Spider-beings, is leaving &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/23/22197177/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-watch-netflix-dvd-4k-blu-ray"&gt;Netflix on December 25th&lt;/a&gt;. That’s two days from now. It’s also unclear where &lt;em&gt;Into the Spider-Verse &lt;/em&gt;will end up. Sony doesn’t have a major streaming platform, and none of the other big streamers — HBO Max, Disney Plus, Peacock, Apple TV Plus, or Amazon Prime Video — have announced that it’s arriving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HZwxjh"&gt;Streaming shuffles aren’t new. Movies and TV shows leave Netflix (or Hulu, or HBO Max) every single month. Ephemerality has defined streaming for years. It’s why sites like JustWatch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21291519/justwatch-streaming-search-engine-filter-app-impressions-hbo-max-disney-plus-netflix-hulu"&gt;have found massive success&lt;/a&gt;, helping people who flock to Google to find out where the movie they watched on HBO Max has wound up, or why tweet threads about the importance of physical media pop up every single week. (This is where I plug buying Blu-rays if possible, especially because streaming also coincides with impermanence, and titles can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21220576/splash-tom-hanks-disney-plus-butt-cgi-hair-streaming-physical-digital"&gt;seemingly be edited at whim&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BkQQMW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is where 2020 becomes especially interesting; it’s the beginning of big, noticeable exclusivity plays&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8TKYdy"&gt;Year endings also tend to see more titles leave likely because more licenses expire. This is where 2020 becomes especially interesting; it’s the beginning of big, noticeable exclusivity plays. Before HBO Max, Disney Plus, and Peacock launched, the rights owners were prepared to license their titles to the major streamers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6klMDE"&gt;It’s a lucrative business — if you don’t have your own streamer. Netflix paid a reported $300 million for &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/id/100277562"&gt;first-run Disney movies in 2012&lt;/a&gt; (although the deal didn’t kick in until 2016). It was a major milestone moment; Netflix beat out Showtime and Starz for that premium window offering. That “Pay 1 window” becomes a bidding war; think of how movies go from theaters to Blu-ray / digital retailers, and then wind up on HBO before they’re played on broadcast networks like ABC. Netflix signed a similar deal in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/6/17/4437404/netflix-dreamworks-exclusive-deal"&gt;2013 with DreamWorks Animation&lt;/a&gt;. Back in the early days of the streaming bonanza, it was also fantastic for subscribers. With new mega deals, and one of the biggest TV libraries available that included shows from every major network, Netflix had &lt;em&gt;basically everything &lt;/em&gt;people needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pxHp7M"&gt;Everything’s changed now. Netflix is far from the only streamer on the block, and in the United States specifically, it’s facing several waves of new competition. In 2019, television research group Ampere Analysis noted that about 20 percent of Netflix’s library included titles from NBCUniversal, Fox, Disney, and WarnerMedia. Three of those companies have since publicly announced the importance of building their own streaming services, taking back much of the content they’ve licensed out to Netflix and other streamers and adding it exclusively to their own products. (The fourth company, Fox, got swallowed up by Disney.) It’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasondashbailey/status/1341048466986954757"&gt;not just Netflix&lt;/a&gt;, but Netflix remains the quintessential example. Netflix’s &lt;a href="https://decider.com/2019/12/04/netflix-film-catalog-shrunk-40-percent-2014"&gt;library is literally shrinking&lt;/a&gt; — something executives have &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2020/01/netflix-executive-team-shrugs-off-friends-exit-impact-is-nothing-we-can-see-1202837394/"&gt;effectively shrugged off&lt;/a&gt; as Netflix pushes into making more original series and films than ever before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wi6xbu"&gt;That change is as clear as day when looking at Netflix’s list of titles leaving by the end of the year. All seasons of &lt;em&gt;The West Wing&lt;/em&gt;? Gone. You’ll have to sign up for HBO Max to view those. &lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt;? Going to need a Premium Peacock subscription to watch any episode from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174856/the-office-netflix-peacock-streaming"&gt;season three through its finale&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-It Ralph 2 &lt;/em&gt;is about to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/14/18093994/ralph-breaks-the-internet-movie-review-john-c-reilly-sarah-silverman"&gt;become a Disney Plus exclusive&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;em&gt;Dexter &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Nurse Jackie &lt;/em&gt;will&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;likely find their way to Showtime’s OTT service or whatever &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21437729/cbs-all-access-paramount-plus-new-name-rebrand-2021-international-disney-hbo"&gt;Paramount Plus is going to be&lt;/a&gt;. (More details on that in the new year.) For those doing the math at home, that means instead of spending $14 a month to watch all of those shows, it’ll now cost approximately $45 a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tgzWrk"&gt;Movies and TV shows from content owners may still end up on Netflix. NBCUniversal and ViacomCBS have spoken about the importance of licensing while setting up their streaming businesses. But the biggest titles, the ones that executives think people will sign up for, will remain exclusive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AlSwBU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Instead of spending $14 a month to watch all of those shows, it’ll now cost approximately $45 a month&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cC1gTw"&gt;For companies like Disney and WarnerMedia, it makes sense. I’m sure people are watching &lt;em&gt;Friends &lt;/em&gt;on HBO Max; whether it’s driving subscriber growth remains to be seen. Other titles that WarnerMedia doesn’t need exclusively get sold off somewhere else — like &lt;em&gt;Rick and Morty&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/rick-and-morty-season-4-hbo-max-hulu-release-date"&gt;which is also on Hulu&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a similar deal with ViacomCBS, which licensed &lt;em&gt;South Park &lt;/em&gt;to WarnerMedia (it now streams on HBO Max) for &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/south-park-stream-exclusively-hbo-max-1203387212/"&gt;more than $500 million&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, the rights will revert back to the original content holders, and they’ll do another calculus as to where &lt;em&gt;South Park&lt;/em&gt; can make them the most money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mNrh8U"&gt;What’s impossible to ignore, however, is how much our streaming experiences have changed in less than a decade. It used to be that if you wanted to watch something, there was a 90 percent chance Netflix had it. If Netflix didn’t, it was probably on Hulu. Now, it practically takes a college degree in content ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="94Stg4"&gt;All of which is a long way of saying, “Who knows where &lt;em&gt;Into the Spider-Verse &lt;/em&gt;will end up?” So, if you want to watch it on Netflix, do it now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jhX3OJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TjF0c3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ehawwd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qd5qqy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The ACLU is suing for more information about the FBI’s phone-hacking lab</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4wNRkrtmqPhSWfHDOeKkSJXnty8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68572501/acastro_180109_1777_0003_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BGKIVx"&gt;On Tuesday, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a new lawsuit demanding information about the FBI’s Electronic Device Analysis Unit (EDAU) — a forensic unit that the ACLU believes has been quietly breaking the iPhone’s local encryption systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFP3QN"&gt;“The FBI is secretly breaking the encryption that secures our cell phones and laptops from identity thieves, hackers, and abusive governments,” the ACLU said &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/the-fbi-is-secretly-breaking-into-encrypted-devices-were-suing/"&gt;in a statement announcing the lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, “and it refuses to even acknowledge that it has information about these efforts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PdnXlh"&gt;The FBI has made few public statements about the EDAU, but the lawsuit cites a handful of cases in which prosecutors have submitted a “Mobile Device Unlock Request” and received data from a previously locked phone. The EDAU also put in public requests for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/9/17550970/apple-ios-usb-restricted-mode-iphone-passcode-cracking-bypassed-usb-accessory"&gt;the GrayKey devices&lt;/a&gt; that found success unlocking a previous version of iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GsSWeJ"&gt;In June 2018, the ACLU filed a FOIA request for records relating to the EDAU, but the FBI has refused to confirm any records even exist. After a string of appeals within the FOIA process, the group is &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/aclu-v-department-justice-complaint-injunctive-relief?redirect=aclu-v-department-justice-complaint-injunctive-relief"&gt;taking the issue to federal court&lt;/a&gt;, calling on the attorney general and FBI inspector general to directly intervene and make the records available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5HVt4V"&gt;“We’re demanding the government release records concerning any policies applicable to the EDAU, its technological capabilities to unlock or access electronic devices, and its requests for, purchases of, or uses of software that could enable it to bypass encryption,” the ACLU said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PDW8TM"&gt;For years, Apple has promoted its iOS disk encryption as a powerful protection against identity theft and unauthorized access — a crucial reassurance as more and more sensitive data is routed through our phones. Apple’s insistence on robust data security has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/12/10749806/encryption-debate-fbi-terrorism-going-dark"&gt;brought it into conflict with the FBI&lt;/a&gt;, which has repeatedly pressured the company to build a backdoor into its system, most notably in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/29/11325030/apple-fbi-iphone-hack-security-encryption-what-comes-next"&gt;the San Bernardino case&lt;/a&gt;. The FBI’s current capability to break iOS encryption remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zoom may launch an email service and calendar app to compete with Google and Microsoft</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rrtrlNpAmcag-yDlGK1rDKNV5JE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68572093/acastro_200331_1777_zoom_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EXWZEp"&gt;Videoconferencing platform Zoom has had a blockbuster year, with its stock price rising more than 500 percent due to the unprecedented surge in remote work brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. But now the company is looking to expand beyond workplace video chat and into new territories, specifically email and calendar services, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/buoyed-by-video-success-zoom-explores-email-calendar-services"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sEo54i"&gt;The company is already working on the email product, which the report states will be a web email service Zoom may begin testing as early as next year. The calendar app appears farther off and it’s unclear if development has even started. But both ideas are smart avenues for Zoom to explore, especially if companies start bringing employees back to the office and reliance on videoconferencing declines as COVID-19 vaccine distribution picks up through 2021. Zoom declined to comment for this story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nZwfDI"&gt;Many of Zoom’s major competitors are videoconferencing platforms bundled as part of broader enterprise app suites, with the two biggest ones belonging to Microsoft with its Office 365 platform and Google with its competing Workspace bundle. Both of those platforms offer calendar, email, and videoconferencing products, so it makes sense Zoom would look to email and calendar to try to round out its offerings and make Zoom less of single-purpose platform.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hvOcYe"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;report has a number of other telling signs the company is interested in building a full enterprise app suite, including job postings for “exciting chat features” and its existing integrations with other apps like Asana and Dropbox. But there is always the possibility the company decides to wait and see how the shift back to office work affects businesses and whether remote work remains a prominent factor of life well into the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJUzH7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 23rd, 2:58PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Noted that Zoom declined to comment. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
