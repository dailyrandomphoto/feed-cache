    <title>Instagram is testing a desktop posting feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f88aHUW3kIp5vsonrnILMN3WRco=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69502691/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UXKMyW"&gt;Instagram is testing the ability to create posts using the web browser on a desktop computer. The feature was spotted by social media consultant Matt Navarra, who captured some &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1408068647025664025"&gt;screenshots&lt;/a&gt; demonstrating the functionality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="57ldfT"&gt;Facebook confirmed the test in a statement &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-24/instagram-tests-letting-users-post-to-feeds-from-desktop"&gt;to Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;. “We know that many people access Instagram from their computer,” spokesperson Christine Pai said. “To improve that experience, we’re now testing the ability to create a Feed post on Instagram with their desktop browser.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wBlAXL"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;NEW! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/instagram?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Instagram&lt;/a&gt; lets you create + publish posts via desktop! &lt;a href="https://t.co/JWzwKg1kyO"&gt;pic.twitter.com/JWzwKg1kyO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Matt Navarra (@MattNavarra) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1408068647025664025?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q8nQgF"&gt;Navarra’s screenshots show that you’re able to select aspect ratios, apply built-in filters, and use basic editing parameters within the browser. The feature isn’t appearing for everyone yet, but it’s highlighted in the top right of the screen with a message saying “Now you can create and share posts directly from your computer,” suggesting Instagram is serious about a broader rollout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VIhhlk"&gt;Instagram has been historically slow to implement features on its web app, particularly on desktops. Direct messaging only became available &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/10/21215449/instagram-dm-web-browser-update-direct-message"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;, for example. But social media professionals who use Instagram as part of their daily workflow have had to resort to third-party tools to create posts on desktops, showing that some use cases don’t necessarily benefit from a mobile-only approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="q4XrlE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Instagram on desktop is better than mobile, change my mind","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/23/17157618/instagram-desktop-browser-mobile-app"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>This Google Contacts redesign is starting to look a bit like Google Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vT5XgtI5h61KlY_CK4rJazEC7Dc=/0x0:1000x667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69502435/gcontacts_2021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XEH98m"&gt;While Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22546791/microsoft-windows-11-announcement-features-updates"&gt;previews its next OS&lt;/a&gt;, Google is &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/06/update-google-contacts-experience.html"&gt;displaying a new look for Contacts&lt;/a&gt;. According to the company this Circles-style extra information is “a new experience for Google Contacts which will help Google Workspace users learn more about their colleagues.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xxpwF9"&gt;In practice, it displays your organizational chart as a part of the Contacts UI as well as your history with a particular person, including both emails and meetings. Keeping things cleanly organized in order to “easily learn more about your colleagues and stakeholders” sounds good. The only problem is that something makes it feel one step away from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/06/28/google-launches-social-layer-google"&gt;bad old days of the early 2010s&lt;/a&gt;, when Google forced Google Plus sorting and feeds onto everyone. Events spam and “Email from Google Plus” were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/9/17952604/google-plus-user-profiles-forced-youtube-gmail-search"&gt;just some of the lowlights&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SoAOTn"&gt;There’s no indication that this model is coming to personal accounts, just to Workspace users and G Suite accounts of various levels over the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="789TEh"&gt;As for the actual Google Plus, that ended in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/10/18134541/google-plus-privacy-api-data-leak-developers"&gt;privacy breaches&lt;/a&gt; and Congressional investigations before the entire thing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/5/21281409/google-plus-currents-gsuite-july"&gt;rebranded as Currents&lt;/a&gt;, a product that some people still find useful.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>Unplug your WD My Book Live, or you might find your drive’s data wiped</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Picture of the NAS with the text “Put your life on it”" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e_bs_kf2smwyBe1e90DkPu98lW8=/0x85:1024x768/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69501942/WD.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="http://products.wdc.com/library/AAG/ENG/4178-705202.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;WD product overview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4tdizQ"&gt;If you own a WD My Book Live NAS, you should immediately disconnect it from your network — users have discovered that their data has seemingly been deleted off the device, with no action on their part (&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/mass-data-wipe-in-my-book-devices-prompts-warning-from-western-digital/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). In &lt;a href="https://community.wd.com/t/action-required-on-my-book-live-and-my-book-live-duo/268147"&gt;a post on its community forum&lt;/a&gt;, WD says that the data loss appears to be the result of “malicious software,” and advises any My Book Live or My Book Live Duo owners to disconnect their devices from the internet to protect their data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HxKiEm"&gt;Some users &lt;a href="https://community.wd.com/t/help-all-data-in-mybook-live-gone-and-owner-password-unknown/268111/19"&gt;on WD’s forum&lt;/a&gt; report that their devices appear to have been factory reset, while others report seeing &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/wd-my-book-nas-devices-are-being-remotely-wiped-clean-worldwide/"&gt;a page requesting a password they don’t know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cw6GnB"&gt;In most cases, those who have been affected say that all of the data on the device appears to be gone, with their file structure either remaining intact, but with empty folders, or no folders at all except the ones that come by default on the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f0lkbJ"&gt;We’ve reached out to WD to ask for comment, and we’ve explicitly asked whether the company will offer data recovery services to affected users, but we haven’t yet gotten a response. The company sent statements to both &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/wd-my-book-nas-devices-are-being-remotely-wiped-clean-worldwide/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BleepingComputer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/mass-data-wipe-in-my-book-devices-prompts-warning-from-western-digital/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which largely mirrored &lt;a href="https://community.wd.com/t/action-required-on-my-book-live-and-my-book-live-duo/268147"&gt;its community post&lt;/a&gt;, saying that WD is investigating the incident, and doesn’t believe its servers were compromised.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is now a $2 trillion company</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RHpggulYAV5s2Sl9zHRYerqXS98=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69501756/vpavic_180502_2536_0018.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZaDnTb"&gt;Microsoft can add &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/06/24/microsoft-closes-above-2-trillion-for-first-time"&gt;ending the day as a $2 trillion company&lt;/a&gt; to the list of things it’s accomplished today, alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22546791/microsoft-windows-11-announcement-features-updates"&gt;announcing Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;. That makes it the second American publicly traded company ever to have a market capitalization of over $2 trillion (the other member of the club being Apple, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21375223/apple-2-trillion-market-cap-first-us-company-stock-price"&gt;which achieved it in August 2020&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/22/tech/microsoft-2-trillion-market-cap/index.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;CNN Business&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TkPpPq"&gt;It’s easy to see how 2020 contributed to Microsoft’s success: the PC market &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225356/pc-sales-shipments-2020-growth-idc-canalys-remote-work"&gt;grew by over 10 percent in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, according to estimates from IDC and Canalys, and seems &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22380920/pc-market-q1-growth-year-over-year-chip-shortage-covid-demand"&gt;to have kept some of that momentum&lt;/a&gt; this year. Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21334725/microsoft-q4-2020-earnings-azure-surface-xbox-gains-growth-profits-sales"&gt;also saw success&lt;/a&gt; with with its Surface devices, Xbox content, and cloud services — the company says its Intelligent Cloud segment &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2FInvestor%2Fearnings%2FFY-2020-Q4%2Fsegment-revenues" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;brought in $48 billion alone&lt;/a&gt; in its 2020 fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LQifFL"&gt;There’s also, of course, the aforementioned announcement of Windows 11, which could drive upgrades for people whose computers don’t &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/microsoft/22544171/microsoft-windows-11-system-requirements-hardware"&gt;meet the minimum requirements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="krLdwQ"&gt;The company’s market cap briefly rose above $2 trillion &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/22/tech/microsoft-2-trillion-market-cap/index.html"&gt;earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, but it had fallen ever so slightly below the mark by the time markets closed. Today, Microsoft was able to make it to market closing with a cap of $2.009 trillion, &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT?p=MSFT"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Yahoo Finance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reddit recovers from major outage </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rQ2APLAogSFb5qS1A8E_IMBtVnM=/81x67:1151x780/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69501469/Screen_Shot_2021_06_24_at_3.20.17_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reddit’s error page.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Reddit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y7awr5"&gt;Reddit was down for many on Thursday, but the company has implemented a fix and the site seems to be working normally. While the outage was going on, Reddit would regularly take a while to try to load a page before showing an error screen with error code 503. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ic34n1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.redditstatus.com/"&gt;On its status page&lt;/a&gt;, Reddit first reported an “elevated level of API errors” at 5:04PM ET Thursday, but &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/reddit/"&gt;Downdetector showed&lt;/a&gt; a huge spike of user reports of problems shortly after. (At their peak, reports surpassed 40,000.) At 6:51PM ET, Reddit said a fix was being implemented, and at 7:18PM ET, &lt;a href="https://www.redditstatus.com/incidents/3710db57k6n8"&gt;Reddit said the fix was in place&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wsB15vpWmM5q38QVVMsRqxBOWAo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22680198/image.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;What you might see when you try to load Reddit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="305erl"&gt;During the outage, the company also took to Twitter to assure users that its “team of Technical People” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Reddit/status/1408196051241029635"&gt;was working on the issues&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1BTTbp"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Sounds like some of you are experiencing issues accessing Reddit — fear not, our team of Technical People is working on it!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pls don't shoot the messenger,&lt;br&gt;social media manager&lt;/p&gt;— Reddit (@Reddit) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Reddit/status/1408196051241029635?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PyBz3n"&gt;Reddit didn’t reply to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gRiMky"&gt;This isn’t Reddit’s first recent outage — the site went down for almost an hour &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419545/reddit-partial-outage-down"&gt;in May&lt;/a&gt;. And Reddit was also taken down by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523953/twitch-reddit-down-fastly-outage-issues"&gt;huge global web outage in June&lt;/a&gt; that also affected sites like Amazon, Twitch, and even us here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;That outage was caused by issues with the Fastly content delivery network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7vt47U"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 24th, 7:41PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Reddit says the outage has been fixed, so we have updated this article accordingly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is supporting AMD’s answer to DLSS on Xbox consoles</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fpJH50"&gt;Microsoft is enabling Xbox developers to utilize AMD’s answer to Nvidia’s DLSS on console games. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22545441/amd-dlss-fidelityfx-super-resolution-fsr-supersampling-tests-benchmarks"&gt;FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) appeared recently&lt;/a&gt; on Windows PCs with the aim of boosting frame rates and maintaining image quality. It’s AMD’s answer to Nvidia’s Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) and early tests have shown it’s a promising technology that will work across multiple games and platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X9HLxp"&gt;FSR is now making its way to Xbox games, too. Microsoft has started previewing support for FSR in its Game Development Kit for both Windows and Xbox today. “It’s supported on Windows, Xbox Series X and S, and Xbox One consoles,” says Jason Ronald, Microsoft’s director of Xbox program management. “FSR was designed to enable developers to achieve higher frame rates and resolutions with minimal work for developers across both console and PC.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bScrVg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;

&lt;p id="DYb95m"&gt;The preview means it will be a while until Xbox games can take advantage of higher frame rates with FSR, but we’d expect to see it appear once Xbox games can be fully certified with FSR support. That’s likely to be some months away yet, so realistically we won’t see FSR appear in Xbox games until later this year or even early 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="daAmA7"&gt;Still, it’s encouraging to see Xbox support FSR early on. We reached out to AMD to clarify when this will be coming to PS5, but AMD isn’t commenting on that yet. Given the wide support across both AMD and Nvidia GPUs on PC, we’re fully expecting to see FSR appear on PS5 at some point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YDdkNR"&gt;Sony’s PS5 is currently lacking VRR or 1440p support on the PS5, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302646/sony-ps5-ssd-expansion-coming-summer-report"&gt;long-awaited M.2 SSD slot&lt;/a&gt; still hasn’t been enabled, so FSR support could be on Sony’s list of things to do. Sony has opened up a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538335/sony-ps5-beta-software-system-features-sign-up"&gt;PS5 beta program&lt;/a&gt; ahead of its next major system update, so fingers crossed we hear more about FSR support or the other missing PS5 features soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Thermapen One promises to make the best meat thermometer even better</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NBID9YftBCio6HIqabguTCZFVOY=/208x0:2197x1326/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69501379/Screen_Shot_2021_06_24_at_5.19.23_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZdZfdl"&gt;The ThermoWorks Thermapen is legendary among chefs as the gold standard in kitchen thermometers, affording the fastest and most reliable temperature readings around. And today, the company has revealed its latest model: &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thermoworks.com%2Fthermapen-one%3Fquantity%3D1%26color%3D16&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F24%2F22548839%2Fthermoworks-one-meat-thermometer-faster-grilling" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the $105 Thermapen One&lt;/a&gt;, which promises to achieve even faster temperature readings: less than a second (hence the name).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uTafjq"&gt;ThermoWorks says the new thermometer is the only sub-second instant-read thermometer that can take a “full temperature reading” — technically five full readings in order to reduce uncertainty — without using estimations or predictive algorithms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bd8HEP"&gt;The company says it spent more than five years developing the new thermometer, which features an improved thermocouple system developed in conjunction with Electronic Temperature Instruments to balance the faster speed with the delicate electronics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="k6UbSc"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wjyNBPPDN1s?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YvVVBz"&gt;In addition to the faster sensor, the Thermapen One also adds a few quality-of-life features, including a brighter backlight that’s better at adapting to ambient light and a redesigned battery door that’s easier to open (which does still require a screwdriver to maintain its IP67 water resistance, something that’s important given that it’s meant to be used in kitchens). It also has a longer five-year warranty, which is good to see given its relatively expensive price tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X3Tqh0"&gt;Admittedly, the Thermapen One is probably overkill for most home chefs; ThermoWorks offers a cheaper $35 &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thermoworks.com%2FThermoPop%3Futm_source%3Dgoogle_shopping%26utm_medium%3Dorganic%26gclid%3DCj0KCQjw2tCGBhCLARIsABJGmZ71CgKqvS0azm5AfBNQsrAmG9sIXHsOFXJU8hnOCchkydwJ9gxPYCMaApq4EALw_wcB&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F24%2F22548839%2Fthermoworks-one-meat-thermometer-faster-grilling" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Thermopop thermometer&lt;/a&gt; that can achieve readings in a comparatively glacial three to four seconds. But if you’re the kind of chef who really needs to-the-second or absolutely accurate temperature readings, the new Thermapen One seems like a great option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yIvUnP"&gt;The Thermapen One renders the old Thermapen Mk4 obsolete, and it will be sold at a slightly higher $105 price point. If you’re a chef on a budget who can tolerate ever-so-slightly longer speeds, the company is selling out the rest of the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thermoworks.com%2FThermapen-Mk4%3Fquantity%3D1%26color%3D16%26utm_source%3Dgoogle_shopping%26utm_medium%3Dorganic%26gclid%3DCj0KCQjw2tCGBhCLARIsABJGmZ5y7bUdnnkyOayQ47wUPobhwDz2Pk5OOoS8E_4uGXldqiqlSjWD4dsaAr3hEALw_wcB&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F24%2F22548839%2Fthermoworks-one-meat-thermometer-faster-grilling" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mk4 models at a discounted $69 price&lt;/a&gt;. Preorders for the Thermapen One start today, with shipping starting in mid-July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g5dSRQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 7:15PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new battery door does still require a Philips-head screwdriver to replace the AAA battery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Baltimore spy plane program was invasion of citizens’ privacy, court rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fh6MOCVnn-PokR65GjPMsxxey1s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69501249/acastro_190204_1777_privacy_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fN6L0i"&gt;The city of Baltimore’s spy plane program was unconstitutional, violating the Fourth Amendment protection against illegal search, and law enforcement in the city cannot use any of the data it gathered, &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22680040/fourth_circuit_decision_baltimore_june_24_2021.pdf"&gt;a court ruled Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. The Aerial Investigation Research (or AIR) program, which used airplanes and high-resolution cameras to record what was happening in a 32-square-mile part of the city, was &lt;a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/bs-md-pol-plane-canceled-20210203-ha3ixtgiyfg4rpgmfftrsd6uwu-story.html"&gt;canceled by the city &lt;/a&gt;in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DKTCqd"&gt;Local Black activist groups, with support from the ACLU, sued to prevent Baltimore law enforcement from using any of the data it had collected in the time the program was up and running. The city tried to argue the case was moot since the program had been canceled. That didn’t sit well with civil liberties activists. “Government agencies have a history of secretly using similar technology for other purposes — including to surveil Black Lives Matter protests in Baltimore in recent years,” the ACLU said in a &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/federal-appeals-court-rules-baltimore-aerial-surveillance-program-unconstitutional"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j58UDW"&gt;In an en banc ruling, the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit found that “because the AIR program enables police to deduce from the whole of individuals’ movements, we hold that accessing its data is a search and its warrantless operation violates the Fourth Amendment.” Chief Judge Roger Gregory wrote that the AIR program “is like a 21st century general search, enabling the police to collect all movements,” and that “allowing the police to wield this power unchecked is anathema to the values enshrined in our Fourth Amendment.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="er7D1l"&gt;The AIR program was run by a company called Persistent Surveillance Systems &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/9a3nyp/baltimore-police-cant-explain-why-their-all-seeing-spy-planes-were-kept-secret"&gt;with funding from two Texas billionaires&lt;/a&gt;. The city police department admitted to using planes to surveil Baltimore residents in 2016 but approved a six-month pilot program in 2020, which was active until October 31st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TMTJPu"&gt;City authorities said the AIR program was meant to help stem violent crime, and a district court had ruled that the program was capable only of short-term tracking and that people weren’t necessarily identifiable in the images collected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nonpf4"&gt;But the Fourth Circuit majority said that assessment wasn’t accurate and said since the AIR program “opens ‘an intimate window’ into a person’s associations and activities, it violates the reasonable expectation of privacy individuals have in the whole of their movements.” The court added that the AIR program surveillance “transcends mere augmentation of ordinary police capabilities. People understand that they may be filmed by security cameras on city streets, or a police officer could stake out their house and tail them for a time.... But capturing everyone’s movements outside during the daytime for 45 days goes beyond that ordinary capacity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r5uBLX"&gt;Plaintiff Dayvon Love, director of public policy for Leaders of a Beautiful Struggle, said in a statement Thursday that his organization had maintained that aerial surveillance isn’t a legitimate or effective means for making Baltimore’s communities safer. “We have always sought to challenge the racial imbued ideology of police-ism: the belief that all urban problems must be addressed primarily or exclusively through the lens of policing,” Love said. “And we are gratified that Chief Judge Gregory saw the importance of that challenge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XbWkhW"&gt;The Baltimore Police Department did not immediately reply to a request for comment Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon is acquiring a podcast hosting and monetization platform</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PfFwq5QOFbzG4r8bNnNKsWbXUtI=/0x0:710x473/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69501005/amazonmusicart19.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Amazon Music&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cRZYor"&gt;Amazon Music is getting more serious about its podcast endeavors. Today, the company &lt;a href="https://podcasters.amazon.com/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s acquiring Art19, a major podcast hosting and monetization platform for an undisclosed sum. This means Amazon will now have a hand in hosting podcasters’ shows as well as selling ads against them because Art19 operates an ad marketplace that targets and inserts ads into programming. An Amazon Music spokesperson says nothing will immediately change on the Art19 platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MfNKJz"&gt;This is a major step for Amazon as it looks to take on a bigger role in the podcasting world. Amazon Music only started offering podcasts in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21439531/amazon-music-podcasts-prime-titles"&gt;September last year&lt;/a&gt;, as did Audible &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536963/amazon-free-podcast-update-catalog"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt;. But in the time since, Amazon Music has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/30/22098312/amazon-music-wondery-acquire-buy-podcast-industry"&gt;acquired Wondery&lt;/a&gt;, one of the last major independent podcast networks. Today’s acquisition gives it a fuller role in the industry. Not only will it make content through Wondery and distribute shows through its app, but now, Amazon can host those podcasts, as well as third parties’, and sell ads against them. This gives Amazon even more data about what’s happening both inside and outside its app. (Amazon Music already &lt;a href="https://advertising.amazon.com/solutions/products/audio-ads"&gt;sells audio ads&lt;/a&gt;, so Art19’s business might complement that work.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9cPTvU"&gt;We’ve seen this same scenario already play out with Spotify. The company started out making content-based acquisitions, like that of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/6/18213462/spotify-podcasts-gimlet-anchor-acquisition"&gt;Gimlet Media&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/26/18282301/spotify-podcasts-parcast-acquisition-gimlet-media-anchor"&gt;Parcast&lt;/a&gt;, but then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21557458/spotify-megaphone-podcast-streaming-ad-insertion"&gt;acquired Megaphone&lt;/a&gt;, an Art19 competitor. In that case, Spotify has focused on bringing a proprietary ad-serving technology to the platform, called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/8/21056336/spotify-streaming-ad-insertion-technology-ces-launch"&gt;Streaming Ad Insertion&lt;/a&gt;, in order to encourage podcasters to move over to the hosting service and take advantage of its ad marketplace. Other companies in the space have also taken a similar position. iHeartMedia &lt;a href="https://www.tritondigital.com/news-item/February-17-2021/iheartmedia-to-acquire-triton-digital-from-scripps"&gt;acquired Triton Digital&lt;/a&gt;, and SXM Media acquired Midroll, an ad-serving marketplace and platform, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/13/21315911/siriusxm-stitcher-podcast-deal-buy-midroll-earwolf"&gt;in July&lt;/a&gt;. As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22287309/podcast-iheart-media-triton-digital-acquire-spotify"&gt;we said&lt;/a&gt; in February, the podcasting business isn’t only about the flashy exclusive content deals, but who can sell and monetize shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bp2Ik8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 24th, 9:11PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to reflect a spokesperson’s response to a request for comment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft will let devs keep every penny their Windows app makes — unless it’s a game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TJB6DMAmoyceCvC1nAVMTvyEH_w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69500961/acastro_180507_1777_microsoft_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LFZuGI"&gt;As part of its Windows 11 announcements on Thursday, Microsoft revealed &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/06/24/building-a-new-open-microsoft-store-on-windows-11/"&gt;a major policy change&lt;/a&gt; to incentivize developers to make apps for the Microsoft Store: starting on July 28th, if a developer uses their own or a third-party payment system in their app, Microsoft will let them keep 100 percent of the revenue. But the deal has one important caveat: it doesn’t apply to games, Microsoft confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Uher5"&gt;That omission further muddies the ongoing debate about the differences between an app and a game and app store policies around each — a distinction that is one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436014/apple-roblox-epic-fortnite-trial-what-is-game-name-change"&gt;core issues&lt;/a&gt; in the ongoing legal battle between &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;-maker Epic Games and Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FKSjej"&gt;Microsoft is largely on the side of apps and games being different because its bottom line depends on it. During the Epic trial, the company testified that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422691/microsoft-xbox-consoles-profit-software-services-revenue-apple-epic-games-trial"&gt;sells expensive Xbox hardware at a loss&lt;/a&gt; and makes its profits from the 30 percent cut it takes of game sales and subscriptions. But it also seemed like Microsoft was saying that PC games were different: the company recently announced that it would lower its cut of game revenues in the Microsoft Store &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409285/microsoft-store-cut-windows-pc-games-12-percent"&gt;from 30 to 12 percent starting on August 1st&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PXs1cS"&gt;It’s not clear if Epic CEO Tim Sweeney was aware of the caveat when &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1408094368918032386"&gt;he tweeted this&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jVlEs2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The 2021 version of Microsoft is the best version of Microsoft ever! &lt;a href="https://t.co/RTpFHpWazG"&gt;https://t.co/RTpFHpWazG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1408094368918032386?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2WzWEx"&gt;While the new 100 percent revshare option doesn’t apply to games, it’s still a significant policy shift — one that both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22546635/microsoft-windows-11-new-app-store"&gt;Windows chief Panos Panay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549007/microsoft-windows-11-satya-nadella-remarks-apple"&gt;Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella&lt;/a&gt; made a big deal about in their remarks at Thursday’s keynote. Now, we just have to see if the new model is enticing enough to bring more developers to the Microsoft Store and if the pressure will lead other platform holders like Apple and Google to make similar changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="GiTeba"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Satya Nadella’s closing Windows 11 remarks were a direct shot across Apple’s bow","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549007/microsoft-windows-11-satya-nadella-remarks-apple"},{"title":"Microsoft reveals the new Microsoft Store for Windows 11, and it has Android apps, too","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22546635/microsoft-windows-11-new-app-store"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
