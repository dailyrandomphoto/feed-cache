    <title>Use of Clearview AI facial recognition tech spiked as law enforcement seeks to identify Capitol mob</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hb0kA9"&gt;Clearview AI’s CEO says that use of his company’s facial recognition technology among law enforcement spiked 26 percent the day after a mob of pro-Trump rioters attacked the US Capitol. First reported &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/01/09/us/trump-biden#facial-recognition-clearview-capitol"&gt;by the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Hoan Ton-That confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Clearview saw a sharp increase in use on January 7th, compared to its usual weekday search volume. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fiHK1L"&gt;The January 6th attack was broadcast live on cable news, and captured in hundreds of images and live streams that showed the faces of rioters breaching the Capitol building. The FBI and other agencies have asked for the public’s help to identify participants. According to the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, the Miami Police Department is using Clearview to identify some of the rioters, sending possible matches to the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force. And &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported that an &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/local-police-force-uses-facial-recognition-to-identify-capitol-riot-suspects-11610164393"&gt;Alabama police department was also using Clearview&lt;/a&gt; to identify faces in images from the riot and sending information to the FBI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B0Vtld"&gt;Unlike other facial recognition used by authorities, which use images such as driver’s license photos and mug shot photos, Clearview’s database of some 3 billion images was scraped from social media and other websites, as revealed in a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition.html?searchResultPosition=1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; investigation last year&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21273388/aclu-clearview-ai-lawsuit-facial-recognition-database-illinois-biometric-laws"&gt;raising serious concerns about privacy&lt;/a&gt;, the practice of taking images from social media violated the platforms’ rules, and tech companies sent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21126063/facebook-clearview-ai-image-scraping-facial-recognition-database-terms-of-service-twitter-youtube"&gt;numerous cease and desist orders to Clearview&lt;/a&gt; in the wake of the investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0aSWL0"&gt;The company said in May it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21251387/clearview-ai-law-enforcement-police-facial-recognition-illinois-privacy-law"&gt;stop selling its technology to private companies&lt;/a&gt; and instead provide it for use by law enforcement only.  Some 2,400 law enforcement agencies across the US use Clearview’s software, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3CXpAM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford will idle its Kentucky plant this week amid semiconductor shortage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Ford Escape" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_5pQlJ4KPMYBKxp4sphrhXpMqqg=/0x0:5184x3456/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68645793/456152796.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jK0GiZ"&gt;Ford will idle its plant in Kentucky for a week as the automotive industry grapples with a shortage of semiconductors, &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/semiconductor-shortage-forces-automobile-production-cuts-75140296"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ABC News&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; The automaker’s assembly plant in Louisville produces the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair SUVs, and employs about 3,900 hourly workers, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/semiconductor-shortage-causes-ford-and-nissan-to-cut-vehicle-production.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Ford said will take a planned one-week plant shutdown that had been scheduled for later in the year and move it to this week instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HB1rNW"&gt;Ford joins Nissan, which says it will reduce production at one of its plants in Japan, which makes the Note, a car not sold in the US. A Nissan spokesperson said the semiconductor shortage has not affected the company’s US production&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cjpbIV"&gt;Volkswagen, Fiat Chrysler, and Toyota &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/volkswagen-china-production/chip-shortages-could-slow-automotive-production-vw-and-suppliers-say-idUSKBN28E1IN"&gt;also have reported problems&lt;/a&gt; with semiconductor supply chains, with Fiat Chrysler temporarily shuttering factories in Canada and Mexico. Volkswagen said in December it had changed some production of its vehicles at plants in North America, Europe and China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HE2otL"&gt;Vehicles are using more semiconductors than they have in the past for features like infotainment, driver assist, and Bluetooth connections, and in recent months, the demand for vehicles has outstripped the supply. Factories that make semiconductors had to shut down during the coronavirus pandemic, which also contributed to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21279633/laptop-pc-shortages-supply-chain-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic"&gt;delay in production&lt;/a&gt; of personal computers, and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-05/apple-is-said-to-face-shortages-in-power-chips-for-iphone-12?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;affected production of Apple’s iPhone 12.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>John Legere is considering becoming the Un-Candidate</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xg6u0TRkhDWfxnBQf1GFY7rWTSs=/0x0:3600x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68640329/JohnLegere_batman.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: John Legere&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U6Gzx8"&gt;John Legere, former T-Mobile CEO and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/7/10729714/john-legere-carrier-bullshit"&gt;aspiring Batman&lt;/a&gt;, has reacted to the mob that attacked the Capitol like many other political and business leaders by calling for President Donald Trump to step down. But he’s also going a step further by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JohnLegere/status/1347374021495681024?s=19"&gt;considering a run for political office himself&lt;/a&gt;. Legere left his post as CEO and member of T-Mobile’s board after successfully negotiating the merger between the company and Sprint, so he very well could be looking far and wide for his next gig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wzfrsy"&gt;Legere’s time as T-Mobile’s CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/mobile/2013/3/26/4149204/tmobile-new-direction-no-contracts-lte-uncarrier"&gt;turned the company into the “Un-Carrier,”&lt;/a&gt; a plan that came with an end to contracts, revamped mobile plans, and a variety of freebies and perks for customers designed to set T-Mobile apart from its longtime rivals AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon. But what would political candidacy — or un-candidacy — look like for Legere?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sPHao7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;For the first time in my life I am actually considering the possibility of running for office. It’s clear somebody needs to help real Americans find change. I’m not sure I’m capable, but I can’t stand by simply watching this craziness.&lt;/p&gt;— John Legere (@JohnLegere) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JohnLegere/status/1347374021495681024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8XygjM"&gt;Well, if it’s anything like his Un-Carrier moves, it could be a mixed bag. Legere &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2016/6/3/11852870/t-mobile-legere-montage"&gt;was brash and unafraid to roast the competition&lt;/a&gt;, and his attitude and leather jackets lean more un-presidential (or Cool) than anything else. But given the last four years we’ve had, we’re probably all used to the unconventional at this point. Tone matters less than not attempting to dissolve democracy, so the bar is low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vFWyyr"&gt;In terms of policy, popular proposals like &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/2/24/21151143/bernie-sanders-2020-polls-medicare-for-all"&gt;Medicare-for-all&lt;/a&gt; fit nicely within the logic of Legere’s Un-Carrier programs. A large part of Un-Carrier’s offering was zero-rating data from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/18/5822996/t-mobile-music-freedom-net-neutrality"&gt;certain music&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/10/9704482/t-mobile-uncarrier-binge-on-netflix-hbo-streaming"&gt;video streaming services&lt;/a&gt; so it wouldn’t count against T-Mobile customers’ bills. Why not do the same thing with costly medical expenses? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Vj3ug"&gt;Of course, this opens up another can of worms. Legere was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/11/10/7190109/do-you-want-net-neutrality-or-not-john-legere"&gt;publicly in support of net neutrality&lt;/a&gt; while he was CEO but pushed programs that flouted it. Those zero-rating schemes, like Binge On and T-Mobile’s other perks, actively favored the services that struck a deal with the company. A healthy internet and a strong Federal Communications Commission might not be at the top of Legere’s priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBl3s7"&gt;There’s no telling how serious Legere actually is or if a run would involve him appearing as the heightened version of himself that made him the unofficial mascot of T-Mobile, but there is a precedent. Executives from the wider world of the tech industry, &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2009-feb-10-me-whitman10-story.html"&gt;like former HP CEO Meg Whitman&lt;/a&gt;, have made attempts to hold a political office, and a businessperson thinking they could fix the country or a state in the same way they juice quarterly revenue is a common theme in modern US politics. I’m not holding my breath for a T-Mobile magenta paint job for the White House or press briefings styled as keynotes, but god it would make a good story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XG0wAK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 10th, 12:52 AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Legere has responded to our story in a roundabout way on his Instagram page, see below — does this suggest he’s serious, or just enjoying the continued meme? You be the judge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon is kicking Parler off its web hosting service</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o2lCkFzPnPkU0b1eWtZcfNaSooM=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68644435/acastro_180329_1777_amazon_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6OqwvA"&gt;In the latest blow to social app Parler, Amazon said Saturday it was suspending the company from its web hosting platform effective at 11:59PM PST Sunday. First reported by &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johnpaczkowski/amazon-parler-aws"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;unless Parler finds another web hosting service, the site will go offline Sunday night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pSELOn"&gt;Parler CEO John Matze said in &lt;a href="https://parler.com/post/009ba435b68c46d4955e1cd7737fa27c"&gt;a post on the site Saturday&lt;/a&gt; evening that the site could be offline for up to a week “as we rebuild from scratch.” Matze said the company had prepared for such an event, “by never relying on amazons [sic] proprietary infrastructure and building bare metal products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UZ2aYe"&gt;He added that “many” were competing for Parler’s business, and accused Amazon, Google, and Apple of a coordinated attack to kill competition. “We were too successful too fast, Matze wrote. “You can expect the war on competition and free speech to continue, but don’t count us out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VvuLCz"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/em&gt;, Amazon Web Services (AWS), told Parler officials that the violence in posts on the site ran afoul of its terms of service, and that it did not believe Parler had a process in place to get back on track. “Because Parler cannot comply with our terms of service and poses a very real risk to public safety, we plan to suspend Parler’s account effective Sunday, January 10th, at 11:59PM PST,” the company’s trust and safety team wrote in a letter to Parler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tz3CfL"&gt;Earlier on Saturday, a group of Amazon employees demanded the company sever its relationship with Parler and stop providing web hosting services to the platform. Amazon Employees for Climate Change and Justice tweeted Saturday that Amazon Web Services, the company’s internet infrastructure service that is the backbone of many websites and apps, should “deny Parler services until it removes posts inciting violence, including at the Presidential inauguration.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PRTL94"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557219/parler-conservative-app-download-new-users-moderation-bias"&gt;Parler has become popular&lt;/a&gt; among supporters of President Trump, as platforms like Twitter and Facebook tightened their moderation policies. The group of Amazon employees includes many higher-skilled workers at the company, including data scientists and software developers. It’s not the first time the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/3/21048047/amazon-employees-climate-change-communications-policy-job-risk"&gt;group has questioned its company’s practices&lt;/a&gt;; it published a letter in April 2019 calling on Amazon to adopt a plan to address climate change, and end AWS’s contracts with fossil fuel companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="t0tH0s"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Enough is enough. Amazon hosts Parler on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/awscloud?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@awscloud&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Amazon workers, we demand Amazon deny Parler services until it removes posts inciting violence, including at the Presidential inauguration. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We cannot be complicit in more bloodshed and violent attacks on our democracy.&lt;/p&gt;— Amazon Employees For Climate Justice (@AMZNforClimate) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AMZNforClimate/status/1347799256883552259?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pbKHey"&gt;Parler has been in the spotlight in the past several days, with activist group Sleeping Giants &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220366/apple-google-parler-pressure-deplatform-violence-capitol"&gt;calling for the app to be pulled from app stores&lt;/a&gt; in response to posts calling for violence against elected officials. Screenshots show posts on Parler—known as parleys— calling for Vice President Mike Pence to face a firing squad, and encouraging “Patriots” to return to Washington D.C. on January 19th with weapons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k238Au"&gt;According to the AWS &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aup/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;acceptable use policy&lt;/a&gt; customers may not use its services “for any illegal, harmful, fraudulent, infringing or offensive use.” AWS &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/far-right-haven-gabcom-had-its-fundraising-site-shut-down"&gt;cut ties with right-wing social site Gab&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, for violating its policy against hateful content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ef9GHz"&gt;On Friday, Google removed Parler from its Play Store because it lacked a robust mechanism for moderating “egregious content,” according to a statement.  “We’re aware of continued posting in the Parler app that seeks to incite ongoing violence in the US,” the statement reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ZjrVy"&gt;Late Saturday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22221730/apple-removes-suspends-bans-parler-app-store"&gt;Apple also banned Parler&lt;/a&gt; from its App Store. According to one report, before it was banned, Parler &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/parler-jumps-to-no-1-on-app-store-after-facebook-and-twitter-bans/"&gt;rose to the No. 1 spot&lt;/a&gt; in the App Store late Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0pv5fF"&gt;Parler didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="acmWvm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 9th, 9:40PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds report that Amazon will kick Parler off of its AWS hosting service Sunday&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CVHrfX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 9th, 10:02PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds comment from Parler CEO and confirmation from Amazon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple removes Parler from the App Store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s1zEUh9OTr-kmE8w5ICh-zXLQLA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68644631/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jYBDmZ"&gt;Apple has removed Parler from the App Store, following accusations that the social media app was fostering calls to violence ahead of, and following, the raid on the US Capitol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sczRDR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;We have always supported diverse points of view being represented on the App Store, but there is no place on our platform for threats of violence and illegal activity. Parler has not taken adequate measures to address the proliferation of these threats to people’s safety. We have suspended Parler from the App Store until they resolve these issues,” reads a statement from the company on Saturday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TMGX2M"&gt;Apple issued an ultimatum to Parler on Friday demanding that it remove content in violation with its policies and provide a plan on how it would moderate content moving forward, which was &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/apple-threatens-ban-parler?bftwnews&amp;amp;utm_term=4ldqpgc#4ldqpgc"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Apple said Parler had 24 hours to make the changes or else it would be removed from the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gFq69X"&gt;Apparently, Parler did propose some changes, but Apple decided they weren’t sufficient, according to a statement Apple sent to Parler alongside its final decision to remove the app. It states that “the processes Parler has put in place to moderate or prevent the spread of dangerous and illegal content have proved insufficient,” and that Parler will not return to the App Store until it has “demonstrated your ability to effectively moderate and filter the dangerous and harmful content on your service.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nbl08K"&gt;Here’s the full statement as provided by Apple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="fbXilX"&gt;To the developers of the Parler app,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yubcZL"&gt;Thank you for your response regarding dangerous and harmful content on Parler. We have determined that the measures you describe are inadequate to address the proliferation of dangerous and objectionable content on your app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YasLJX"&gt;Parler has not upheld its commitment to moderate and remove harmful or dangerous content encouraging violence and illegal activity, and is not in compliance with the App Store Review Guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9VKNj"&gt;In your response, you referenced that Parler has been taking this content “very seriously for weeks.” However, the processes Parler has put in place to moderate or prevent the spread of dangerous and illegal content have proved insufficient. Specifically, we have continued to find direct threats of violence and calls to incite lawless action in violation of Guideline 1.1 - Safety - Objectionable Content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NfOJuv"&gt;Your response also references a moderation plan “for the time being,” which does not meet the ongoing requirements in Guideline 1.2 - Safety - User Generated content. While there is no perfect system to prevent all dangerous or hateful user content, apps are required to have robust content moderation plans in place to proactively and effectively address these issues. A temporary “task force” is not a sufficient response given the widespread proliferation of harmful content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HwSxC1"&gt;For these reasons, your app will be removed from the App Store until we receive an update that is compliant with the App Store Review Guidelines and you have demonstrated your ability to effectively moderate and filter the dangerous and harmful content on your service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ySL7W"&gt;Regards, App Review Board&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="3Vis3k"&gt;The app was briefly still available on Apple’s store after we received the statement, but it disappeared from the store a number of minutes after we published this post. &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/parler-jumps-to-no-1-on-app-store-after-facebook-and-twitter-bans/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reported earlier today&lt;/a&gt;, the app jumped up to #1 on the App Store and may have gained hundreds of thousands of users between the time Apple issued its 24-hour ultimatum and when the company pulled it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f16mNP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221648/google-suspends-bans-parler-play-store"&gt;Google pulled Parler&lt;/a&gt; Friday evening. “We’re aware of continued posting in the Parler app that seeks to incite ongoing violence in the US,” Google said in a statement. “We recognize that there can be reasonable debate about content policies and that it can be difficult for apps to immediately remove all violative content, but for us to distribute an app through Google Play, we do require that apps implement robust moderation for egregious content. In light of this ongoing and urgent public safety threat, we are suspending the app’s listings from the Play Store until it addresses these issues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="74XGOB"&gt;Both Apple and Google faced pressure &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220366/apple-google-parler-pressure-deplatform-violence-capitol"&gt;on Friday&lt;/a&gt; to deplatform Parler, which is known for being conservative-friendly and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557219/parler-conservative-app-download-new-users-moderation-bias"&gt;having less stringent moderation&lt;/a&gt; than other social media platforms. The removal of both apps comes after a mob attack Wednesday on the US Capitol by pro-Trump rioters. On Friday, Amy Piekoff, head of policy at Parler, &lt;a href="https://video.foxnews.com/v/6221435493001#sp=show-clips"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Fox News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a ban from the App Store would be “huge,” adding that if it Apple removed Parler “we’re toast.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="daAZBG"&gt;Parler did not immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday. CEO John Matze &lt;a href="https://parler.com/post/7a9ba1df6d0949f2996dd7d5f13b1b49"&gt;posted a statement on Parler&lt;/a&gt; accusing Apple of applying a “horrible double standard” in its decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="URthnz"&gt;“Apple, Google and the rest of the anti-competitive pack of big tech tyrants coordinate their moves and work together to stifle competition in the marketplace,” he wrote. Matze added more details would be coming soon about Parler’s plans “as we have many options.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hjzs5v"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 9th, 8:58PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added statement from Parler CEO&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WaBW2Y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QbyNph"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BPWAQQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What just happened this week?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-POLITICS-UNREST" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7t2C2MDQ90WkmKTW7RJUzO-mbNA=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68644216/1230486822.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A mob of President Trump’s supporters rioted at the Capitol  | Photo by ALEX EDELMAN/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3QTk5R"&gt;Ah, what a year this week has been! Our entire perception of time &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22167586/pandemic-time-perception-2020-covid"&gt;has already been skewed by the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, but even by &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; standard the last few days have felt like a bizarre time warp, starting with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22213105/slack-outage-down-2021-server-error"&gt;Slack outage on Monday&lt;/a&gt; that seemed like it would be the story of the week. Oh how naive we were. Of course, Wednesday’s attack on the Capitol as Congress was certifying the Electoral College results dominated the rest of the news cycle, and social media and other online platforms decided that by &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22220746/trump-speech-incite-capitol-riot"&gt;inciting the rioters&lt;/a&gt;, the president had finally crossed a line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wK7vmN"&gt;Here’s a review of the tumultuous first week of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aRjs3y"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday, January 6th&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="t4gziB"&gt;After he spoke to a rally near the White House, a mob of Trump supporters marched on, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217411/capitol-building-lockdown-protesters-trump-supporters"&gt;and broke into the US Capitol building&lt;/a&gt;. Five people were killed, and scores have been arrested with more to come. YouTube scrambled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217421/capitol-building-trump-mob-protest-live-stream-youtube-twitch-facebook"&gt;to moderate livestreams&lt;/a&gt; and surface authoritative sources as rioters livestreamed their activities. President Trump posted a video repeating that the election had been stolen and praising the protesters, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217697/twitter-trump-facebook-restrict-violence-tweet-video-capitol-riot-maga"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217743/trump-capitol-attack-youtube-video-removed-twitter-facebook-moderation"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217788/facebook-remove-trump-video-emergency-situation-mob-violence"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; all promptly removed from their platforms. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217686/trump-twitter-account-locked-capitol-hill-riot-tweets-policy-violations"&gt;Twitter issued a 12 hour ban&lt;/a&gt; on the president, requiring him to delete several tweets that appeared to glorify the violence at the Capitol.  &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22218009/trump-facebook-ban-block-posting-24-hours-capitol-riot"&gt;Facebook and Instagram banned Trump for 24 hours&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Tga3tO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday, January 7th&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ygulXD"&gt;At about 3:30 a.m., Vice President Mike Pence &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/01/06/congress-electoral-college-vote-live-updates/"&gt;affirmed the results of the presidential election&lt;/a&gt;, cementing President-elect Joe Biden’s victory. The largely ceremonial action came after Congress returned to the Capitol following the expulsion of throngs of rioters. But the consequences of Wednesday’s violence for President Trump started to become clear. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;Facebook banned the president “indefinitely”&lt;/a&gt;, ensuring he won’t be able to post there for the remainder of his term. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218776/shopify-trump-store-disable-campaign-ecommerce-sites-capitol"&gt;Shopify took down Trump’s campaign store&lt;/a&gt;, where his followers purchased Make America Great Again hats and other merch. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218876/youtube-trump-videos-election-results-misinformation-strike-removed"&gt;YouTube announced it would punish Trump&lt;/a&gt; and other channels for spreading election lies, and Twitch said it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22219144/twitch-trump-ban-indefinitely-capitol-attack"&gt;disabling Trump’s account&lt;/a&gt;. TikTok, the video platform that had been in the president’s crosshairs for months, removed a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22219644/tiktok-videos-trump-inciting-supporters-us-capitol"&gt;video of Trump inciting &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218876/youtube-trump-videos-election-results-misinformation-strike-removed"&gt;supporters to storm the Capitol&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0nvfZi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday, January 8th &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="zuxBhr"&gt;As the House considered impeaching Trump a second time, more platforms made their restrictions on the president and his followers permanent. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220778/alphabet-workers-union-demands-youtube-ban-trump"&gt;Alphabet Workers Union called on YouTube to ban Trump&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220834/reddit-trump-subreddit-ban-violence-us-capitol-mob"&gt;Reddit banned the r/donaldtrump forum&lt;/a&gt; for inciting violence. Apple and Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220366/apple-google-parler-pressure-deplatform-violence-capitol"&gt;faced pressure to deplatform social site Parler&lt;/a&gt; over calls to violence, and later in the day, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221648/google-suspends-bans-parler-play-store"&gt;Google pulled Parler from its Play Store,&lt;/a&gt; with Apple threatening to do the same. Gaming chat platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221579/discord-bans-the-donald-server-reddit-subreddit"&gt;Discord banned pro-Trump server ‘The Donald’&lt;/a&gt; and Twitter banned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221332/twitter-ban-qanon-accounts-michael-flynn-sidney-powell-ron-watkins"&gt; QAnon supporters, including former national security adviser Michael Flynn&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gcTflw"&gt;And after hundreds of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221386/twitter-employees-trump-ban-internal-letter-capitol-attack"&gt;Twitter employees called for Trump to be banned&lt;/a&gt;, at long last, the president’s favorite social media platform pulled the plug: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;Twitter permanently suspended his realDonald Trump&lt;/a&gt; account, after he resumed tweeting and said he would not be attending President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration. Trump tried to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221683/trump-tried-to-evade-his-ban-with-potus-but-those-tweets-were-instantly-deleted"&gt;tweet from the @POTUS account,&lt;/a&gt; but those tweets were removed almost immediately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aBCeqd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday, January 9th&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="24LMIS"&gt;By Saturday afternoon, several &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/trump-resignations.html"&gt;Trump administration officials had resigned&lt;/a&gt;, and Sen. Richard Warner called on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22222200/social-media-telco-urged-preserve-evidence-capitol-attack-twitter-facebook-google-verizon-apple"&gt;telco and social platforms to preserve content&lt;/a&gt; about the attack on the Capitol that could be digital evidence. The United States Capitol, Warner wrote, “is now a crime scene.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q9jJWr"&gt;Late Saturday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22221730/apple-removes-suspends-bans-parler-app-store"&gt;Apple announced it would ban Parler&lt;/a&gt; from its App Store, saying the app “has not upheld its commitment to moderate and remove harmful or dangerous content encouraging violence and illegal activity.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="41HQqp"&gt;Biden’s inauguration is 11 days away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UQnMyB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 9th, 9:05PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added Apple’s ban on Parler&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump’s ban from Twitter creates the ultimate case of link rot in posts across the internet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/crkIr0q-ghjIB5wF4F8EE8xylTs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68643910/acastro_180827_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4dPXR0"&gt;When Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;banned President Trump&lt;/a&gt; from its platform permanently on Friday, the thousands of tweets he put forth from his realDonaldTrump account over the past decade were wiped out. Retweets of realDonaldTrump tweets from other accounts now show a “this tweet is unavailable” message instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JnF4BL"&gt;But embeds of Trump’s original tweets are now displaying in articles across the internet as shadows of their former selves, some with just the text of the former tweet included, others as empty gray boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eYJGsZ"&gt;This effect, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot"&gt;known as link rot&lt;/a&gt;, happens when images or content are deleted or otherwise broken, so links don’t point back to the original target, whether that’s a tweet, a video, or a web page. In most instances, a dead link is a visually unappealing annoyance, but link rot can pose problems when it comes to legal citations. A &lt;a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/futureoftheinternet/2013/09/22/perma/"&gt;2013 study by Harvard University&lt;/a&gt; found that nearly half of the hyperlinks cited in Supreme Court decisions were broken. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YFIJyX"&gt;For context, here’s an embed of the tweet by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey that started it all. If you click on it, it takes you to his page on Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="w7oDEj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;just setting up my twttr&lt;/p&gt;— jack (@jack) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/20?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 21, 2006&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="822HGt"&gt;Trump’s tweets aren’t completely gone from the internet; some of the president’s tweets must be preserved under the Presidential Records Act (which predates Twitter by 40-plus years), and there’s a &lt;a href="https://www.thetrumparchive.com/"&gt;sortable archive of his tweets&lt;/a&gt; built by an independent developer. And  most internet users are familiar with the &lt;a href="https://archive.org/web/"&gt;Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;, a library of millions of snapshots of websites as they exist at a given moment in time, which can help when looking for old, updated, or deleted content. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/9/10952050/politwoops-returns-twitter-politicians-deleted-tweets"&gt;There’s also Politwoops&lt;/a&gt;, the site that preserves politicians’ deleted tweets for posterity, in case you really want to remind yourself about such highlights as the &lt;a href="https://projects.propublica.org/politwoops/tweet/869766994899468288"&gt;covfefe moment of 2017&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2TqyuA"&gt;Twitter first introduced embeddable tweets in 2012, allowing users to display tweets within blog posts and articles as they appear on the site itself. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/8/21/4644942/facebook-now-lets-you-embed-posts-anywhere-on-the-web"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, Snapchat, YouTube and Instagram also have allowed embeddable posts and content for some time. But as with anything on the internet, content links only live as long as the content itself. And as more and more platforms eject or otherwise restrict the outgoing president’s presence on the internet we’ll see more dead links where his content used to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tCGEck"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Social media and telco companies urged to preserve evidence from Capitol attack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uYx6LN5QqKIZvEdN5raw-DLZWmA=/25x0:2016x1327/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68643477/GettyImages_1230453521.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Rioters breached security at the Capitol on Wednesday January 6th | Photo by Olivier Douliery / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7aoZXg"&gt;Sen. Mark Warner (D-Virginia), incoming chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, is asking mobile carriers and social media platforms to preserve “content and associated metadata” that may be  connected to the attack on the US Capitol. Warner said in a statement Saturday that he contacted the CEOs of AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile, Verizon, Apple, Facebook, Gab, Google, Parler, Signal, Telegram, and Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v4VTOB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“The United States Capitol is now a crime scene,” Warner &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22224462/capitol_attack_twitter.pdf"&gt;wrote in his letters&lt;/a&gt;. “The FBI and other law enforcement agencies are currently investigating the events of that day, and trying to piece together what happened and the perpetrators involved. The prospect of litigation on behalf of the victims of the mayhem also is highly likely. Messaging data to and from your subscribers that may have participated in, or assisted, those engaged in this insurrection – and associated subscriber information – are critical evidence in helping to bring these rioters to justice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1yemBp"&gt;Warner noted that many of those participating in the January 6th attack that left five people dead posted images to social media, or shared them via text and mobile messaging platforms while the riot was underway and afterward, “to celebrate their disdain for our democratic process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTUI64"&gt;All the named companies routinely comply with &lt;a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/digitaldiscovery/library/preservation/preservationanalysis.html"&gt;court-issued preservation orders&lt;/a&gt;, issued during criminal investigations. But Warner’s letter is an informal request, without the legal force of a criminal preservation order, and it is unclear how the companies will respond. Court-issued preservation orders are often issued under seal so it is also possible that one of the many agencies investigating the Capitol raid has already issued such an order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVn9sb"&gt;We’ve reached out to the companies to ask how and if they plan to comply with Warner’s request and will update if we hear back from them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DhFLv8"&gt;A Facebook spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company was “continuing our ongoing, proactive outreach to law enforcement and have worked to quickly provide responses to valid legal requests. We are removing content, disabling accounts, and working with law enforcement to protect against direct threats to public safety.” T-Mobile acknowledged it had received Warner’s letter. “As always, we will fully cooperate with requests from law enforcement,” a spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2HhUjv"&gt;To reiterate, however, Warner’s request doesn’t carry quite the same legal weight as a subpoena or other formal request from a law enforcement agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t8fHkL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/08/capitol-riot-democrats-social-media-456325"&gt;Warner told &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that following Wednesday’s attack, Congress would “come back with a vengeance” against social media platforms that were unable to rein in violent content and threats on their platforms. “This is going to come back and bite ‘em,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cJb7nH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 9th 1:15PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Adds comment from Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mY9cWX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 9th 3:43PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Adds comment from T-Mobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use your Oculus Quest 2 to play any PC VR game wirelessly</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Virtual Desktop" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q8Sb_6aZYKAVgUN-Mu726FoGJrQ=/0x0:1440x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68643020/hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh hey, it’s all of my PC games available to play on the Quest 2, wire-free, from within a virtual room. This is getting weird.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vDDDh3"&gt;One of the best features of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;Oculus Quest 2&lt;/a&gt; is it can be manually linked via USB to your gaming PC to play more demanding VR games you couldn’t otherwise run natively on the headset. That’s great if you want a way to play games like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/23/21188291/half-life-alyx-review-valve-index-oculus-quest-vr-shooter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; but the obvious downside is that you’re now physically tethered to a PC — so much for the wireless freedom that the Quest 2 advertises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WTupji"&gt;Thankfully, developers have already figured out the seemingly impossible: how to run system-intensive titles on your PC and stream the visual feed to your VR device while syncing all of your movements over Wi-Fi. It gives you the best of both worlds: letting you play the games you want without being attached by a cable to your computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f3KFeB"&gt;Doing this isn’t as simple as installing an app through the Oculus store; there are several steps involved. I’m going to walk you through the steps required to make this happen on your Quest 2 virtual reality headset. The same steps likely work on the first Quest iteration, but I only have the latest model here to test.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o_t-Z4D9QRYXg53gktfDSroykrk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21869420/akrales_200904_4160_0158.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="y6XT1Z"&gt;Get a link cable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mkk0sS"&gt;Even though this is a how-to on experiencing VR without wires, you’ll need a wire to get started. Oculus sells an expensive 16-foot cable &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Faccessories%2Foculus-link%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22218827%2Foculus-quest-2-wireless-pc-vr-games-how-to#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for around $80&lt;/a&gt;, but that’s made for people who really want to use the Quest 2 in wired mode. There are other, less costly alternatives, like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Powerline-Pull-up-Resistor-MacBook/dp/B01MZIPYPY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker’s 10-foot USB-C to USB Type-A 3.0 cable&lt;/a&gt;, which costs about $20 and gets the job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iSGod0"&gt;Many USB cables that come with modern Android phones will likely work, too. And the cable doesn’t have to be long — we’re just doing some simple data transfer here. Unfortunately, the USB-C cable that Oculus includes with each Quest 2 didn’t work for this process when I tried it. It’s simply for charging the headset.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Oculus Link cable" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d2-t2ZH4DcN5xNKEuiIxv-hPNeE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22220848/link.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the official Oculus Link cable. It costs $80 and is difficult to find in stock. You don’t need this specific model to get through this how-to!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HLFOrZ"&gt;Enable developer settings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ENBD4r"&gt;If you want to load files onto your Quest 2, you’ll need a developer account. Fortunately, it’s easy to do, but it’s a strange process that’s meant to be used by actual developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="M5h2bP"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://developer.oculus.com/sign-up/"&gt;Go to this page&lt;/a&gt; and sign in to your Facebook account in your browser of choice. Just make sure you sign in to the same Facebook account that you signed in to on your Quest 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iETLPN"&gt;The next part of the process is to name your “organization.” You can name it whatever you’d like. You can find a direct link to this page &lt;a href="https://developer.oculus.com/manage/organizations/create/"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt; in case you get lost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JviHwY"&gt;With those two steps out of the way, open up your Oculus mobile app (iOS or Android) and sign in with the same Facebook account. Then navigate to the “Settings” pane by clicking it at the bottom-right corner of the app window. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="f28QYc"&gt;On the next page, click “Oculus Quest 2” right beneath your name, and a few more options will expand from within it. Click “More Settings”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LjFHiH"&gt;Once you’re there, tap “Developer Mode” and switch it on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Uk0AYEdZujV8vYa_mbrXnBAMaQE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22220802/oculussettings.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click here to see more options, including “More Settings” that contains the Developer Mode toggle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AQD0Fp"&gt;Install the Quest 2 driver for your PC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FedPeY"&gt;The next couple of steps pave the way for you to sideload software onto the Quest 2 headset, which is a feature usually reserved for developers. If you’re using a Windows PC, you will need to install ADB drivers to let your PC write to the headset; according to the Oculus site, macOS and Linux systems don’t need a driver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="IfSXDw"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/oculus-adb-drivers/"&gt;Download the software linked here&lt;/a&gt;, hosted by Oculus. (Just check the box saying you agree to the terms of the license — you can read it if you want — and click on “Download.”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Tc4ftm"&gt;Once it’s downloaded, extract the contents of the folder. Then right click the item called “android_winusb.inf” and select “Install.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Oculus ADB driver" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yjLNsBnRKNtXnQL2frnTJKssLSM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22220830/androidinstall.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Install this driver to get this process started.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="E0oS4h"&gt;Buy the Virtual Desktop app for Quest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qYkSF8"&gt;The Virtual Desktop app lets you access your PC through the lens of a VR headset. You can use it for games, like we’ll be doing, but you can also watch movies you have stored on your PC in a variety of different virtual environments. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2F2017050365004772%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22218827%2Foculus-quest-2-wireless-pc-vr-games-how-to#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;There’s a Quest-specific version of the app that you can purchase here for $20&lt;/a&gt;. (Make sure it says that it’s compatible with Quest underneath the purchase button.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HsBT4k"&gt;After you purchase it, install it on the headset. We’ll be returning to this app in just a bit, but for now, a few other steps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Virtual Desktop" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iVvcJViGCifzUvXoqbandzJ1-6Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22220864/vd.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Virtual Desktop running on the Quest 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="moyHQc"&gt;Connect the Quest 2 to your PC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1c0QG0"&gt;Connect your Quest 2 via its side-mounted USB-C port to your PC’s fastest available USB port. If you’ve done everything correctly up to this point, you’ll see a message displayed in the headset asking if you want to allow USB debugging. Allow it to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2olhKD"&gt;Download and install SideQuest on your PC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3PXijo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://sidequestvr.com/"&gt;SideQuest&lt;/a&gt; is a free app and storefront for experiences that can be sideloaded onto your headset. For the purposes of this how-to, you’re just going to use it to apply a necessary patch to the Virtual Desktop app that I just suggested you buy and install on your Quest 2 headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="BzYKAc"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://sidequestvr.com/setup-howto"&gt;Head here to find the right installer for your operating system&lt;/a&gt; (I used the Windows 10 version for this how-to) and download it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9NwEZL"&gt;Once it finishes installing, run SideQuest &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="p8KAZs"&gt;At this point, your headset should show up as connected in the top-left corner of the SideQuest app on your PC with a green bubble. If it’s not showing as connected, check your headset’s display for a prompt. It may be waiting for you to allow your PC to access and modify the Quest 2’s file system. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sidequest app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/edGIzkrxEFjC_rfVmqW12xgoTV8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22220822/sidequestgreen.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The green light indicates that your headset is connected.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AxsTDf"&gt;Sideload the Virtual Desktop VR patch for Quest 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zzx32q"&gt;Within SideQuest, type “virtual desktop” in the search bar. The result you’re looking for is called “Virtual Desktop VR Patch.” This is the necessary key to fooling your computer into thinking your Quest 2 is a wired headset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="k4e6Qs"&gt;With your Quest 2 connected to your computer, hit the “Install to Headset” button in SideQuest, located just below the search bar in the app. The process should be pretty snappy, lasting just a few seconds. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sidequest" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5ziLKCpgcSGu-X0gG7CIl1FkaQg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22220813/questinstalltoheadset.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Install this necessary Virtual Desktop patch to your Quest 2 headset.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7F3xXK"&gt;Download Virtual Desktop Streamer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zwiEFT"&gt;There’s yet one more free application to download: &lt;a href="https://www.vrdesktop.net/"&gt;Virtual Desktop Streamer&lt;/a&gt;. Made by the same folks who made the Virtual Desktop app you purchased on the Quest 2, this app simply streams PC content to your headset via Wi-Fi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="LRXQqT"&gt;Once this app is downloaded and installed, you’ll need to input your Oculus username in the Streamer window &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Ovpydi"&gt;If you don’t know it off the top of your head, you can find it by opening the Oculus app on mobile, navigating to “Settings,” and then tapping on the area that shows your name and email address. The name that will display next to your avatar is your username.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Oculus app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R-J0UPjJSbyMOlAcOy2iyZNZhBk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22220804/oculusname.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Having a hard time finding your Oculus username? Tap on your full name in the Settings menu to see this view pictured above.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="dCc3Bu"&gt;After that’s entered, hit “Save”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RXWg5x"&gt;That’s the last step! But remember that it’s crucial to have the Virtual Desktop Streamer app open in order for your headset to communicate with your PC. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Virtual Desktop Streamer" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uFCk8sazQ5CJ39c4U4ARWJVRwXA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22220811/streamer.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s what the Virtual Desktop Streamer app looks like. It’s very simple.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FylPqj"&gt;Open Virtual Desktop on your Quest 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="tFxMTY"&gt;If every step was done correctly, you’ll see your PC pop up in the list of available devices to connect to from within the Virtual Desktop app on your Quest 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oWDSZP"&gt;Once you’ve connected, the Options button (the left Oculus Touch controller’s equivalent of the Oculus button) is mapped to open up the top-level menu for Virtual Desktop, as shown in the image below. From there, clicking “Games” will reveal every game that’s installed on your PC. You can simply boot each one from there, and your PC will handle all of the hard work. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Virtual Desktop" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RetcNAlbbLJZGLVlASVqciHC1_U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22220812/virtudaldesktopgames.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of the VR-ready games installed on your PC will show up within Virtual Desktop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="E4ucp4"&gt;If you aren’t happy with the visual fidelity within each game, you’re free to customize some settings that affect latency, refresh rate, and more. Note that you’ll likely get a clearer, more fluid image if your PC is powerful. Your wireless router plays a huge role in delivering a smooth experience, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PNzjSC"&gt;Streaming VR over Wi-Fi certainly isn’t a perfect solution. I play just a few feet away from a Wi-Fi 6-ready router that’s wired directly to my PC via an ethernet switch, yet I still experience the occasional spot of lag and slightly fuzzy image. Though with enough tweaking on the Virtual Desktop app (turning Wi-Fi off on seldom-used tech items never hurts), I think you’ll have a good time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="zU1OZb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Facebook is turning VR into a platform — but some indie devs fear its power","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21455665/facebook-oculus-vr-indie-developers-power-monopoly-concerns"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="92N37l"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: The last two paragraphs erroneously suggested that internet speed played a role in your ability to use this wireless solution to play your VR games. It’s all handled locally. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DraftKings announces it will now allow betting on drone races in some states</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Drone Racing League In London" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cMgMYKRJzSgaVrNx4n3SD6Wy9XQ=/0x0:3500x2333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68642983/695185380.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0z1ast"&gt;Sports betting company DraftKings and the Drone Racing League (DRL)  will now allow betting on drone races in some states, the two &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-drone-racing-league-and-draftkings-take-flight-with-official-sports-betting-agreement-ahead-of-season-finale-races-301203192.html"&gt;companies announced&lt;/a&gt;. DRL, which &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/draftkings-and-drone-racing-league-partnership-lets-you-bet-on-drone-races.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt; describes&lt;/a&gt; as a first-person view racing league, allows pilots to compete for prizes by flying their drones through courses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vRta0L"&gt;Residents of Colorado, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Tennessee, and West Virginia will be able to bet on the races via their phones, and regulatory approval is pending for betting on drone races in other states, the companies said. The terms of the deal and the amounts of the prize money weren’t disclosed, but drone racers &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/19/drone-racing-is-worth-100000-in-upcoming-championship.html"&gt;in a 2017 tournament&lt;/a&gt; competed for $100,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1eN4af"&gt;“The sky is now the limit for DRL fans to get skin in the game, and we’re thrilled to partner with DraftKings to transform our high-speed race competition into the ultimate sport to bet on,” DRL President Rachel Jacobson said in a statement. According to &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;, drones used in the events are built by DRL, and each one is worth about $2,000. The league has deals for media rights to the races with NBC Sports and Sky Sports, and a streaming arrangement with Twitter to host its preflight shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZcbws"&gt;DraftKings first introduced DRL drone races last year as a kind of test run, and says response was better than expected. &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaellore/2021/01/08/drone-racing-league-partners-with-draftkings/?sh=40faf1572a71"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the first free-to-play pool in November drew more than 150,000 entrants. DRL was &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.espn.com%2Fespn%2Fstory%2F_%2Fid%2F13431957%2Fproponents-see-huge-potential-drone-racing-league&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F9%2F22222051%2Fdraftkings-drl-betting-drone-races#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;established in 2015&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L5H8Cj"&gt;The first races, part of the 2020 DRL Allianz World Championship Season, are slated for Saturday at 4:30PM ET on NBC, Twitter, and Facebook. DRL and DraftKings will host pre-flight shows ahead of the live events to give fans details on how to participate. &lt;/p&gt;
