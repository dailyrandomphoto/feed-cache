    <title>Vrbo is blocking new Washington, DC reservations during inauguration week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pJdSuZSn_YDioOTYMYv4p5X0_TU=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68691308/Vrbo_logo_dark.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;vrbo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0AxJ2N"&gt;Vrbo has changed its stance on people making reservations in the Washington, DC area during the week of the inauguration. The company announced on January 19th, the day before the event, that it will block any new reservations through Friday, January 22nd. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/16/22234501/vrbo-cancel-reservations-washington-dc-inauguration-airbnb-capitol"&gt;Vrbo previously stated it was evaluating new bookings&lt;/a&gt; and that it would “take appropriate action in coordination with law enforcement” if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QW28dL"&gt;The news was tweeted by Expedia Group (which owns Vrbo) and from the official Vrbo Twitter account. It comes in light of DC officials encouraging people to &lt;a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2021/january/headline-891291-en.html"&gt;stay home and participate in the inauguration virtually&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XXCZk3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Based on updated guidance provided by government officials regarding security threats, and as part of ongoing efforts to protect the safety of travelers, partners and communities, all new Vrbo reservations will be blocked in and around Washington, D.C. through Friday, 1/22.&lt;/p&gt;— Vrbo (@vrbo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vrbo/status/1351583247260672005?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PqmXRz"&gt;The company has slowly been changing its policies around inauguration rentals, after &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katienotopoulos/vrbo-wont-cancel-inauguration-rentals"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Buzzfeed News&lt;/em&gt; reported that residents are concerned&lt;/a&gt; about extremists using the service to stay in DC. Vrbo &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vrbo.com%2Fvacation-ideas%2Fexplore-vrbo%2Ftravel-trends%2Fa-place-for-everyone-leaves-no-room-for-hate&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F19%2F22239269%2Fvrbo-blocking-new-reservations-dc-inauguration#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;says in a blog&lt;/a&gt; that it’s “encouraging hosts to cancel bookings” if they believe that the person is there to commit violence, but it’s not blanket-canceling existing reservations. The company does say it’s “re-vetting [them], to help ensure public safety,” but today’s news doesn’t change what Vrbo is doing about people who have already booked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qTBi2v"&gt;In comparison, Airbnb not only blocked new reservations, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228798/airbnb-washington-dc-inauguration-reservations-blocked-cancelled"&gt;but it canceled existing ones as well&lt;/a&gt;. On January 6th, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ExpediaGroup/status/1351050004312559617"&gt;Vrbo stated&lt;/a&gt; that all new reservations would be subject to increased scrutiny and security, but it seems like we’ll just have to trust that those measures were effective, as the new ban seems like it’ll only affect people who are booking last minute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KBJwBy"&gt;The home-sharing apps are not the only ones trying to avoid more violence in the nation’s capital ahead of tomorrow’s inauguration: Facebook has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233871/facebook-blocking-events-white-house-us-state-capitols-inauguration-day"&gt;shut down events near the White House&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22221730/apple-removes-suspends-bans-parler-app-store"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221648/google-suspends-bans-parler-play-store"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228675/amazon-parler-takedown-violent-threats-moderation-content-free-speech"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; have all worked to remove the distribution of Parler, an app that failed to moderate rioters during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/18/22236750/propublica-parler-capitol-riot-videos-timeline-resource"&gt;the attack on the Capitol building&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iybqKD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 20th, 10:02AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Updated to clarify that hosts are encouraged to cancel reservations if they are concerned about violence.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix confirms Shuffle Play feature will officially launch this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MyCj7CRBIvPB_tJDHRAzDvm9u64=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68694730/acastro_181101_1777_netflix_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zSW7Ew"&gt;Netflix’s Shuffle Play feature, which the company was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/18/21374543/netflix-shuffle-play-test-random-tv-movies"&gt;spotted testing last year&lt;/a&gt;, is getting a widespread launch in the first half of 2021. &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/netflix-shuffle-play-feature-official-launch-1234888490/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; the company made the announcement as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238877/netflix-200-million-subscribers-q4-earnings-bridgerton-emily-paris-cobra-kai-queens-gambit"&gt;its latest financial results&lt;/a&gt;. In its testing phase, Shuffle Play has worked by picking content based on your viewing history, helping you avoid feeling overwhelmed by Netflix’s home screen full of content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f0zbew"&gt;Netflix’s COO and chief product officer Greg Peters said the feature is designed for users to “indicate to us that they just want to skip browsing entirely, click one button and we’ll pick a title for them just to instantly play.” During its tests of the feature, Netflix has experimented with including a “Shuffle Play” button on its profile select screen, and a “Play Something” option in its menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C2tjdD"&gt;Here’s how that ended up looking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ANo8F0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Interesting new feature &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/netflix?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@netflix&lt;/a&gt; ... but what kind of insane person just says, “yolo, let’s spin the Netflix wheel of fortune” &lt;a href="https://t.co/6WDJrmd7pG"&gt;pic.twitter.com/6WDJrmd7pG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Turner Levison (@TurnerLevison) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TurnerLevison/status/1295543859141844992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 18, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6AkRkA3paWUs7Mw10TC_6ohBNLI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21768377/netflix_play_something.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo by Julia Alexander / The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7KNXZC"&gt;The big question now is what Netflix will end up calling the feature. During its earnings presentation, co-CEO Reed Hastings joked that they might call it “I’m Feeling Lucky,” after the Google search feature that skips straight to the top search result. But Peters quickly shot down that idea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Br2Asw"&gt;“We’re going to come up with something better than that, so stand by for this. You’ll see it when it rolls out,” Peters said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d7Ys1r"&gt;Whatever it ends up being called, Shuffle Play will join Netflix’s other recent attempt to make it easier to find content to watch. Last year, it added a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21502772/netflix-new-popular-row-tab-tv-update"&gt;“New &amp;amp; Popular” tab&lt;/a&gt; to the service, which features a combination of new, popular, and upcoming content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tVU5fC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izY9ie"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft killed the Zune, but Zune-heads are still here</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jC21QaP8dI2BBqZyndcVYfrG-bU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68694078/acastro_210111_4367_zuners_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Microsoft may have killed off its flagship MP3 player nearly a decade ago, but these fans are keeping their enthusiasm alive&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="WkiZ7a"&gt;It was weird to own a Zune in 2005. It is even weirder to own a Zune in 2021 — let alone 16 of them. And yet, 27-year-old Conner Woods proudly shows off his lineup on a kitchen table. They come in all different colors, shapes, and sizes, and each can be identified by that telltale black plastic D-pad just below the screen. He owns the entire scope of the brief Zune lineup — from the svelte Zune 4 to the chunky Zune HD — and among the microscopic community of people who still adore Microsoft’s much-derided MP3 player, no collection of dead tech could possibly be more enviable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ywMJsC"&gt;Woods picked up his Zune foraging habit during the pandemic, while he was furloughed from his job working security at Best Buy. “I taught myself to solder, began buying up dead Zunes, and repairing and flipping them for a profit,” he says. “At some point I ran across some rare ones and couldn’t bring myself to part with them.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s0QZ5h"&gt;He counts a particularly rare model bearing the &lt;em&gt;Halo 3&lt;/em&gt; logo and another with the &lt;em&gt;Gears of War&lt;/em&gt; seal, but to fully understand the depths of Woods’ obsession, you need to look past the gadgets and into the great beyond. Click through his post on the r/Zune subreddit, and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Zune/comments/imrh1m/briefly_posted_my_collection_last_week_but_heres/"&gt;wander into his veritable shrine of forgotten Zune detritus&lt;/a&gt;. Woods owns multiple Zune-stamped traveling cases and boombox docks. He has a Zune-branded stress ball as well as a Zune tinderbox, complete with matches that are dyed in the brand’s customary burnt orange and fiery purple. My personal favorite: a Rubik’s cube that, when solved, reveals the Zune’s polyhedral insignia on all of the white squares, as if to say the answer to one of history’s most vexing logic puzzles is, eternally, Zune. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="CCavs9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s safe to say that a lot of people are here for nostalgia.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wgwcZm"&gt;Microsoft spent most of the 2000s a few steps behind Apple. The rival company was perennially a little bit cooler, sleeker, and more tasteful than the endemic squareness of the Gates estate. Often, the Zune was considered the ultimate example of that failure. The product was entirely functional, sure, but for reasons that remain difficult to articulate — the video game insignias, the oversized trackpad, their baffling bulkiness — it was also about a million times less chic than the iPod. (That same inscrutable problem flags Bing, Cortana, the ill-fated Windows Phone, etc.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USnNzx"&gt;But today, almost a decade after Microsoft terminated the brand, there is a small bastion of diehards who are still loving and listening to their Zunes. If you talk to them, they’ll tell you that these MP3 players are the best pieces of hardware to ever run a Windows operating system. Preserving the Zune legacy has just become another part of the hobby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Various Zunes from Conner Woods’s collection" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MH0r9JnpRrhE3-PsG6sM5oC6Sak=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22244948/Zune_Collection__1_.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Various Zunes from Conner Woods’s collection" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lu0dNj6G41afhV0G5rreZssoceg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22244949/Zune_Collection__4_.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Various Zunes from Conner Woods’ collection.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CWARLo"&gt;r/Zune has about 4,500 subscribers, and it stands as the only salon left on the internet for those who are pumping life into Microsoft’s most memorable underdog. In the golden days, says Woods, the nation had many other lively forums like “ZuneBoards” and “Zunited.” There has been absolutely no news for Zune-heads since 2011 when Microsoft firmly announced that it was moving on from the MP3 sector indefinitely. And so, most of the posts on the subreddit radiate with a strong wistful ennui in lieu of any firmware updates on the horizon. “My current collection,” writes one poster, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Zune/comments/im5cq1/my_current_collection/"&gt;laying out their four Zunes on a chessboard&lt;/a&gt;, Electric Light Orchestra’s “Mr. Blue Sky” cued up on the one in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RtApyl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Zune/comments/izdt16/120_gb_ssd_modded_my_dads_zune_120_that_he_used/"&gt;Others administer modifications&lt;/a&gt; on their Zunes that push the hardware well past what it was capable of in 2006; like retrofitting an imaginary future where the Zune was not only still around but &lt;em&gt;dominant&lt;/em&gt;. “Started this project in late May, and it’s finally finished,” says Woods, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Zune/comments/htrlp0/started_this_project_in_late_may_and_its_finally/"&gt;in a different post&lt;/a&gt;, announcing that he had successfully added a 128GB SSD to a humble Zune motherboard. Someone else flaunts the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Zune/comments/jltsm9/wireless_charging_on_zune_30/"&gt;wireless charging adapter they added to an ancient Zune 30&lt;/a&gt;. Spend enough time on r/Zune, and you’ll begin to believe that anything is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4GNdN3"&gt;But most often, the denizens here simply want to express to their worldwide comrades that they also haven’t given up on Zune. “It’s safe to say that a lot of people are here for nostalgia,” says John, a 26-year old from San Diego who told me he was first seduced by the Zune in middle school. It’s strange to consider that an abandoned boutique suite of audio hardware is capable of making young men emotional, but then again, I suppose we are only just now discovering how the personal technology boom has impacted our psyche. “Picked up this beauty for $25. I’m pumped!” writes one poster, attached &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Zune/comments/f3lij2/picked_up_this_beauty_for_25_im_pumped/"&gt;to a photo of a prehistoric Zune&lt;/a&gt; sitting calmly next to a whirring Xbox One S. “Just a little Zune porn,” adds another, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Zune/comments/ffb77b/just_a_little_zune_porn_trying_to_not_let_the/"&gt;who’s using the hardware’s built-in radio signal to tune into KPBS&lt;/a&gt;. “Trying to not let the flame die out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="SbfdDu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Zunes were ahead of their time.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BHTC2T"&gt;One frequent contributor to the forum, 27-year-old Erick Leach, reminds me that, in its heyday, the Zune came equipped with a fairly robust social media appendage: Zune owners could send songs to each other wirelessly and unlock Xbox Live-like achievements for the music they listened to — both novel features in the mid-2000s. The brand never managed to muster the cultural ubiquity of the iPod (Apple attempted its own failed social network, Ping, around the same time), but with that emphasis on community, perhaps it was inevitable for the Zune to eventually mount a cult-like fandom. That’s Leach’s theory, at least. He always felt like there was a massive nation of Zune-heads out there who he would surely meet someday. “That never ended up happening as the Zune died out. But it was wonderful to find the subreddit and see the same passion for the Zune,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CDSkCk"&gt;Leach believes the Zune has aged better than people might think. He calls it the best-sounding music player he’s ever used, and he remains in awe of how it decoded a variety of different sound formats. “Artist tabs in the device itself included artist information, photos, recommendations, a robust music store, and free music for Zune Social users,” continues Leach. “It was a device for music lovers who just love music. Simply and effectively.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2o7zaB"&gt;That’s one of the wrinkles you tend to learn after spending time with the Zune Crew, most of them are lifelong audiophiles — the sort of people who get religious about terms like “lossless” and “FLAC.” What’s more, Woods makes the case that the Zune predicted the entire modern music industry as we know it. The Zune Marketplace offered a genuine streaming subscription — long before that became the dominant way people consumed music — which never caught on. “People liked owning their music back then. A paywall for music access seemed odd to people,” he says. “Zunes were ahead of their time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Hdjzvd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I feel less alone now than I ever did as a Zune user.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sEdK0K"&gt;That, of course, is the connective tissue of r/Zune. As much as its citizenship adores its cherished failed hardware, they congregate on these forums mostly to connect with others who’ve fallen, hopelessly and indefinitely, under the Zune’s baffling enchantment. Woods tells me that solidarity among Zuners has never been stronger. He finds even more thrills in this strange afterlife, as the years have eroded away everyone except for the zealots. “I feel less alone now than I ever did as a Zune user,” finishes Woods. “I feel more involved now than I ever did in the past, and I feel that I have a lot more to contribute now as a ‘seasoned veteran.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="DLwFFn"&gt;He can scour the earth in search of every last scrap of Zune memorabilia with the confidence that there will be an audience willing to upvote his efforts indefinitely. He can strap an absurdly huge SSD on the motherboard, ensuring that it will never be replaced. He can post a Zune-stamped coaster, rescued from the deep recesses of the Microsoft trash pile, and trust that his friends will treat the discovery like the Holy Grail. The Zune was mocked, lampooned, and chased out of the market with its tail between its legs. But it never truly died, not with fans like these.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus ExpertBook B9450 review: lightweight, long-lasting work laptop</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;An ultrathin notebook with fantastic battery life&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="jDIw4N"&gt;There are two reasons to buy the ExpertBook B9450: the weight and the battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mV4b9Y"&gt;Pick up the Asus ExpertBook B9450, and you’ll wonder where the rest of it is. Asus is touting it as the world’s lightest 14-inch commercial laptop, and it is light. Carrying it around, I felt like I was carrying nothing. My test unit is 2.19 pounds, but models go as low as 1.91 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oEBp0H"&gt;Inside the 0.6-inch chassis, though, Asus has still managed to include some decent specs. Models start at &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202002AM070000002"&gt;$1,699&lt;/a&gt;, and the base includes 16GB of RAM, 512GB of storage, and a Core i7-10510U with Intel’s UHD Graphics 620. The model I’m using, which costs &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Business-Laptop-i7-10510U-Processor-Hrs-Battery-B9450FA-XS79/dp/B0854GGW1G/ref=as_li_ss_tl?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=66d6eb0f691179e8fcddc9af99c3da50&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,799&lt;/a&gt;, has the same processor but bumps the storage up to two 1TB drives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ExpertBook B9450 keyboard seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lJiAHJY5lGmvKJtlGdW8TWbdOFU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22236056/mchin_190410_4371_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asus says the keyboard has a lifespan of up to 10,000,000 keystrokes, per its durability testing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XDffhl"&gt;But the ExpertBook’s battery life is just as (if not more) impressive than its weight. In my testing, it lasted an average of 10 hours and 47 minutes — and that was while multitasking with a decent load of Chrome tabs and apps at 200 nits of brightness. That means the ExpertBook isn’t the longest-lasting business laptop I’ve ever tested (the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21519885/dell-latitude-9510-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;$3,000 Dell Latitude&lt;/a&gt; still holds that crown), but it’s certainly in the hall of fame. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="M13nBj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10292229"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3vAS1I"&gt;That’s my quick take on the ExpertBook. Those are the two standout features (in addition to the storage capacity). Together, they make it a great option for business users who need a portable device with quite a bit of storage, but potential buyers should be aware that the processor is mostly suitable for basic office tasks. More on that in a bit.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The left side of the Asus ExpertBook B9450." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yg3gFopYQFbJA_5MN1013zvdHvk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22236057/mchin_190410_4371_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s too bad all USB-C ports are on the same side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9T3c8o"&gt;A problem with laptops this thin and light is that they sometimes feel flimsy. The ExpertBook is surprisingly sturdy, though; it’s made with multiple layers of a magnesium-lithium alloy material that Asus says is 17 percent less dense than “conventional” magnesium-aluminum alloy. The company also says the B9450 has passed MIL-STD 810G military-grade standards, which tests various factors like port durability, spill resistance, and shock resistance. I’d believe it. While I did feel a bit of flex in the keyboard deck and screen, it was nothing compared to what I’ve seen from other ultrathin units like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/28/21153098/vaio-sx12-review-display-design-price-specs-features"&gt;Vaio SX12&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2nZRe0"&gt;Durability aside, the ExpertBook feels very high quality. There are metallic flecks in the finish, which give the whole thing a bit of a celestial look in certain light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oAQOl9"&gt;One note with the design: like a number of Asus laptops, the ExpertBook has an ErgoLift hinge, which means the display folds under the keyboard deck when you open the laptop and lifts it a bit off the ground. This has a number of benefits — it’s supposed to increase cooling and make typing more comfortable — but it also means that if you’re using the ExpertBook on your lap, you’ll have a sharp hinge digging into your legs. I know not everyone spends as much time on the couch as I do, so your mileage may vary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ExpertBook B9450 open, angled slightly to the right. The screen displays the Asus ExpertBook logo on a blue and white background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WH6P6GpvPVUBFNiBt2WcPNwRJ4A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22236059/mchin_190410_4371_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When the laptop is unfolded to a 145-degree angle, the bottom rises by 5 degrees.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pucLnz"&gt;The final impressive thing is the useful port selection: you’ve got two Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports, one USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A port, one HDMI 2.0 port, one Micro HDMI to LAN port, and one 3.5mm combo audio jack. Plenty of manufacturers have had trouble fitting even USB-A onto ultrathin machines, so I’m impressed to see a full-sized HDMI here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The left side of the Asus ExpertBook B9450." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZrOarEKYDVN8reuAtiPv2O0jBwE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22236058/mchin_190410_4371_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HDMI 2.0 port supports 4K video output.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="01XmHG"&gt;Other fun stuff: there’s a fingerprint scanner below the arrow keys, the Windows Hello webcam has both a physical shutter and a kill switch, and the touchpad has Asus’ NumberPad 2.0 feature, which allows you to pull up an LED numpad with the touch of a sensor. And there are a number of business-specific features, including a TPM 2.0 chip and a preloaded suite called Asus Business Manager where you can encrypt your local drives, toggle system registry editing, and customize various other stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k58Swh"&gt;All this sounds great, so what’s the catch? There’s really only one, but it’s one that will matter to plenty of people. It’s the processor. The Core i7-10510U is a four-core processor that’s significantly lower-powered than the chips you’ll see in the best laptops on the market like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 13&lt;/a&gt;. It’s far from a workhorse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div id="z3D8iN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10292266"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="j1N6KR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If you think you’ll need to do strenuous work on this, you’ll want to look elsewhere&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yLrciZ"&gt;Now, the ExpertBook is just fine for basic office work — emails, Google Docs, Slack, Zoom calls, that sort of thing. I never heard the fans spin up during my regular Chrome multitasking, nor did I experience any performance issues. If this is what you do all day, great — the ExpertBook is for you. But if you think you’ll ever need to do strenuous work on this, especially tasks that leverage the integrated graphics, you’ll want to look elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fqVMHG"&gt;I tried to run our traditional video export test in Adobe Premiere Pro to illustrate the performance difference between this model and other ultraportables you can buy, but the program crashed during each trial. I let Asus know about this, and it’s looking into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ExpertBook B9450 facing away from the canera, angled to the left." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GD718JnrlZ6A70xQegsQPYIIneI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22236062/mchin_190410_4371_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The lid and base panel are made of magnesium-lithium alloy, which Asus says is 17 percent less dense than “conventional” magnesium-aluminum alloy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VBD23A"&gt;So I ended up running some light games instead. The ExpertBook ran &lt;em&gt;Rocket League &lt;/em&gt;on maximum settings at 40fps (where the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;11th Gen XPS 13&lt;/a&gt; with a Core i7 i7-1165G7 put up 111fps, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21221003/dell-xps-13-2020-review-core-i7-specs-features-price"&gt;10th Gen XPS 13&lt;/a&gt; with a Core i7-1065G7 put up 70fps). On &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, it averaged 85fps (to the 11th Gen XPS’s 205fps and the 10th Gen’s 160fps). It averaged 31fps on &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;’s Ultra settings and 10fps on the lowest &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; (which I ran mostly out of curiosity). Those frame rates are considerably below what you can expect from both XPS models, as well as plenty of much more affordable 14-inchers like Asus’ own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21494523/asus-zenbook-14-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-features-price"&gt;ZenBook 14&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="NhQFyu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10292267"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hsSMfg"&gt;To reiterate: The ExpertBook isn’t anything close to a gaming laptop. This is just to illustrate the processing power you’re sacrificing for the additional portability, battery life, and storage that the ExpertBook offers (and of course, to note that if you think you’ll ever want to play even casual games, think about getting something else).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dvr05W"&gt;One thing I want to commend Asus for, though: The ExpertBook’s cooling is great. During several Premiere export attempts and a long gaming session, the CPU’s temperature stayed very consistently in the high 60s and rarely jumped above 70 degrees Celsius. That’s impressive, especially for such a thin device. (The XPS 13 spends a lot of time in the high 90s.) On the other hand, the fans made so much noise that they were audible from multiple rooms over — people around me would have been alarmed if I tried these tests in an office. That’s another reason to steer clear of this if you’ll need to do gaming or media work from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="09Nxan"&gt;The audience for the ExpertBook B9450 is somewhat specific. But that doesn’t mean it’s small. If you’re someone who doesn’t care much about processing power, but does care about portability, battery life, and storage, this laptop is worth the $1,799. Not only is it among the lightest you can buy at this size, but it’s one of few products in its weight class to feature dual storage slots. It’ll be difficult to find all three of those features in many other 14-inch laptops at this price point. Add nice build quality and the nifty numpad feature, and I imagine this is a laptop many at-home and on-the-go workers will be happy to have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7OLDg8"&gt;Just make sure you know what you’re getting — because the low-powered processor and deafening fans certainly aren’t ideal for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia’s Shield TV now supports PS5 and Xbox Series X controllers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WhoE8T74nPt_JS3T9MtgXeQQgMc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68694001/acastro_210113_1777_gamingstock_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AVgPMp"&gt;Nvidia is updating its Shield Android TV software to include support for the latest next-gen console controllers. If you own a Shield TV or Shield TV Pro device, you can now pair the PS5 DualSense or Xbox Series X controllers to play Android games or PC titles through Nvidia’s GeForce Now streaming service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4hUjyl"&gt;To pair a PS5 DualSense controller, you can head into the Bluetooth section of the Shield TV, and then hold down the PlayStation button until the light pulses blue. For Xbox Series X / S controllers, you can hold the pairing button until the Xbox button starts blinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7R0ZK2"&gt;Alongside the controller support, Nvidia is also adding Control4 home automation system support in &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fshield%2Fsoftware-update%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F20%2F22240383%2Fnvidia-shield-tv-ps5-dualsense-xbox-series-x-controller-support-update#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this Shield TV 8.2.2 update&lt;/a&gt;. This allows the Control4 remote or app to navigate around the Shield TV UI to launch apps. This Shield TV update also brings the devices up to Android’s December 2020 security patch level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WxNrmh"&gt;Nvidia has consistently updated its Shield TV software for years, improving its AI-powered 4K upscaling features &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21402819/nvidia-shield-tv-update-4k-upscaling-remote-customize"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt; along with improvements to remote control customizations. Nvidia also added IR and CEC volume controls last year to its latest devices. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to stream the inauguration of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Biden-Harris Themed Merchandise On Sale Ahead Of Inauguration" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2HW3jXh3KACoiCxSW8f3SOTnBts=/0x1:4000x2668/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68693838/1230589253.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GtC8jn"&gt;President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris are set to make history today when they will be sworn into office as president and vice president. Because of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and heightened security following this month’s deadly attack on the Capitol, Inauguration Day will be unlike any other before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N00qxb"&gt;Here’s how to watch and participate in the historic day’s events from home:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WBwyMg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When is the presidential inauguration?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PRkbao"&gt;The inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will begin on Wednesday, January 20th, in Washington, DC. Soon after Biden takes his oath of office, he will deliver an inaugural address outlining his vision for the next four years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DR6uV3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What time does the inauguration start?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eu3URr"&gt;The inauguration will officially begin at 12PM ET. But other events, like the national anthem, will start before the official event at 11:30AM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gPwmt5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where can you watch the inauguration?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dozqET"&gt;The Biden Presidential Inaugural Committee will host a free stream of the inauguration at &lt;a href="http://bideninaugural.org"&gt;bideninaugural.org&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/bideninaugural"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wt5Xig"&gt;&lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/live"&gt;ABC News&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/"&gt;CBS News&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://foxnews.com/"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="http://msnbc.com"&gt;MSNBC&lt;/a&gt; News, &lt;a href="http://cnn.com"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://pbs.org"&gt;PBS&lt;/a&gt; will all host live streams of the event on their websites as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="iZjlMS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is performing at the inauguration?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="iGtsiX"&gt;Lady Gaga is set to perform the national anthem, and Jennifer Lopez will provide a musical performance as well. For people watching from home, the inaugural committee has planned for a “virtual parade” that will feature additional musical guests and other performances “paying homage to America’s heroes on the front lines of the pandemic” as the new president makes his way to the White House.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gwGpZc"&gt;At 8:30PM ET Wednesday, the inauguration will be followed by &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/arts/music/biden-inauguration-performers.html"&gt;a primetime television event&lt;/a&gt; hosted by Tom Hanks. Other celebrities like Justin Timberlake, Demi Lovato, and Jon Bon Jovi will perform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hYuV5j"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who will attend the inauguration?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpXBS4"&gt;George W. Bush, Laura Bush, Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Bill Clinton will all be in attendance, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/inauguration-day.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. President Donald Trump will not be attending the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pgwKPH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vscC4l"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Valve and five game publishers fined millions for geo-blocking Steam games in EU</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TqUsHnAk32gPbM7hCGGPxnuGPyg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68693777/acastro_180509_1777_steam_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="x9WwKp"&gt;Valve and five PC video game publishers have been fined a total of €7.8 million (around $9.5 million) &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_21_170"&gt;by the European Commission&lt;/a&gt; for restricting cross-border game sales in the European Economic Area. The Commission said that the companies geo-blocked around 100 PC video games, preventing them from being activated and played outside certain EU countries. This broke the EU’s Digital Single Market rules which prohibit those types of barriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wJIq40"&gt;The European Commission says the geo-blocking was to prevent games being activated outside Czechia, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Geo-blocking prevents gamers living in EU countries with higher average incomes from being able to save money buying them in EU states where they’re cheaper and then activating them on Steam. Activation keys were geo-blocked between 2010 and 2015, the European Commission said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TFQa6N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Under EU competition law, companies are prohibited from contractually restricting cross-border sales”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P7l35j"&gt;“Today’s sanctions against the ‘geo-blocking’ practices of Valve and five PC video game publishers serve as a reminder that under EU competition law, companies are prohibited from contractually restricting cross-border sales,” the European Commission’s head of competition policy said. “Such practices deprive European consumers of the benefits of the EU Digital Single Market and of the opportunity to shop around for the most suitable offer in the EU.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wG9oQL"&gt;Five publishers were fined in total. Focus Home was fined almost €2.9 million (around $ 3.5 million), ZeniMax over €1.6 million (around $2 million), Koch Media almost €1 million (around $1.2 million), Capcom €396,000 (around $480,000), and Bandai Namco €340,000 (around $410,000). Because each of these companies cooperated with the investigation, their fines were reduced by between 10 and 15 percent. Valve, however, chose not to cooperate, and was fined over €1.6 million (around $1.9 million).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VWM1gz"&gt;The European Commission opened its formal investigation into the practice of geo-blocking back in 2017, and formally asked Valve to stop the practice &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/5/18296527/european-commission-valve-antitrust-objections-games-price"&gt;back in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Valve has previously argued that only a small number of games used region-locked activation keys, and argued it shouldn’t be liable for region locks requested by publishers. It said it ended the practice in 2015, with limited exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s new Chrome 88 update improves dark mode, removes FTP and Adobe Flash</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qUXTXZ"&gt;Google is releasing a new version of Chrome this week that will improve its dark mode support, alongside removing FTP and Adobe Flash support. The dark mode improvements can be found on both Windows and Chrome OS. There are refinements to both the light and dark modes in Chrome OS, with the themes updated for the app launcher, quick settings, and shelf parts of Chrome OS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhN4ML"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/709576/whats-new-in-chrome-88-available-today/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;How To Geek &lt;/em&gt;also reports&lt;/a&gt; that the Windows 10 dark mode is improved with Chrome 88, with scroll bars finally appearing dark. Unfortunately, these are currently limited to the settings, bookmarks, history, and new tab pages of Chrome 88 and not across all websites with dark themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JUT3HW"&gt;Elsewhere, Google is also removing some old web technology in Chrome 88. The File Transport Protocol (FTP) is officially disabled with this latest version, removing support for a protocol that has been used for decades to send files across the web.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jucvsj_JiAao9HxESoCGChkbkM4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22247087/P7oLa5S.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chrome’s new tab search feature.&lt;span class="ql-cursor"&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7dIT7E"&gt;Adobe Flash is also being fully removed from Chrome 88, after being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/15/11679394/chrome-to-block-flash-later-2016"&gt;initially blocked&lt;/a&gt; and then disabled in recent years. The removal of Flash from Chrome marks the end of an era, following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/31/22208190/adobe-flash-is-dead"&gt;Adobe’s discontinued support on December 31st&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vsdpUi"&gt;Google is also experimenting with some new features for Chrome. Both tab search and less intrusive website permission requests can be found hidden away in Chrome 88. You’ll need to enable the new tab search using &lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;chrome://flags/#enable-tab-search&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;, and it will appear as a new drop down arrow in the Chrome tab UI. Smaller permission prompts can also be enabled from &lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;chrome://flags/#permission-chip&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is investigating another top AI ethicist</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0yjBmbhDOf2wv7QYCf18yMSXH1s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68693538/acastro_180427_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LrMBeF"&gt;Google is investigating artificial intelligence researcher Margaret Mitchell, who co-leads the company’s Ethical AI team, and has locked her corporate account, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/scoop-google-is-investigating-the-actions-of-another-top-ai-ethicist-50030739-ea3d-4ea2-b452-c228b4fc9773.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Axios &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The news comes a little over a month after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150355/google-fires-timnit-gebru-facial-recognition-ai-ethicist"&gt;another prominent AI ethicist&lt;/a&gt;, Timnit Gebru, said she was fired by the company. Mitchell’s account has now reportedly been locked for “at least a few days” but she hasn’t been fired, according to a tweet from Gebru. Mitchell did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1dHkiQ"&gt;In a statement given to &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;, Google said it was investigating Mitchell after its systems detected an account had “exfiltrated thousands of files and shared them with multiple 	external accounts.” According to an &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; source, Mitchell had been using a script to go through her messages, finding examples of discriminatory treatment of Gebru. Last week, Mitchell tweeted to say she was documenting &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mmitchell_ai/status/1349994887031054337"&gt;“current critical issues from [Gebru’s] firing, point by point, inside and outside work.&lt;/a&gt;” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="twSFEs"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Just after midnight. Hit 10 pages documenting current critical issues from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timnitGebru?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@timnitGebru&lt;/a&gt; 's firing, point by point , inside and outside work. For Jeff Dean and whoever might actually read it (no one?). Wistfully remembering when I used to do research.&lt;/p&gt;— MMitchell (@mmitchell_ai) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mmitchell_ai/status/1349994887031054337?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZcPnxd"&gt;Google said its security systems automatically lock corporate employee accounts “when they detect that the account is at risk of compromise due to credential problems or when an automated rule involving the handling of sensitive data has been triggered.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jS4TqL"&gt;“We explained this to the employee earlier today,” Google said, “We are actively investigating this matter as part of standard procedures to gather additional details.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="r4mzT0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;She's not fired **yet**. But apparently they've told her she will be locked out for at least a few days. &lt;a href="https://t.co/H1ibkgNQHM"&gt;https://t.co/H1ibkgNQHM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Timnit Gebru (@timnitGebru) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timnitGebru/status/1351713824295038980?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HWtWHb"&gt;Mitchell has previously tweeted in support of Gebru, and has been critical of Google and other big tech companies for their approaches to diversity and systematic bias. Yesterday she &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mmitchell_ai/status/1351619240982319107"&gt;tweeted to criticize&lt;/a&gt; Google CEO Sundar Pichai’s approach towards workplace diversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Et4cn"&gt;Google faced widespread criticism after Gebru left the company. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-20/google-sidelines-second-artificial-intelligence-researcher"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that thousands of internal employees and external academics and campaigners signing a petition in support of the AI researcher. The company has faced ongoing criticism for its work on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/6/17086276/google-ai-military-drone-analysis-pentagon-project-maven-tensorfow"&gt;Project Maven&lt;/a&gt;, an AI project designed to improve military drone strikes. Opposition to the project was named as a key reason when Google employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212347/google-employees-contractors-announce-union-cwa-alphabet"&gt;announced plans to unionize&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG considers exiting smartphones in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6rYe3nGzf14NboHm3NHAY_lXxSc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68693536/cgartenberg_201022_4254_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7oHyWw"&gt;LG is considering exiting the smartphone market in 2021. After losing around $4.5 billion over the past five years, LG’s smartphone business has been struggling to compete with rivals. Now LG CEO Kwon Bong-seok has notified employees that the company is considering making big changes to its smartphone business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OAxPp8"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20210120000992"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Korea Herald &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Kwon Bong-seok sent out an internal memo to staff on Wednesday, hinting at a change in direction for LG’s phone business. “Since the competition in the global market for mobile devices is getting fiercer, it is about time for LG to make a cold judgment and the best choice,” says an LG official in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Korea Herald&lt;/em&gt;. “The company is considering all possible measures, including sale, withdrawal and downsizing of the smartphone business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="spmpoo"&gt;LG confirmed the internal memo was genuine in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, noting that nothing has been decided yet. “LG Electronics management is committed to making whatever decision is necessary to resolve its mobile business challenges in 2021,” says an LG spokesperson. “As of today, nothing has been finalized.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="LG’s Rollable phone." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rBRVGC5zKuEfIfeolgy1-9csSGM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22227268/lgrollable.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG’s Rollable phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oW7JbP"&gt;This new internal memo follows a now-deleted report from Korean outlet &lt;em&gt;TheElec &lt;/em&gt;earlier this month that claimed LG was planning to exit the smartphone business. LG branded that report “completely false and without merit,” &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/01/15/no-lg-isnt-exiting-the-smartphone-business/"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Android Police &lt;/em&gt;just a week ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="obyGsF"&gt;LG has previously promised “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/9/21058238/lg-smartphone-profitable-2021-apple-samsung-ces-mwc"&gt;wow factors&lt;/a&gt;” to try and attract consumers and make its flagging mobile division profitable. LG has tried multiple times with the G7, the V40, the G8, and the V50 to compete with Samsung and Huawei, but it’s not been enough to push its market share in the right direction. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21304097/lg-velvet-phone-review-price-us-specs-camera"&gt;LG’s latest Velvet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536659/lg-wing-review-dual-screen-price-specs-features"&gt;Wing smartphones&lt;/a&gt; have attempted to try something new, but neither were well received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T40dIU"&gt;Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi, Vivo, and Apple all continue to dominate worldwide smartphone shipments, &lt;a href="https://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share/vendor"&gt;according to IDC&lt;/a&gt;. LG is now turning its focus to its Rollable phone, in an effort to differentiate it from the competition. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224591/lg-rollable-phone-extending-display-teaser-ces-2021"&gt;LG teased the Rollable device&lt;/a&gt; again at the Consumer Electronics Show last week, with a “unique resizable screen” that extends from a phone to become a small tablet display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FHrOmD"&gt;LG has promised its Rollable device is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226532/lgs-rollable-phone-launch-release-date-ces-2021"&gt;real and will launch in 2021&lt;/a&gt;, but with the company reconsidering its mobile plans it could be one of the last LG phones we’ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
