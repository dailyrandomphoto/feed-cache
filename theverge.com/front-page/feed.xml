    <title>The Surface Duo gets better TikTok support and availability outside the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="igSwLe"&gt;Microsoft announced &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/devices/2020/12/15/the-year-ahead-for-surface-duo/"&gt;in a blog today&lt;/a&gt; that its dual screen phone, the Surface Duo, will be getting an “enhanced” TikTok app that takes advantage of its design. The company also announced the Duo will be available outside the US in early 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O169FZ"&gt;When &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21428763/microsoft-surface-duo-review"&gt;reviewed the Surface Duo&lt;/a&gt;, we liked the hardware of the device, but had concerns with its modified Android software. The Duo was buggy at release and didn’t feature many non-Microsoft apps that took advantage of the dual screen setup. The Surface Duo can run normal Android phone apps on either screen, but using the split-screen features Microsoft designed requires specific tailoring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="koHI8P"&gt;The group of apps that use Microsoft’s “postures” and multitasking features remains small, but TikTok is a major social media addition.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e8DhKXvfdOYJVSv6qqJse-0t8NA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22172811/TikTok_SurfaceDuo.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new TikTok experience on the Surface Duo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rbiNaO"&gt;The company says that TikTok will use both of the Duo’s screens, allowing you to watch the “For You” feed on one screen, while browsing hashtags and searching for videos on the other. Microsoft highlighted the Spotify and Kindle apps when the Duo launched, but TikTok is one of the biggest apps to add full support since then. (Microsoft itself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/13/21360130/microsoft-tiktok-acquisition-bid-rejection-bytedance"&gt;attempted to purchase the company from ByteDance&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ALJOne"&gt;In addition to the new app, Microsoft says the Surface Duo will be available for purchase in Canada, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom in early 2021. The company says they’ll have more to share “at the beginning of 2021,” so expect a more specific release date or maybe even an update on the Duo’s larger sibling, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/2/20889000/microsoft-surface-neo-windows-10x-hands-on-features-price-photos-release-date"&gt;the Surface Neo&lt;/a&gt;, in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SgDrwC"&gt;The “enhanced” TikTok app should be available now for Duo owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQeo1k"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oculus is shipping the Quest 2 Elite Strap again and extending its warranty after quality issues</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Oculus Quest 2 with Elite Strap" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xGWbFLwWGPDaqb5Isk-A41AGzmI=/320x0:3776x2304/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68518263/Quest_2_with_Elite_Strap_accessory.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Oculus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="v0SexV"&gt;Oculus is resuming shipments of its Quest 2 Elite Strap accessory and extending the warranty after reports of defective straps. &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/oculus-pauses-quest-2-elite-strap-quality-reports/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;UploadVR&lt;/em&gt; reported earlier&lt;/a&gt;, the Facebook-owned virtual reality company paused Elite Strap shipments in November, saying a small number of users had reported them snapping after use. Now, &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oculus-quest-2-elite-strap-sales-resume-after-initial-quality-control-issues?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+androidcentral+%28Android+Central%29"&gt;it tells &lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it’s pinpointed the issue as a “processing inconsistency with some early units,” and the product is going back on sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WcpNmk"&gt;Oculus maintains that the Elite Strap problems affect a “very small percentage” of customers. But it’s increasing the standard one-year warranty to a two-year period, during which Oculus will replace broken straps free of charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F4CZWe"&gt;The $49 Elite Strap (and a $129 version with an external battery and carrying case) replaces the standard cloth strap of the Oculus Quest 2 VR headset. It’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21432628/oculus-quest-2-accessories-headstrap-usbc-fit-pack-price"&gt;a major upgrade&lt;/a&gt; that makes the $299 Quest 2 far more comfortable, and although it’s still not available for purchase through the Oculus store or Amazon, it’s apparently a viable option once again.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Siri can now play animal sounds and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_IPFpP_OAf3SYAARwGpaSOoYYFY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68518259/acastro_180510_1777_siri_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nH9583"&gt;With &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22163752/ios-14-3-proraw-airpods-max-fitness-plus-available-now-download"&gt;yesterday’s release of iOS 14.3&lt;/a&gt;, Siri got a new trick: the ability to play real-world sound samples on command. Ask “Hey Siri, what does _____ sound like?” and it will start playing the sound for you. If you ask on an iPhone or iPad, it will show you a picture as well. Google Assistant has been able to do this for a few years now, but now it’s available for the iPhone, iPad, and HomePod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g02Lar"&gt;Apple hasn’t announced how many sounds it’s added, but it’s been able to handle most of the animals I asked about (except for some obscure ones that I’m not sure have a real distinctive noise, like an anteater). At the moment, it seems like the sounds are limited to animals, vehicles, and musical instruments. I tried asking for some nature-y sounds, such as thunder or a waterfall, and Siri didn’t play anything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1yPvTa"&gt;This feature is probably best heard, rather than read about, so I made a video in which I ask Siri to play different sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q1WYBe"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Siri Sounds|99868" data-volume-uuid="05c0ff26a" data-volume-id="99868" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-525" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I asked Siri what several things and animals sound like. (Warning: this may activate any iOS devices if they have “Hey Siri” turned on.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sm5Q31"&gt;Interestingly, it’s got samples for different breeds of dog, so you can hear what a mastiff sounds like compared to a Shih Tzu. There are obviously quite a few things that Siri doesn’t have sound samples for, and in some cases (like when I asked what humans sound like), it doesn’t even try. As you can tell from the end of the video, Siri is Siri — technical imperfections and all. (At one point, Siri started answering the question, stopped, said it was sorry, and restarted its answer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y1MlQw"&gt;I know I’m going to be asking Siri for random sounds every now and then, trying to figure out what it has sounds for and what it doesn’t. If you’re not as easily amused as I am, the feature could also be useful if you have kids, who I’ve heard are always asking what things sound like. It’s also useful for when someone in your household says that foxes sound like people screaming, and you just have to know if they’re right. (&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/zBpZTo1dlPM?t=24"&gt;Here’s a YouTube link&lt;/a&gt; so you can see as well as hear it.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Most doses of a COVID-19 treatment are going unused</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An IV medication drip." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DpET60dbR66PsTaaoxoX9Xvw1P8=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68518215/HH_IV_3.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QbQnMB"&gt;The majority of the doses of COVID-19 antibody drugs sent to states have not been used, Moncef Slaoui, head of Operation Warp Speed, the US government’s coronavirus vaccine effort, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CNBCnow/status/1338904444772225025"&gt;told CNBC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Around 65,000 doses of the drugs, which can help protect people at high risk of severe COVID-19 from developing serious cases of the disease, go out each week. Only 5 to 20 percent end up going to patients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ikfYJf"&gt;It’s disappointing, Slaoui told CNBC&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; because the drugs could help keep COVID-19 patients out of the hospital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XKTGGX"&gt;Doses are going unused because administering them is complicated. Ongoing surges in COVID-19 cases across the country mean states don’t have the resources to sort through those logistics. The Utah Department of Health &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575207/antibody-treatment-distribution-limited-dose-coronavirus-treatment"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in November that the state had to focus on keeping hospitals afloat, and couldn’t devote the time to organizing distribution of the antibody drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZIvmGn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is a giant failure that we need to remedy.&lt;br&gt;It is also a failure that many predicted. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have the tools now to end suffering from covid. We just need to find a way to get them to patients. &lt;a href="https://t.co/XZULmqpSam"&gt;https://t.co/XZULmqpSam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Walid Gellad, MD MPH (@walidgellad) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/walidgellad/status/1338906649466167297?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 15, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QPv0eB"&gt;Despite the thousands of unused doses, the antibody drugs, made by the pharmaceutical companies Regeneron and Eli Lilly, are in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575207/antibody-treatment-distribution-limited-dose-coronavirus-treatment"&gt;limited supply&lt;/a&gt;. Each state gets a set amount each week based on the number of COVID-19 cases it’s reporting each week. Then, the state has to decide how to divvy it up between hospitals. It’s not a readily available resource, so doctors aren’t relying on it as a standard treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KQ45hS"&gt;Another challenge is that the antibody drugs have to be given to patients soon after they contract COVID-19. Timing is everything. If patients aren’t getting tested or don’t get test results back within a short window after they fall ill, they can’t benefit from the drug. Even if they do get diagnosed with COVID-19 quickly at a testing site, they may not start to feel seriously ill or call a doctor until they’re outside that window. Without that contact, they might not know about or be offered the drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJAYtN"&gt;In addition, the drug has to be given intravenously — so patients who are in the early, most contagious stages of their disease have to go to a hospital or outpatient facility where they will interact with nurses and doctors. States and health care organizations have to set up safe places for patients to receive the treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="12u07f"&gt;Slaoui told CNBC that Operation Warp Speed may be able to help states work through those logistics. But for now, they’re still&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;a barrier stopping thousands from receiving treatment for COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook will resume political ads just for Georgia’s Senate runoff election</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wtg78bP9CC-Pfp2_WEBmsVcLBo8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68518179/mdoying_180118_2249_facebook_0581_1stills.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michele Doying / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DHcdwL"&gt;Facebook on Tuesday said it would make an exception to its political ad ban to let campaigns and other political organizations run advertising for the upcoming Georgia runoff elections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WXrTNX"&gt;The Senate races, which will determine which US political party controls that chamber of Congress under President-elect Joe Biden, take place on January 5th. Facebook says advertisers authorized to run ads on social issues, elections, or politics will be allowed to run those ads starting tomorrow, December 16th at 12PM ET. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FgZ1dY"&gt;Facebook initially faced pushback over the political ad ban and its implications for races as vital as the Georgia runoffs. Democratic campaign officials &lt;a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2020/11/10/social-media-ad-ban-hampers-georgia-senate-runoff-efforts/"&gt;criticized the platform&lt;/a&gt; for hampering its efforts to fight misinformation about the election and voting fraud, while Republicans expressed concern that a lack of advertising would leave them flat-footed in efforts to register voters and combat their own brand of online misinformation &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/06/georgia-republican-election-official-says-trumps-false-voter-fraud-claims-undermine-democracy.html"&gt;encouraging Republicans to abstain from voting in protest&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="liwYqd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We agree that our ad tools are an important way for people to get information about these elections.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iq8hj2"&gt;“In recent weeks we’ve heard feedback from experts and advertisers across the political spectrum about the importance of expressing voice and using our tools to reach voters ahead of Georgia’s runoff elections,” writes Facebook product manager Sarah Schiff, in a &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/12/update-on-the-georgia-runoff-elections/"&gt;blog post announcing the exemption&lt;/a&gt;. “We agree that our ad tools are an important way for people to get information about these elections. So we have developed a process to allow advertisers to run ads with the purpose of reaching voters in Georgia about Georgia’s runoff elections.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fCa7AE"&gt;Facebook’s ad ban, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21506798/facebook-ban-political-ads-after-us-presidential-election-trump-biden-results-notification"&gt;announced back in October&lt;/a&gt;, is only a temporary measure the social media giant implemented “to reduce opportunities for confusion or abuse.” It was a prescient approach, given how President Donald Trump has spent nearly every day since the election spreading false or misleading information about the results of the race. Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21560969/facebook-political-ad-ban-extended-trump-2020-election-concede-misinformation"&gt;said last month&lt;/a&gt; after Election Day it would extend the ban for about a month, in response to Trump’s refusal to concede and rampant online misinformation from the president, right-wing media, and other conservative sources about unsubstantiated election fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D3qHS1"&gt;It’s not clear how long Facebook intends to keep the ad ban in place, as it’s been more than a month since its last extension. But the company says it is taking measures so that its exemption for the runoff elections doesn’t result in any unintended consequences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cLAMZH"&gt;For instance, Facebook says it will outright reject any ads targeting locations outside Georgia, or that try to address other political issues outside the scope of the runoff races. It’s also keeping in place its ban on ads with any claims or other content that includes information debunked by its partner fact-checkers, or that “delegitimizes” the races. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sj89g1"&gt;Facebook also plans to label any content that “tries to delegitimize voting in these elections” with false claims about fraud and other conspiratorial misinformation. “And, if someone goes to share the content we have labeled, they will first see a message directing them to our Voting Information Center, which provides reliable election information,” says Schiff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U5siDc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is shutting down its Periscope apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YaJNggjL84ZSz6OmaLtqQbBxodE=/110x0:1291x787/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68517908/0_rNGSqodt790lkpl_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ANRjjQ"&gt;Twitter has &lt;a href="https://periscope.medium.com/farewell-periscope-164db2742b7c"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’ll be shutting down Periscope as a service, with the company set to discontinue the Periscope applications by March 2021. Twitter will, however, continue to offer live video streaming through its integrated Twitter Live feature within the main Twitter app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lLDD1o"&gt;“The Periscope app is in an unsustainable maintenance-mode state, and has been for a while,” the company explained in a blog post. “Over the past couple of years, we’ve seen declining usage and know that the cost to support the app will only continue to go up over time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sdkWY"&gt;While Periscope won’t be fully shut down until March, the company is already blocking any new account signups starting in the latest update to the apps, which is rolling out today. Users will have the chance to download an archive of both their Periscope videos and their data before the app is shuttered next year. Additionally, &lt;a href="https://www.periscope.tv/periscopeco"&gt;the Periscope website&lt;/a&gt; will remain active to serve as a “read-only archive of public broadcasts.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cI4nDm"&gt;Periscope will also be “relaxing our requirements” for users to apply to become “&lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/super-broadcaster"&gt;Super Broadcasters&lt;/a&gt;,” the company’s term for select users who are given the opportunity to cash out tips given to them by followers. Broadcasters will have until April 30th, 2021, to finish cashing out their tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CCGgtT"&gt;Twitter bought Periscope back in March 2015 before the service even launched, back in the heyday of live broadcasting (arguably started by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/9/8164893/meerkat-live-video-streaming-twitter-yevvo-periscope"&gt;Meerkat&lt;/a&gt;, a once-viral streaming service that has since pivoted over to developing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/28/13081014/meerkat-houseparty-video-app"&gt;Houseparty&lt;/a&gt;). Periscope would launch later that month, with all of the force of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/26/8293353/periscope-live-streaming-twitter-meerkat"&gt;Twitter’s considerable social presence&lt;/a&gt; behind it. But for all of Periscope’s popularity at the time, it wasn’t a staying force, in the same way that other live streaming services — like the juggernaut of Twitch — would become. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QK5t28"&gt;Twitter would go on to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/14/13942840/twitter-live-video-periscope-integration"&gt;integrate live video into the main Twitter app&lt;/a&gt; in December 2016, in a feature that was described as being “powered by Periscope.” According to Twitter, the company has since moved “most of the core capabilities of Periscope” into Twitter Live, with the shuttering of Periscope as a separate service allowing it to better focus on further building out that live streaming functionality in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The latest OBS update includes support for stripping out audio from VODs on Twitch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mjo6ddAIakzjiZkBOFa8SBDwlas=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68517861/acastro_200410_1777_OBS_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hmLqEQ"&gt;The new Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) update is out, and as per usual it includes a bunch of changes and fixes that will make your streaming life just a little bit better. The biggest change in this version of OBS is support for the feature that Twitch debuted in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21495243/twitch-soundtrack-streaming-music-soundcloud-distrokid-facebook-gaming"&gt;Twitch Soundtrack&lt;/a&gt; — the ability to play music in a second track while you’re streaming to Twitch, so that it can be stripped out of your recorded broadcast, or VOD (video on demand). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="i4i2KP"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This release adds a second audio track when streaming to Twitch which will be saved to the VOD instead of the stream audio. You can enable this feature in Output settings when streaming to Twitch. Special thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Twitch&lt;/a&gt; for assisting during the development of this feature!&lt;/p&gt;— OBS (@OBSProject) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OBSProject/status/1338651935356973057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 15, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8HxOQv"&gt;For the uninitiated: it’s normal to play music in the background of live streams, but issues around copyright mean that it can be dangerous. Twitch has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562372/twitch-soundtrack-riaa-music-youtube"&gt;engaged in an extended battle with the music industry&lt;/a&gt; because streamers habitually play copyrighted music on-stream that they don’t have the rights to; it came to a head earlier this year, when streamers were flooded with copyright takedown requests from the music industry. Those requests were based on copyrighted music found in clips from streams and full recorded broadcasts — which is what Twitch Soundtrack, and by extension this feature, are meant to solve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="csL5Bz"&gt;OBS pointed out that Twitch helped with the development of the feature, which is interesting because the company already has Soundtrack. I can only imagine it means that this is the latest front in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562372/twitch-soundtrack-riaa-music-youtube"&gt;Twitch’s fight with the music industry&lt;/a&gt; — because if streamers get used to stripping music from their VODs as a general practice, the problem of people broadcasting copyrighted music on Twitch might eventually solve itself. Though, personally, I believe that’s wishful thinking. Either way, OBS implementing the feature means that more streamers will use it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Walmart will have the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S available online at 3PM ET today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LCVCwa"&gt;If you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174265/ps5-xbox-series-x-s-restock-best-buy"&gt;missed the restock of the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, you have another chance at Walmart. The retailer announced that at 3PM ET on December 15th, it will have both next-gen consoles available for purchase exclusively through its website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hr5nsU"&gt;Visiting the retailer page for either the PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X / S will display a message that reads, “Available online only, Dec 15 at 3:00 PM ET. While supplies last,” as seen in screenshots below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uy09LV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10229005"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PcgsFZ"&gt;A Walmart spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that anyone successful in purchasing either a &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPlayStation-5-Console%2F363472942&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2Fseort%2F443574645&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2Fseort%2F606518560&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;S&lt;/a&gt; will have to wait until the end of the month to get their new console(s) as the items will be available for delivery only and will arrive “after December 25th.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="R7H5nr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226833"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CXb0Cl"&gt;Like most retailers, Walmart has exclusively sold both consoles online. Much like Nvidia’s RTX 30-series or AMD’s Radeon RX 6000 graphics cards, both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X / S are some of the most popular tech products on the market right now, and they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay"&gt;are also some of the most difficult to find in stock&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0KG4uG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226823"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Fortnite can now run at 120 frames per second on PS5 and Xbox Series X / S</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1c6Dh4NVJa3b5Td8qfyhNNDd998=/221x0:1555x889/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68517349/Fortnite.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MoAdqw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; will now be able to run at &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/day-1-ready-fortnite-arrives-next-week-on-xbox-series-x-s-and-ps5"&gt;120 frames per second on the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S&lt;/a&gt;. The game already received &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/2/21545910/epic-fortnite-ps5-xbox-series-x-enhancements-benefits-new-features"&gt;next-gen features like 4K at 60fps and dynamic visuals&lt;/a&gt; when the new consoles launched, but now Epic is updating the free battle royale game to take even more advantage of the hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b5RZDn"&gt;“120FPS Mode” can be enabled in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s video settings, but like other performance modes in console games, it does come with some caveats. Turning on 120fps will cap the resolution of the PS5 and Xbox Series X at 1440p rather than the usual 4K, while also reducing some graphical settings like shadows, post-processing, and streaming distances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hrnb1q"&gt;On the slightly less powerful Series S, enabling 120fps caps resolution at 1080p and reduces graphical settings like shadows. Unlike the Series X and PS5, running at 120fps also requires disabling volumetric clouds completely. Epic does note that when 120fps is turned off, the Series S will now default to a 1200p resolution rather than 1080p for all game modes. Not that I could ever tell the difference between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1FguKm"&gt;Epic most recently spruced up &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s performance with an update focused on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174861/fortnite-performance-mode-epic-games"&gt;getting the game running better on older PCs&lt;/a&gt;, but “120 FPS Mode” is more of a nice-to-have than anything necessary to continue enjoying the game. Epic also says that 120fps is only available on 120Hz displays, so you might not be able to enjoy it without a new TV or monitor. For those who can enable it, 120 FPS Mode is available in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Office is now updated for M1 Macs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The new MacBook Air is fast" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ccwbq_gLy_s8NDH890Y5RM_1ZIA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68517274/vpavic_4291_20201113_0380.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y1GLPv"&gt;If you’ve been using Microsoft Office on an M1 Mac, it’s about to get better — &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Fblog%2F2020%2F12%2F15%2F4-ways-microsoft-365-is-improving-the-experience-for-mac-users%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft is announcing an update&lt;/a&gt; today that brings native support for Apple’s new custom chip architecture to the Windows productivity suite. The apps getting the updates are Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, and OneNote. Notably absent, however, is Teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YIdd2Z"&gt;The updates are making the apps universal ones — meaning these versions will run on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs, so any upcoming updates or features will be coming at the same time for both platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rXhJja"&gt;If you’re a heavy user of Teams, you may be disappointed to hear that it hasn’t been included in today’s rollout of updates. Microsoft promises they’re working on that platform in their blog post, but the company hasn’t announced any sort of timeline. Meanwhile, Microsoft’s main communications competitor, Slack, has native support available &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/slackeng/status/1326237727667314688"&gt;in a public beta&lt;/a&gt;. It seems like you’ll have to stick with the emulated version for now, if your team uses Teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2KAl3i"&gt;Office users who have automatic updates turned on should have the new versions sometime today, and anyone else can update it through the Mac App Store or Microsoft’s AutoUpdate software (depending on if you downloaded Office through the App Store or directly from Microsoft). Outlook users will get not only native Apple Silicon support, but support for iCloud accounts as well, allowing them to sync their email, contacts, and calendars to the app if they use Apple’s service to store them. &lt;/p&gt;
