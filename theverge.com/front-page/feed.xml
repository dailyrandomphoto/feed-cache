    <title>PayPal’s updated app is its first step to becoming your bank</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uxzi7FTPHSnF9zw5uSmlbfUSzic=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69887349/Dashboard1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: PayPal&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5NM7Fd"&gt;PayPal is updating its mobile app with a new visual design, support for a high-yield savings account, and a way to find coupons in-app. In the past, the company prioritized sending and receiving money and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21527288/paypal-cryptocurrency-support-buy-sell-venmo-bitcoin"&gt;cryptocurrencies&lt;/a&gt;, but its new app is trying to be a little bit of everything to everyone, and it’s available today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gDrQHb"&gt;The immediately noticeable change is a visual one.  The old payment-focused PayPal app put sending and receiving money at the forefront, with your account balance the first thing you see when you open the app. The PayPal app’s new “homepage” is a dashboard of sorts with quick access to your balance, the amount of crypto you own, and your frequent contacts. It sorts other options under dedicated tabs and hubs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="su0Sr4"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/srSPlNz8NIY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rTr9xA"&gt;Direct deposit and features like PayPal’s credit and debit cards are under the wallet tab. The payments hub where you’ll find peer-to-peer payments, bill pay, charitable donations, and messaging. The shopping tab keeps track of coupons and loyalty programs. And finally, the finance tab features cryptocurrencies and the new high-yield savings account.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dowBxc--OATebhFS2PQTj_7g-Oo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865578/Savings1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: PayPal&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PayPal app’s new high-yield savings account can be found in the finance tab.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WXJtt8"&gt;In terms of new features, rolling out a savings account is a notable one. The automatic money-saving app Digit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22533664/digit-automatic-savings-online-bank-ai-subscription"&gt;added banking in beta earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, but PayPal has even more reach. This new PayPal app supports direct deposit — with the option to receive deposits two days early — and save the money you add to a PayPal Savings account. PayPal says its accounts will come with an annual percentage yield (APY) of 0.40 percent and no minimum balance or monthly fees. PayPal is also adding access to bill pay, so you can set up automatic payments to service providers and use “eligible funding sources” from your PayPal wallet to pay them. PayPal hasn’t shared what steps you need to take to open a savings account, and when asked, referred us to the features listed above.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QyT-XWQcG7d7YSAHs8KLqosQdlM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865579/Deals2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: PayPal&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;PayPal plans on surfacing coupons and discounts from various brands for use in transactions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="z1WUSD"&gt;PayPal is also emphasizing coupons and in-store discounts with a new dedicated shopping hub. “Shoppers will be presented with discounts and offers on hundreds of popular brands,” PayPal says, and along with the ability to “shop through the in-app browser.” Those savings extend outside of PayPal as well. You can clip coupons for use anywhere PayPal is a payment option online. PayPal is also working on a loyalty program that offers cashback and “shopping credit” on eligible purchases made with PayPal. The addition of coupons is similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21571806/google-pay-relaunch-money-payments-finances-deals-offers-banking-plex"&gt;the one Google made with Google Pay last year.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z0OE7c"&gt;PayPal’s new app is jam-packed with features, to the point that there’s a good chance that not everyone is going to use or even be aware of all of them. A more focused approach would probably be better for the average user, but the new PayPal app seems just as focused on making casual users reliant on more PayPal features as it is pleasing power users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7BoIm5"&gt;The new Paypal app is available today. PayPal Savings accounts are coming later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dpPYGu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r4z20O"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HP’s Spectre x360 16 uses AI to make you look glamorous on video calls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A user in a red dress types on the HP Spectre x360 16 in an evening room at a small wooden table. The screen displays a photo of a group of urban dancers in an outdoor scene in an editing program. To its left is a small lit lamp." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w26EX2bR_hTAaD0F1Wo7NFzw1Ls=/562x111:1705x873/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69887367/1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the HP Spectre x360 16.&lt;/em&gt; | HP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZfbWEP"&gt;HP makes some of the most gorgeous laptops you can buy, and its Spectre line is the most beautiful of them all. But the new Spectre x360 16, a 16-inch 2-in-1 touchscreen laptop, will flip that dynamic around. Not only is this laptop beautiful — this laptop wants to make &lt;em&gt;you &lt;/em&gt;beautiful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YENE3Q"&gt;That’s the idea, at least. The Spectre x360 16, starting at $1,639, is the first 16-inch laptop to include an “integrated, intelligent” 5MP webcam, HP claims. But that’s not all. It also comes with a program called — and I love this name — HP GlamCam. It’s not entirely clear what GlamCam will do, but HP claims that one of its main features, Beauty Mode, will “touch up skin, teeth, and eyes” during video calls. The goal, HP says, is to “keep your focus on what you’re saying, not your looks.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GLBWkY"&gt;There are also, of course, very &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/04/02/1021635/beauty-filters-young-girls-augmented-reality-social-media/"&gt;legitimate reasons&lt;/a&gt; to object to widespread use of beauty filters, which are available on many social media apps and have been popular for decades (though their use in real-time video is a recent advance). Some experts have warned that their prevalence on social media could contribute to unrealistic beauty standards among children and teenagers. On the other hand, this is a feature that Zoom itself has offered for &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2020/03/how-to-look-better-during-zoom-video-calls.html"&gt;over a year&lt;/a&gt;, and one that plenty of grown-up &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/zoom-video-conferencing-filter-touch-up-work-from-home-coronavirus-2020-3"&gt;workers&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2020/03/how-to-look-better-during-zoom-video-calls.html"&gt;heralded as a savior&lt;/a&gt; during a stressful period of time when it was difficult for many to make primping a priority. (The Spectre x360 16, as a premium workstation, also isn’t the type of laptop I’d expect to see too many children using.) It will certainly be an interesting feature to test.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A user participates in a video call on the HP Spectre x360 16, pointing to the right. The laptop sits on a white desk. To its left are a book and a smartphone. To its right are a small potted plant, an earbuds case, a pencil case, and a full bookcase." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gAXl4rjz6Mduxsz8vhmoxFcmR5s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22866427/HP_Spectre_x360_16_lifestyle_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don’t you want to be like these happy people?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A user participates in a video call on the HP Spectre x360 16. The laptop is seen from the side and sits on a marble table. A hydroflask is to its right, as is a shelf populated with two potted plants, a stack of books, a number of glass cups and jars, a pencil pot, and a speaker." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gwZycN5dR8dC70qdwr6Ie_LP32w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22866433/HP_Spectre_x360_16_lifestyle_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;GLAMCAM!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2OcYGC"&gt;GlamCam includes some other features to simplify your video calls, like Auto Frame (which will keep the camera’s focus on you if you get up and move around) and Lighting Correction (which will adjust your feed to keep lighting consistent if you’re moving from indoors to outdoors). The laptop can auto-lock when the camera sees you leave your desk and unlock itself when you return, dim its screen when you’re looking away, and add blur by itself if someone is behind you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vcKT9w"&gt;Software aside, it’s worth noting that HP has been putting 5MP webcams on some of its other high-end devices. I just tried one out on the $2,600 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22675550/hp-elite-dragonfly-max-2021-review-tile-test-specs-price-features"&gt;Elite Dragonfly Max&lt;/a&gt;, and while it delivered a better picture than you can generally expect from laptop webcams, I didn’t see a mind-blowing jump in quality. This one does support Windows Hello facial recognition, though, and has a physical privacy shutter. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The HP Spectre x360 16 on a white background, half open, angled away from the camera." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cqxdb8SWswoLHsAzgOgyd-llYWw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22866437/1__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a beauty.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="socW6K"&gt;Webcam aside, the new Spectre can come in either “nocturne blue with celestial blue accents” or “nightfall black with pale brass accents.” It has a 16:10 aspect ratio and a 91 percent screen-to-body ratio, with up to a UHD+ OLED panel. It’s HP’s first consumer notebook made from recycled CNC aluminum, as part of a broader sustainability focus that HP has brought to many of its recent premium models. Inside, it comes with up to an 11th Gen Intel Core i7 processor, a Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 graphics card, and support for Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2. It will be available in October on HP’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Slack launches clips, video messages that help you avoid meetings</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l6mYZSJ4I3i-T89LU5FbgHGWt2E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69887355/acastro_190412_1777_slack_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AiMsEo"&gt;Slack is launching its new clips feature today, allowing coworkers to record video messages that exist in Slack channels. Clips supports audio from a microphone, alongside video and screen recordings. They’re designed to help teams communicate across various time zones, and cut down on the amount of meetings that are now taking place in a hybrid work era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PtuF8J"&gt;In addition to clips, Slack is also expanding Slack Connect to allow paid organization to partner with companies on free plans. It’s also announcing GovSlack that will run in a government-certified cloud environment when it launches in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MEkePK"&gt;Clips can be shared in channels or through DMs on Slack, and they even include live captions and a transcript that’s searchable in the Slack interface. Because they’re just like sharing an image or a text message in Slack, coworkers can reply with text, audio, video, or emoji. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iniznU"&gt;Slack has been working on this feature for more than a year, and initially it sounded more like Instagram Stories that might disappear after a day rather than video voicemails that persist in channels. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21505519/slack-instagram-stories-push-to-talk-audio-calls-new-features"&gt;Initial prototypes involved a stories-like interface&lt;/a&gt;, but the feature has developed into something that fits more with the way people use Slack.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P_SV0rQnXYBT3aY8RvAalQ8F9cU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22866685/Clips_GIF_2.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slack’s new clips feature lets you record video and voice messages.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pJ0VQb"&gt;“We were inspired by how people are using video in consumer apps,” explains Tamar Yehoshua, chief product officer at Slack, in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We actually prototyped a lot of different versions of this internally, and now we’ve settled on this as a means of communicating into your work repository.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nU1GE5"&gt;Clips feels like the next step in Slack attempting to address the needs of businesses adjusting to working from home alongside a renewed mix of office work. Huddles, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556992/slack-huddles-audio-calls-feature-launch-discord-like"&gt;a Discord-like audio calls feature&lt;/a&gt;, launched earlier this year and it’s already Slack’s “fastest adopted feature,” according to Yehoshua. Clips will begin rolling out today and will be available for all paid teams this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYEWtx"&gt;Alongside the clips feature, Slack is also improving the way Slack Connect works. Slack Connects lets partner organizations work together in Slack and communicate, and now Slack is extending this to companies that aren’t on paid Slack plans yet. Slack Enterprise Grid customers will be able to invite anyone to use Slack and communicate with them instantly this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mujwPjR06uG3DmZyCfmHGT1yt3w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22866669/Clips_GIF_1.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Slack&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clips also supports screen recording.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TYgYxi"&gt;GovSlack is also launching in 2022, a version of Slack that runs in a government-certified cloud environment. While Slack can already be used by the US government, this new version complies with federal government requirements like FedRAMP High and DoD IL4 certifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8uRV3"&gt;SalesForce closed its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22587666/slack-acquisition-salesforce-closed-messaging-cloud"&gt;$27.7 billion deal to acquire Slack&lt;/a&gt; in July, and we’re now starting to hear more about the company’s ambitions for its communication service. It certainly sounds like SalesForce sees Slack as its digital hub, and the company is moving to integrate more of its services into Slack. “SalesForce has about 10 million developers in our ecosystem, and so what we’ve focused on with our platform work is connecting our platform to Slack for the SalesForce developer ecosystem,” explains Rob Seaman, senior vice president of Slack at SalesForce. “We consider Slack as the new engagement layer for SalesForce. We think the greater majority of users will be staying in Slack to do their work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WYzrUe"&gt;The concept of putting Slack at the center, or as a work hub, is very similar to what Microsoft has been doing with Teams. Most of Microsoft’s biggest services plug into Teams somehow, and the company has been pushing Office integration to convince businesses to use Teams. SalesForce will certainly help Slack respond to Teams here, all while keeping Slack’s APIs open for others developers to integrate apps and services.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HP’s new all-in-one has an ultrawide display and an RTX 3080 GPU</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C3V_oJ4W0fSor1UbxYRO0wbBESU=/0x0:3234x2156/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69887414/HP_ENVY_34_AiO_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ultrawide all-in-one with its magnetically attached webcam.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: HP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aynlV8"&gt;HP’s new Envy 34-inch All-In-One Desktop PC is a self-contained Windows 11 machine that’s available with comparable specs to a standalone gaming PC. It has a large 34-inch ultrawide IPS display (5120 x 2160), which can be powered by Nvidia’s RTX 3080 GPU and Intel’s 11th Gen Core i9 processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eqh3RA"&gt;Externally, the all-in-one is also equipped with a number of neat quality-of-life features. It’s got a magnetically-attached 16-megapixel webcam which can be reoriented to sit on any of the monitor’s four sides, and a 15W Qi wireless charger built into the stand to charge your phone or other compatible accessories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nSKqBfO6ZdNiHHP1J9Ovkj_Gfxc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22866671/HP_ENVY_34_AIO_10.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PC’s stand has a Qi wireless charger built in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a_ug-uEPS83FQ1Hug3pE_NR8jhw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22866672/HP_ENVY_34_AiO_3.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The webcam can be placed anywhere around the display.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FNL6nj"&gt;Around the back there are four USB-A ports and two Thunderbolt 4 ports, with an additional pair of USB-A ports on the side alongside an extra USB-C. There’s also an HDMI out, as well as a headphone / microphone combo port. Internally, the Envy All-In-One has four RAM slots and two M.2 SSD slots, and HP says its RAM and storage are user upgradeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="czoIHZ"&gt;It’s a pretty decent spec list for an all-in-one, and offers nearly all the features you could want out of a productivity or even gaming machine. The downside is that it won’t come cheap, HP says the Envy All-In-One will cost $1,999 when it ships next month, and that’s just the starting price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bq4Z1Q"&gt;If that’s too expensive for your tastes, HP also has a pair of other all-in-ones it’s announcing today. First up is the Pavilion All-in-One Desktop PC which is available with either a 24- or 27-inch display, a 5-megapixel pop-up webcam, and an AMD Ryzen 5000 series CPU. It goes on sale next month at a starting price of $799. There’s also the similarly named HP All-in-One Desktop PC, which lacks the Pavilion branding, and comes with a choice of AMD or Intel processors starting at $749.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A roughly $30 million handshake between two rivals is the latest display of consolidation in the small launch industry&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="QzFZNA"&gt;Astra, the small launch company that recently went public, has signed a roughly $30 million deal for the rights to manufacture Firefly Aerospace’s Reaver rocket engines in-house, according to a document seen by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; and people familiar with the arrangement. The agreement is part of a growing trend of consolidation in an industry of small rockets, where companies are cutting new deals to stay competitive as private capital abounds, more players take the field, and demand for small launch services shifts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1l0uQZ"&gt;Under the deal, which closed earlier this year, Firefly will send up to 50 of its Reaver rocket engines to Astra’s rocket factory in Alameda, California, where a development engine was already delivered in late spring for roughly half a million dollars, according to an internal Firefly document viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;and a person briefed on the agreement. Astra engineers have been picking apart the engine for detailed inspection, said a person familiar with the terms, who, like others involved in the deal, declined to speak on the record because of a strict non-disclosure agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NdlLST"&gt;Astra’s vice president of communications Kati Dahm declined to discuss the agreement when asked by &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;for comment on specific details, but disputed as incorrect the number of engines that the deal covers, as well as the cost of roughly a half million dollars for the initial development engine that’s sitting in Astra’s factory. Dahm declined to provide any additional information to back up those disputes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: John Kraus / &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/Astra/status/1304626075251556353?s=20" target="_blank"&gt;Astra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first of a series of three Astra rocket iterations lifts off in September 2020 from the company’s launch site in Kodiak, Alaska.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3x9gMh"&gt;Fusing Firefly’s engines with Astra’s own rocket technology would help Astra reach its publicly stated “500kg to 500km” goal, or the capability to send 1,102 pounds of satellites&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;into the most popular orbital altitude for mega-constellations. The company’s current rocket — simply called Rocket, nothing else — has been test-launched through various iterations, and after three main attempts, has yet to reach orbit. The latest rocket iterations use five of the company’s own Delphin engines, which are designed to lift up to 331 pounds to low-Earth orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lSWLbw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;In the early throes of starting a rocket company — but moving faster than usual&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lDyrcX"&gt;Astra is one of a handful of new launch startups that has been drudging through the trials of starting a launch business. Roughly five years after its founding in 2016, the company reached space — but not orbit — during its second launch last year, a feat that came quicker than most rocket startups typically achieve. Its third and most recent attempt in August from its pad in Kodiak, Alaska &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/29/22647094/astra-rocket-lv0006-launch-failed"&gt;failed after one of its five core engines shut down&lt;/a&gt; nearly a second after liftoff, Astra co-founder and CEO Chris Kemp told reporters at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Abn2FD"&gt;Firefly, too, has struggled to reach orbit using its centerpiece Alpha rocket, which is powered by four Reaver engines. This month, the company’s first orbital launch attempt failed when one of Alpha’s engines shutdown after a fuel valve spontaneously closed, cutting off the rocket’s ability to steer itself vertically. It started tumbling and turning sideways mid-flight before Space Force officials, who help manage launch safety, stepped in and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22655687/firefly-alpha-rocket-explodes-space-force-first-launch"&gt;detonated it&lt;/a&gt;. Alpha, as designed, can carry much more to orbit than Astra’s current rocket — some 2,204 pounds of satellites to low-Earth orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0vIecHfeT8NgJv07chHQJDZzge8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865637/liftoff_twitter.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Firefly’s Alpha rocket lifts off for its first launch attempt in September 2021. An engine suddenly shut down over two minutes after liftoff, leading officials to terminate the rocket before reaching space.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="neibpB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Astra is limited to two Reaver engines per rocket&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LYkTnH"&gt;The IP agreement includes a clause that aims to ensure Astra’s rocket doesn’t directly compete with Firefly’s Alpha. Astra, people involved in the deal said, is limited to using no more than two Reaver engines per rocket — just good enough to achieve the “500kg to 500km” goal. Kemp, Astra’s CEO, declined to comment on the specifics of the deal but emphasized Astra isn’t outright buying engines from Firefly. Doing so would be a major reversal for Astra’s brand of vertical integration, or the arrangement in which a company largely owns most of its supply chain to keep costs low and minimize production risks. Rather, according to the people briefed on the deal, Astra is buying the engine’s IP to manufacture them in-house and avoid being dependent on a supplier for its engines, which engineers regard as a rocket’s most important piece of hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DuY3kD"&gt;“I can’t comment on any supplier agreements that we have, but I can tell you that we have said that all IP required to produce all of our technology will be owned by Astra, licensed by Astra, or developed by Astra,” Kemp told &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NHei1c"&gt;A spokesperson for Firefly declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nxP1uM"&gt;Firefly’s move to sell engine IP to Astra, a rival, is part of a broader strategy to diversify its rocket business, and an increasingly common tactic in the industry. In August, Firefly announced a “new line of business dedicated to supplying rocket engines and other spaceflight components to the emerging New Space industry.” Without naming Astra, Firefly CEO Tom Markusic &lt;a href="https://spacenews.com/firefly-aerospaces-alpha-rocket-ready-for-first-launch/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;SpaceNews&lt;/em&gt; last month&lt;/a&gt; that Firefly has a contract to deliver about 50 rocket engines to a company developing its own launch vehicle. The Firefly document reviewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; says the same, and adds that sharing IP is part of the deal. Multiple sources involved in and familiar with the agreement told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Astra is the undisclosed customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="10lKqx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We would not want to be in a position where if they don’t supply us an engine, we can’t launch a rocket”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GBhwew"&gt;Swapping out Astra’s Delphin engines for Firefly’s Reaver engines isn’t as easy as it might sound. The existence of the deal between the two companies suggests Astra is planning a redesigned launch vehicle, which analysts say would have been necessary anyway to achieve its goal of sending 500kg to low-Earth orbit. But it’s unclear what rocket Astra is planning around the Reaver engines or when it would be ready to launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VU3EUBFvhoXKGQyQluzdjACIDlk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865708/EwoYs5tUUAEvU_O.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: John Kraus / Astra&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Astra test-fires a Delphin engine at its Alameda, California facilities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f3b15q"&gt;Firefly offered to sell Astra its Reaver engines directly earlier this year, people familiar with the talks said, but Astra, focused on bringing in new technology whose production lines it can control itself, didn’t want that kind of arrangement. “We would not want to be in a position where if they don’t supply us an engine, we can’t launch a rocket,” a person familiar with Astra’s strategy said. That might be the right move, as an example from the other end of the launch industry shows — United Launch Alliance (ULA), the Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture, is buying engines from Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin to power the company’s next generation rocket, Vulcan. But Blue Origin’s engine development delays &lt;a href="https://spacenews.com/tory-bruno-says-the-challenges-with-be-4-are-real-but-the-engine-is-moving-forward/"&gt;have held up&lt;/a&gt; ULA’s timeline for Vulcan’s inaugural launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="LCx0tc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Collaborating while competing is typical in the space industry&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Adj7k6"&gt;Overall, the agreement between Astra and Firefly “seems like a natural outcome of the increasing maturity of new entrants to the marketplace,” says Carissa Christensen, an industry analyst and founder of BryceTech. The small launch industry is flooded with new entrants — roughly 100 different small launch companies exist nowadays, with only a handful making meaningful progress toward space. Rocket Lab, a California-based firm that launches rockets from New Zealand, is the only small launch firm that’s conducting routine operations, using its Electron rocket to loft satellites into space for the Space Force and private companies. Rocket Lab went public this year through a SPAC merger, or a special-purpose acquisition company that’s listed publicly only to merge with a private company and take it public. That unlocked new capital for the company’s future rocket development plans and put its valuation around $4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AEkwlC"&gt;“Historically, it’s typical that space companies collaborate and work together as well as compete,” Christensen said, partially because launch companies require large sums of investment and don’t generate constant streams of revenue or profit. And “because of the relatively limited demand,” there aren’t tens of thousands of launches a year that would keep operations busy and revenue coming in. Instead, there are roughly a hundred launches per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s4txdU"&gt;Like Firefly, Rocket Lab has also expanded into the components business in recent months, but on a different scale. The company announced it is selling reaction wheels — tiny components that help satellites maintain position in orbit — and plans to make up to 2,000 each year. Selling IP for engines like Astra and Firefly’s arrangement, Rocket Lab’s CEO Peter Beck tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, “doesn’t move the needle” in the small launch industry. “Providing thousands of reaction wheels across a large number of platforms and large constellations — that actually moves the needle for the whole industry,” he claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NacRdfZ3r8BuKBQXwTOPLajYRVY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865721/RocketLab_F9_SimonMoffatt_SamToms_LowRes4.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sam Toms and Simon Moffatt / Rocket Lab&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rocket Lab’s 9th launch of Electron for its “As The Crow Flies” mission in 2019 lifts off from Māhia Peninsula, New Zealand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E8FJ9N"&gt;For small launch firms, “either they’ll go out of business or I definitely think there will be mergers and acquisitions,” Christensen said. Some of those mergers and acquisitions, she added, will be the result of a convenient deal two companies reached, or a desperate tactic for a company to stay alive. “It’s a high risk business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rq8zKq"&gt;Astra, founded in 2016, was the first launch company to go public earlier this year, accessing new capital by taking the route of a SPAC merger. Astra’s valuation was pegged at $2.1 billion. After its announcement to go public, the company acquired Apollo Fusion in July for $145 million, scooping up electric spacecraft propulsion technology designed to power satellite busses that Astra is planning to develop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="OKe0i9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Few will make it on their own”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s83BF1"&gt;Firefly, founded by Markusic in 2014 as Firefly Space Systems, went out of business in 2016 after a European investor pulled out, which Markusic said at the time was due to the Brexit referendum. The company was resurrected as Firefly Aerospace in 2017 when Noosphere Ventures, an investment firm founded by Ukrainian entrepreneur Max Polyakov, bought the bankrupt company’s assets. After a funding round in May, the company’s overall valuation is just over $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Pk5700"&gt;“We took Firefly from bankruptcy to a valuation of more than $1 billion in less than 5 years. We can increase that by a factor of 10 in the next 5 years,” Polyakov said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hCjnkf"&gt;“Putting crazies and romantics aside, some of these companies have solid tech; others may have better access to capital. The inevitable result of a market situation like this is consolidation or mergers,” he said of the overall industry landscape. “Few will make it on their own.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft gets ready to launch the Surface Pro 8 I’ve been waiting years for</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-7zSna8ddfUYSGi1KVXvr5UMkm0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69887242/vpavic_191104_3776_0013.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Surface Pro design has remained mostly the same since 2014. | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gsu3rP"&gt;Microsoft is planning to launch its latest Surface Pro 8 tablet tomorrow. Sources familiar with Microsoft’s plans tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the new Surface Pro 8 will ship with the biggest hardware design and specification changes since the Surface Pro 3 launch more than seven years ago. The Surface Pro 8 looks like the Surface Pro redesign I’ve long waited for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="js8iez"&gt;Microsoft is planning to bring most of the sleek design elements of the Surface Pro X to the Surface Pro 8. The tablet itself will be more rounded at the edges, and a new Surface keyboard will house a new slim Surface Pen inside just like the Pro X does. While the display bezels at the top and bottom of the Surface Pro 8 won’t be fully eliminated, they will be a lot smaller and nearly edge-to-edge on the sides. The Surface Pro 8 will still be slightly thicker  than the Pro X, though.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9UUrctJlTysaCtypYXi0VYL6sms=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19249909/akrales_190930_3688_0196.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Pro X design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tT6xoR"&gt;I’m also expecting Microsoft to replace the Surface Pro 8 display with a 120Hz panel that will make use of Windows 11’s new Dynamic Refresh Rate feature. Dynamic Refresh Rate is similar to how Apple’s high refresh-rate ProMotion displays operate, allowing the display to fluctuate between different refresh rates depending on tasks. Microsoft is primarily using this new Surface Pro 8 display to boost inking performance on the device, and make scrolling in web pages and certain apps a lot smoother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uC6ygP"&gt;Inking improvements on the Surface Pro 8 will be significant thanks to this new display, and an updated Surface Pen. The same slim stylus design found on the Pro X will be available on the Pro 8, and Microsoft is making some solid improvements here. The new Surface Pen will support haptic feedback so you get the subtle sensations from drawing, and the tip has been improved for better pressure sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TJDKv8_l0HBnrEFtd81TlIv27cU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19249906/akrales_190930_3688_0094.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Pro 8 will include a slim Surface Pen like the Pro X.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="us9Go3"&gt;Microsoft is also moving to Thunderbolt on the Surface Pro 8, ditching the USB-A port and moving to two USB-C ports that will support high-speed data transfers. Again, this is similar to the Surface Pro X which also ships with dual USB-C ports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQkI2d"&gt;When I reviewed the Surface Pro 7 two years ago, I said “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20923662/microsoft-surface-pro-7-review-tablet-specs-features-price-usb-c-windows-10"&gt;I wish this looked like a Surface Pro X,&lt;/a&gt;” and the Pro 8 delivers on most of the Pro X improvements. Microsoft is sticking with Intel’s 11th Gen chips inside, which means the big differences between a regular Surface Pro and the Surface Pro X will be down to battery life and performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AhYTvB"&gt;If the Surface Pro 8 can deliver solid battery life, this could be the best Intel-powered Surface Pro ever. After years of refining the design of the Surface Pro 3, the Surface Pro 8 is set for a design overhaul just in time for Windows 11 with its refreshed UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="atRpVj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; will be covering all of Microsoft’s Surface news tomorrow. We’re expecting the Surface Pro 8, a new Surface Book design, Surface Pro X updates, a Surface Go 3, and the Surface Duo 2. Microsoft’s event kicks off at 11AM ET on September 22nd, and we’ll be covering all the news live.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snap has new Lenses that show users how to fingerspell in American Sign Language</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="New lenses will help Snapchat uses learn to fingerspell in American Sign Language" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d4wVptlyEVhwrg9hTphmgTXmmaw=/0x170:501x504/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69887115/signlang.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Snap&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aGqjXM"&gt;To mark the &lt;a href="https://wfdeaf.org/iwdeaf2021/"&gt;International Week of the Deaf&lt;/a&gt;, Snapchat has created custom stickers and three AR Lenses to encourage users to fingerspell, the company said Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BnqT1j"&gt;The new features were designed by incorporating feedback and guidance from deaf and hard-of-hearing employees at the company, and using AI and computer vision technology developed by Hungarian startup SignAll, which focuses on technology for deaf people. SignAll has developed technology that can be used to track hand movements to translate sign language into spoken language. The company launched fingerspelling &lt;a href="https://www.signall.us/newsroom/ace-asl-the-ai-powered-sign-language-app-from-signall-is-now-available-on-android"&gt;mobile app Ace ASL&lt;/a&gt; for iOS in April, and for Android earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="axmft0"&gt;The new Snap features were also driven internally by Snap Lab software engineer Jennica Pounds, who is deaf. Pounds said her oldest son has had a hard time learning American Sign Language, which was a big motivation for her to work on the new tools. “I’m passionate about this technology because I truly believe it’s going to break so many applications wide open,” she said in a news release. “It’s tech like this that will help families like mine communicate and grow together.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3e4OQw-N5fGelEd_rEPDoIp-HF4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865092/sign_sticker.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Snap&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Snap sticker with the ASL sign for “I love you.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lxabyJ"&gt;The AR Lenses will help Snap users learn to fingerspell their names, along with common words like “love,” “hug,” and “smile.” They can capture and share the experiences with other users in chat. And there’s also a new group of Bitmoji stickers showing some commonly signed terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wONqEf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tt13Db"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1o1CeWz7B5-WaInFcndLYSDqdLo=/0x0:708x472/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69887062/background.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BtlPH0"&gt;Comcast appears to be planning to offer TVs running its own software across at least two territories, according to recent &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/comcast-xclass-tv-hisense"&gt;reports from &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/eec0e585-dd24-4ef7-9a23-ed2afccb7269"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="brvfpE"&gt;In the US, the TVs will reportedly be branded as XClass TVs. Originally manufactured by Hisense, the 43 and 50-inch sets will run Comcast’s X1 operating system, which is already found on its set-top boxes and Xfinity Flex streaming box. An &lt;a href="https://id.platco.xfinity.com/login?execution=e1s1"&gt;Xfinity landing site&lt;/a&gt; confirms the “XClass TV” branding, while an FAQ spotted by &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; says they’ll aggregate “your favorite apps, live channels, and On Demand movies and shows together in one place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mGvW8G"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apps, live channels, and On Demand movies and shows together in one place”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rPt0Ft"&gt;Meanwhile in the UK, Comcast subsidiary Sky is reportedly planning to launch smart TVs of its own. &lt;em&gt;The FT&lt;/em&gt;’s report doesn’t mention what operating system these TVs are likely to run. Sky already operates its Sky Q platform in the country, which currently runs on set-top boxes and shows satellite broadcasts alongside video streamed from services like Netflix and Disney Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x87c0N"&gt;Comcast declined to comment to &lt;em&gt;Protocol &lt;/em&gt;on its report. In the UK, Sky confirmed that it’s always exploring new technologies, but declined to comment on “product rumors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7J9qiv"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; notes, the initiatives appear to be Comcast’s attempt to insulate itself as customers turn away from traditional cable and satellite plans in favor of streaming services. By offering a platform that competes with the likes of Roku, Comcast would be able to maintain its direct relationship with customers. It could then aggregate content from other streaming providers alongside its own Peacock and Xumo streaming services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="63zKPx"&gt;Controlling the viewing platform also gives Comcast and its subsidiaries the ability to negotiate with streaming providers to offer them better prominence on its platforms, the &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt; notes. Netflix in particular is well known for paying manufacturers to place dedicated shortcut buttons on its remotes, and &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; reports that the XClass TV’s remote will have shortcut buttons to Netflix, Amazon Prime, YouTube, and Peacock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Kxn0F"&gt;As well as smart TVs, in the UK Sky is also reportedly testing a version of its Sky Q service that runs solely over the internet rather than satellite, &lt;a href="https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2021/08/sky-uk-allegedly-trial-broadband-tv-service-without-satellite.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ISPreview&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The plans were first announced back in 2017, and the company has already launched similar products in &lt;a href="https://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2021/08/02/without-cable-or-satellite-sky-deutschland-launches-sky-q-over-ip/"&gt;European countries like Germany&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s yet to announce an official launch in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="db1yFz"&gt;Without an official announcement, it’s uncertain when the TVs could hit the market in either country. But in the UK, Sky is planning a launch event on October 7th, when it’s teasing that “something magical is coming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X8fdwQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Comcast is an investor in Vox Media, The Verge’s parent company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f2I6ZN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix launches free, first-of-its-kind Android mobile plan in Kenya </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8opmfhocKcaqEft8F7kgSAazbLQ=/0x37:422x318/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69887037/NFLX_FREEPLANLAUNCH_UI_3_c__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d2mO2C"&gt;Netflix is launching a new free Android mobile plan in Kenya that will allow users to watch a limited selection of its catalog, including full seasons of select shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KQnrh0"&gt;Netflix announced that &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-launches-free-plan-in-kenya"&gt;beginning this week&lt;/a&gt;, the new ad-free Netflix mobile plan for Android gives users the option to sign up without having to enter any payment information (though they’ll need to verify that they’re 18 or older and will still need to submit an email address to create a login). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2sR6UB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Netflix hopes users will upgrade to a paid subscription&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bQNWOv"&gt;A Netflix spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it’s the first time the streamer has offered a free tier. Roughly a quarter of its library will be included in the free plan, and users on this tier will be able to watch entire seasons of shows. Netflix said it hopes that users who enjoy using the service will eventually upgrade to one of its paid subscriptions, which support streaming from TVs and laptops as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HEStzf"&gt;Netflix has experimented with free-to-stream content before in an attempt to woo new subscribers. It previously made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/17/21225143/netflix-doumentaries-free-youtube-our-planet-13th-babies-explained"&gt;some of its content&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289576/netflix-trial-of-the-chicago-7-free-youtube-limited-time"&gt;available on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, for example, and the company experimented with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21408344/netflix-watch-free-two-popes-bird-box-stranger-things-promotional-campaign"&gt;free-to-watch portal&lt;/a&gt; with a small selection of titles after it permanently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514661/netflix-free-trial-us-cancel-content-sampling-streaming"&gt;axed its free trial period&lt;/a&gt; in the US. HBO Max, which also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/4/22154553/hbo-max-ditches-one-week-free-trial-ahead-of-wonder-woman-1984"&gt;killed its free trial&lt;/a&gt; ahead of &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt;’s day-and-date release on the service, has similarly experimented with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22608403/hbo-max-new-subscribers-free-episodes"&gt;offering limited episodes&lt;/a&gt; for free to boost its subscriber numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QyIvyc"&gt;Netflix’s free Android plan for users in Kenya launched Monday and will continue rolling out over the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>So Snoop Dogg just claimed to be a prominent NFT booster</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Screenshot of Snoop Dogg’s tweet claiming to be Cozomo Medici" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Br2Y2y1ojayCOZ7fpSon65CefNY=/0x0:954x636/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69886144/Screen_Shot_2021_09_20_at_3.04.30_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1nSjbx"&gt;Snoop Dogg, the famous rapper, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SnoopDogg/status/1440038460417474567?s=20"&gt;tweeted on Monday&lt;/a&gt; that he’s the one behind a Twitter account that discusses NFTs. Yes, this really is a thing that’s happened. While Snoop Dogg &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcrypto.com%2Fnft%2Fdrops-event%2F80b2e021d4cbfbc43789db5377ecf1ed&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F20%2F22684780%2Fsnoop-dog-nft-booster-cozomo-medici-reveal-prank-crypto" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;has released NFTs before&lt;/a&gt;, that’s not really anything new for celebrities — running &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CozomoMedici"&gt;a Twitter account that constantly tweets about crypto&lt;/a&gt;, and owning around a hundred of the crypto tokens, however, would be another level. Is this reveal real? A prank? It’s unclear, but it sure is &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6UXBWz"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CozomoMedici/"&gt;@CozomoMedici&lt;/a&gt; (seemingly named after a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosimo_de%27_Medici"&gt;prominent Renaissance-era Italian banker&lt;/a&gt;) is a Twitter account that’s amassed quite a few followers in the month or two it’s been active and talking about crypto. Part of what’s made the account splashy is that it’s seemingly &lt;a href="https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0xce90a7949bb78892f159f428d0dc23a8e3584d75"&gt;spent millions on NFTs&lt;/a&gt;. The person behind the Medici account has been talking about releasing their personal details for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CozomoMedici/status/1438617782585724934?s=20"&gt;at least a few days now&lt;/a&gt;, even &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CozomoMedici/status/1438903417246650368?s=20"&gt;running a poll&lt;/a&gt; inviting people to guess at their true identity. (No, Snoop Dogg was not one of the options, but AOC and the lead singer of Muse were). It culminated today with the person behind the account announcing that they were going to tweet their identity from their personal account, saying that it would be discovered because they’re considerably famous. Five minutes later, Snoop Dogg tweeted “I am @CozomoMedici.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SrCyjn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Shortly, as promised, I will dox from my personal account.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As my fame is considerable, the tweet will no doubt be discovered. Those who are curious to my identity will soon know it.&lt;/p&gt;— Cozomo de’ Medici (@CozomoMedici) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CozomoMedici/status/1440037291771121668?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="j7h1sO"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;I am &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CozomoMedici?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@CozomoMedici&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Snoop Dogg (@SnoopDogg) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SnoopDogg/status/1440038460417474567?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="enk2E7"&gt;It’s tempting to use Medici’s involvement with Jason Derulo, singer of “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBI3lc18k8Q"&gt;Whatcha Say&lt;/a&gt;” and “Wiggle (feat. Snoop Dogg),” as evidence of his prominence in the space. The R&amp;amp;B artist &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasonderulo/status/1436090353103237132"&gt;thanked Medici for helping him purchase a CryptoPunk&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, but today’s (possible) reveal raises the question: did Derulo look to Medici because they were prominent in the NFT space, or did he know it was actually &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiP14ED28CA"&gt;one of his peers&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Image of Jason Derulo and Snoop Dogg looking off-screen with surprised faces." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OQby9tWtdab-ES3atwF0pC5_LLM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865566/Screen_Shot_2021_09_20_at_2.34.14_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Warner Records&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When you see an excellent NFT.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ClwZaH"&gt;While the Medici account is relatively new, only being created last month, it’s still managed to gain some notoriety, having been mentioned in &lt;a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/117605/art-blocks-hit-generative-artist-5-38-million"&gt;a story by crypto outlet &lt;em&gt;The Block&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The Medici OpenSea account also has around 100 NFTs &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/Cozomo_de_Medici"&gt;in its collection&lt;/a&gt; (some of which were purchased for millions of dollars worth of Ethereum). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="oTYSCk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CeBfmt"&gt;I know the question you’re asking... no, screaming... no, freestyle rapping at your monitor: has Cozomo de Medici bought any Snoop Dogg-themed NFTs? Well, of course I went and snooped on &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/Cozomo_de_Medici"&gt;their OpenSea account&lt;/a&gt;, and I found some things that would be pretty amusing if Medici turns out to actually be Snoop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xXGyhv"&gt;First, a few minutes after Snoop tweeted his confession, the Medici account bought two weed-themed NFTs &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/Cozomo_de_Medici?identifier=Cozomo_de_Medici&amp;amp;search%5BsortBy%5D=LAST_SALE_PRICE&amp;amp;search%5BsortAscending%5D=false&amp;amp;search%5Bquery%5D=nyandogg"&gt;by an artist named NyanDogg&lt;/a&gt;. The account has also been sent a cloud of &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x40d1587cb0bd9e2bcf7ab16c857d9a9fd881d445/1036"&gt;blunt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x6f0365ca2c1dd63473f898a60f878a07e0f68a26/6056"&gt;Snoop-themed&lt;/a&gt; NFTs since the reveal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FGYQYiIYnyg-WCFolfVRDHlKw3c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865598/Screen_Shot_2021_09_20_at_2.45.35_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the NyanDogg NFTs purchased by Medici.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eDSsre"&gt;Hey, wait, isn’t that Snoop’s Twitter avatar?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Owp6CYJkAgKFCRNT0phgX4qczKU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865604/Screen_Shot_2021_09_20_at_2.46.41_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;By George it is!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ocbRnT"&gt;There is, of course, the possibility that this is a troll on Snoop Dogg’s part, or that Medici and Snoop coordinated this and the real Medici’s identity is still unknown. The Medici Twitter account has liked a ton of tweets relating to Snoop Dogg’s, but to be honest, if Snoop claimed to be &lt;em&gt;me,&lt;/em&gt; I’d like tweets about it too, despite the fact that I’m not actually Snoop Dogg (as far as you know).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tweet retweeted by Snoop Dogg reading: “with so much drama in the N-F-Ts it’s kinda hard being @CozomoMedici   but he somehow some way keep buyin’ up slick ass jpegs like every day”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LMKe9LUB6MnbhqOXqD2qklt-FzA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865665/Screen_Shot_2021_09_20_at_3.05.51_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8ZQSn1"&gt;It’s hard to tell what the fallout from all this will be. Will Snoop Dogg become a thought leader in the NFT space? Will more celebrities come out as having run crypto accounts (perhaps Snoop’s friend &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/food-news/a37637908/snoop-dogg-martha-stewart-tasty-halloween/"&gt;Martha Stewart&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650594/banksy-nft-scam-pranksy-ethereum-returned-duplicates-art"&gt;Pranksy&lt;/a&gt;)? Or will this whole thing turn out to have been an elaborate prank?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D0grwA"&gt;At the moment, the answer to all of those questions is unclear, but there is one concrete consequence of Snoop’s tweet: his mentions are now filled with people pitching him NFT projects. Never thought I’d have that in common with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Y87nT"&gt;Final note: while, again, I cannot stress enough that there’s no hard evidence linking Snoop and the Medici account, there’s one more critical clue to point out: Medici often &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CozomoMedici/status/1440037293327142923?s=20"&gt;signs off tweets with a wine emoji&lt;/a&gt;. You know who has his own brand of wine? &lt;a href="https://www.19crimes.com/wines"&gt;Snoop Dogg&lt;/a&gt;. Case closed everyone, we’ve totally nailed it down.&lt;/p&gt;
