    <title>PS5 exclusive Destruction AllStars is the next generation of car crashing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PUKLj1tgEL-LMDGLwCrX6YZnkb4=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68756633/destruction_all_stars_screenshots_21_disclaimer_ps5_en_15oct20.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h3OjN9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Destruction AllStars&lt;/em&gt; is a game about smashing cars. It’s right there, the first word in the title. It’s also a major milestone for the PS5 — a huge exclusive that’s solely on the next-gen console that isn’t a remake or stretching across generations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zEbQgr"&gt;It’s a title that will, by necessity, be used to showcase what kind of games developers can make when given full reign of the PS5’s new features and firepower. But smashing is still the heart of &lt;em&gt;Destruction AllStars&lt;/em&gt;: so much so that the seed of the game was a simple idea. “Imagine how awesome we can make damage on PS5,” John McLaughlin, a senior producer at Sony XDev, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OOBacu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Imagine how awesome we can make damage on PS5.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j0Rifx"&gt;It was a short jump from there to partnering with Lucid Games for development, given the studio’s heritage. Game director Colin Berry had previously worked on Sony’s &lt;em&gt;Wipeout&lt;/em&gt; series, while other Lucid members came from other classic car games, like &lt;em&gt;Metropolis Street Racer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Project Gotham Racing&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;MotorStorm&lt;/em&gt;. “One thing that was for sure was that these guys knew cars,” says McLaughlin. “And then we basically went to those guys with that seed and said ‘We want to do something on PS5, with lots of destruction and cool stuff — what’s your idea, what’s your pitch?’”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vXKOdQzjfzAyreLvpNVZ0H-IBAo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22274479/50566903546_1016acafc5_k.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oweytX"&gt;The Lucid team returned with a different kind of combat car game. As McLaughlin explains, “They came to us, not so much with &lt;em&gt;Destruction AllStars&lt;/em&gt; — the name came later on — but they came with the pitch of a game that featured cars, featured loads of destruction, [and] encouraged destruction. It wasn’t about hiding from the destruction, it was all about smashing and racking as fast as you can, and so on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vWD0aG"&gt;The other goal was to raise the bar for a destruction derby-style game. While older games would cheat at showing damage or debris, hiding behind texture swaps or low-resolution polygons, &lt;em&gt;Destruction AllStars&lt;/em&gt; tries to offer a better experience, according to Berry. “Regarding the PlayStation 5 and what we were told about the specs early on, that we could look at doing deformation and damage and the physics in a way that we haven’t done before, and to a level that we haven’t done before. So, the crumpling of the cars, the amount of parts of each car is made up, all of these wrecks, we can really push the bolt on those kinds of things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XjZ0rn"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6kP3G5vO49A?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2IoEDQ"&gt;That level of detail in the titular destruction is a big part of why &lt;em&gt;Destruction AllStars&lt;/em&gt; is limited to just the PS5 — even when a PS4 port would have opened up the game to more players, a key thing in a game that’s heavily focused on multiplayer modes. A PS4 version just “wouldn’t have performed the same in terms of the damage and the defamation and the physics, actually in the game,” says Berry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RRWg9T"&gt;The flip side of that exclusivity, of course, is what happens to &lt;em&gt;Destruction AllStars&lt;/em&gt; next. As a free PS5-exclusive title on offer through PlayStation Plus for the next two months, it’ll be virtually guaranteed a huge opening audience, much in the same way that previous PS Plus hits like &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355586/fall-guys-ultimate-knockout-pc-ps4-game"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have achieved. &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt; went on to become an internet sensation, with massive esports tournaments that are still popular even years after release. &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt;, on the other hand, has largely faded into the background, hamstrung by new content that trickled out too slowly to keep most players’ interest after the first few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7If8bX"&gt;“We have a plan, we have a roadmap, not just for the ... launch window of the game, but for the first three, four weeks down the line, for a couple of months down the line, for the next year,” says McLaughlin, with new characters, new game modes, and more all planned for free in the future. “We’ve got a plan on a schedule of content over the coming year that I think is going to keep people entertained and engaged and keep them coming back and wonder what they’re dropping this week, and wonder what they’re dropping next week.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kZ7Svu"&gt;Destruction AllStars&lt;em&gt; is available as a &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21534475/destruction-all-stars-ps5-launch-title-delayed-ps-plus-february-2021"&gt;&lt;em&gt;free download for PlayStation Plus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; subscribers on the PlayStation 5 for the months of February and March. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W7IMip"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y2I1yt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Comcast is doubling the speed of its low-income internet plan</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nxGNPSXrwQv2VD0ZCuBVCe-jrQI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68756638/acastro_180525_1777_comcast_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yXyH2U"&gt;Users of Comcast’s Internet Essentials plan will be getting a significant speed increase on March 1st. The service, which currently runs at 25Mbps, will be automatically upgraded to 50Mbps without requiring additional fees or action from customers. Upload speeds are also being increased from 3Mbps to 5Mbps. Faster access for the same price should be a relief for many families struggling to adapt to having work, school, and entertainment largely shifted to the internet during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SXdqVN"&gt;The Internet Essentials plan is Comcast’s $9.95 per month (plus tax, of course) internet service provided to qualifying low-income households &lt;a href="https://www.internetessentials.com/get-help#mostasked&amp;amp;all_Documentsneeded"&gt;eligible for assistance&lt;/a&gt; from programs like SNAP, Medicaid, or WIC. This is the second time in a year that Comcast’s program is getting a speed bump: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/12/21177524/comcast-internet-essentials-speed-increase-coronavirus"&gt;it was upgraded from 15Mbps in March of last year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S7IpW5"&gt;Comcast upgrading its cheapest plans to 50 / 5Mbps is somewhat of a rebuke to former FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242635/fcc-ajit-pai-internet-speed-advanced-telecommunications-3mbps"&gt;who last month claimed that 25 / 3Mbps speeds are&lt;/a&gt; “an appropriate measure by which to assess whether a fixed service is providing advanced telecommunications capability.” It seems even Comcast disagrees with Pai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6hxnGZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Somewhat of a rebuke to former FCC Chairman Ajit Pai&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jsZ5mv"&gt;The upgrades are part of Comcast’s response to the coronavirus, but the faster speeds should stick around after the pandemic is over. In March, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/20/21296913/comcast-free-wifi-hotspot"&gt;made its public Wi-Fi hotspots free&lt;/a&gt;, and in September it started the “Lift Zone” program, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21441222/comcast-wifi-community-centers-low-income-students"&gt;which provides access to Wi-Fi and educational resources&lt;/a&gt; for people living in low-income areas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WtfBhp"&gt;With COVID-19 shutdowns having a &lt;a href="https://www.princeton.edu/news/2020/11/30/covid-19-shutdowns-disproportionately-affected-low-income-black-households"&gt;disproportionate impact on low-income households&lt;/a&gt;, it’s good to know that the people who need it most will be getting faster internet service without having to pay any additional cost. Of course, there will still be people who need internet access &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc"&gt;that won’t have it&lt;/a&gt;, but the announcement is one bright spot in a news category that often doesn’t provide feel-good stories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lonFK7"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Comcast is an investor in Vox Media, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; parent company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla agrees to recall cars with failing displays</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vhzo6nBci5dLWjTKfzRYcC3oBEw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68756584/akrales_170414__1610_0149.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1oqnhz"&gt;Tesla has agreed to recall more than 134,000 Model S sedans and Model X SUVs that will eventually suffer from faulty displays after pressure from the leading US safety regulator, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Tesla announced the recall to customers in an email, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/02/02/tesla-will-finally-voluntarily-recall-model-s-x-touchscreen-problem-arm-twisted-nhtsa/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and said a software update could allow them to keep accessing crucial features like the backup camera in the meantime if their displays fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OE3iDx"&gt;The problem that prompted the recall has to do with the 8GB eMMC NAND flash memory device that Tesla used in its massive touchscreen displays on most 2012–2018 Model S sedans and 2016–2018 Model X SUVs. These chips eventually wear out, as &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qvgxqp/worn-out-flash-memory-is-suddenly-bricking-tesla-cars"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; first reported back in 2019, and when they do, it bricks the entire “media control unit” — cutting off access to not only the backup camera (which is now federally required), but also HVAC controls and everything else that Tesla has routed through the touchscreen. It also affects the turn signal lights, according to the agency. NHTSA says all of this increases the risk of a crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FGlbcL"&gt;NHTSA started an investigation into the failures last year, and during that process, Tesla eventually told the agency that every car with the flash chip “will inevitably fail.” Tesla told NHTSA that it could take as long as eight years to swap all the defective parts if a recall wasn’t issued, with most failures happening around 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CqqSV6"&gt;Tesla did not appear to want to recall the cars initially, prompting NHTSA to take the unusual step of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22229854/tesla-recall-model-s-x-touchscreens-bricked-failure-nhtsa"&gt;publishing a public letter “requesting” the recall last month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="knt6fn"&gt;Now, Tesla has committed to the recall. On February 1st, NHTSA sent &lt;a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2021/RCAK-21V035-5245.pdf"&gt;another letter&lt;/a&gt; confirming that Tesla will begin a recall on March 30th, covering an estimated 134,591 vehicles. (NHTSA notes in this letter that Tesla still does not believe the bricked displays cause a safety risk.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O98saR"&gt;Owners can call Tesla customer service at 1-877-798-3752 for more information, and the company’s reference number for the recall is SB-21-21-001. They can also call NHTSA’s “Vehicle Safety Hotline” at 1-888-327-4236 or go to &lt;a href="http://www.safercar.gov"&gt;www.safercar.gov&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eVG8F9"&gt;In the email to owners, Tesla says it will upgrade the eMMC chip free of charge with an “enhanced 64GB eMMC.” The company says it will notify owners when “parts become available” and asks that they not schedule a service appointment unless their vehicle’s display bricks or they get an alert about the memory storage. Owners who already paid Tesla to repair the issue “may be eligible for reimbursement,” which the company says it will share more information about by the end of March. Tesla has been offering to &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/01/22/tesla-slashes-price-media-unit-upgrade-amid-controversy/"&gt;swap the media control unit altogether for $1,500&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for a more powerful version with new features — and which, presumably, won’t fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRXOBY"&gt;In the meantime, Tesla says owners will not lose access to the backup camera, turn signal, and a base setting for windshield defogging and defrosting if the chip fails as long as owners upgrade their vehicle’s software to version 2020.48.12. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Small launch startup Astra to go public at $2.1 billion valuation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bFR1XrXEoy5S7fAZvNmD1ZfH87Y=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68756438/EpedCU2XIAIwTiJ.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Astra’s 3.2 rocket launching from Alaska | John Kraus/Astra&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dYUf86"&gt;Astra plans to become the first small rocket maker to go public, the company announced Tuesday, after reaching space for the first time in December. It’ll become the second publicly traded space venture &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20936896/virgin-galactic-public-offering-nyse-spce-space-tourism"&gt;after Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q8YUWR"&gt;The Northern California-based rocket firm’s “3.2” launch vehicle &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178110/astra-small-satellite-launcher-rocket-3-2-alaska-success-orbit"&gt;blasted to space for the first time&lt;/a&gt; in December from its Kodiak, Alaska launch site, a key test mission that “far exceeded our team’s expectations,” Astra CEO Chris Kemp told reporters at the time. The launch demo, though just barely missing orbit, propelled Astra into a small group of firms that have reached space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EpB8k5"&gt;The company has 50 customer launches lined up, and over $150 million of contracted launch revenue so far. Now, Astra is merging with special purpose acquisition company (or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;SPAC&lt;/a&gt;) Holicity Inc. to take its launch business public in a deal that would value Astra at $2.1 billion. Astra’s ticker will be ASTR when the deal closes in the second quarter of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H6QQDM"&gt;Kemp, NASA’s former chief technology officer, said the merger and public filing unlocks a new stage for the company: “over the next 2-3 years, we will dramatically increase our launch schedule with a goal of daily launches by 2025,” he tweeted Tuesday. It also marks “a step closer to our mission of improving life on Earth from space by fully funding our plan to provide daily access to low Earth orbit from anywhere on the planet.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RnY1H8"&gt;The SPAC merger teams Kemp’s Astra up with billionaire Holicity CEO Craig McCaw, who’s expected to join the company’s board of directors. It also allows Astra to tap into $500 million in cash after the deal closes. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>One day, your home could be made with mushrooms</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/msHNwwtYUC8qxe3b9hFrsCVSwV0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68756421/Article.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K1g3P1"&gt;Mushrooms are helping architects and engineers solve one the world’s biggest crises: climate change. These fungi are durable, biodegradable, and are proving to be a good alternative to more polluting materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7vCb1I"&gt;“Our built environment needs these kinds of materials,” says David Benjamin, founding principal architect at the firm The Living. “Different countries have really ambitious climate change goals, and this material could really help jump-start some of that progress.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KShs5G"&gt;&lt;q&gt;”Our built environment needs these kinds of materials.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6joEzO"&gt;Building materials and construction make up about a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22178481/buildings-greenhouse-gas-emissions-climate-change-united-nations-report"&gt;tenth&lt;/a&gt; of global carbon dioxide emissions. That’s way more than the global &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-shipping-environment-imo/shippings-share-of-global-carbon-emissions-increases-idUSKCN2502AY"&gt;shipping&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.iata.org/en/programs/environment/climate-change/"&gt;aviation&lt;/a&gt; industries combined. And the problem is getting worse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U9dn7c"&gt;Materials made with mycelium, the fungal network from which mushrooms grow, might be able to help turn that around. They produce far less planet-heating carbon dioxide than traditional materials like &lt;a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-why-cement-emissions-matter-for-climate-change"&gt;cement&lt;/a&gt;. An added bonus is that mushrooms are biodegradable, so they leave behind less harmful waste than traditional building materials. Mushrooms can even help with clean-up efforts, feeding off things that might have otherwise ended up in a landfill, like sawdust or agricultural waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SKfnnI"&gt;Construction materials made from mushrooms are still in pretty early stages of research and development. But they’re showing potential as an insulation material and even as a replacement for concrete blocks. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke with some of the people leading the mushroom revolution. We even made our own mushroom brick and put it to the test. Check out the video above to see how well mushrooms performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D94LW2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="qhBZRj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like most recent events, the 2021 edition of the Sundance Film Festival has shifted from an in-person showcase to a virtual one. Despite the change, we’ll still be bringing you reviews on the most interesting experiences we find, from indie films to VR experiments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ApHo1Q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pink Cloud &lt;/em&gt;starts with a message that underlines the distressing ludicrousness of where we are: it’s a movie about people stuck in a never-ending quarantine because of a deadly threat outside their doors. It’s also an early prescient one, as it was written in 2017 and filmed in 2019. It has no purposeful connections to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it’s impossible not to draw parallels between &lt;em&gt;The Pink Cloud &lt;/em&gt;and our current reality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hI82Fn"&gt;The movie is set in a Brazilian city where a mysterious pink gaseous cloud hovers over residents and kills people if they’re outside for longer than 10 seconds, trapping them in whatever building they’ve found shelter in for years at a time. That said, &lt;em&gt;The Pink Cloud &lt;/em&gt;is less about the deadliness of their situation and more about the devastating monotony that follows. Quarantine is seen through a relationship between Giovana (&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1056455/?ref_=tt_cl_t1"&gt;Renata de Lélis&lt;/a&gt;) and Yago (Eduardo Mendonça), a one-night stand that turns into something much longer-term when they’re forced to move in together. Over the course of the next several years, Giovana and Yago navigate becoming a couple, having a child, separating without leaving the apartment, virtually dating, and getting back together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0JAByW"&gt;It’s the quiet moments that are &lt;em&gt;The Pink Cloud&lt;/em&gt;’s most powerful. FaceTime calls become tedious, eating the same thing day in and day out becomes a drag, and the only other person in people’s lives starts to grate on every nerve. We aren’t meant to suddenly stop physical contact with the rest of the world, and the cataclysmic effects of being cut off from everyone and anyone is quietly destructive. Life seems to suddenly speed up and slow down all at once. Giovana goes from being staunchly against children to having one, waiting for the lethal cloud to go away while settling into domestic routines because there’s no other way to live. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pink Cloud&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9TeUzI"&gt;At the center of it is the internal battle between the never-ending hope things will get better and the sinking realization there’s no end in sight. People switch careers to find something they can do at home, learn new skills, watch way too much TV, play too many games, find virtual boyfriends and girlfriends, and go to school at home. Children are born into the void knowing nothing about the outside world other than what they can see from their windows. Adults who remember life pre-cloud dream of getting back to the world they once knew while working to make their new living conditions the best they can. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XpcjYR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pink Cloud &lt;/em&gt;is supposed to be a science fiction story, a dystopian world that quietly asks, “How would you cope in this situation?” Watching the movie in 2021, the answer is obvious: I don’t have to wonder how I’d cope, I know exactly how I’ve dealt with not being able to see family members or certain friends for nearly a year. But even with the “fiction” aspect of &lt;em&gt;The Pink Cloud&lt;/em&gt;’s science fiction setting removed, the movie still hit home the hardest part of Giovana and Yago’s ordeal, one that I’m still struggling with and I’m sure millions of other people are, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8SEJGY"&gt;When does it all end? How much optimism can someone have that eventually the pandemic — the pink cloud — will just disappear and life will return to normal? What does return to normal even &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt;? At a time when I’ve turned to movies to try to escape or find answers to problems that I have no control over, &lt;em&gt;The Pink Cloud &lt;/em&gt;is a reminder of our daily life these past 300 or so days, and it provides no immediate answer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="573Da5"&gt;Turns out, &lt;em&gt;The Pink Cloud &lt;/em&gt;was exactly the movie that I needed. I devoured watching this couple struggle with the same internal battle of hope and acceptance, desires and settling, fond memories of the before time and preparation for what comes next. &lt;em&gt;The Pink Cloud&lt;/em&gt;, a movie written some 1,100 days before the pandemic, ironically became a way for me to process so much of what happened in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Logitech made so much money during the pandemic it could afford this Super Bowl ad</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j0ahpX5ownS9XFSHDqbjn_9SNc0=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68756342/DefyLogic_Nas.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Logitech&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hSyoBY"&gt;Logitech sold enough keyboards, mice, and PC webcams during the pandemic that it can afford its first-ever Super Bowl commercial. The 60-second spot, titled “Defy Logic,” will air during the first quarter of the game on February 7th and feature rapper and songwriter Lil Nas X. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="srXqLv"&gt;The documentary-style ad spotlights how artists and other creative types use Logitech products for their work. It shows Lil Nas X writing and recording a song, along with graphic and visual artists; streamers; musicians; and climate, gender equality, and education reform activists demonstrating their Logitech items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Tz55x"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ChIDLM"&gt;In May, Logitech reported &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-logitech-results/logitech-sales-surge-as-working-from-home-boosts-demand-idUSKBN22O06A?feedType=RSS&amp;amp;feedName=technologyNews"&gt;sales of its products&lt;/a&gt; were booming as the pandemic kept millions of people working and schooling from home. Sales of its video collaboration products — which include cameras, microphones, and software used in online meetings — increased by 60 percent year over year, with accessories like tablets and webcams seeing double-digit growth. The company reported sales were up 13.6 percent in the three months ending March 31st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SZyBBm"&gt;Earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://s1.q4cdn.com/104539020/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/Logitech-F3Q21-Prepared-Remarks.pdf"&gt;Logitech reported its third-quarter sales&lt;/a&gt; were up 85 percent year over year to $1.67 billion, with sales of PC webcams more than quadrupling to $132 million, and sales of its video collaboration products more than tripling to a record $293 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FbTbkx"&gt;Logitech didn’t say how much it paid for the Super Bowl commercial, but &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/cbs-has-sold-virtually-all-of-its-commercial-time-for-the-super-bowl.html"&gt;30-second spots are going for a reported $5.5 million&lt;/a&gt;. The company says it plans to air a 30-second version of its Defy Logic ad during the Grammy Awards in March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R7VRHc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Goro Miyazaki on what makes a Studio Ghibli film: ‘I wish somebody could give me an answer’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Animation director Goro Miyazaki, son of famous Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki, is photographed i" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9QjyQvnWPgxeit0O5ocVJpJN994=/0x1:2933x1956/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68756300/566022025.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The famed animation studio returns with its first 3D CG movie, Earwig and the Witch&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="H5ucNc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Earwig and the Witch&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t look like a Studio Ghibli film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ISTuDQ"&gt;It’s the famed studio’s first foray into CG animation, and it’s a big departure from lush, hand-drawn films like &lt;em&gt;Spirited Away&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;My Neighbor Totoro&lt;/em&gt;. It’s also Ghibli’s first animated film since 2014’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/22/8643009/when-marnie-was-there-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;When Marnie Was There&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zkkPWX"&gt;That’s a big task to take on, and leading the charge is director Goro Miyazaki, son of studio co-founder Hayao Miyazaki. After reluctantly following his father into animation — Goro originally spent years working as a landscape designer — this is his third film, following &lt;em&gt;Tales from Earthsea&lt;/em&gt;, a controversial adaptation of Ursula K. Le Guin’s classic novels, and the charming period piece &lt;em&gt;From Up on Poppy Hill&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jCl1OY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Earwig &lt;/em&gt;is based on the novel of the same name by Diana Wynne Jones, and it follows a precocious young girl who has been adopted by a witch who quickly puts her to work. It may not have the visual style of a classic Ghibli film, but it touches on many of the elements of whimsy and fantasy that have made the studio’s works so beloved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="eMMlSO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s very challenging, is all I can say.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s8PVCF"&gt;Miyazaki says that production of the film wrapped up last year, just before the Japanese government called for a state of emergency, so it wasn’t impacted much. “We were very fortunate in that way with this film,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. That said, he’s no stranger to troubled productions: during the creation of &lt;em&gt;Poppy Hill&lt;/em&gt;, Japan was struck by a massive earthquake, and the team had to work around rolling blackouts. “There was still hope and positivity,” he says of that time. “But now with the current situation, there’s so much uncertainty. It’s very challenging, is all I can say.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xuEgyg"&gt;The new film debuted on television in Japan in December, and it’ll be out on HBO Max in the US on February 5th. (It’ll also be playing in select theaters starting February 3rd.) Ahead of &lt;em&gt;Earwig and the Witch&lt;/em&gt;’s English debut, I had the chance to talk to Miyazaki about his career so far, the shift to CG, and the existential question of what a Studio Ghibli film actually is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TRZxjR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VCJW4s"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All three of your films are very different in terms of story and style. How do you decide what projects to work on?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zAUSDl"&gt;It mostly comes out of my conversations with our producer, Toshio Suzuki, rather than the decision being solely mine. Through the conversations I have with him, he will maybe suggest something: “Do you want to do an adaptation of this story or that story?” And then if I feel like it’s something that I can do, then it becomes a project that I take on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="82Prtb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was it about &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earwig and the Witch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; in particular that spoke to you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kyYiKi"&gt;One of the things that I loved about the story was the protagonist Earwig not being your typical well-behaved girl. When it’s necessary, she can be manipulative of people around her, and when somebody treats her bad, she thinks of how she can get back at them. It’s not your typical heroine from a lot of Japanese animation where they’re very honest, pure, and beautiful. Earwig is very different from that. When she faces a difficult situation, she is not someone who would just persevere and wait until somebody saves her. She’s the one that actually acts and tries to change the situation herself. So that I found was very interesting for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="v5PyvB"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lk5YWIbwzRE?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4tXmwQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did the visual style come about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wGVRH0"&gt;In terms of the visuals, this being the first 3D CG anime from Studio Ghibli… Studio Ghibli has always done hand-drawn-style animation, so we knew that we weren’t able to recreate that through 3D CG, so it was a matter of which direction we wanted to go with. Whether it’s going to be a very photorealistic visual, or trying to find a different path. That was when I referenced stop-motion animation, using a lot of puppets. I felt that was quite fitting for what we were trying to do with this project. I referenced that a lot in creating the visuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KIbKY8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I read that because so few people at Ghibli understood 3D animation, you were given pretty free rein on this project. Is that true?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1kuYts"&gt;It is true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vwyp3M"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does CG offer compared to hand-drawn animation in terms of what you can do and how you can express yourself?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DBOoGJ"&gt;One of the things I found was that with hand-drawn animation, you have to rely on the hands of a very talented animator to bring out a great performance from the character with facial expressions, emotions, and so forth. There’s a limited number of very talented animators that can do so. That’s one of the big challenges with hand-drawn animation. But with 3D CG, you’re able to have different people working on different expressions of one character, which worked well for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gIo9FC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the things that struck me about the movie was so much of it took place in a single location. Was this a conscious decision?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YxLklb"&gt;The original story is about the girl being confined in that house, and dealing with the witch she lives with. However, what we did was, because there are limited locations, we wanted to make sure that each set was high quality, that it was very rich in details. If you think about trying to recreate that with hand-drawn animation, the art department would go crazy because it would mean they would have to redraw all of that clutter and small details a million times. In that sense, the 3D CG approach really worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="yRaPfi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It was like me hiding in the garage without people noticing what I was doing.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eZKJ4h"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Since this is Ghibli’s first CG film, and also the first new film from the studio in years, did you feel any extra pressure compared to your previous projects?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JSXjXA"&gt;Not really, not much pressure. Because by the time I started working on this film, &lt;em&gt;Earwig and the Witch&lt;/em&gt;, Hayao Miyazaki had already started working on his new film [&lt;em&gt;How Do You Live?&lt;/em&gt;]. So I was able to kind of hide behind that and not feel much pressure from the outside. It was like me hiding in the garage without people noticing what I was doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mKdT2N"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you take out the hand-drawn aspect, what do you think are the elements that make a film a Ghibli film?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LXphnH"&gt;That question is kind of a puzzle. What makes a film a Ghibli film? People who have seen &lt;em&gt;Earwig and the Witch&lt;/em&gt; will tell me “It’s actually more Ghibli than I expected.” And I wonder why they say that. I wish somebody could give me an answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XrB0cD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So is it like a feeling? You know it when you see it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="COdhHA"&gt;Probably so. Someone told me that maybe it’s just something in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uXK7aB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now that you’ve directed three films, how do you think you’ve grown or changed as a director?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="URwvgY"&gt;With each project, I feel like I’m doing something for the first time, so it’s hard to tell whether I’m growing or not. After working on this film, I feel that I like things that are lighter, with humor, and not too serious. And with humor, I really like the dry humor that you can see in Diana Wynne Jones’ story.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cheaters are ruining Call of Duty: Warzone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1cKaS7fIVGRauEkw_iNTqn5KszA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68756227/acastro_300505_4008_pcGameHacks_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6GyziK"&gt;Cheaters in &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt; are ruining the game and forcing professional players to abandon it. Game hacks and cheat software are being widely used in the battle royale hit, and it has left the community of millions of players feeling frustrated with the lack of attention from publisher Activision and developer Infinity Ward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZCnEOA"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21246229/pc-gaming-cheating-aimbots-wallhacks-hacking-tools-developer-response-problem"&gt;Cheating in some of the world’s top PC games has been getting worse&lt;/a&gt; over the past year, and aimbots and wallhacks are now increasingly common in the industry’s most competitive shooters. Aimbots automatically lock onto opponents’ heads, making it easy to wipe out waves of players. Wallhacks expose everyone on a map, so cheaters get a huge advantage by knowing where their opponents are at all times. In battle royale games, which ask players to spend sometimes between 20 to 30 minutes playing a single match, losing to a cheater can be especially frustrating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="4wDPrO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The world’s biggest PC games are fighting a new surge of cheaters and hackers","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21246229/pc-gaming-cheating-aimbots-wallhacks-hacking-tools-developer-response-problem"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="OnzwLQ"&gt;Cheating has reached a breaking point for some who primarily play &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt;. YouTuber Vikkstar123 &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/T7Lhin677Qs"&gt;quit the game last week&lt;/a&gt;, after a cheater was blatantly using wallhacks and aimbots and streaming to Facebook Gaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mvNvoY"&gt;The cheater was even part of Facebook’s Level Up program, so they were able to freely stream game cheats and actually make money doing so. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Slasher/status/1356390971982934016"&gt;Facebook has now demonetized the cheater&lt;/a&gt;. But since the company did not ban them, the streamer continued with blatant wallhacks enabled just hours ago.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kHEv3YAz97XlPvvpf_bIlzl1GEo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22275394/W7mBmk0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A cheater streaming live on Facebook Gaming.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MkZ875"&gt;Vikkstar isn’t alone in his frustrations. A $250,000 &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt; tournament was &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-01-22-usd250-000-call-of-duty-warzone-tournament-rocked-by-accusations-of-cheating"&gt;rocked by accusations of cheating last month&lt;/a&gt;, when rival high-profile players accused a Canadian player of using an aimbot, which the player denied. It led to a situation where a member of the esports organization 100 Thieves searched through the computer of the accused player live on Twitch, in an attempt to find cheating software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FWop3K"&gt;Prominent &lt;em&gt;Warzone &lt;/em&gt;players &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NICKMERCS/status/1352430270293692416"&gt;Nickmercs&lt;/a&gt; and YouTuber &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Drift0r/status/1352448721284427776"&gt;Drift0r&lt;/a&gt; have also both been highly vocal about the rise of cheating in &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt;. This latest round of outcries follows months of issues with hacking in the game, where players have regularly spotted people using aimbots and wallhacks and sharing clips on Reddit and TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AUsLHM"&gt;The response from Activision and Infinity Ward has lacked urgency. Activision made it clear it has “zero tolerance” for cheaters in &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://blog.activision.com/uk/en/call-of-duty/2020-03/Cheaters-Not-Welcomed-in-Call-of-Duty-Warzone"&gt;nearly a year ago&lt;/a&gt;, when it moved to ban thousands of players. By October, Infinity Ward revealed it had &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/InfinityWard/status/1311471137663021056"&gt;banned more than 200,000 accounts&lt;/a&gt; for cheating across &lt;em&gt;Warzone &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Modern Warfare&lt;/em&gt;. There’s a vague promise of “additional security updates and added backend enforcement tools,” but many players feel there isn’t enough being done to combat the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="azBUh8"&gt;Cheating isn’t a problem that’s unique to &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt;. Popular games like &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21246229/pc-gaming-cheating-aimbots-wallhacks-hacking-tools-developer-response-problem"&gt;many other titles have been experiencing high levels of cheating recently&lt;/a&gt;. People are even cheating in games like &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;, where aimbots aren’t exactly necessary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="edxjbh"&gt;It might seem like this cheating surge is limited to PC gaming, but it also extends to game consoles. Cheaters can purchase specially modded controllers to get an edge in games, improving aim assist, gun recoil, and more. CronusMAX is popular across both PlayStation and Xbox, and it allows players to run millions of scripts, mods, exploits, and macros to automate and improve gameplay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kQvYdU"&gt;The biggest problem the industry faces is tackling this collectively. There are a variety of anti-cheat solutions being used by various game developers, but it’s a cat-and-mouse game against the hackers developing the cheats. It’s very much like the malware industry, and game developers have to be on top of detecting new cheats with a sense of urgency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E39ClO"&gt;Game developers are often too slow to respond to blatant cheating, or don’t do enough to communicate with the communities frustrated most by the cheating issues. With hackers able to generate huge sums from selling cheats, it increasingly looks like a problem that will get worse before it gets any better.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft planning special gaming, cloud, and Windows events in coming months</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CArypR"&gt;Microsoft is planning a series of news events over the coming months that will focus on categories like gaming, cloud, and Windows. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has learned that Microsoft is dedicating time to particular categories at a time when the pandemic has halted in-person events. Microsoft’s first event will take place later this week, focusing on what’s next for work and Microsoft 365.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iMidl0"&gt;The company is planning similar events that focus on what’s next for its cloud ambitions, as well as gaming, Windows, and security in the coming months. Microsoft typically discusses a broad range of its products at events like Ignite or Build, and this will continue, but these separate events are designed to highlight what its product changes mean for entire categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sx8BA6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Watch &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/satyanadella?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@SatyaNadella&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jared_spataro?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Jared_Spataro&lt;/a&gt; discuss ways to transform the employee experience. Save the date for our digital event. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/EmployeeExperience?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#EmployeeExperience&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/LV5KjcwBPF"&gt;https://t.co/LV5KjcwBPF&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/uHHbQlFdcX"&gt;pic.twitter.com/uHHbQlFdcX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Microsoft 365 (@Microsoft365) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Microsoft365/status/1354836654050193409?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pK0awF"&gt;The Windows event will likely focus on Microsoft’s “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212817/microsoft-windows-10-visual-changes-update-sun-valley-2021"&gt;sweeping visual rejuvenation&lt;/a&gt;” of the operating system, which is currently codenamed “Sun Valley,” and the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230554/microsoft-windows-10x-leak-chrome-os-chromebooks-hands-on"&gt;Windows 10X efforts&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft is putting a larger effort into overhauling the UI of Windows this year, with visual changes planned to improve the consistency of the OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LcyRrt"&gt;Microsoft also has big plans for gaming in general throughout 2021, especially with its Xbox Game Pass and xCloud work. Microsoft’s dedicated gaming event will likely focus on the company’s plans to expand xCloud and its gaming efforts, in a year that will see a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/5/21208583/e3-2021-june-coronavirus"&gt;“reimagined” E3 take place&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="30Ufv1"&gt;This entire approach to news events from Microsoft is different from previous years. It’s taking place during a year where many people continue to work and even study remotely. The pandemic has reshaped entire industries, and it will likely fuel many of Microsoft’s announcements across 2021. If the events are a success, it could even shape how Microsoft plans its news announcements for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
