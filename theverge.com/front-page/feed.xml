    <title>FCC approves $7 billion to get better equipment to remote learners</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Emergency Connectivity Fund Program helps schools and libraries outfit students and patrons with remote learning equipment&lt;/em&gt; | Illustrator by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UOGsUE"&gt;The FCC has &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-launch-717-billion-connectivity-fund-program-0"&gt;approved $7.17 billion in funding&lt;/a&gt; to help students, school staff, and library patrons access hotspots and connected devices to use at home. The Emergency Connectivity Fund Program will allow schools and libraries to purchase equipment to be used off-site — and to get reimbursement for equipment already purchased to address remote learning needs during the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ynGuhS"&gt;The new fund will use processes already in use by the E-Rate program, which currently helps schools and libraries pay for broadband internet. Qualifying schools and libraries will be able to purchase hotspots, routers, tablets, and computers, among other devices necessary for remote learning (though smartphones don’t qualify). Students and patrons can take them home and use them, rather than &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/31/us/taco-bell-california-students-wifi-trnd/index.html"&gt;huddle outside of a Taco Bell&lt;/a&gt; in order to finish their homework. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Bq0fP3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;9 million public school students live in homes lacking both adequate internet access and a suitable device for remote learning&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WoLsK9"&gt;This well-known “homework gap” that has seen millions of kids struggle to participate in remote learning is an issue that FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel is keen to address. Since the very beginning of the pandemic, she has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21183589/fcc-commissioner-jessica-rosenworcel-homework-gap-editorial-wifi-hotspots-coronavirus"&gt;called on the FCC&lt;/a&gt; to help schools and libraries get hold of equipment sorely needed in many homes across the country — the FCC quotes a study from last spring that found about nine million public school students live in homes lacking both adequate internet access and a suitable device for remote learning. With this new funding and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302807/fcc-internet-subsidies-authorized-low-income-broadband"&gt;Emergency Broadband Benefit Program&lt;/a&gt; already underway, there may be a bit of relief in sight for these households.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic v. Apple keeps coming back to the gap between ignorance and inconvenience</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/58SAFjI73j_WHaXt4TY_U6lokRM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69272119/vpavic_180607_2652_0053.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LSZxry"&gt;Last week, the judge in &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple &lt;/em&gt;asked whether Epic really had an antitrust case against Apple, or whether it just wanted to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419894/apple-epic-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-trial-day-2"&gt;help kids make impulse purchases&lt;/a&gt;. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers was talking about the importance of where and how&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;people pay for their apps, and today she continued that line of questioning to the point of suggesting a kind of App Store policy change that Epic never originally put on the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwAZu0"&gt;Epic sued Apple for banning &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; from iOS over a direct payment system for V-Bucks, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; in-game currency. Epic called that unfair and monopolistic. But Apple argued that it lets developers sell in-app purchases through its Safari browser, even at a discounted price — so there’s no lockout. And while Epic itself has focused on explaining &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22421912/iphone-web-app-pwa-cloud-gaming-epic-v-apple-safari"&gt;why web apps aren’t a good substitute for native ones&lt;/a&gt;, its expert witness David Evans brought up another major issue: anti-steering rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zkfpT"&gt;Anti-steering rules (in this context) &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_2093"&gt;refer to rules that ban&lt;/a&gt; developers from pointing users outside of Apple’s ecosystem. iOS developers can’t add links or references telling people to get a better deal on their website, or send emails to accounts created through Apple. Android has these rules too, but it &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/09/google-announces-crackdown-on-in-app-billing-aimed-at-netflix-and-spotify/"&gt;delayed a serious crackdown&lt;/a&gt; on them until this fall — and since you can install third-party stores and sideload apps on Android, developers in Google’s ecosystem have more options in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AhA7LQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An Epic witness compared app makers to moonlighting Uber drivers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FNqBnD"&gt;Evans, an economist, was originally trying to explain in-app purchases by comparing Apple to a ride-hailing app like Uber, comparing an app developer to a Uber driver who had struck up a good relationship with a customer. The customer wanted to start directly hiring the driver, but the ride-hailing company (representing Apple) demanded that the customer keep paying through its app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kqngEz"&gt;Judge Rogers didn’t appear convinced. Buying V-Bucks through a browser, she noted, seemed a lot like a passenger directly paying a driver. “There’s nothing about that distribution process that impacted differently given your Uber example.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nExCIp"&gt;Evans basically responded that in this analogy, cab drivers can’t even do the equivalent of giving passengers their phone numbers. “Epic is not able to message the iOS app user and tell them ‘You can go to the web and get this more cheaply.’ Or ‘I really encourage you to go to the web and get V-Bucks there,’” Evans objected. The problem, he said, was the combination of requiring Epic to use Apple payment processing, plus a “whole set of barriers” that make it harder to tell users they have an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gml1aD"&gt;These anti-steering provisions have come up in the trial before — yoga app maker Yoga Buddhi complained about them last week. But this time, Rogers offered an obvious followup question. If there was no anti-steering provision, she asked, would Epic still have a problem with Apple’s system? “The customer could choose whether they wanted to stay and make the purchase on the app or do it some other way, right?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3U1sKW"&gt;Evans admitted that nixing the anti-steering provisions “wouldn’t eliminate the market power that Apple has here, but it would certainly diminish it.” He said it would be more helpful for some apps than others — it’s pretty good for subscription-based companies that have a separate website, for instance, and less useful for mobile-only games that rely on a stream of microtransactions. But he acknowledged he hadn’t conducted a specific study of the topic, so he wasn’t sure exactly &lt;em&gt;how &lt;/em&gt;big the issue would still be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RixG0U"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Consumers do get klutzy and disconnected”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rfvFm6"&gt;Later in the day, economist Susan Athey raised a different issue with App Store exclusivity. The App Store lets users sign up for subscriptions, but if they switch to an Android phone, they have to either cancel their subscription or keep managing it through Apple. Athey was using this to explain why a third-party app store would be useful, should Apple ever allow one to exist — if you could access the same purchase from both big phone platforms, the same way you can get your old iOS apps on a new iPhone, switching devices could become much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Okte7i"&gt;But Rogers suggested again that if developers could just tell people to sign up through the web, “then there wouldn’t really be the same kind of need for the kind of cross-platform app store that you’re talking about.” After all, services like Netflix already direct people to sign up through their websites — Apple and Google just really don’t like it, and they try to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421734/apple-epic-netflix-in-app-purchase-removal-emails"&gt;discourage the practice&lt;/a&gt; without an actual ban. Similar to Evans, Athey conceded that there’d be a “big benefit” in letting app makers “alert people to the most efficient way to pay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dVwlre"&gt;Athey argued that “consumers do get klutzy and disconnected and sensitive to delays when trying to complete that type of activity,” and telling people to go use a web browser doesn’t solve that problem. But Rogers could easily decide that inconvenience and enforced ignorance are separate issues, and that only the latter is a serious antitrust concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CXDmwY"&gt;Getting rid of anti-steering provisions would be a comparatively small win for Epic, which wants to put full-fledged third-party App Stores on iOS. But it’s a smartphone ecosystem feature that’s often overshadowed by bigger antitrust complaints — and &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; is putting it under the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CryptoPunks NFTs sell at Christie’s for $16.9 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The collection features nine portraits, including one alien." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DaxVZ9VubSNQlZm3KU5zEjKQqjY=/34x0:1017x655/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69272050/cryptopunks_9_punks_larva_labs_nfts_at_christies_new_rvs_0409.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Nine CryptoPunks sold together at Christie’s. | Image: Christie’s / Larva Labs&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DRCany"&gt;Another huge NFT sale was made at Christie’s tonight: &lt;a href="https://www.christies.com/lot/lot-larva-labs-est-2005-9-cryptopunks-2-6316969/?from=salesummary&amp;amp;intObjectID=6316969"&gt;a collection of nine CryptoPunks&lt;/a&gt; was purchased for $16.9 million. It’s likely the second-largest NFT purchases ever made, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;behind Beeple’s $69 million sale&lt;/a&gt; in March (though with the notable caveat that this sale included nine separate works).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hz4c1J"&gt;CryptoPunks were one of the earliest NFT projects, and they’ve become increasingly valuable as collector’s items. The project, created by Larva Labs in 2017, offered 10,000 small pixel-art portraits of people, zombies, aliens, and apes. Each one was algorithmically generated and features different attributes, like their hairstyle, glasses, or hat. Some traits are rarer than others, and those tend to make for more valuable CryptoPunks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="nBiUpY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"NFTs, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="mycFZe"&gt;This sale of nine CryptoPunks comes from Larva Labs itself. The group initially kept 1,000 of the NFTs for themselves and gave away the rest. The bundle of nine includes one CryptoPunk with a particularly rare trait: &lt;em&gt;CryptoPunk 635&lt;/em&gt;, the one with the blue face and sunglasses, is one of just nine “alien” punks in the entire series. Another of the nine sold, &lt;em&gt;CryptoPunk 2&lt;/em&gt;, the one with wild black hair that looks a bit like a heart, has the distinction of being number two out of a 10,000-work series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xpIkww"&gt;CryptoPunks have soared in popularity since NFTs started blowing up in February. Two alien punks sold in March for more than $7.5 million each. Another seven have sold for more than $1 million, all just in the past few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pdNagM"&gt;This is Christie’s second huge NFT sale. The auction house &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;sold a Beeple NFT for $69 million&lt;/a&gt; in March, marking a high point for the NFT market. An NFT by Emily Ratajkowski &lt;a href="https://www.christies.com/lot/lot--6317722/"&gt;will go up for auction&lt;/a&gt; at Christie’s later this week.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The T-Mobile / Sprint merger hasn’t created jobs — it’s ended them</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q0jsesPQ0YdAAwvd6TmSd7bniQg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69271585/acasatro_180430_1777_sprint_Tmobile_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="84BbK6"&gt;T-Mobile promised its $26 billion merger with Sprint would add new jobs to the economy literally every single day, but a report from &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/t-mobiles-hiring-pledge-is-off-to-a-slow-start-11620639002"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;confirms the newly combined company actually employs fewer people now than it did before the merger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HkS7F9"&gt;Here’s how specific &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fun-carrier%2Fnew-t-mobile-creating-jobs&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F11%2F22429587%2Ft-mobile-sprint-merge-jobs-promise-pandemic" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile’s promise was&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="NkdxSM"&gt;So, let me be really clear on this increasingly important topic. &lt;strong&gt;This merger is all about creating new, high-quality, high-paying jobs, and the New T-Mobile will be jobs-positive from Day One and every day thereafter.&lt;/strong&gt; That’s not just a promise. That’s not just a commitment. It’s a fact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ny04YG"&gt;“Jobs-positive” would not be how I’d describe T-Mobile’s employment practices. The company employed 5,000 fewer people by the end of 2020 than it did before the merger, the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; writes. And before you blame the COVID-19 pandemic, you should know that  wireless executives who spoke to &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; said that shrinking the number of jobs was always part of the plan — the pandemic just sped up planned &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/22/coronavirus-retail-workforce-faces-permanent-decline.html"&gt;job loss on the retail side&lt;/a&gt; of T-Mobile’s business. In fact, T-Mobile &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21293293/tmobile-sprint-merger-layoffs-hundreds-biso-jobs-cut"&gt;laid off hundreds&lt;/a&gt; of Sprint’s inside sales team just a few months after its merger was completed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BqaabC"&gt;In addition to the “jobs-positive from day one and every day thereafter” claim, which now appears to have been a blatant lie, T-Mobile also specifically promised it would add 11,000 jobs by 2024. Instead, it appears to be moving in the opposite direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EYQ9p5"&gt;We were warned this would happen. &lt;a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-sprint-t-mobile-merger-jobs-20171010-story.html"&gt;Wall Street analysts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/sprint-t-mobile-merger-could-lead-thousands-job-losses-despite-n1134956"&gt;labor unions&lt;/a&gt; both predicted anywhere between 24,000 to 30,000 jobs could be lost if T-Mobile and Sprint got what they wanted. Telecom industry watcher Karl Bode wrote multiple articles for &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;highlighting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18634195/t-mobile-sprint-merger-conditions-access-coverage"&gt;how meaningless&lt;/a&gt; the merger promises looked, comparing to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20962739/t-mobile-sprint-nextel-merger-prices-rural-coverage-promises"&gt;Sprint’s own history&lt;/a&gt; of post-merger layoffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v096vD"&gt;For some context, when Sprint was given the go-ahead to merge with Nextel in 2005, it made its own claims about how great its merger would be for the economy. Bode writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Lg96K1"&gt;Government filings had promised the FCC that the deal would “generate economic growth and jobs in the United States.” Then-Sprint CEO Gary Forsee told media outlets in 2005 that employees “shouldn’t expect to see a headline that there’s thousands of jobs that are going to be cut on the first of November or any time along the way.” By the end, more than 8,000 employees would lose their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OTOPMm"&gt;Sounds familiar, doesn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xre29K"&gt;T-Mobile’s other merger obligations, like helping Dish become a viable fourth carrier option, also seem like they might just be talk. Dish CEO Charlie Ergen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364126/boost-mobile-3g-cdma-t-mobile-shutdown-customers-costs"&gt;recently told the FCC&lt;/a&gt; that if T-Mobile moves forward with its plans to shut down its older 3G CDMA network, Dish’s Boost Mobile customers (who rely on Sprint’s network for service) would be greatly harmed. Ergen stresses that for customers who need the less expensive phone plans Boost provides, upgrading to a 4G or 5G-capable phone isn’t a small expense — it could force some people to go without.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="AeidX3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Dish chairman calls T-Mobile the ‘Grinch’ for going back on merger promises","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409800/dish-charlie-ergen-t-mobile-cdma-shutdown-grinch"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5zarQA"&gt;As far as jobs are concerned, current T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert does tell the J&lt;em&gt;ournal&lt;/em&gt; that the company plans to fill 6,000 open positions as the world recovers from the pandemic. That might possibly bring T-Mobile/Sprint back up to its pre-merger numbers, but it’s now even harder to believe the company will add an additional 11,000 jobs by 2024. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8H9k0m"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung and Lenovo are the latest to ditch a physical Mobile World Congress</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZLp3y9"&gt;Samsung and Lenovo representatives won’t show up in person to Mobile World Congress in Barcelona this year, according to statements obtained &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/samsung-will-attend-barcelonas-world-mobile-congress-remotely-la-vanguardia-2021-05-11/"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Verge,&lt;/em&gt; respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OSEF82"&gt;Samsung says it has “made the decision to withdraw from exhibiting in-person” and will instead attend remotely to prioritize the health and safety of its customers and employees.  A Lenovo spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company will attend virtually instead of in person and that it informed the GSM Association, which organizes the event, about its plans on Friday. Neither company has announced what its remote presence will look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pMKwuD"&gt;The in-person event is still scheduled to happen in June, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287802/mwc-event-barcelona-testing-masks-vaccines"&gt;despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; and difficulties with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421558/us-covid-coronavirus-vaccines-patent-waiver"&gt;vaccination availability outside the US&lt;/a&gt;. The GSMA also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/5/21123846/mobile-world-congress-gsma-coronavirus-lg"&gt;fought against shutting down last year’s event&lt;/a&gt; early on in 2020 before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/10/21131118/mwc-2020-coronavirus-intel-sony-amazon-cancel"&gt;several big brands dropped out&lt;/a&gt;. This year, we’ve already seen Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360692/google-mwc-mobile-world-congress-phone-2021-nokia-ericsson"&gt;announce that it won’t be exhibiting&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to Samsung and Lenovo’s remote announcements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FY6fwj"&gt;Other notable companies have dropped out from the in-person conference as well, including &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/5g/nokia-joins-ericsson-in-bailing-on-mwc-with-oracle-sony-also-reportedly-out-/d/d-id/767983"&gt;Nokia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/ericsson-bails-mwc-barcelona-2021"&gt;Ericsson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/mwc-june-2021-barcelona-in-person-sony-nokia-ericsson-oracle-220004011.html"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.telecomtv.com/content/sustainability/what-s-up-with-oracle-mwc-orange-ofcom-5g-spectrum-apple-41023/"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ2zZY"&gt;We’ve reached out to several other large brands about their attendance plans, including ZTE, and Huawei, which haven’t responded to request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IKhKfy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 11th, 5:21PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Lenovo confirmed to The Verge that it won’t attend MWC 2021 in person. Headline and copy have been updated to reflect. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9KYNXb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 11th, 8:14PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added list of other companies that won’t be attending the conference.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>First commercial-scale offshore wind farm in the US gets federal approval</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Deepwater wind farm off Block Island, Rhode Island" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S5eZMW7zC2TxtJ0Ix994rCoxKzQ=/111x0:2079x1312/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69271108/1316070124.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Pk70yU"&gt;The first commercial-scale offshore wind project in the US just got the green light from the Biden administration. The approval has the potential to dramatically grow the nation’s wind energy sector after years of regulatory limbo for proposed offshore projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="j5J9m0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Big ambitions for offshore wind&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3g26hM"&gt;The Interior Department (DOI) granted the Vineyard Wind project permission to install up to 84 turbines off the coast of Massachusetts. Once completed, the project will be able to generate up to 800 megawatts (MW), enough electricity for 400,000 homes. That’s a dramatic scaling up of existing offshore wind capacity in the US. There are currently only two small developments off the East Coast and those can only&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;generate a combined 42 megawatts of electricity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NyAgaj"&gt;The Biden administration has big ambitions for offshore wind. It set a goal of getting 30,000 MW of energy from offshore wind by 2030. That’s part of a bigger plan to tackle climate change by reaching 100 percent clean electricity by 2035. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VWpmE4"&gt;“A clean energy future is within our grasp in the United States. The approval of this project is an important step toward advancing the Administration’s goals to create good-paying union jobs while combatting climate change and powering our nation,” Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in a &lt;a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-approves-first-major-offshore-wind-project-us-waters"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UG0UF6"&gt;Europe is already ahead of the game, with more than &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/271055/cumulative-european-offshore-wind-power-capacity-installations/#:~:text=Europe's%20cumulative%20offshore%20wind%20energy,European%20water%20bodies%20in%202006."&gt;25,000 MW&lt;/a&gt; of offshore wind capacity now. Globally, wind and solar energy are taking off&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;when it comes to electricity generation. New renewable energy capacity made up 90 percent of the global power sector’s growth in 2020 and is expected to do so again in 2021 and 2022, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430465/renewable-energy-solar-wind-iea-2020-exceptional-growth"&gt;according to a market update released today by the International Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CfKqK2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Globally, wind and solar energy are taking off&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cAPwlf"&gt;Vineyard Wind first submitted its construction and operations plan for federal approval in 2017, although plans for the project have been in the works &lt;a href="https://www.vineyardwind.com/press-releases/2021/3/8/vineyard-wind-statement-on-release-of-final-environmental-impact-statement"&gt;since 2009&lt;/a&gt;. Now that the project has been greenlit, it’s expected to be operational by 2023, according to the project’s developers, Avangrid Renewables and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bQBApe"&gt;Vineyard Wind receiving a Record of Decision from the DOI’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management is likely a good sign for more than a dozen other offshore wind projects awaiting federal approval. It’s good news for adjacent industries, too, including shipbuilding.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;There’s been a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22296979/us-offshore-ships-wind-boom-installation-vessels"&gt;“chicken and egg” situation for the offshore wind&lt;/a&gt; industry: it needs specialized vessels to construct new projects, but shipbuilders were hesitant to invest in new builds until major projects received permits to move forward. Vineyard Wind’s approval could be wind in the sails to get both industries really moving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OHfGpH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7KaZAU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Wyze Buds Pro offer ANC and wireless charging for $60</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T2THXTRXH1oDMIAotYQGkvV7NCc=/233x0:2647x1609/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69270980/Screen_Shot_2021_05_11_at_12.25.28_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Wyze&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8Rd4yA"&gt;Wyze, maker of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21726548/wyze-watch-44-47-smartwatch-price-release-date-features"&gt;$20 smartwatches&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21450637/wyze-headphones-video-doorbell-c-pricing-release-date"&gt;$30 video doorbells&lt;/a&gt;, has announced &lt;a href="https://wyze.com/wyze-buds-pro.html"&gt;a new pair of wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; that include active noise cancellation and a Qi wireless charging case for only $60 (&lt;a href="https://phandroid.com/2021/05/11/the-wyze-buds-pro-bring-active-noise-cancellation-and-alexa-for-just-60/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Phandroid&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). They’re called the Wyze Buds Pro and come in at an incredibly low price when compared to the competition: you could buy four pairs of these for the price of Apple’s AirPods Pro, which have similar features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bAdheL"&gt;For comparison: &lt;a href="https://us.soundcore.com/collections/true-wireless/products/a3902"&gt;Anker’s $60 earbuds&lt;/a&gt; come without ANC or wireless charging (instead using Micro USB, where the Wyze buds also include a USB-C port).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q41FQU"&gt;Wyze’s announcement video takes a decidedly self-aware bent, but while it does mention the sweat resistance, transparency mode, and wind noise reduction, it doesn’t mention one of the funniest things about the product’s name: it’s called “Pro,” but there aren’t any Wyze Buds non-pros to compare them against (though Wyze does &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WyzeCam/status/1392162656191016960?s=20"&gt;say a pair is coming&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3JR4r7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n3TlUy8vC98?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9CA2Mv"&gt;I may poke fun, but, on paper at least, these earbuds are competing way above their price. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22323748/anker-liberty-air-2-pro-review-wireless-headphone-price"&gt;SoundCore Liberty Air 2 Pro&lt;/a&gt; (what a name) from Anker and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Buds/dp/B085WTWYS4?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Buds second-gen from Amazon&lt;/a&gt; are both considered to be budget picks for true-wireless earbuds with ANC, and those are in the $100+ price range. Amazon charges an extra $20 for a wireless charging case for the Echo Buds, something that Wyze includes. To add insult to injury for Amazon, the Wyze Buds Pro also have Alexa built in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gtoGrW"&gt;Of course, some of the most important functions of earbuds are how they sound and whether the ANC is actually any good. Given that we haven’t actually heard them yet, these earbuds haven’t proven themselves in either category. But if they end up being good, or even passable, they’ll be a solid deal for those who want all the fancy features without having to pay top dollar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fo5qP1"&gt;The Wyze Buds Pro are currently available for preorder, and Wyze says they will start shipping in July.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram will let people list their pronouns on their profiles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ndZt73ZoRkds_D0CTxw3OLQhxBU=/62x0:3494x2288/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69270813/E1IBRk2VIAIoRO9.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CDSSxH"&gt;Instagram is making it easier to address people by their defined pronouns. The company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/instagram/status/1392176784028749824/photo/1"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that it’s allowing people to add up to four pronouns to their profile, which they can then choose to display publicly or only to their followers. (Users under 18 will have this setting turned on by default.) Instagram says people can &lt;a href="https://help.instagram.com/contact/3827467694039713"&gt;fill out a form&lt;/a&gt; to have a pronoun added, if it’s not already available, or just add it to their bio instead. Instagram says this is available in a “few countries,” but doesn’t specify further. We’ve reached out for more information and will update if we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1rfrm"&gt;A couple &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffers already have the pronouns setting available to them, suggesting it’s live in the US. You can get a better sense of the feature’s user flow in the screenshots below, courtesy of news writer Jay Peters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WENjqU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10494820"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jTSaLW"&gt;Other platforms also allow their users to add pronouns to their profiles. Dating apps, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/11/17846054/okcupid-pronoun-options"&gt;OkCupid&lt;/a&gt;, have already introduced the feature, as have other apps like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/2/18646740/lyft-pronoun-choice-app-lgbtq-pride"&gt;Lyft&lt;/a&gt;. Interestingly, Facebook &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/13/facebook-gender-identity/"&gt;allowed users&lt;/a&gt; to define their pronouns starting in 2014, although the feature limited people to “he/him, she/her, and they/them.” This appears to still be the case while Instagram will offer more options.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to get a government-paid discount on your broadband </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0VSs6-nM67vX-UDEmnm0m0TOjPY=/0x0:945x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69270446/EBB_Program_Social_Media_Post_Images_Option1_Telehealth1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gWCc31"&gt;The past year, a lot of people were laid off or otherwise unable to pay for basic necessities. So the &lt;a href="https://rules.house.gov/sites/democrats.rules.house.gov/files/BILLS-116HR133SA-RCP-116-68.pdf"&gt;stimulus package&lt;/a&gt; passed by Congress in December included a provision to pay for broadband and other basic tech for those who, because of job loss or other financial difficulties, can’t afford to pay for it on their own. And starting this week, if you qualify, you can take advantage of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kf2rdg"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://getemergencybroadband.org/"&gt;Emergency Broadband Benefit Program&lt;/a&gt; is being administered by the FCC and offers a temporary discount on monthly broadband bills — up to $50 a month (or $75 if your household is on qualifying Tribal lands). If your income qualifies, you can also get a one-time discount of up to $100 for a computer or a tablet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kgqz9D"&gt;It’s not a lot, considering how much tech costs these days, but every little bit helps. And applications for that discount will be available starting tomorrow, May 12th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GCs6Bw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There are a variety of ways you can qualify for the program&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6ji2jm"&gt;There are a variety of ways &lt;a href="https://www.lifelinesupport.org/do-i-qualify/"&gt;you can qualify for the program&lt;/a&gt;. Qualifications can include your income level (at or below 135 percent of &lt;a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/2021-poverty-guidelines"&gt;the Federal Poverty level&lt;/a&gt;), participation in a program such as SNAP or Medicaid, job loss due to the pandemic, or other criteria. You can get more information by either visiting the &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/consumer-faq-emergency-broadband-benefit"&gt;FCC website&lt;/a&gt; or by going to &lt;a href="https://getemergencybroadband.org/"&gt;getemergencybroadband.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TDFd5I"&gt;If you think you qualify, you can either &lt;a href="https://getemergencybroadband.org/"&gt;apply online&lt;/a&gt;, contact your current broadband provider to see if they are participating in the program (or &lt;a href="https://data.usac.org/publicreports/CompaniesNearMe/Download/Report"&gt;check this list for a provider near you&lt;/a&gt;), or print out and complete an application and send it to: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="kdkprs"&gt;Emergency Broadband Support Center&lt;br&gt;P.O. Box 7081&lt;br&gt;London, KY 40742.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="yZoQ0N"&gt;One warning: if you think you may qualify, don’t put off sending in the application. This is a temporary program, and you lose your benefit when the fund runs out of money, or “six months after the Department of Health and Human Services declares an end to the COVID-19 health emergency” — whichever is sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1vHraN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qVhEO5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H6QQ18"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instacart tells entry-level team to return to office, senior managers can stay home</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Sizzling U.S. Stock Markets Await Next Leg Of Record IPO Run" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BNroc8ZGpF6XO6JhBzjplr0YqVs=/0x2:4000x2669/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69270427/1230448031.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PnEVI3"&gt;Instacart is shifting to a primarily remote-first workplace, but employees say the company has arbitrarily chosen which teams have to come into the office in a way that hurts junior employees. Workers on the central operations team — which includes logistics and trust and safety — have been told they need to return to the San Francisco office three days a week starting in September and were not given a clear reason why. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OCt0jf"&gt;“To a lot of employees this policy excluding us from permanent remote work is being interpreted as ‘we trust the majority of the company to be able to work remote permanently, but not these specific employees,’” says one employee who asked to remain anonymous for fear of professional retaliation. “Considering everyone has been remote for over a year, it’s very disappointing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m0pI2d"&gt;Last week, the company announced that 70 percent of the workforce would be remote. “We asked our employees what they wanted the future of work at Instacart to look like, their response? Make it flexible,” &lt;a href="https://instacart.careers/remote/"&gt;a newly updated careers page says&lt;/a&gt;. “We know there’s no one-size-fits-all approach for how we do our best work, so we’re introducing a hybrid work environment for when it’s safe for our offices to re-open.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Am3K2H"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s not a matter of data security.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VqT6AN"&gt;Workers on central operations say they aren’t sure why they’re being required to come in. While companies like Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21497789/facebook-content-moderators-accenture-return-office-coronavirus"&gt;mandate in-office work for content moderators who handle sensitive information&lt;/a&gt;, Instacart is letting the central ops team work from home twice a week — and has allowed them to be fully remote for the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SO8JEd"&gt;In response to questions from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, an Instacart spokesperson said: “Central Operations employees often work with sensitive proprietary information and data that is managed on-site in Instacart’s offices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gXFSzU"&gt;The team, estimated to be around 100 people, includes many entry-level employees and workers who are new to the tech industry. Employees say the power imbalance makes it difficult to push back on the remote work policy. “A lot of the roles are easily replaceable,” says another worker who asked not to be named. “They can happily find someone else to fill that role if you’re not okay with the policy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cH0Ihn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Two commenters say they plan to quit if the policy doesn’t change.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EY0vuz"&gt;On the anonymous chat app Blind, one user wrote that managers on the central operations team were told to “silence the issue, when reported, rather than find a solution.” While anyone with an Instacart email address can post on Blind, the comment scared employees who worried they’d be fired if they questioned the mandate. Two commenters say they plan to quit if the policy doesn’t change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yx1dkv"&gt;An Instacart spokesperson said it has never told managers to silence the remote work issue, adding: “We always encourage employee feedback on these policies and will continue to create forums for open discussion to ensure every Instacart employee feels engaged, productive, and successful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9lKV2d"&gt;In an internal email obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, an Instacart director said in-person work was a “foundational element to professional growth, team cohesion, cross-collaboration, and sustained performance over time.” But the requirement does not apply to most other teams at the company, nor does it extend to senior managers in the central operations organization. Those employees are able to work remotely, popping into the office a “percentage of time” throughout the month, according to the internal note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5jnzdh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Twitter and Coinbase have committed to going fully remote.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1RM836"&gt;The tension between Instacart employees and management highlights the quandary that many tech companies will likely face as they begin to reopen their offices. While organizations like Twitter and Coinbase have committed to going fully remote, others are attempting a hybrid approach that will doubtless leave some workers frustrated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lluyeB"&gt;That’s partly because many tech workers have moved outside of San Francisco. Natalie Holmes, a research fellow at the California Policy Lab, &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-03-04/california-exodus-san-francisco-migration#:~:text=California-,Californians%20aren't%20leaving%20the%20state%20en%20masse%20%E2%80%94%20but%20they,from%20the%20California%20Policy%20Lab."&gt;told the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the city was experiencing “a unique and dramatic exodus” amid the coronavirus pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uPLGkQ"&gt;Instacart employees on the central operations team were already upset about having to return to in-person work three days a week when the&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2021/05/06/instacart-remote-work-new-normal-office-hq.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;San Francisco Business Times &lt;/em&gt;published an article&lt;/a&gt; last week announcing most of the company would be remote. “The article put it in perspective that we were basically the only people who would be required in the office,” the anonymous employee says. “That threw the reason of ‘cross-collaboration’ out the window, since the teams we work with won’t be there.”&lt;/p&gt;
