    <title>Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra S Pen support confirmed by FCC</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pJfOmO"&gt;An FCC listing confirms that Samsung’s S Pen stylus can be used with the company’s upcoming flagship Galaxy S21 Ultra phone. The confirmation, first &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-s-pen-1186549/"&gt;discovered by &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, comes in &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/A3LSMG998B/Test-Report/Wireless-Charging-Test-Report-5034277"&gt;a test report&lt;/a&gt; for model number SMG998B. The discovery lends clarity to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22175769/samsung-stylus-galaxy-phones-s21-foldable"&gt;recent statements&lt;/a&gt; from Samsung mobile president TM Roh, who said that some of the “most well-loved features” of the Galaxy Note will be coming to other Samsung devices in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nOmYqu"&gt;The FCC test report explicitly describes an EUT (Equipment Under Test) device that can be used with an S Pen in both hover and click modes. “The EUT can also used with a stylus device (S Pen). The EUT operates with the S Pen in two different inductive coupling modes of S Pen motion detection (Hover and Click) operating in the range of 0.53 –0.6MHz.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UKiYUlam4WW3Qv6faQP669p36uc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22192788/s21_fcc_listing_uwb_and_s_pen.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The relevant section of the FCC test report showing S-PEN support and other features.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VGjqJT"&gt;The listing also confirms wireless power transfer (to charge things like the upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22180111/galaxy-buds-pro-360-view-samsung-wireless"&gt;Galaxy Buds Pro earbuds&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231623/6ghz-wifi-6e-explained-speed-availability-fcc-approval"&gt;Wi-Fi 6E&lt;/a&gt;, and UWB on the yet to be announced Galaxy S21 Ultra. Last week Roh also said that Samsung planned to &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-defies-one-size-fits-all-mobile-experiences/"&gt;do more with ultra-wideband in 2021&lt;/a&gt; with help from partners, like using UWB to locate objects or your family pet, open doors, and personalize car experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ouNX2b"&gt;Everything should become clear at the upcoming Samsung event in January, presumably on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167208/samsung-galaxy-s21-january-14th-launch-india-plus-ultra-s-pen"&gt;Thursday the 14th&lt;/a&gt; if rumors hold.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Telegram gets Discord-like group voice chats</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4pvzOc9Uq9mxhPeGNbbN8geZNVQ=/0x0:540x360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68571180/groupchats.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p9V7Ue"&gt;Telegram is adding a new group voice chats feature that’s similar to an always-on Discord room. Voice chats are now part of existing text chats, and operate as a persistent option to speak live with friends or family. As they’re always available, you can dip in and out of voice chats just like you would in a Discord room or call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LT4Gfu"&gt;Telegram is supporting “a few thousand participants,” so even bigger groups for things like live events will include voice chats. The feature appears at the top of an existing group chat, if enabled, allowing anyone to join the conversation freely. On the desktop versions of Telegram for Windows and Mac, you can also use a push-to-talk key for voice chats to control your microphone input.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AOp6VTbfe2PlIMXbE3zccowddLw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22192787/telegramandroid.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Telegram&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Telegram’s new voice chat overlay for Android.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CQZSam"&gt;Telegram has also built a useful voice chat overlay for Android, which operates as a system-wide floating widget. It lets you see who’s talking or operate microphone and mute options when Telegram is running in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4SLCpd"&gt;At the moment group voice chats is focused on audio, but &lt;a href="https://telegram.org/blog/voice-chats"&gt;Telegram says it’s adding&lt;/a&gt; video and screen sharing features in the coming weeks. If you’re interested in trying out group voice chats you’ll need to be an admin of a group to enable the feature in the group settings menu.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nearly half a billion users played Among Us in November</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Among Us" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AMrVnjByV-VHm4Gi6ofI05026Sw=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68570242/ss_a0f2416e11bf5b47788eaa3617e092b73962b145.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: InnerSloth&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qKHiUD"&gt;With &lt;a href="https://www.superdataresearch.com/blog/worldwide-digital-games-market"&gt;roughly half a billion people&lt;/a&gt; reportedly playing it in November, &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; has had the most monthly players for a mobile game ever, beating giants &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/10/21060877/pokemon-go-record-revenue-2019-niantic-labs-ar-growth"&gt;like &lt;em&gt;Pokémon GO&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush Saga&lt;/em&gt;. According to Nielsen’s SuperData, the game is “by far the most popular game ever in terms of monthly players.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CS899C"&gt;The success is even more remarkable because InnerSloth — the company that makes Among Us — &lt;a href="http://www.innersloth.com/About.php"&gt;only has four employees&lt;/a&gt;. That’s roughly 125 million players per person who works on the game. It’s proven to be so popular that the studio decided to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21453499/among-us-2-sequel-popular-canceled-developers-innersloth"&gt;cancel a sequel that was in the works&lt;/a&gt; and just put all its effort into improving the original. It even caught the attention of sitting congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21526164/aoc-among-us-twitch-debut-top-concurrent-viewers"&gt;who livestreamed herself playing it&lt;/a&gt; to try to encourage people to vote, with an audience on Twitch that peaked at over 400 thousand viewers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AtsuKY"&gt;In an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Carter Rogers, Principal Analyst at SuperData, said that the next-most popular game in terms of monthly active users only clocked in at 300 million. Rogers notes that Nielsen arrives at its figures through a mix of “point-of-sale and event data from publishers, developers and payment service providers.” &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176459/among-us-nintendo-switch-cross-play-launch"&gt;release on the Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt; was recent enough that it didn’t have an appreciable impact on the game’s total numbers in Nielsen’s analysis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yYnLBZ"&gt;The fact that &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; had 500 million players shows the outstanding reach you can get by making a free game that runs on mobile devices. According to SuperData, only three percent of those 500 million players were playing the PC version. To put that number in perspective, &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; is one of the most hyped AAA game launches we’ve seen in a long time, and it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195728/cyberpunk-2077-sales-copies-sold-launch-refunds"&gt;sold 13 million copies this month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m7MCxS"&gt;Of course, there’s a large price difference between the games (&lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; is free on mobile, and $5 on PC), but it shows that the audience for mobile games is much larger than other platforms. InnerSloth is working to ensure that Among Us has some staying power by continuing to add new content to it, like the Airship map with new tasks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168243/among-us-innersloth-new-map-airship-early-2021"&gt;that’s being added early next year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roast your own Spotify listens with this snarky AI</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NdXN5hc2dG3WoIKkFKxPL3vS7mg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68569959/acastro_180213_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h9pJGW"&gt;The yearly Spotify Wrapped is a rather upbeat affair, which doesn’t doesn’t quite match everyone’s mood this year. For the more sullen among us, there’s another option: &lt;a href="https://pudding.cool/2020/12/judge-my-spotify/"&gt;a bot from The Pudding&lt;/a&gt; that will judge us for our crimes of listening to terrible music. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IWfXOF"&gt;If you want to be judged, you open a page titled “How Bad is Your Spotify” and you log in with your Spotify account. (It might take a couple refreshes on the “Loading your music library” page.) This absolute jerk of an AI then drags you mercilessly while it pulls your playlists and top tracks. It asks you questions before it shows any results, in phrasing that gives the plain text the same aura as the girls who bullied me in middle school. &lt;em&gt;Did you really listen to Clementine by Sarah Jaffe?&lt;/em&gt; (Yes) &lt;em&gt;Like ironically?&lt;/em&gt; (No…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8ukO8"&gt;The final judgement comes in the form of a multi-hyphenated phrase, followed by a page of loose statistics (I am apparently 24 percent basic). This stupid little computer program deemed my Spotify listens mason-jar-candle-from-target-craft-beer-snob-wet-ass bad. And you know what? It’s right. I listened to a frankly unholy amount of Hozier this year. Spotify Wrapped wanted me to be proud of that, but I’ve spent the year hating the fact that I was too bummed out and busy to actually seek out new and exciting artists. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e0BDwdm_jXA_TxOLYNU615qD808=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22191874/IMG_2712.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8RNGZB"&gt;The bot is not actually that personalized. It will ask everyone the same boilerplate questions in a snarky tone. But it still gave me the validation I didn’t know I craved. My music taste kinda sucks, but whose doesn’t? Who among us doesn’t love to listen to the same old tried-and-true songs that hit just right, even if they earn the scorn of our more pretentious friends? Please join me in this journey of shameless shamefulness, and find some joy in a well-earned roast.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SEC says third-largest cryptocurrency was sold all wrong</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pYTrTHQ5OR_09PmtitMZ_W3seOw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68569791/acastro_1901001_3701_indieGameDevs_still.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vp9aWN"&gt;Ripple, its former CEO and founder Christian Larsen, and its current CEO Bradley Garlinghouse are being &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-338"&gt;sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt;. The SEC says that they raised more than $1.3 billion through an unregistered securities offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7XfLHO"&gt;The suit claims that Ripple violated securities laws by selling XRP, which &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ripple-to-face-sec-suit-over-xrp-cryptocurrency-11608598800"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; calls&lt;/a&gt; “the third-largest cryptocurrency by market value,” over a seven-year period starting in 2013. According to the complaint, the “illegal securities offering” created an information asymmetry that let Larsen and Garlinghouse sell XRP to investors who only knew what Larsen and Garlinghouse chose to tell them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tQ2a72"&gt;At the heart of the suit is a basic question about XRP: &lt;a href="https://www.iflr.com/article/b1m2pm9g4n65mk/cryptocurrencies-and-us-securities-laws-beyond-bitcoin-and-ether"&gt;is it a security or a currency&lt;/a&gt;? According to the SEC’s suit, it’s a security, and so Ripple didn’t provide its investors with the proper information they needed to assess any potential risk. According to Garlinghouse, it’s a virtual currency, which means the SEC has nothing to do with it. The SEC has previously ruled that bitcoin and Ethereum are currencies. Also, &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/ripple-labs-inc-resolves-criminal-investigation"&gt;the Justice Department treated XRP&lt;/a&gt; as a currency in 2015, when Ripple settled a suit over its business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="emoJ9F"&gt;But XRP differs from bitcoin and Ethereum in an important way. For those two cryptocurrencies, new coins are created through a “mining” process, which is ongoing. Ripple started XRP by creating 100 billion units all at once. Ripple owns about 6.4 billion XRP, and Garlinghouse and Larsen also own a good chunk of it. Another 48 billion XRP are held in reserve, for periodic sales. This difference may be why the SEC is claiming XRP is a security, not a currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PiCIuc"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I appreciate you saying what this could mean for the larger U.S. crypto industry. The SEC is doing the opposite of “fostering innovation” here in the US.  It’s not just XRP they’re attacking here. &lt;a href="https://t.co/fGzrVmhu8b"&gt;https://t.co/fGzrVmhu8b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1341405037948493826?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 22, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="THcfd6"&gt;The SEC has won similar suits against Block.one and Kik in the past, saying that the initial coin offerings these startups offered were actually securities. But those cases were different; Kik and Block.one did their ICOs &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; an SEC directive in 2017. XRP came into existence years before that directive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8HugUQ"&gt;The lawsuit didn’t come as a surprise; Garlinghouse &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/sec-to-sue-ripple-over-xrp-sales-ceo-says"&gt;announced yesterday&lt;/a&gt; that the company expected the suit, and Ripple has already published its &lt;a href="https://ripple.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Ripple-Wells-Submission-Summary.pdf"&gt;Wells response&lt;/a&gt;, a document that explains to the SEC that its actions were legal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QD3fP3"&gt;An important part of settling whether XRP is a currency or a security may involve something called the Howey test, which was created by a 1946 Supreme Court case. That ruling defined a security as an investment of money in a shared enterprise with an expectation of profits from others’ work. According to Ripple, XRP doesn’t satisfy the Howey test for a variety of reasons, but especially because no one bought XRP with the expectation of getting Ripple’s profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4Xnh1"&gt;The SEC’s complaint challenges that. In 2016, Ripple admitted to the New York State Department of Financial Services that buyers were “purchasing XRP for speculative purposes.” It also cites a hedge fund investor who owned XRP saying in 2015 that “the increase in XRP value is heavily dependent on the success of Ripple.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k2zZ6p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Substack says readers and writers are really in charge of moderation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0h-ISkZBHEPqPMJ0eq14-4UgNwo=/0x0:2500x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68569677/Untitled_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XCZC4j"&gt;Substack plans to take a “hands-off approach” to determining who can use its newsletter platform and “resist public pressure” to remove writers seen by some as “unacceptable.” &lt;a href="https://blog.substack.com/p/substacks-view-of-content-moderation"&gt;In a blog post this afternoon&lt;/a&gt;, the company outlined a relatively lax content moderation policy designed to let writers know they won’t be removed from the platform as long as they comply with basic rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SgKGu3"&gt;While it does have &lt;a href="https://substack.com/content"&gt;a short list of prohibitions&lt;/a&gt;, Substack says that “readers and writers are in charge.” The idea is that readers don’t have to pay for or subscribe to writers who they don’t agree with, and writers can leave — and take their mailing lists with them — if they don’t like the platform. “We just disagree with those who would seek to tightly constrain the bounds of acceptable discourse,” the platform’s co-founders wrote today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k1MhA5"&gt;Substack argues that it’s nothing like Facebook or Twitter, but it could soon have to grapple with the same thorny moderation problems of big platforms. The service has attracted a number of high profile writers this year, including Glenn Greenwald and Anne Helen Petersen. Pretty much anyone can start a newsletter and start accepting payments on the platform, though, and the service’s increasing prominence could soon lead to an influx of writers who aren’t reviewed or endorsed by the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="7t0NvE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Can Substack CEO Chris Best build a new model for journalism?

    <title>Sony says it’s already seeing some benefits from WarnerMedia’s big HBO Max bet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CqCu0jOOUkgkLjoXQjSBP9XV9bI=/589x0:1876x858/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68569501/Spider_Swing.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Sony Pictures Entertainment&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wvj9gD"&gt;Sony Pictures saw a “bit of a boom” in interest from Hollywood creatives who want to work with a studio committed to theatrical releases, according to the company’s CEO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sbyp2b"&gt;The uptick in interest comes just after WarnerMedia announced its 17 movies planned for 2021 will premiere on HBO Max the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22152626/hbo-max-2021-movies-release-date-matrix-dune-suicide-squad"&gt;same day they hit theaters&lt;/a&gt;. For WarnerMedia executives trying to figure out how to bolster subscribers for its new streaming service and release films in an era when the return to theaters is uncertain, the move makes sense. Plus, WarnerMedia executives will tell you they’re still committed to theatrical releases, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/08/cnbc-exclusive-cnbc-transcript-warnermedia-studios-and-networks-group-chairman-ceo-ann-sarnoff-speaks-with-cnbcs-squawk-alley-today-.html"&gt;pointing to &lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt;’s release&lt;/a&gt;. Others in the industry will point to &lt;em&gt;Tenet &lt;/em&gt;as a reason &lt;em&gt;for &lt;/em&gt;the HBO Max move. &lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rESR5i"&gt;While Sony could &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/studio-dilemma-risk-a-box-office-flop-sell-netflix-1246354"&gt;sell a title to a streamer&lt;/a&gt; — the company sold Tom Hanks’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21264009/tom-hanks-greyhound-apple-tv-plus-streaming-sony-pictures-pandemic"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Greyhound &lt;/em&gt;to Apple&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year for $70 million — CEO Tony Vinciquerra &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SquawkAlley/status/1341458110221836288"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the company remains committed to more traditional releases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rtmjUV"&gt;“The real benefit has been the number of incoming calls from talent to us saying, ‘We want to be doing business with you because we know you’re a theatrical distributor and producer,’” Vinciquerra said. “That has actually worked very well for us.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CiRqna"&gt;One important reason Vinciquerra can commit to theaters is because Sony Pictures doesn’t have a major streaming service. Therefore, its blockbusters will continue as theatrical exclusives before moving to other platforms (digital retailers and cable). There are some advantages Sony is finding within the industry’s shifting moment. Executives want a more flexible release period, ideally looking at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/18/21184030/universal-trolls-world-tour-hunt-coronavirus-birds-of-prey-warner-bros-disney-paramount-vod-digital"&gt;30-day exclusivity in theaters&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, most movies play in theaters for up to 90 days exclusively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iXBknq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That has actually worked very well for us.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="THyKT7"&gt;Like other CEOs, Vinciquerra wants the option to keep a movie in theaters for a shorter period of time if it’s not performing as well, while also keeping high grossing movies (think &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt;) in theaters for as long as possible. Unlike other executives at companies like Disney and WarnerMedia, however, Vinciquerra also doesn’t have to worry about growing a streaming service (Sony instead sees big financial return in licensing after &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-01/flush-with-cash-streaming-giants-prep-mega-bids-for-hollywood-hits?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;movies hit the home market&lt;/a&gt;), giving Sony room to be the studio that &lt;em&gt;actually can&lt;/em&gt; commit to keeping its films in theaters.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJRCvi"&gt;With WarnerMedia offering people in the US the option to stream at home, and Disney moving some of its titles to Disney Plus exclusively, Sony has more room on the calendar to figure out where to drop its smaller number of blockbusters to generate the most revenue. Having more freedom within the calendar is especially key in 2021 when there is, currently, a blockbuster scheduled practically every week. Trying to find an emptier weekend to debut a movie — one that might have space to find an audience for weeks — becomes a little easier, and could help with contract negotiations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fTWXC9"&gt;“When we dated [&lt;em&gt;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&lt;/em&gt;], I knew a year in advance, because it was the second week of &lt;em&gt;Lion King&lt;/em&gt;, that absolutely positively [&lt;em&gt;Once Upon a Time&lt;/em&gt;] would not open at number one,” Tom Rothman, Sony Pictures Chairman, told &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/hollywood-reporter-executive-roundtable-7-major-studio-chiefs-1250718"&gt;in late 2019&lt;/a&gt;. “And the conversation we had with the filmmakers was, ‘Even if we get your biggest opening ever, I promise you will not be number one. But I also promise you it’s a great day for the movie.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eadIhq"&gt;None of this means Sony is suddenly going to become the biggest studio in the world, or the only place directors want to work. As distribution methods change, so do contracts. When the world does enter a post-pandemic phase, and people venture out to watch movies, Disney and Warner Bros. will likely rule the box office once again. In 2019, Disney amassed &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2020/01/highest-grossing-movie-studios-2019-record-international-global-box-office-market-share-chart-analysis-2020-forecast-1202823471/"&gt;$13.15 billion at the global box office&lt;/a&gt;, accounting for more than 50 percent of the marketshare. Warner Bros. came in second with $4.4 billion, and Sony trailed with $3.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="bzTt35"&gt;&lt;q&gt;None of this means Sony is going to become the biggest studio in the world&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="paqN4U"&gt;What Sony’s commitment does mean, however, is the studio has a massive advantage with filmmakers like Christopher Nolan and &lt;em&gt;Dune &lt;/em&gt;director Denis Villeneuve, both of whom &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168881/denis-villeneuve-christopher-nolan-anger-hbo-max-streaming-att"&gt;publicly decried WarnerMedia’s move&lt;/a&gt;. Disney, WarnerMedia and, to an extent, NBCUniversal have to consider their costly and shiny streaming platforms in need of constant new content, while Sony does not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qsS1du"&gt;Netflix has dipped its toe into theatrical releases (especially for awards consideration), but its primary audience is at home. Amazon Studios has stepped &lt;a href="https://www.thewrap.com/amazon-studios-jen-salke-on-film-strategy-late-night-honey-boy/"&gt;back from theatrical releases&lt;/a&gt; in order to focus on Amazon Prime subscribers. Apple remains a question mark: would the trillion dollar company commit to a 40-day theatrical window if it meant working with top talent, before moving titles to its Apple TV+ platform? Seems like a definite possibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lk3H3q"&gt;Sony is betting on theaters, and talent, to drive its business. That’s not new, but as other companies focus on streaming, it does feel especially notable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ECy77Q"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BZFpj0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zjJlca"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tKaUdj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MGWK7W"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A OnePlus smartwatch is finally coming in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mXiItR5tE0zza51oi_UsVzhx1Ik=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68569422/vpavic_4112_20200721_0052.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gco3Ay"&gt;OnePlus will finally be making a smartwatch in 2021, CEO Pete Lau has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1341392977973960707"&gt;announced on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, marking the first foray into wearable devices for the smartphone company. There’s not many details yet on the upcoming device,  including what smartwatch OS it’ll run, a price, or even a firm release date — Lau only notes that it’ll be “released early next year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TKQ2Uj"&gt;The idea of a OnePlus smartwatch isn’t a new one; the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/6/4/11859138/oneplus-canceled-smartwatch"&gt;had reportedly designed&lt;/a&gt; a Wear OS (then still called Android Wear) smartwatch a few years ago. OnePlus ultimately nixed that product, though” “We had completed the design but we still decided to scrap it,” Lau said in &lt;a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-smaller-smartphone-makers-feel-the-markets-squeeze-1464947768?mod=e2twd"&gt;an interview with the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “We have to be focused.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Awm2nv"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Many of you said you wanted a watch, and as you might have heard over the weekend—we're making one, to be released early next year. Wishes do come true.  &lt;a href="https://t.co/H1Fqv9srXj"&gt;https://t.co/H1Fqv9srXj&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Pete Lau (@PeteLau) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1341392977973960707?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 22, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P4oc1s"&gt;OnePlus has started to branch out beyond phones in recent years, though: in addition to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219278/oneplus-8-review-specs-features-camera-battery-screen-price-photos-video"&gt;high-end smartphone&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219861/oneplus-8-pro-review-specs-features-price-camera-battery-photos-video"&gt;lineup each year&lt;/a&gt;, the company now makes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219689/oneplus-bullets-wireless-z-earbuds-headphones-price"&gt;an array of headphones&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"&gt;budget line of Nord phones&lt;/a&gt;, and even smart TVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGzzZT"&gt;The launch of a OnePlus smartwatch in 2021 — the first from the company — also comes hot on the heels of the release of the Oppo Watch earlier this year, which was similar the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/6/21167560/oppo-watch-apple-china-price-release-date-smartwatch"&gt;first-ever smartwatch that Oppo had made&lt;/a&gt;. Given that there’s been no shortage of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/6/15/17467348/oneplus-6-vs-oppo-r15-pro-vivo-bbk"&gt;similarities&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/17/18678746/oppo-reno-10x-zoom-review-oneplus-7-pro-camera"&gt;in the past&lt;/a&gt; between Oppo and OnePlus products (the two companies share an owner, the massive conglomerate BBK Electronics), it’s possible that the upcoming OnePlus watch may take some cues from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21267264/oppo-watch-hands-on-preview-smartwatch-china-apple"&gt;existing Oppo Watch&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon’s nationwide 5G can be slower than its LTE network, tests show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Ey6Zvi67ahwauofHpqKcjEfHho=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68569332/vzw-042.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IoFTeg"&gt;Verizon’s new nationwide 5G network is reportedly slower than its LTE network, to the point that users are apparently better off just disabling 5G entirely unless they’re near a mmWave network. The results come from &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/heres-why-verizon-iphone-users-must-turn-off-5g-right-now"&gt;testing done by &lt;em&gt;PC Magazine&lt;/em&gt;’s Sascha Sagan&lt;/a&gt;, who points to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509364/verizon-5g-network-ultra-wideband-nationwide-apple-event"&gt;Dynamic Spectrum Sharing, or DSS&lt;/a&gt;, as the culprit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i8EPRy"&gt;The tech lets carriers run LTE and 5G networks side by side, which is useful if, like Verizon, you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21418981/verizon-5g-midband-spectrum-auction-winner-fcc-dish"&gt;don’t yet have enough dedicated 5G spectrum&lt;/a&gt;. While the carrier has largely focused on its mmWave network until recently, it also has begun rolling out a mid-band nationwide 5G network, which promises to avoid mmWave’s range issues by using DSS. The only catch is that, with Verizon, it seems like this tech leads to worse performance in most cases for phones running in 5G mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ggJFH4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It may be worth checking to see if you’re actually getting faster speeds with 5G on&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8WWL2r"&gt;The solution, at least for now, is to just turn 5G off if you’re a Verizon customer. If that has your concerned about speeds compared to your T-Mobile customer friends, don’t worry too much: in it’s &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/fastest-mobile-networks/2020"&gt;nationwide speed test&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, &lt;em&gt;PC Magazine&lt;/em&gt; found that T-Mobile’s 5G can often still be slower than Verizon’s LTE, even though it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21418289/t-mobile-mid-band-5g-81-new-cities-towns-coverage-gigabit-speeds"&gt;uses dedicated 5G bands&lt;/a&gt;. That same nationwide test also revealed that AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G can be slower than its LTE as well — which makes sense, given that it also uses the DSS technology for it’s 5G network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xAZuIE"&gt;The results from &lt;em&gt;PC Magazine&lt;/em&gt; were only done in New York City, so if you have a 5G phone on Verizon, it may be worth checking to see if you’re actually getting faster speeds with 5G on. If you’re not, it may be worth turning it off entirely for now. This is also likely just a temporary issue — as Verizon continues to add dedicated 5G spectrum, their speeds are going to improve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fKURvA"&gt;It’s important to note that this doesn’t apply to Verizon’s mmWave technology, which is much faster than anything any other carrier has to offer. However, while mmWave &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9j8G_4FocrA&amp;amp;feature=emb_title"&gt;has the speed, it doesn’t have the range&lt;/a&gt;, and it can be blocked by trees, buildings, and sometimes even windows. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21516518/apple-iphone-12-5g-uw-verizon-mmwave-logo-reveal-ad-chris-rock"&gt;if you often find that 5G UB logo&lt;/a&gt; popping up on your phone, and you need that speed, it may be worth keeping 5G on, even if it could lead to slow downs when you get outside its range.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google and Nickelback really want you to look at your photographs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x6sFS-uBcXdlkmt8A0K6Lmjh4Lg=/97x0:1252x770/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68569309/Screen_Shot_2020_12_22_at_1.56.54_PM.5.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="92b5r1"&gt;Nickelback has created &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km3sqKZ7CPE&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be"&gt;a parody version of its own song “Photograph”&lt;/a&gt; for a new Google Photos ad, and it’s a lot more entertaining than you might suspect. In the ad, Nickelback lead singer Chad Kroeger mercilessly makes fun of himself, fully leaning into the “Photograph” meme and its usefulness in explaining all sorts of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIlNIVXpIns"&gt;graphs&lt;/a&gt; and in illustrating &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/NSUe_-3PIFk"&gt;framed copies of other memes&lt;/a&gt;, as Kroeger instructs viewers to “look at them” in his unmistakable, raspy voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UtmEtU"&gt;The ad’s lyrics and photos touch on Kroeger’s “noodle hair” and his passion for photographing dessert. That it manages to both be a nice example of Google Photos’ features and a cute use of the old meme makes it worth a watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wVS0SG"&gt;“Photograph” is 15 years old, and the meme connected to it has been around for &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/nickelbacks-photograph"&gt;at least five&lt;/a&gt;, so seeing the ad is bound to spark some memories, which is exactly Google’s intention. While it’s not quite an original idea for an ad, Google gets a pat on the head for being aware of the joke. Nickelback also wrote the new lyrics for the parody version, according to an email Google sent to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, so the band’s having some fun too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FKbn0u"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sIlNIVXpIns?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MP8xDb"&gt;Viral videos cemented Nickelback’s status as a meme, but here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/15/8420611/kwame-opam-wont-stop-nickel-rolling-me-this-is-my-story"&gt;“Nickel-rolling”&lt;/a&gt; is what first comes to mind when we think of the band. Nickel-rolling is the unfortunate practice of trolling people with songs, lyrics, and images from the band Nickelback, like a Rickroll for the Nickelback generation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bgolOG"&gt;The band has been the butt of jokes in the past, but if I’m honest, “Photograph” is a catchy song — good luck getting it out of your head if you watch the whole Google Photos ad. I think a lot of the ironic hate towards Nickelback is fading — I know it is for me. When we discussed the new ad, &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; editor Nick Statt summed up the phenomenon well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="sVfKxW"&gt;I feel like every thing the internet hates eventually becomes endearing, because the curve of internet culture bends toward “not being a jerk” as everyone just grows up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="YCXNon"&gt;Whether someone at Google is admitting to being a Nickelback fan or simply reviving an old joke, some levity might be necessary given &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21560810/google-photos-unlimited-cap-free-uploads-15gb-ending"&gt;Google’s new storage policy in Photos&lt;/a&gt;. The company announced it will end its unlimited storage offer for “high quality” photos after June 1st, 2021. If you want to store more than 15GB after that cut-off, you’ll have to subscribe to Google One. Yes, Google would like you to look at your photographs, and it fully expects you to pay for the privilege of storing them.&lt;/p&gt;
