    <title>Saturn’s ‘Death Star’ moon might be hiding an underground ocean</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oiQYJwb4O7qgJrhToyh8dxQWzLk=/66x0:635x379/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70413698/Low_Res_saturn_moons_mimas_enceladus_3328x1800_hero.jpg.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EV9YAW"&gt;During a mission to discover whether or not Saturn’s moon Mimas was geologically dead,  researchers discovered something far more surprising: “&lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/940521"&gt;compelling evidence&lt;/a&gt;” of an underground ocean buried beneath the surface of the Death Star-like moon. Mimas, the researchers say, might be a “‘stealth’ ocean world,” a finding that, if verified, would further expand the number of potentially habitable places in our solar system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kEpnFq"&gt;Icy moons with evidence of subsurface oceans have garnered a lot of attention from scientists lately. The two best known examples in our solar system, Saturn’s &lt;a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/saturn-moons/enceladus/in-depth/"&gt;Enceladus&lt;/a&gt; and Jupiter’s &lt;a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/jupiter-moons/europa/in-depth/"&gt;Europa&lt;/a&gt;, are considered prime places to search for alien life. Enceladus, in particular, appears to have most of the ingredients needed to sustain life in its seawater, which spews out of geysers near the moon’s South Pole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DqArP7"&gt;But while the surfaces of both Europa and Enceladus show signs of geologic activity, suggesting an internal heat source that allows liquid water to exist, the surface of Mimas is heavily cratered, leading Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) scientist Alyssa Rhoden to suspect it was “just a frozen block of ice,” according to &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/940521"&gt;a press release&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfARr1"&gt;However, Rhoden now thinks Mimas’s cratered-like appearance kept an ocean hidden. In &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0019103521005091?via%3Dihub"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; published earlier this month in the journal &lt;em&gt;Icarus&lt;/em&gt;, Rhoden and her colleague Matthew Walker of the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona, show that tiny wobbles, or “librations” in the moon’s orbit detected by NASA’s Cassini spacecraft can be explained by gravitational interactions with Saturn that produce enough heat maintain a liquid ocean beneath a thick icy shell. A model developed by the team suggests that icy shell is 14 to 20 miles thick.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NjSZmk"&gt;The findings suggest Mimas is a “compelling target for further investigation,” Rhoden said in a release. Studying the moon’s potential to support an ocean, she says, could help researchers understand the prevalence of ocean moons at even more distant and poorly-explored locales, like Uranus. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Paramount Plus Fatal Attraction reboot will see Lizzy Caplan down bad for Joshua Jackson</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ak0MU1gnmtcKL2Sctisx8aGpPek=/164x134:1806x1229/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70413696/Lizzy_Joshua.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M46ZJD"&gt;Though the original &lt;em&gt;Fatal Attraction &lt;/em&gt;is a seminal classic that’s always worth revisiting, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826909/paramount-plus-live-channels-linear-streaming"&gt;Paramount&lt;/a&gt;’s confident that it’s high time the film was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299958/italian-job-sequel-series-flashdance-fatal-attracion-shows-paramount-plus-streaming"&gt;remade as a series&lt;/a&gt; for the generation who grew up watching &lt;em&gt;Dawson’s Creek &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Mean Girls&lt;/em&gt; on repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d5vkI8"&gt;In the new Paramount Plus &lt;em&gt;Fatal Attraction&lt;/em&gt;, a series written by Alexandra Cunningham (&lt;em&gt;Desperate Housewives&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Dirty John&lt;/em&gt;), Joshua Jackson stars as Dan Gallagher, a man whose chance sexual encounter with a woman named Alex Forrest (Lizzy Caplan) leads to a torrid affair that quickly turns dark. Like the original, this Alex’s feelings for her beau sour once he begins to rebuff her, and her obsessive feelings for him begin to grow increasingly intense and dangerous. But according to &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;, the new &lt;em&gt;Fatal Attraction &lt;/em&gt;will also put a particular focus on exploring its themes through a “modern” lens with more nuanced ideas about the balances of power in relationships, emotional manipulation, and how we conceive of “strong women” as an archetype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IeyP7g"&gt;While it’s unclear what other new updates this &lt;em&gt;Fatal Attraction &lt;/em&gt;will feature, Paramount Plus’ head of original scripted series, Nicole Clemens, emphasized in a press statement about the series that Jackson and Caplan chemistry will be a key element of the production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="so6Aec"&gt;“[Joshua Jackson] and Lizzy [Caplan] are perfectly matched to tell a nuanced and modern narrative about the complexities of the human psyche,” Clemons said. “We’re thrilled to partner with them to bring this provocative and captivating story to a new generation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I6S03y"&gt;Currently, there’s no word on when production on &lt;em&gt;Fatal Attraction &lt;/em&gt;is set to begin or when the series will hit Paramount Plus.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FAA estimates 78 percent of US planes can now land at airports with 5G C-band</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="American Airlines Boing 777 Landing At London Heathrow" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fD2icf3k1Ghz8TmN1Cp9po2kK7o=/0x0:5400x3600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70413591/1229178652.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There were concerns some altimeters might not properly filter 5G signals.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Nicolas Economou/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X5cObI"&gt;The FAA &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/5g"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; that an “estimated 78 percent of the U.S. commercial fleet” have been cleared to land at airports with 5G C-band, even under low-visibility conditions. The agency’s statement comes after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891634/faa-att-verizon-5g-c-band-rollout-battle-airlines-buffer-zones"&gt;a week of controversy&lt;/a&gt; surrounding the rollout of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891286/att-5g-rollout-select-metro-areas-faa-delay"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891284/verizon-c-band-5g-ultra-wideband-now-available"&gt;Verizon’s&lt;/a&gt; upgraded cellular tech, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889141/us-airlines-united-american-delta-5g-c-band-disruption-radar-altimeter"&gt;saw US airlines warning of “catastrophic disruption”&lt;/a&gt; to travel and shipping and some international airlines &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22890080/5g-flight-cancel-att-verizon-c-band-emirates-air-india-ana-japan"&gt;announcing they’d halt flights to some US airports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wN2QVN"&gt;At issue are concerns that some radio altimeters won’t properly ignore signals from the new 5G transmitters. While there are precautions that should keep this from happening, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889664/att-5g-limits-c-band-expansion-airports-further-carrier-airline"&gt;creating buffer zones around airports&lt;/a&gt;, an incorrect altimeter reading could cause real problems during a low-visibility landing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k0vNnj"&gt;Given the high stakes, the FAA has said that only planes with altimeters that it has tested and cleared will be allowed to land in sub-optimal conditions at airports where the new 5G tech has rolled out. You can read our explainer of the situation, which goes into detail about the last-minute confusion, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867221/att-verizon-5g-midband-spectrum-faa-air-safety-delay-cband"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="btYEdc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The FAA has quickly added altimeters throughout the week&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IslnZH"&gt;On January 16th, the agency announced that it had cleared two altimeters, which it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891725/faa-radar-new-altimeter-clearance-5g-c-band-rollout-airlines-boeing-777"&gt;bumped up to five on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. It said the cleared altimeters were installed in “some” versions of planes like the Boeing 737, 747, and 777. The FAA changed that language on Thursday, saying that the 13 cleared altimeters should cover “all” Boeing 717, 737, 747, 757, 767, 777, 787, MD-10/-11, and Airbus A300, A310, A319, A320, A330, A340, A350, and A380 models. It also notes that “some” Embraer 170 and 190 regional jets are covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cRv7Sn"&gt;The FAA is still predicting that some altimeters won’t pass the test and will be “too susceptible to 5G interference.” Planes equipped with those models won’t be allowed to land at airports with the new 5G tech in low-visibility conditions — which could prevent airlines from scheduling any flights using those planes to airports of concern, given the unpredictability of weather and the disruption such a diversion would cause. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="72mUwf"&gt;The carriers have been frustrated with the FAA and airlines for their handling of the situation. Their rollouts have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22866098/faa-dot-verizon-fcc-att-5g-c-band-delay-airplane-safety"&gt;been delayed multiple times&lt;/a&gt;, and on Tuesday, AT&amp;amp;T &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889664/att-5g-limits-c-band-expansion-airports-further-carrier-airline"&gt;put out a statement&lt;/a&gt; lambasting the FAA’s “inability to do what nearly 40 countries have done, which is to safely deploy 5G technology without disrupting aviation services.” Verizon followed with a similar statement that also mentioned other countries’ rollouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qbTyQR"&gt;You can read the FAA’s full statement &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/5g"&gt;on its 5G page&lt;/a&gt;, under the “FAA Statements on 5G” heading. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PlayStation 5 is available once again at Best Buy right now (update: sold out)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_iiAWxZ-Jif-ngtwfPFgzkhsaP4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70413158/vpavic_4278_20201030_0247.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oz0oKj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 20th, 3:29PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Best Buy has sold out of its stock of PlayStation 5 consoles for the day. We hope that you scored one. But if not, we’ll try to help you get one next time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qSyWWO"&gt;While there have been many restocks of Sony’s PlayStation 5 console as it slowly gets a little easier to obtain one, we’re sadly not out of the woods just yet. The PS5 is still hard to come by for a product that is over one year old. Thankfully, there’s another chance to pick one up today, care of Best Buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldz2XY"&gt;Best Buy is opening up orders for the standard disc drive-equipped &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgcljGhDR4o" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation 5 console, costing $499.99&lt;/a&gt; and disc-less &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgsAG7xlDGh" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Digital Edition for $399.99&lt;/a&gt;. Orders from Best Buy are usually based around store pickup orders, so it is very likely that you may need some luck on your side with a nearby location that has inventory. Whatever the case, the key is to try and stay persistent. Log into your Best Buy account, with billing and shipping info pre-filled, and click “Add to Cart” to join the queue. Once it is your turn the button may change and prompt you to verify your account. It’s after that point that you may find out whether a nearby store has stock or not. If not, you it doesn’t hurt to close the window and try again. Sometimes the stock for Best Buy stores is rolled out in waves, with restocks lasting up to, and sometimes over, one hour in length before everything is all sold out once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qCzT2b"&gt;Hopefully you manage to get one today, but if not we’ll be here to let you know of the next restocks from Best Buy and other major retailers. If you did luck out, be sure to regularly check out our deals pages, where we often surface some of the best prices around on games and peripherals. You can even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/newsletters" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;subscribe to our&lt;em&gt; Verge Deals&lt;/em&gt; newsletter&lt;/a&gt;, and get deals and promos right to your inbox. accessories you may need right off the bat, and &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to play Wordle</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_YKb2LVbUd2GpUPXqCdPL3aAo-I=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70413557/1237669899.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wordle is the free word game everyone on Twitter seems to be playing.&lt;/em&gt; | Stefani Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TTTJ39"&gt;By this point in the pandemic, we’re all looking for something pleasant to distract us — even momentarily — from all the chaos, which may explain why the simple, no-frills game &lt;em&gt;Wordle&lt;/em&gt; has become so popular. It’s a web-based puzzle that requires players to guess a new five-letter word every day, in six tries or less, and everyone gets the same word. You may have seen people sharing the gray, green, and yellow square patterns on Twitter, which show how they performed on that day’s Wordle without giving away the solution (more on that in a sec).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6hGB6W"&gt;According to a lovely &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/03/technology/wordle-word-game-creator.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; profile&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Wordle&lt;/em&gt; creator and software engineer Josh Wardle (get it?), he devised the game as a gift for his partner Palak Shah, who loves word games and crossword puzzles. The pair apparently got into the NYT Spelling Bee and daily crossword games in 2020, and Wardle wanted to create a new game that Shah would like. The perceived scarcity of the game — only one puzzle per day — leaves the player wanting more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EzobvJ"&gt;Where do I find Wordle? &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="vrSNpt"&gt;The game is web-based, so there’s no official app to download (although it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/12/22880353/wordle-copycat-creator-apology-word-game-app-store-apple"&gt;not for lack of trying&lt;/a&gt; by a few copycats). You can play using a mobile or desktop browser; just go to &lt;a href="http://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/"&gt;www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/&lt;/a&gt;. You have until midnight, when the word resets and a new word is there for you to guess. I often start a game, leave the browser tab open, and come back later as I try to figure out the correct word. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0H6JVn"&gt;How do I play Wordle?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6uLi2N"&gt;Everyone has their own &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@tglaiel/the-mathematically-optimal-first-guess-in-wordle-cbcb03c19b0a"&gt;strategy&lt;/a&gt; for how they approach that first blank grid of squares. Choosing a word that has a lot of vowels as your first guess is a solid plan; once you rule out the various vowels, it narrows the word choices significantly (and no, I am not telling you my secret starting word). Type in your word and hit “Enter.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qDDBfu"&gt;Letters that are in the word and are in the correct spot will then turn green, letters that are in the word but in a different spot will be yellow, and letters not in the word of the day will be gray. Note that a green or yellow letter can appear in a word more than once — for example, if you get one green “a,” there could be another “a” somewhere else in the word — but you won’t necessarily know that until you play the next word. And no fake words are allowed — the game will throw you a “Not in word list” message if you try to enter AEIOU, for instance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F81xaT"&gt;In the screenshot below, the keyboard shows letters you’ve guessed wrong (in other words, that are not in the word) in dark gray or black and the letters you haven’t guessed yet in light gray. You’ll know you’ve won when all the letters turn green (and a compliment like “Impressive” appears).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="That R is in the right place but looks like there are no E’s in today’s Wordle." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QhQ5M_AWjgDX6_EryiMBxR9ciy0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23182520/wordle.PNG"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HgDjXa"&gt;What are these squares everyone is sharing on Twitter? &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ss0RM7"&gt;Originally, Wardle didn’t create a sharing component for the game, but after seeing users on Twitter sharing their results using green, yellow, and black square emojis, he added a share button that lets you copy your results once you’ve completed the game in a way that won’t give away the day’s word to anyone who hasn’t played it yet. So in the grid below, you can see I guessed completely wrong on the first entry, got two correct letters in the right spots on the second guess, and guessed the word correctly on the third try (not bad!). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yhu2y6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Wordle 215 3/6&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜&lt;br&gt;⬜⬜⬜  &lt;br&gt;     &lt;/p&gt;— kim lyons (@SocialKimLy) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SocialKimLy/status/1484231087178096645?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 20, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IKBd8z"&gt;Anything else I need to know?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xDUkrX"&gt;There’s a high contrast “color blind” version and a dark mode available; you can toggle them on using the gear symbol in the upper right corner next to the word WORDLE. If you’re really feeling lucky, you can also toggle on “Hard Mode,” which requires you to include any hints in the next word. For instance, in the first screenshot, in hard mode, I would have to include the R, the T, and the O in my third guess (so RADIO wouldn’t have worked there). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="to5g6o"&gt;It’s worth noting that this display option can be difficult for those who use screen readers online, such as people who have low vision. Developer Cariad Eccleston, founder of &lt;a href="http://antagonist.app"&gt;antagonist.app&lt;/a&gt;, created a way to make your results accessible (h/t to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LiamODellUK"&gt;Liam O’Dell&lt;/a&gt; for this tip). Paste the results you copied from the Wordle site into the translator at &lt;a href="https://wa11y.co/"&gt;wa11y.co/&lt;/a&gt;, and you’ll get a text description of how you did. Here’s today’s description:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VIF53l"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;alt: &lt;br&gt;Wordle 215 3/6&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Line 1: Nothing.&lt;br&gt;Line 2: 4th and 5th perfect.&lt;br&gt;Line 3: Won!&lt;/p&gt;— kim lyons (@SocialKimLy) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SocialKimLy/status/1484233392552087554?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 20, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4X1Xv1"&gt;Of course, since we’re on the internet, &lt;em&gt;Wordle’s&lt;/em&gt; grids have been &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mjseidlinger/status/1480642717361360899?s=20"&gt;meme-ified&lt;/a&gt;, repurposed for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SenGillibrand/status/1483799551198867457?s=20"&gt;political messaging&lt;/a&gt;, and many &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LEGO_Group/status/1481234548738469891?s=20"&gt;brands have tried&lt;/a&gt; to get in on the game’s popularity. But Wardle &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59881512"&gt;told the BBC&lt;/a&gt; he has no plans to include ads on the game and isn’t collecting or otherwise doing anything fishy with anyone’s data. A nice thing on the internet? We deserve it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BGu1KN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AirBuddy 2.5 for macOS adds better Bluetooth control for some non-Apple headphones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dvv2vF9wZ1fkFO0fYhG0UJrcE2o=/550x0:2950x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70413541/Proximity_Engine_2___No_Text.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;AirBuddy 2.5 has a new “Proximity Engine” v2 that should detect and hand off peripherals faster. | Image: Buddy Software&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nN1n5y"&gt;A new version of AirBuddy for macOS Monterey is available starting today, adding the option to quickly shift some non-Apple Bluetooth headphones and other devices between Macs and iPhones. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/28/18200945/airbuddy-mac-app-connecting-airpods-bluetooth"&gt;original&lt;/a&gt; AirBuddy app for macOS that launched in 2019 was a simple solution to let AirPods interface with your Mac just as seamlessly as they already did on iOS devices — complete with the animated pop-up many iPhone users are accustomed to seeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z1q72T"&gt;AirBuddy 2.5 takes advantage of new under-the-hood macOS Monterey changes to enable things like low battery notifications, switching from transparency mode to noise-canceling on AirPods that are not even currently outputting sound from the Mac, and easy control over automatic switching between devices. This version also lets power users take advantage of more actions in the Shortcuts app and create automation (to check battery level or quickly connect and disconnect) and profiles. A complete list of the actions that can be performed is published on the &lt;a href="https://v2.airbuddy.app/AirBuddy25ReleaseNotes"&gt;release notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="HPCDyS"&gt;AirBuddy now works with some third-party devices in macOS Monterey, such as the Sony WF and WH series headsets. These devices don’t have Apple’s W1 or H1 chip, so functionality is limited. They are only shown while connected to the Mac, but can be pinned to the list for quick connection. Battery alerts can also be configured for such devices, as long as they provide battery information to macOS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="EYd2is"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This one was a “never gonna happen” item on my list, until Apple decided to start showing battery information for some third-party Bluetooth devices in macOS Monterey   &lt;a href="https://t.co/9qZ1yhZYfB"&gt;https://t.co/9qZ1yhZYfB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Guilherme Rambo (@_inside) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_inside/status/1483524849565941767?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 18, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aYJoC6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; was provided a beta release to try out the new features, so we installed it on a Mac running the latest version of macOS Monterey and another Mac running macOS Big Sur (both systems are M1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T_2AlmF8OyQaqczJBTyPe89D4cQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23182482/Screen_Shot_2022_01_20_at_12.31.03_AM.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MkKTGX"&gt;I had access to a pair of Sony WF-1000XM3 wireless earbuds and some LG &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/29/9217709/samsung-level-u-earbuds-review-neckbuds"&gt;neckbuds&lt;/a&gt; and was able to add them to my devices in AirBuddy on macOS Monterey. Unfortunately, this and some other features did not work in Big Sur since this is a beta release specifically designed for Monterey. The developer plans to release AirBuddy 2.5 for older macOS versions next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I84xQTYHJ0XG_jhz18JnZvXu6Mk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23182572/Image_1_20_22_at_1.46_PM.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Umar Shakir / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LG Tone HBS800 neckbuds also worked!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tJ4gWQ"&gt;The hero feature of the new AirBuddy is a faster connection switch using what developer Guilherme Rambo (a former &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; writer) is calling Proximity Engine 2.0 — “a complete overhaul of the AirBuddy Bluetooth Low Energy stack that talks to your AirPods, faster and more reliable than ever.” From our testing, AirPods and Beats Solo headsets popped up within a second, which feels faster than how it shows up on iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NLIdqv"&gt;AirBuddy is not the only app with Bluetooth handoff abilities, but AirBuddy feels more like an OS feature and not an app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gXKmy8jmvOLQmreIuzPBQewL8hI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23182418/IMG_1475.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Umar Shakir / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Beats Solo with W1 chip show up just like it would on iOS. For context on why it appears as the Club Collection blue color, I transplanted the parts of the broken Beats Solo 3 into the body of the special edition Space Gray Beats Solo 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4L2Lhy"&gt;For me, the most useful feature is easily handing off the Magic Keyboard and Magic Trackpad to a second Mac (available in the previous version of AirBuddy as well). I’m currently working on two MacBook Air M1s, and to swap my Keyboard and external Trackpad between them, I plug a USB-C hub into the computer I want to work on and rely on the Lightning charge cable to re-sync to the other computer. It sounds cumbersome but I’m quick about it. And with Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22832765/universal-control-apple-macos-monterey-ipad-delay-spring"&gt;further delaying&lt;/a&gt; Universal Control (which lets you drag and drop files and windows between two Macs while also using one set of peripherals), AirBuddy is a good wireless KVM-ish type of solution for me, right now.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cut4BOl5EknR-98vedjv95JUgN0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23182386/Screen_Shot_2022_01_19_at_12.55.54_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Umar Shakir / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A warning for beta users that configured battery alerts may need to be set up again (and assurance that the bug isn’t in the final release). If you’re wondering what Show me a Puppy does, it links to this delightful &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/629448485423385502/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;picture of a zoomy Corgi pup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RaPhpk"&gt;The 2.5 update is available for free to anyone who has purchased AirBuddy 2.0 (as an automatic update on macOS Monterey, with older OSes receiving them next week). For new customers, the price is $9.99 — higher than the minimum $5 charge for the original version but the same price since the 2.0 release.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s head of comms is leaving after less than a year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tFaT8eBJvboBnGos5OGy4bVUSq4=/129x0:1071x628/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70413485/1236193236.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dedh8I"&gt;Apple is renowned for a culture of secrecy, one that’s managed in no small part by the company’s head of communications. But it’s had a hard time filling that role, with the most recent entrant — &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johnpaczkowski/apple-taps-stella-low-as-new-communications-chief"&gt;Stella Low, formerly Cisco’s PR chief&lt;/a&gt; — now leaving after less than a year on the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6zjgpi"&gt;Fifteen-year Apple vet Kristin Huguet Quayle is taking over, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/karaswisher/status/1484240198758240261"&gt;according to journalist Kara Swisher&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johnpaczkowski/apple-new-head-of-pr-kristin-huguet?d_id=3072577&amp;amp;ref=bftwfwd&amp;amp;utm_source=dynamic&amp;amp;utm_campaign=bftwfwd"&gt;BuzzFeed’s John Paczkowski&lt;/a&gt;. Apple confirmed to &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/em&gt; that she’s been promoted effective immediately, as Low leaves to spend more time with her family. The previous comms boss, Steve Dowling, left in September 2019, and Apple left the role open for nearly two years before hiring Low last May. (During that time, long-time Apple marketing and App Store boss Phil Schiller reportedly stood in.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e5v1V2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Longtime &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Apple&lt;/a&gt; PR exec (15 years) Kristin Huguet Quayle is taking over as VP, Worldwide Comms of the world’s most valuable company, a very big job given all the regulatory issues, products to come (hello AR glasses &amp;amp; autonomous cars) and the metaverseness of it all.&lt;/p&gt;— Kara Swisher (@karaswisher) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/karaswisher/status/1484240198758240261?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 20, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kBYobq"&gt;Between Dowling and Low, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21350154/apple-worlds-most-valuable-company-saudi-aramco"&gt;Apple became the world’s most valuable publicly traded company&lt;/a&gt;, got itself into the (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22893546/epic-apple-fortnite-appeal-app-store-restrictions"&gt;ongoing&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, and became embroiled in all kinds of scrutiny from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/9/11/20859972/apple-antitrust-app-store-search-tax-warren"&gt;antitrust enforcers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/6/22520378/apple-wwdc-2021-developer-insult-macbook-pro"&gt;developers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22654197/apple-app-store-editorial-scams-refunds"&gt;app store users&lt;/a&gt;, and its own employees — the ones that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22700898/apple-company-culture-change-secrecy-employee-unrest"&gt;could maybe bring its fortress of secrecy toppling down&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wUkbSl"&gt;Apple’s PR chief before that, Katie Cotton, &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/5/30/11627500/goodbye-to-all-that-today-is-katie-cottons-last-day-at-apple"&gt;set the tone for the company’s communications&lt;/a&gt; for 18 years. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/9/5794104/apple-is-reportedly-looking-for-a-friendlier-head-of-public-relations"&gt;Apple was reportedly looking for a “friendlier, more approachable” successor&lt;/a&gt; after she left. I’m curious if the company’s relationship with the press will change again now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="9r6LW2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s fortress of secrecy is crumbling from the inside","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22700898/apple-company-culture-change-secrecy-employee-unrest"},{"title":"Tim Cook’s Apple, ten years later","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22639629/tim-cook-apple-ten-years-decade-steve-jobs-legacy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="FqE8Ik"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton’s woes continue as it temporarily halts bike, treadmill production</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pelton Bike Plus in an apartment" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ad9zwbqn1nOd5NA1J4npz7nUrws=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70413318/akrales210108_4344_0020.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peloton is pausing production of its connected bikes and treadmills.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QYgFlQ"&gt;Peloton’s pandemic fortunes began waning in 2021, and it appears that trend is continuing into the new year. According to a &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/20/peloton-to-pause-production-of-its-bikes-treadmills-as-demand-wanes.html"&gt;new CNBC report&lt;/a&gt;, Peloton has decided to temporarily halt production of its connected exercise bikes and treadmills amid weak consumer demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X5S442"&gt;Citing a confidential internal company presentation, CNBC reports that Peloton will stop producing its original Bike from February to March. The company halted production on its more premium Bike Plus in December and apparently has no plans to restart until at least June. The newer Peloton Tread, which launched last year, will also cease production for six weeks starting next month. Unsurprisingly, Peloton also reportedly has no plans to produce any Tread Plus machines in fiscal 2022. The company stopped making new Tread Plus machines after the Consumer Product Safety Commission &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420918/peloton-treadmill-recall-tread-accidents-cpsc-voluntary-refund"&gt;recalled the device&lt;/a&gt; following reports of several injuries, and in one instance, the death of a small child. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NvHY4f"&gt;The woes also extend to the forthcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22771827/peloton-guide-camera-movement-tracking-price-release-date"&gt;Peloton Guide&lt;/a&gt;. Announced in November, the Guide was meant to be a $495 camera-based strength training system that connected with a user’s TV and came bundled with a heart-rate armband and a remote. However, CNBC cites internal documents showing the product hasn’t garnered a lot of interest thus far from consumers. While the Guide was expected to launch in early 2022, it appears that it may not launch until as late as April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eQnm3e"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to Peloton for comment but did not immediately receive a response. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W2kFbY"&gt;The connected fitness company is purportedly halting production as it had overestimated consumer demand for its products and misjudged people’s desire to return to in-person fitness classes — a fact that CEO John Foley admitted during &lt;a href="https://investor.onepeloton.com/events/event-details/peloton-interactive-1q22-earnings-call"&gt;its last investor call&lt;/a&gt; in November. The result is warehouses full of Peloton products, and no sign of another at-home fitness craze starting up on the horizon. It’s an ironic twist of fate. In the early days of the pandemic, Peloton’s biggest problem was its struggle to meet skyrocketing demand, resulting in &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/17/business/peloton-slow-delivery.html"&gt;months-long shipping delays&lt;/a&gt; that the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266121/peloton-shipping-delays-earnings-q4-2020"&gt;spent millions to address&lt;/a&gt;. Another issue is that Peloton went on a massive spending spree while things were going well. In December 2020, the company &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/maybe-now-peloton-orders-wont-take-so-long-1845933064"&gt;forked over $420 million&lt;/a&gt; to buy commercial fitness equipment maker Precor. It then spent another &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451515/peloton-400-million-factory-ohio-treadmill-bikes"&gt;$400 million to build a factory in Ohio&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HAkYki"&gt;It might be tempting to look at Peloton’s struggles as a bellwether for the entire connected fitness industry — and it’s undoubtedly true that many connected fitness equipment makers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22778851/peloton-growing-pains-connected-fitness-tonal-hydrow-mirror"&gt;have followed Peloton’s playbook&lt;/a&gt;. However, connected fitness isn’t going anywhere. Experts believe that akin to remote work, people will likely adopt &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/12/health/online-fitness-training-in-person-workouts-wellness/index.html"&gt;a hybrid model&lt;/a&gt; of working out both at home and in the gym. Peloton, while still the leader, is facing increased &lt;a href="https://www.modernretail.co/startups/at-home-fitness-brands-are-investing-more-in-marketing-as-competition-heats-up/"&gt;competition from rivals&lt;/a&gt; like Tonal, Echelon, Hydrow, and Mirror. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nIa9lw"&gt;The bigger question is how Peloton adjusts to the new post-pandemic reality. Peloton’s next earnings call is scheduled for February 8th, but the results from last quarter were concerning. Although Peloton &lt;a href="https://investor.onepeloton.com/static-files/4e16bcc7-dd3b-40ec-acb6-840e691b40ee"&gt;retained 92 percent of its yearly subscribers&lt;/a&gt;, it reported a &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/04/peloton-pton-to-report-fiscal-q1-2022-earnings-.html"&gt;net loss of $376 million&lt;/a&gt;. Attempts to slash &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22643715/peloton-bike-price-drop-q4-results-subscription-prices"&gt;$400 off the price&lt;/a&gt; of the original Peloton Bike in August didn’t seem to help bolster demand, either. A separate CNBC report from earlier this week also noted Peloton was working with a consulting firm &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/18/peloton-hires-mckinsey-to-review-cost-structure-as-equipment-sales-slow-.html"&gt;to potentially cut jobs&lt;/a&gt; and “review its cost structure,” as well as &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/17/peloton-is-about-to-tack-on-hundreds-of-dollars-in-fees-to-its-bike-and-treadmill-citing-inflation.html"&gt;add delivery and assembly fees&lt;/a&gt; for its bikes and treadmills. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic pushes to overturn App Store ruling in opening appeal brief</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rfiBnPuc2aWphDwXvOUKu6dKoKk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70413310/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dzTaud"&gt;Epic Games has filed &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21182876-epic-appeal-opening-brief"&gt;its opening brief&lt;/a&gt; to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, seeking to overturn the previous ruling that Apple’s control over the iOS App Store does not qualify as a monopoly. The company first gave notice of it appeal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22670269/epic-files-appeal-fortnite-legal-battle"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt;, but Thursday’s filing is the first time it has laid out its argument at length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n123RE"&gt;“Epic proved at trial that Apple retrains trade...by contractually requiring developers to exclusively use Apple’s App Store to distribute apps and Apple’s IAP for payments for digital content within apps,” the filing reads. “If not overturned, [the district court] decision would upend established principles of antitrust law and...undermine sound antitrust policy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NAcyoS"&gt;Epic’s first legal challenge to Apple’s App Store restrictions &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown"&gt;came to a finish in September&lt;/a&gt;, when a district court ordered Apple to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22773082/epic-apple-fortnite-lawsuit-ruling-injunction-stay-app-store-anti-steering-rules"&gt;roll back some restrictions on in-app payments&lt;/a&gt;, but otherwise cleared the company of antitrust charges. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22814147/epic-apple-app-store-injunction-paused"&gt;A separate appeal from Apple&lt;/a&gt; has been filed to reverse the new in-app payment rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1KICvp"&gt;In her ruling, Judge Gonzales Rogers was particularly ambiguous on the question of whether Apple held monopoly power over the mobile gaming market. “The evidence does suggest that Apple is near the precipice of substantial market power, or monopoly power, with its considerable market share,” she wrote in the decision. “Apple is only saved by the fact that its share is not higher, that competitors from related submarkets are making inroads into the mobile gaming submarket, and, perhaps, because [Epic] did not focus on this topic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0wyxZ"&gt;In the appeals brief, Epic seems determined to revisit that question, and draw a clearer link between the iPhone’s success as a mobile gaming platform and a potential monopoly case against Apple. “The district court’s factual findings make clear,”  the filing alleges, “that Apple’s conduct is precisely what the antitrust laws prohibit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tL3C3o"&gt;Reached for comment, Apple emphasized the broad scope of economic activity taking place on the App Store, as evidence of its ongoing competitive value. “In its ruling last year, the district court confirmed that Apple is not a monopolist in any relevant market and that its agreements with app developers are legal under antitrust laws,” said Apple spokesperson Marni Goldberg. “We are confident that the rulings challenged by Epic will be affirmed on appeal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G19eu0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 4:05PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Included statement from Apple.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lawmakers approve Big Tech antitrust overhaul, but with strings attached </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Majority Leader Schumer, Senate Democrats Hold Media Availability" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a5LOnKFMStlcTi6Zsc1vNy0Kx4k=/0x0:4229x2819/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70413292/1365492770.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6KWLe4"&gt;Congress is one step closer to actualizing transformative antitrust reform for the tech industry after sending their most viable bill to the Senate floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J2RgcH"&gt;The Senate Judiciary Committee approved the American Innovation and Choice Online Act by a 16-6 vote on Thursday after hours of lengthy debate. The bill – sponsored by a bipartisan group of tech hawks like Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Josh Hawley (R-MO) – would ban dominant tech platforms from favoring their own services and products over those of their competitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uMEP4N"&gt;The successful committee vote comes after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889579/ftc-justice-department-lina-khan-kanter-google-facebook-amazon-antitrust"&gt;a week of antitrust action from the federal government&lt;/a&gt; that’s spooked the tech industry and put lobbyists in a frenzy. While prohibiting self-preferencing, like Amazon placing its own branded products above better-rated competing ones, the bill also forces platforms to apply their terms of service equally to every user. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1dCrMi"&gt;Despite the committee’s successful vote, the bill faces an uphill battle over the months ahead. In the days leading up to the vote, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22890100/antitrust-bill-apple-google-big-tech-senate"&gt;Apple and Google brandished statements&lt;/a&gt; criticizing the legislation, mounting an industry-led assault against the bill. Tim Powderly, Apple’s senior director of government affairs, warned that the bill could harm consumer privacy and security, while Kent Walker, Google’s president of global affairs and chief legal officer, argued that it would make the company’s search engine far less useful to consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2ozFL"&gt;Specifically, Apple’s security concerns relate to language in the bill that the company fears would allow iPhone and iPad users to download apps outside of the App Store. Powderly argued this provision could harm users who could download unscreened and potentially harmful software to their devices. If enacted, the bill would make it difficult for Apple to collect its sometimes 30 percent commissions from developers on App Store purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BUWwnU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I want to stress that this bill is not meant to break up Big Tech or destroy the products and services they offer.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nWj0Rx"&gt;Tech-backed industry groups, like NetChoice, echoed these concerns, saying that the vote came too quickly and didn’t give lawmakers enough time to fully understand the bill’s language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NDEOXn"&gt;“Lawmakers should stop this backroom wheeling-and-dealing and instead take the input of economists, experts, and businesses to better understand the impact of this rushed legislation,” Carl Szabo, NetChoice’s vice president and general counsel, said in a statement after Thursday’s vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RD6OIi"&gt;The bill’s sponsors tried to smooth over concerns from the industry and their colleagues over the legislation. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) said in his opening remarks, “I want to stress that this bill is not meant to break up Big Tech or destroy the products and services they offer.” He continued, “Rather, the goal of the bill is to prevent conduct that stifles competition, while ensuring that pro-consumer innovations and offerings are still available.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pUg9lZ"&gt;During the hearing, senators on both sides of the aisle proposed amendments to address additional concerns over privacy, censorship, and national security. Specifically, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) said that he had several amendments, including language that would allow users to sue platforms they accuse of harming them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yBCHJd"&gt;“The abuses of Big Tech are such that I am happy to unleash the trial lawyers,” Cruz said during Thursday’s markup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pCGm3Z"&gt;Cruz did not offer up any of the amendments, saying that Klobuchar and the bill’s sponsors are working with him to include this language in the final bill text. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8zGBIF"&gt;Progressive groups, &lt;a href="https://www.freepress.net/news/press-releases/provision-senate-antitrust-bill-would-undermine-fight-against-online-hate-and-disinformation"&gt;like Free Press&lt;/a&gt;, raised separate concerns, suggesting that a certain provision could make it harder for platforms like Facebook and Google to tackle disinformation or deplatform hateful or racist users and publications like the &lt;em&gt;Daily Stormer&lt;/em&gt;, a white supremacist website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PE72cl"&gt;“This provision could require platforms to host hate speech and other harmful content targeting Black and Brown people, the LGBTQIA+ community, women, immigrants, Indigenous people and other targeted populations,” Free Press said in a statement on Thursday. “It opens the door to arguments that covered platforms are unlawfully discriminating against hate-and-disinformation purveyors by taking them down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="54nmZC"&gt;Last summer, the House Judiciary Committee passed a similar bill to the one the Senate approved on Thursday. Still, that bill has yet to receive a vote on the House floor and must be approved by both chambers of Congress before it heads to President Biden’s desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fhftrW"&gt;The White House hasn’t issued any statements in support of the legislation, but &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/19/readout-of-listening-session-on-addressing-barriers-to-competition-and-innovation-in-tech/"&gt;administration officials met&lt;/a&gt; with the leaders of companies that have criticized Big Tech in the past, like Sonos and Yelp, on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XbD6CG"&gt;“Participants explained the challenges their businesses encounter operating through third-party platforms to reach large numbers of customers,” a readout from the meeting said. “A number of participants also expressed difficulty paying both fees that platforms charge and indirect costs through requiring the purchasing of supplemental services or advertising to maintain the business user’s position in platforms’ rankings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nceqsB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L1P0Z2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
