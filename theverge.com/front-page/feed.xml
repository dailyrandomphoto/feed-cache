    <title>A streamer is staying live for as long as people keep subscribing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LUOCKf5UFHFnbECUX_Sk3qa7xbo=/116x41:1324x846/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68990091/Screen_Shot_2021_03_18_at_4.39.49_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RBy64i"&gt;Twitch streamer &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ludwig"&gt;Ludwig Ahgren&lt;/a&gt; has been live since March 14th, and today marked the fourth continuous day of his broadcast. The reason? Every time someone subscribes to his channel, it adds 10 seconds to the amount of time he plans to remain live. In other words: Ahgren is running an uncapped subathon because he’ll stay up as long as viewers keep subscribing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pu1ynU"&gt;Since he’s one of the most popular streamers on Twitch — with 1.8 million followers as of this writing — it means Ahgren’s going to be live for at least a couple more days. (As of this writing, he’s got another 57 hours to go.) Yesterday, when he went to sleep for the night in his red racecar bed, he even managed to become the top streamer on Twitch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IpX51A"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Number 1 and 2 streamers on twitch tonight&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Badass &lt;a href="https://t.co/dpVpEaEZCt"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dpVpEaEZCt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— ludwig (@LudwigAhgren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LudwigAhgren/status/1372127176716292101?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6VZ34V"&gt;This isn’t actually against Twitch’s TOS. A Twitch spokesperson emailed &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; a statement, clarifying that they, too, have been watching the stream pretty closely and maintaining that Ahgren isn’t violating any of their rules. “Our &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/community-guidelines/"&gt;Community Guidelines&lt;/a&gt; do not prohibit sleeping on stream, however we expect streamers to take proper precautions to ensure their stream and chat are being monitored and attended to,” wrote a spokesperson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ofHMWd"&gt;While he’s been awake, Ahgren’s been streaming games with friends; while he’s asleep, his mods have been running videos chosen by the community. As Nathan Grayson &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/twitch-stars-never-ending-stream-shows-no-signs-of-stop-1846488273"&gt;wrote in &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: “It’s basically a big, bleary-eyed slumber party where everyone’s just vibing.” (While subathons are a thing in the Twitch community, they rarely go longer than, say, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/bmc789/shroud_gifts_giantwaffle_100_subs_extending_his/"&gt;30-something hours&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iCF53I"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.twitch.tv/?channel=ludwig&amp;amp;autoplay=false&amp;amp;parent=www.theverge.com&amp;amp;parent=iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=iframely.com&amp;amp;parent=cdn.iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=if-cdn.com" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T9SQWn"&gt;Twitch is a wonderfully immediate place online. You can see and interact with the people on your screen in real time, which feels like a kind of intimacy. Ahgren’s stream is well on its way to becoming an event in Twitch’s history, akin to Twitch Plays Pokémon and any of its other site-wide memes. It’s incredible to me that as big as it is, Twitch still has its own distinct culture and its own set of stars who seem to do stunts like this just because they seem cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jnRTbW"&gt;But historicizing can wait. Right now, Ahgren’s live, and it’s wonderful. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to find out if you’re getting the third stimulus payment</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="(Flickr) American money" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Uc1TxMuTgjVGvbShTUaGZHovxG4=/0x43:1024x726/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68990053/4603130687_d0a0862bc4_b.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KcmCg7"&gt;It’s always nice to anticipate an influx of cash, especially if things have been a bit tight lately. &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1319/text"&gt;The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021&lt;/a&gt;, which was signed into law on March 11th, 2021, includes Economic Impact Payments in the amount of $1,400 or less, depending on your reported income. In fact, as of Wednesday, March 17th, you may have already gotten yours; that was when the first payments began hitting bank accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R7YYiA"&gt;So if you’ve been using direct deposit to pay your federal taxes (or get your tax refunds), then check your bank account. If you don’t use direct deposit and you qualify for a payment, you should get either a check or a prepaid Economic Impact Payment (EIP) card in the mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ge43Id"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Haven’t seen anything yet and want to find out your status? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ce2mLR"&gt;The best way to find out where your payment is (and if one is coming) is via the IRS’s &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment"&gt;“Get My Payment”&lt;/a&gt; tool, which will tell you whether you’re eligible and, if so, when you will see the payment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SqeZU8"&gt;If you use the tool and are getting a “Payment Status Not Available” message, then, according to the IRS, this means “either we have not processed your payment yet, we do not have enough information to issue you a payment or you are not eligible for a payment.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The IRS “Get My Payment” tool may help you find out where your stimulus payment is." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mt8li06Cr5U-Go1nC1luIkFgMqw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22380970/Screen_Shot_2021_03_18_at_4.23.05_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The IRS’s “Get My Payment” tool may help you find out where your stimulus payment is.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JiZSWk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you know if you’re eligible?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YUOCib"&gt;It’s complicated. Whether you get a payment can depend on what your adjusted gross income (AGI) was, based on your 2020 taxes (if you’ve already filed) or your 2019 taxes (if you haven’t). The AGI is basically the amount you earned that year minus such things as contributions to a retirement account, and it can usually be found on line 8b of your 1040 tax form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1uplt1"&gt;If you are an individual and your AGI was below $75,000, you qualify. If your AGI was at least $75,000 but below $80,000, you will get a portion of the $1,400. But if your AGI was $80,000 or higher, you’re completely out of luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0BBmu8"&gt;This changes, of course, if you’re the head of a household (in which case, you get $1,400 if you make below $112,500 and nothing if you make $120,000 or more) or a married couple who files jointly (in which case, you get the $1,400 if the AGI is below $150,000 and nothing if it’s at least $160,000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CHzb5z"&gt;There are a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nolo.com%2Flegal-encyclopedia%2Fhow-much-will-my-covid-19-stimulus-check-be-and-am-i-eligible.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22338569%2Fcovid-stimulus-payment-check-track-irs-economic-impact" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;variety of calculators available online&lt;/a&gt; that can tell you how much you can expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="awkZ5O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to file and pay your 2020 taxes online ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22225419/file-taxes-pay-online-how-to-irs-us"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="1YkeEQ"&gt;Speaking of calculators, your AGI isn’t the only factor being taken into consideration. There are other considerations as well. Among them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="FMBESH"&gt;Non-citizens don’t get payment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="23W0DY"&gt;If you don’t file taxes, you should be okay — unless you also didn’t file last year and didn’t get a check, in which case, it might be a good idea to file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="a8l0rm"&gt;Adult dependents in a household (such as college students or elderly parents) will qualify for payments as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="nWT3Ie"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/recovery-rebate-credit-frequently-asked-questions"&gt;IRS has a FAQ&lt;/a&gt; that should answer most (if not all) of your questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xY5OrE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if you never got your first or second stimulus payments?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pHsCDN"&gt;If you were eligible for one or both of the first two stimulus payments but never received it, it’s too late now to actually get paid. You will have to apply for a &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/recovery-rebate-credit"&gt;Recovery Rebate Credit on your 2020 taxes&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not as good as getting a direct payment, but at least you’ll recover some of what you would have paid in taxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f00JRj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel teaser hints long-awaited Xe HPG gaming GPUs may be revealed on March 26th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cIbO_FNrz4IEpIFFl46CEXjsB-U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68989966/acastro_210120_1777_intel_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cN0a48"&gt;Intel’s upcoming Xe HPG “DG2” discrete gaming GPUs might be close to a reveal. The company has teased a “&lt;a href="https://xehpg.intel.com/"&gt;Xe HPG Scavenger Hunt&lt;/a&gt;” for March 26th at 12PM ET / 9AM PT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RTHNxf"&gt;The website was hidden in a binary sequence segment Intel stuck in its GDC 2021 presentation that briefly teased the &lt;a href="https://wccftech.com/intel-has-hidden-a-mysterious-clue-about-its-upcoming-xe-hpg-gpu-in-teaser-video/"&gt;upcoming graphics card&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://wccftech.com/intels-mystery-clue-cracked-xe-hpg-scavenger-hunt-going-live-on-26th-march-2021/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wccftech&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has managed to decode the message: the IP address for the aforementioned scavenger hunt website, which promises more information on the 26th.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h7jmK1eQdSn-HK4GXrZHAP67wNg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22381004/Screen_Shot_2021_03_18_at_4.37.59_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mISNuI"&gt;It’s not clear whether Intel will be launching the DG2 cards on the 26th or if the official announcement will come at new Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger’s mysterious announcement on “the new era of innovation and technology leadership at Intel” &lt;a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/media-alert-engineering-future/#gs.vvq5w1"&gt;that’s set to take place on March 23rd&lt;/a&gt;. If that’s the case, then it’s possible that the scavenger hunt could award fans more information on the upcoming GPUs (or perhaps even with actual graphics cards if Intel is feeling generous). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1R7CY2"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m8L5uqNXlNE?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vyQhva"&gt;While Intel released its first Iris Xe graphics cards earlier this year, based on its “DG1” prototypes that used the company Xe LP architecture. But the lower power cards weren’t really meant for gaming. In fact, they were primarily only sold directly to partners to include in prebuilt machines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ajbx5J"&gt;The upcoming “DG2” cards — based on the higher-performance Xe HPG architecture — promise to offer real gaming competition to long-established players like AMD and Nvidia. &lt;a href="https://wccftech.com/intel-xe-hpg-dg2-flagship-gaming-gpu-spotted-with-512-eus-4096-cores/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wccftech&lt;/em&gt; also recently&lt;/a&gt; spotted one of the rumored DG2 cards that made an appearance on Geekbench, too, featuring 512 EUs, 4096 cores, 1800MHz clock speeds, and 12GB of GDDR6 VRAM. &lt;a href="https://wccftech.com/intel-xe-hpg-gaming-discrete-graphics-cards-featuring-the-dg2-gpu-detailed/"&gt;Other rumors&lt;/a&gt; have indicated that Intel is working on an entire lineup of GPUs using the new architecture, spanning cheaper entry-level models to pricier options for power-hungry gaming enthusiasts. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA’s future Moon rocket completes critical hot-fire test</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pgl2po0g8ot2EBAJBRx9QrnsX1M=/693x0:3750x2038/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68989944/Screen_Shot_2021_03_18_at_4.56.43_PM.5.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oZGG3C"&gt;NASA test-fired the core stage of its massive Space Launch System rocket in Mississippi on Thursday. The team appeared to clinch its second attempt at a hot-fire run &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/16/22234891/nasa-sls-green-run-test-hot-fire-shutdown"&gt;after cutting short an initial firing in January&lt;/a&gt;. Pending a review of the test’s data, engineers are aiming to ship the rocket stage to Florida ahead of its debut test flight to the Moon under NASA’s Artemis program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGRvXO"&gt;Mounted in a behemoth test facility at NASA’s Stennis Space Center, the 212-foot-tall rocket stage’s four RS-25 engines ignited together for over eight minutes to test the conditions of a real liftoff. NASA and its prime contractor, Boeing, needed to reach at least four minutes of continuous test time to call it a success. With eight minutes, “they should have gotten what they need,” NASA spokeswoman Leigh D’Angelo said. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t5tXQWvlFEAStfFLThL7hxV37fk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22381057/NASA_Rocket_Test_2.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF by Nick Statt / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2MWmYj"&gt;“They clearly got the full duration they were after, which is really great news,” NASA’s Green Run campaign manager Bill Wrobel said right after the engines shut down. “Clearly there’s a lot of data that has to be analyzed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="stRt1q"&gt;The engine run was a crucial last step in the SLS program’s so-called Green Run test campaign. If the data checks out, it will make its way via boat to NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida for final assembly. The rocket’s first launch, Artemis I, will send an uncrewed Orion astronaut capsule on a trip around the Moon early next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5nFW9S"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B7NstH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="32SgH7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s big PlayStation game giveaways are the perfect ways to hide a precarious position</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lDWnjsa1FdVd9haQxLbMPWfu57E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68989834/vpavic_4278_20201030_0234.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fGg0x3"&gt;You may be wondering why Sony is giving away &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336370/horizon-zero-dawn-free-ps4-ps5-playstation-sony"&gt;good games for free&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s a thought:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="26qb9x"&gt;Sony knows you basically can’t buy a PS5 — and that its most exciting new games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538464/ps5-xbox-series-x-launch-games-list-new-release-holiday-2020-2021"&gt;won’t be out for months&lt;/a&gt; even if you could. Sony also knows there’s little it can do about that. It can’t magically fix &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278431/biden-administration-global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-executive-order"&gt;the global semiconductor shortage&lt;/a&gt; or bring an early end to the pandemic that’s caused numerous game delays &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21325659/game-developers-survey-coronavirus-gdc"&gt;as developers learn how to work from home&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mVPwwr"&gt;But Sony does have one way to bolster goodwill at the beginning of this console generation: it can tide over PlayStation fans by giving away a handful of its best games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y4lZly"&gt;On March 1st, Sony &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297009/ratchet-and-clank-free-ps4-ps5-playstation-sony"&gt;started giving away 2016’s &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;with no strings attached — no subscription required, just a free game for you to keep forever for your PS4 or PS5 console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8JegzJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;These titles aren’t shovelware; they’re great&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ve2Civ"&gt;On April 19th, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336370/horizon-zero-dawn-free-ps4-ps5-playstation-sony"&gt;it’ll start giving away 2017’s &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn,&lt;/em&gt; too&lt;/a&gt; — the &lt;em&gt;Complete Edition&lt;/em&gt;, so you’re also getting the Frozen Wilds DLC — plus a big bundle of excellent indie games starting on March 25th, including &lt;em&gt;ABZÛ,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Enter the Gungeon&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Rez Infinite, Subnautica,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Witness. &lt;/em&gt;Sony’s even throwing in four well-regarded PlayStation VR titles: &lt;em&gt;Astro Bot Rescue Mission&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Moss&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Thumper&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Paper Beast. &lt;/em&gt;None of these titles are shovelware: they’re all great, and Sony has said it’ll keep giving away games through June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zpPGpS"&gt;Sony calls this its “Play at Home” program, and it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21220964/sony-ps4-uncharted-the-nathan-drake-collection-free-home"&gt;originally pitched last year&lt;/a&gt; as a way to keep gamers home and socially distanced during the pandemic, which... sure. Let’s give it the benefit of the doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ml4Bt0"&gt;But as Epic Games has shown with its Epic Games Store, giving away old games for free is also a great way to kickstart a new gaming platform. Originally a glorified launcher for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Tournament_(cancelled_video_game)"&gt;the abandoned &lt;em&gt;Unreal Tournament&lt;/em&gt; successor&lt;/a&gt;, EGS brute-forced its way into becoming a bona fide Steam competitor &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254901/epic-games-store-accounts-daily-monthly-active-concurrent-users-storefront-2020-data"&gt;by giving away 749 million copies of games&lt;/a&gt; (not a typo) in 2020. Some of those users seem to have stuck around, seeing how they spent $265 million on third-party games last year alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lDfleQ"&gt;While Epic has never said how it can afford to give away thousands of dollars worth of games to any person for free, it probably isn’t hemorrhaging billions of dollars to make it happen. Many of them are older popular titles gamers are already likely to own elsewhere, so it’s not like they’re cannibalizing sales. I’d also be very surprised if Epic doesn’t have special deals with developers based on that (or, perhaps, to only pay when you actually launch and play these games). If Sony sticks to its own titles or ones where it can cut deals, it might be a relatively cheap way to build goodwill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zZZWBm"&gt;As we’ve discussed here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, one of the single most impressive things about the PS5 and Xbox Series X is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163921/ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-old-games-next-gen-consoles"&gt;how well they play&lt;em&gt; last-gen&lt;/em&gt; games right now&lt;/a&gt;. Both Sony and Microsoft decided to build with backwards compatibility in mind, only with next-gen SSDs for speedier load times and more horsepower to keep framerates high even with PS4 Pro and Xbox One X enhancements applied. Old favorites are worth playing all over again, and it’s a great way to catch up on what you’ve missed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="hveCVQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Epic Games Store users claimed 749 million free games last year","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254901/epic-games-store-accounts-daily-monthly-active-concurrent-users-storefront-2020-data"},{"title":"The PS5 and Xbox Series X made us fall back in love with old games","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22163921/ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-old-games-next-gen-consoles"},{"title":"There’s never been a better time to play video games","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21536084/video-games-ps4-ps5-xbox-series-x-among-us-animal-crossing"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="XQibda"&gt;But that’s only if you’ve got a PS5 and are willing to buy those games. Microsoft may have a more attractive alternative: not only is its Xbox Series X (somewhat) easier to buy, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/24/21336892/microsoft-xbox-series-x-game-pass-event-showcase-future"&gt;the company’s &lt;em&gt;true &lt;/em&gt;next-gen Xbox&lt;/a&gt; keeps getting stronger every month. I mean &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21437529/xbox-game-pass-versions-tier-ultimate-pc-console-explainer"&gt;Xbox Game Pass&lt;/a&gt;, the monthly subscription service that lets you play both back catalog titles and brand-new first-party-exclusive games on the Xbox One, Xbox Series consoles, Windows PCs, and even an early cloud gaming service that can beam them to your phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RUEVh7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/10/21430240/how-much-will-sony-ps5-cost-xbox-series-x-s-editorial"&gt;Last September&lt;/a&gt;, I predicted Sony would price the PS5 and disc-less PS5 Digital Edition at $500 and $400, respectively, because it was Sony’s race to lose. It was the one with a recent track record of hit exclusive games and the one actually making a case for next-gen with next-gen exclusives as well. But while Microsoft did have to delay &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;, it has since spent a staggering $7.5 billion &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325757/microsoft-xbox-bethesda-acquisition-game-pass-exclusive-games-phil-spencer-comment"&gt;buying Bethesda explicitly to add future exclusives&lt;/a&gt; to the Xbox Game Pass stable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Adbgw"&gt;Last week, Xbox Game Pass subscribers woke up to find &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325044/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-bethesda-games-list"&gt;nearly every modern &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fallout,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wolfenstein,&lt;/em&gt; and Arkane Studios game&lt;/a&gt; waiting for them on console, PC, and streaming from the cloud, many of them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22328089/microsoft-xbox-series-x-bethesda-frame-rate-boost-game-pass"&gt;quickly adding Xbox Series X performance boosts&lt;/a&gt;. Anecdotally, a few people have told me they changed their tune on the Xbox Series X after the Bethesda deal was announced. Earlier this month, Xbox Game Pass covered its bases for sports fans &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22311265/xbox-game-pass-nba-2k21-madden-nfl-21-nhl-21-ea-pass"&gt;with the latest Madden, NBA, and NHL games, too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Te9Okx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Will Sony break the cycle?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FrGaIm"&gt;At this point in the console cycle, gamers don’t really know which one of the consoles will “win,” or which launch promises will actually pan out. Historically, the company that sold the most consoles in a previous generation has become overconfident, arrogant, full of themselves. Sony expected gamers would pay “599 US dollars” for an overengineered PS3 on the back of its &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/e3-sony-2006-giant-enemy-crab"&gt;giant enemy crab&lt;/a&gt;, after the PS2 was a huge success. When the Xbox 360 became the obvious place for multiplayer gaming and early motion gaming, Microsoft bet its fortunes that customers would buy the Xbox One, a home entertainment hub that ran Windows where they’d shake their bodies in front of a bundled Microsoft Kinect. Much of that vision &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/13/5714362/without-kinect-xbox-is-just-a-console"&gt;disappeared a year later&lt;/a&gt;, but Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/22/15010540/video-game-exclusives-ps4-xbox-one-switch-zelda-horizon-scorpio-first-party"&gt;never caught up&lt;/a&gt; to Sony’s relentless focus on good, exclusive games for the PS4. (Nintendo had the Wii U. Enough said.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y1p147"&gt;Now, it’s Sony’s turn again, and gamers might be wondering if Sony has learned the lesson — whether it might manage to break the cycle of arrogant victors, particularly after some of Sony’s “PlayStation exclusives” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21444039/ps5-playstation-5-final-fantasy-xvi-demons-souls-pc-announcement"&gt;appeared to have some funny business going on&lt;/a&gt;. For its part, Sony has to be wondering how many would-be PS5 buyers might now give up if they manage to find an Xbox Series X or Xbox Series S in stock instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9wH9j9"&gt;But there are signs that Sony’s arrogance might be a thing of the past, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/7/22269634/how-sony-designed-ps5-dualsense-playstation-symbol-microtexture"&gt;that Sony is more self-aware now&lt;/a&gt;, and these free games are a huge step in the right direction. I think old Sony — the Sony that insisted on proprietary discs and memory sticks for years — would expect you to pay money to buy these games on the strength of its brand. New Sony is the company that gives you a free copy of &lt;em&gt;Astro’s Playroom &lt;/em&gt;with every PS5, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549072/astros-playroom-ps5-review-dualsense-controller"&gt;one of the best pack-in games&lt;/a&gt; ever made. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="3jjxH6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony is now part-owner of Evo, the most prestigious fighting game tournament</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sKcr6H5jzivbx0DUm5ofvSQ9H8k=/0x0:720x480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68989643/6051484ac3c9a940d27ac1fb_i_ZN8xk4M_X3.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Evo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Qfe28j"&gt;Sony and RTS, a new venture from Endeavor’s esports business, &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210318005890/en/"&gt;have acquired&lt;/a&gt; the prestigious Evo fighting game tournament through “a joint venture esports partnership.” The terms of the acquisition were not disclosed “due to contractual commitments.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="remkV7"&gt;“Fighting games have been a vital part of PlayStation’s legacy and our community since the very beginning, and we’ve been thrilled to partner with Evo over the years,” Steven Roberts, VP of global competitive gaming at Sony Interactive Entertainment, said in a press release. “This joint acquisition with RTS marks a new chapter of collaboration with Evo’s co-founders, Tom and Tony Cannon, and their passionate community of fighting game fans.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3icBFh"&gt;Tom and Tony Cannon also &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EVO/status/1372639787270639616"&gt;shared a message&lt;/a&gt; to the Evo community regarding the acquisition. “The new partnership is committed to bringing amazing tournaments and competitive gaming experiences back to you this year and beyond,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EVO/status/1372639787270639616"&gt;they said&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hkysTI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A message to our community. For more information visit &lt;a href="https://t.co/6JHZCsJsXr"&gt;https://t.co/6JHZCsJsXr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/uj0NKRW30m"&gt;pic.twitter.com/uj0NKRW30m&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— EVO (@EVO) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EVO/status/1372639787270639616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KlA9qG"&gt;The organizations also announced that Evo will be back this year as &lt;a href="https://www.evo.gg/"&gt;Evo Online&lt;/a&gt;, a virtual fighting game competition happening from August 6th–8th and August 13th–15th. Players can compete in tournaments for &lt;em&gt;Guilty Gear Strive&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat 11: Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Street Fighter V: Champion Edition&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Tekken 7&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMvZIw"&gt;“Our collective team is laser-focused on one mission: preserving the authenticity of Evo for the fighting game community and finding creative ways, alongside our fans, to grow the tournament and make its events and broadcasts more fun, engaging and accessible than ever,” &lt;a href="https://www.sie.com/en/blog/welcoming-evo-into-the-playstation-family/"&gt;Sony said in its blog&lt;/a&gt;. “At its core, Evo will remain what it has always been: an open-format competition that gives fighting game fans from different countries a chance to connect, test their skills, and forge new friendships.” The Cannons will remain “remain closely involved in an advisory role,” according to Sony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyaKIt"&gt;Last year, Evo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/1/21244580/evo-2020-fighting-game-tournament-online-only-covid-19-coronavirus-pandemic"&gt;was scheduled&lt;/a&gt; to take place online in the summer because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/3/21312385/evo-online-cancelled-sexual-misconduct-allegations"&gt;it was canceled&lt;/a&gt; after co-founder and president Joey Cuellar was accused of sexual misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ERMOHm"&gt;“We want to reaffirm that harassment or abuse of any kind has no place within Evo or any of our future events, and we’re taking every precaution to make sure members of our community will always be treated with the respect, dignity and decency you deserve,” the Cannons said &lt;a href="https://www.evo.gg/letter"&gt;in their statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QMEoQ"&gt;Evo will be operated by the new joint venture between Sony and RTS, the new venture from Endeavor. (&lt;a href="http://www.endeavorco.com/story/"&gt;Endeavor&lt;/a&gt; offers talent representation, event management services, and other services for sports, entertainment, and other industries.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Fy4Ea"&gt;“Evo is a unique and iconic community unlike any other in the fighting game space, and we’re proud to be partnering with the SIE team and the legends that are Tom and Tony—as well as Mark Julio as Head of Business Development—to help grow Evo,” Stuart Saw, CEO of RTS, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The federal government is investigating yet another Tesla Autopilot crash</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zpHTyPpRQlLmy4Zkv1_eIuZfw7Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68989522/acastro_180524_1777_tesla_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XSgllG"&gt;The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating another Tesla crash in which Autopilot was allegedly in use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tvHHIM"&gt;The crash took place outside of Lansing, Michigan, when the driver of a Tesla Model Y smashed into a state trooper’s cruiser. Michigan police said the driver was using Autopilot, Tesla’s advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS), at the time of the crash. No one was injured, but the government sent investigators to the scene to determine how Autopilot may have contributed to the crash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VbHfWv"&gt;“NHTSA is aware of the incident involving a Tesla vehicle near Lansing, Michigan,” a spokesperson said in a statement. “Consistent with NHTSA’s vigilant oversight and robust authority over the safety of all motor vehicles and equipment, including automated technologies, we have launched a Special Crash Investigation team to investigate the crash.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nIQuit"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is the latest crash involving a Tesla to be scrutinized by federal investigators&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1MvkER"&gt;This is the latest crash involving a Tesla to be scrutinized by federal investigators. NHTSA has sent teams to inspect similar crashes involving Teslas that took place in recent weeks in Houston and Detroit. Local law enforcement has said it doesn’t believe Autopilot was involved in the Detroit crash, but they have yet to make the same determination in Houston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rWp8SE"&gt;This is also the latest incident to involve a driver using Autopilot crashing into a stationary object. There have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/17/18629214/tesla-autopilot-crash-death-josh-brown-jeremy-banner"&gt;at least two fatal crashes&lt;/a&gt; in which a Tesla owner has smashed into a stopped vehicle, and Tesla has yet to address it in any meaningful way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z7IjCS"&gt;Tesla didn’t respond to a request for comment, likely because the company has dissolved its press office and typically doesn’t respond to media requests anymore. In the past, Tesla has warned its customers that Autopilot is not an autonomous driving system and still requires constant attention to the road while in use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IGd0FW"&gt;At the same time, the company recently rolled out a beta version of Autopilot called “Full Self Driving” that has given many people the false impression that Tesla vehicles are autonomous and don’t require drivers to pay attention to the road. Tesla recently expanded the number of people who have access to the beta software. “Still be careful, but it’s getting mature,” CEO &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1368017749851598850?s=20"&gt;Elon Musk tweeted&lt;/a&gt; recently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2T1bGv"&gt;Tesla has a checkered history with the NHTSA, the federal agency that can issue recalls and investigate automobile crashes. The agency has investigated multiple fatal crashes involving Autopilot. Last year, the National Transportation Safety Board concluded that the ADAS was one of the probable causes of a fatal 2018 crash, in which a California man was killed after his Model X smashed into a concrete barrier. Later, the chair of the safety board said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21152984/tesla-autopilot-safety-recommendations-ignored-ntsb-crash-hearing"&gt;Tesla was ignoring its recommendations&lt;/a&gt;. And last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21530411/teslas-full-self-driving-beta-test-nhtsa"&gt;a spokesperson for NHTSA said the agency was “monitoring”&lt;/a&gt; the rollout of Tesla’s Full Self Driving software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g9VpHH"&gt;Safety advocates decried Tesla’s decision to test its driver-assistance software on its customers as irresponsible. The executive director of the Center for Auto Safety accused Tesla of “intentionally misleading the public regarding the capabilities and shortcomings of their technology,” &lt;a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2021-03-17/us-sends-investigators-to-probe-another-michigan-tesla-crash"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton CEO says accident involving treadmill resulted in child’s death</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Ethan Miller / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9HmZLA"&gt;A child was killed in an accident involving the Peloton’s Tread Plus treadmill, &lt;a href="https://support.onepeloton.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058677091-A-Note-from-Peloton-CEO-John-Foley-about-Tread-"&gt;Peloton CEO John Foley said&lt;/a&gt; in a note posted to the company website Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNlFzD"&gt;“I’m reaching out to you today because I recently learned about a tragic accident involving a child and the Tread+, resulting in, unthinkably, a death,” Foley wrote. “While we are aware of only a small handful of incidents involving the Tread+ where children have been hurt, each one is devastating to all of us at Peloton, and our hearts go out to the families involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ye7EUi"&gt;Peloton declined to provide further details about the child, the incident, or the “handful of previous incidents” Foley referenced. But &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-18/peloton-ceo-says-accident-with-treadmill-led-to-death-of-child?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a report &lt;a href="https://www.saferproducts.gov/PublicSearch/Detail?ReportId=3054628"&gt;filed in February&lt;/a&gt; with the Consumer Product Safety Commission mentions a second, separate incident with a Tread Plus treadmill where a three-year-old boy suffered a “significant brain injury.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kXQT6V"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A child in a second incident had tread marks on his back and other injuries&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f2jEPk"&gt;The report states the child had “tread marks on his back,” a neck injury, and facial injuries. That report was updated with a note from Peloton on March 17th, saying the company had been told the child would “fully recover.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HIWfu4"&gt;The company’s statement on Thursday said that the Tread Plus was designed and tested for use by people over 16 and weighing more than 105 pounds. “Additionally, when the Tread+ is not in use Members should continue to follow the safety instructions by storing the safety key, which keeps the Tread+ from operating, away from the Tread+ and out of reach of children,” it says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U6fENp"&gt;Foley warned that children and pets should be kept “away from Peloton exercise equipment at all times. Before you begin a workout, double check to make sure that the space around your Peloton exercise equipment is clear.” He also said the company is “currently assessing ways to reinforce our warnings about these critical safety precautions to hopefully prevent future accidents.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qIzBXL"&gt;Despite their somewhat &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22238974/peloton-bike-plus-review-price-features"&gt;expensive price tags&lt;/a&gt;, Peloton’s stationary bikes and treadmills have been hugely popular during the coronavirus pandemic, with most gyms closed and people social distancing at home. The company reported that &lt;a href="https://investor.onepeloton.com/static-files/1d578332-048e-4b0c-8909-b532c100f65d"&gt;its revenue increased 66 percent&lt;/a&gt; year over year in the first three months of 2020. The company &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/peloton-customers-complain-delays-cancellations-during-lockdown-2020-6?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T"&gt;struggled&lt;/a&gt; to keep up with the demand for its products early on, however. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eYfl6O"&gt;In October, &lt;a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/Peloton-Recalls-PR70P-Bike-Pedals-Due-to-Laceration-Hazard-Recall-Alert?inline-read-more"&gt;Peloton issued a recall&lt;/a&gt; for clip-in pedals on about 27,000 of its bikes following reports of broken pedals that caused injuries, including several that required medical care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KtbfrR"&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/27/the-danger-of-treadmills/"&gt;25,000 children are injured&lt;/a&gt; annually in home exercise-related equipment accidents. One of the most common types of injury is friction burns that happen when a child touches a moving belt on a machine. In 2009, boxer Mike Tyson’s four-year-old daughter, Exodus, was &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=7677067"&gt;killed in a treadmill accident&lt;/a&gt; after a cord wrapped around her neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sd9q4d"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 18th, 4:31 PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added detail about a February incident involving a 3-year-old boy being injured on a Peloton treadmill&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Barnes &amp; Noble will reveal a Lenovo-made Nook tablet next week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/32xbMsLNfiu72kJ82P8VBmQc0iE=/76x0:889x542/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68989378/NOOKphoto.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Barnes &amp;amp; Noble&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JPlW6b"&gt;Barnes &amp;amp; Noble’s line of Nook e-readers isn’t dead yet. The company has confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that despite running out of stock, it still plans to sell its Kindle competitors once new units arrive in stores later this spring. In fact, there’s a previously unannounced tablet that the company will imminently reveal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDj0b6"&gt;Susan McCulloch, Barnes &amp;amp; Noble’s senior director for Nook operations, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company will bring back its Nook tablet line with “a new NOOK tablet designed with Lenovo” that it will reveal next week. Barnes &amp;amp; Noble’s most recent Nook tablet &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/11/5/18065106/barnes-and-noble-nook-tablet-10-1-release-price"&gt;was the $129 10.1-inch Nook&lt;/a&gt;, its largest Android tablet ever. But it, along with every other Android tablet from Barnes &amp;amp; Noble, has been &lt;a href="https://goodereader.com/blog/barnes-and-noble-nook-ereader-news/will-barnes-and-noble-sell-tablets-again"&gt;unavailable to purchase since last July&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V5mR51"&gt;Currently, the Nook GlowLight 3 and GlowLight Plus e-readers share a similar fate, as both are listed as completely sold out online. It’s apparently the first time both products have been unavailable at the same time, according to &lt;a href="https://goodereader.com/blog/barnes-and-noble-nook-ereader-news/barnes-and-noble-nook-e-readers-are-sold-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Good e-Reader&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Some stores still list in-store stock available, which has led to speculation that Barnes &amp;amp; Noble might be discontinuing the Nook line entirely — something we’ve seen happen before with products &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22328436/apple-discontinues-original-homepod-mini"&gt;like Apple’s HomePod&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RyqTnX"&gt;But the lack of stock is actually due to “exceptionally strong” sales of the two products, which McCulloch credits to an increase in reading over the past year. “As problems go, of course, this is a bitter-sweet one for a retailer,” she added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4ksCx"&gt;That would be impressive, given the Nook GlowLight 3 and GlowLight Plus are more than slightly outdated. (The GlowLight 3 was released in 2017, while the larger GlowLight Plus is almost two years old.) But it seems the dwindling supply is just due to increased demand, as opposed to Barnes &amp;amp; Noble planning refreshed models or an exit from the e-reader business entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9xi3QK"&gt;Despite the odds, instead of folding, it seems the Nook brand is about to get yet another refresh in the coming weeks. Barnes &amp;amp; Noble isn’t letting its older e-reader hardware or the incredibly oversaturated Android tablet market stand in its way.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The NYT Cooking Facebook group was half-baked, so the Times is throwing it out</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yTzO9ZG4_0hbKDRGRye_kxqDp0A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68989310/acastro_180501_1777_facebook_dating_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / Th&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="egtEAb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;Cooking Facebook group will soon no longer bear the name of the publication: the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; has given up on controlling it and is taking its name off the group. According to a note posted in the group &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/erinbiba/status/1372380021483048969"&gt;(which was then reposted to Twitter)&lt;/a&gt;, control of the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/nytcooks/"&gt;private 77,000-member Facebook group&lt;/a&gt; will be given over to members of the community who are interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k6FUhn"&gt;The reactions from members of the group have been... something else, with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/erinbiba/status/1372389826620690433?s=20"&gt;one commenter saying&lt;/a&gt; the group was full of “Aunt Lydias” (a reference to the dystopian rule enforcers of &lt;em&gt;The Handmaid’s Tale&lt;/em&gt;) and “hall monitors.” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ITooAmRJ/status/1372516315777351687?s=20"&gt;Another said&lt;/a&gt; they would delete the group, “freeing us all from this retched prison,” if given moderation powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WaEJ5I"&gt;In a post to the group by the &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;announcing the change, the company explains that it had become clear the group was interested in “much more than recipes or The New York Times.” While it’s understandable that moderating a special-interest group can be difficult in the best of circumstances, according to journalist Erin Biba, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/erinbiba/status/1372384590481010689?s=20"&gt;there were only four moderators&lt;/a&gt; to supervise the nearly 80,000 users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fja2bs"&gt;As for why the &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;stepped away from the private group, it doesn’t seem like the decision was made in reaction to a specific incident. &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; columnist Ben Smith &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/benyt/status/1372550435836399616?s=20"&gt;reached out&lt;/a&gt; to the paper’s assistant managing editor, Sam Sifton, to ask why the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; was backing away from the group, and he responded that it is because the group was “a lot of people who want to post pictures of their dogs next to their soufflé.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fezl9M"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;OK, I have reported this out. Per &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SamSifton?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@SamSifton&lt;/a&gt;, there was no precipitating crisis, simply a realization that "it's a lot of people who want to post pictures of their dogs next to their soufflé" and "not a place where we were going to March people toward NYT Cooking." 1/&lt;/p&gt;— Ben Smith (@benyt) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/benyt/status/1372560011503734797?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hFdQNx"&gt;The group has &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/laurenstrapagiel/new-york-times-cooking-facebook-group-turned-political"&gt;run into moderation issues before&lt;/a&gt;. It had a “no political views” rule, which a member broke around election season after a post advocating for a certain candidate. It seems that now, the group will have to decide for itself what it wants to be, separate from &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yzEJRR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I am ready for the New York Times Cooking Community autonomous zone &lt;a href="https://t.co/roGDjJaH5e"&gt;https://t.co/roGDjJaH5e&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— julia reinstein   (@juliareinstein) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/juliareinstein/status/1372388249461739520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
