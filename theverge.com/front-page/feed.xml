    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q7YEna"&gt;Amazon’s Prime Day for 2021 may happen on June 21st and 22nd, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-27/amazon-said-to-hold-prime-day-sales-event-june-21-and-22"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Last year’s Prime member-exclusive shopping holiday was delayed until October due to the pandemic. In years prior, Amazon had hosted Prime Day in the summer. But with June upon us, this could mean one of the best times to buy tech, games, movies, and more could be just around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l2fyfh"&gt;We’ll have that covered end-to-end with all of the best deals. But here are the tech deals you need to know about today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="REz9N9"&gt;
&lt;p id="4Y0XpS"&gt;A couple of Beats headphone models with noise cancellation are seeing big discounts today. Firstly, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YVYNM3N?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Beats Solo Pro at Amazon are down to $150&lt;/a&gt; (originally $300), and notably, this sale price is for the black, gray, and ivory colorways that aren’t frequently looped into big price cuts. These are on-ear headphones with Apple’s H1 wireless chip that allows hands-free “Hey Siri” commands. The black model is currently backordered until June 10th at Amazon, but other colors are in stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nAx7jx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10436511"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AG4vGY"&gt;If you want all-encompassing sound, the Beats Studio 3 might be a better choice because of their over-ear design. Originally $350, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1741737748299677012#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085296FLT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; are selling the shadow gray and matte black colorways for $220. Like the newer Solo Pro, these offer noise cancellation, and its ear cups can fold inward to make them easier to stow in a bag. The Studio 3 are older than the Solo Pro (they were released in 2017), and they have Apple’s older W1 wireless chip. They’ll still quickly pair with Apple devices, but these don’t offer hands-free Siri commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yMnzzq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10521384"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RaRuum"&gt;Sony is hosting a Days of Play sale that includes some of the &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/category/518b9425-a874-447f-b286-002ceca36cbf/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first big price cuts on digital PS5 games as well as many PS4 titles&lt;/a&gt; that will see visual upgrades when running on PS5. If you’d rather have discs instead of downloading games, you can find discounts on many of these games at other retailers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="irxtCx"&gt;Before I get into calling out some favorites, I want to note that digital storefront Eneba is offering a deal on $50 PlayStation gift cards that you can use to purchase games, DLC, and more from the PS Store. Once you &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeDeals052821&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-50-usa-psn-key-united-states%2Fjetpak" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;add this gift card to your cart&lt;/a&gt;, enter the code &lt;strong&gt;DAYSOF50PROMO &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout to see the price drop down to $43.49 (or lower).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HVMBks"&gt;Now, for a few games that are on sale:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pyHayh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226091"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Ru5do2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9591232"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="2XIfqK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10521407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="wS9LVq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568461"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KQQXcH"&gt;If you’re making plans to head outdoors for a camping trip, BioLite’s CampStove 2 Plus seems like a smart purchase for both staying warm and keeping your phone charged. It’s a portable stove that can provide 3W of electricity to its built-in 3,200mAh battery when a fire is going. Usually $150, it’s down to $113 until May 31st, 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QDVlGK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10521431"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g2PiTn"&gt;Lastly, you can get $50 off the usual going price for Google’s 10-inch Nest Hub Max that has a built-in camera for video calls via Zoom or Google Meet. &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fga00426us.html&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Adorama is offering this deal&lt;/a&gt;, and you can get it yourself by adding the smart display to your cart, then use the offer code &lt;strong&gt;EXTRA50OFF &lt;/strong&gt;to bring the price down to $180.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2OaXbK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9625470"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="SEImcy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Nine things we learned from the Epic v. Apple trial</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Epic-Apple Trial Hangs Over Some 50,000 Games On App Store" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QvWjpsyzhn-QaXVWIPxFHZ2LJao=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69350409/1233086757.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ThdAUl"&gt;It’s been just over three weeks since the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; proceedings kicked off, and the news has been relentless. So as we wait for a verdict to roll in, we’re taking a quick turn through all the biggest takeaways from the trial. A lot of the juiciest points didn’t speak directly to the verdict — like the profit structure of the Xbox or the troubled history of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; crossplay — but that’s part of the fun of a massive trans-corporate dustup like this. Once you start digging through CEO Tim Cook’s inbox, all sorts of interesting stuff comes out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="1BNyLu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1] Apple keeps iMessage closed in order to sell more iPhones&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="WI4baB"&gt;We’ve known for a while that Apple isn’t going to make iMessage available outside of iOS devices, but this trial showed exactly how thoroughly Apple has considered expanding iMessage into other operating systems — and exactly why the company doesn’t want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J0FX3w"&gt;Internal emails show Eddy Cue pushing to expand iMessage into a WhatsApp-style messaging platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406303/imessage-android-eddy-cue-emails-apple-epic-deposition"&gt;as early as 2013&lt;/a&gt; — and the issue reemerging in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375128/apple-imessage-android-ecosystem-lock-in-epic-games-filings-app-store-dispute"&gt;an email to Phil Schiller in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. The idea was rejected for the same reason both times: opening up iMessage would just mean one less reason to buy an iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YKMGWs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sony saw ‘Fortnite’ crossplay as a business liability&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="5EXf53"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2] PlayStation’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fortnite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; crossplay deal is even sketchier than we realized&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="wrxQdG"&gt;Sony took its time enabling crossplay between different console versions of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, eventually relenting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/26/17905146/sony-fortnite-ps4-cross-play-support"&gt;late in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417560/sony-ps4-cross-play-confidential-documents-epic-games-agreements"&gt;a handful of new emails with Epic Games&lt;/a&gt; showed the deal was even knottier than was publicly known. Apparently, Sony saw crossplay as a business liability for its business and was only willing to adopt it after Epic agreed to a complicated cross-platform revenue sharing agreement. It’s a unique arrangement — but since we also learned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407939/fortnite-biggest-platform-revenue-playstation-not-ios-iphone"&gt;PlayStation is the top revenue driver for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Epic seems to have been willing to make concessions for the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sjPoT0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3] Apple pulled out all the stops to keep Netflix selling subscriptions on the iPhone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Vjt96K"&gt;Apple insists it treats all App Store developers equally, but it’s clear big players like Amazon have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206400/apple-tax-amazon-tv-prime-30-percent-developers"&gt;gotten special treatment&lt;/a&gt; because of their sheer number of users. This trial turned up another instance, with emails that showed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421734/apple-epic-netflix-in-app-purchase-removal-emails"&gt;Apple employees scrambling behind the scenes&lt;/a&gt; to keep Netflix from removing in-app purchases from its iPhone app in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s3gsZx"&gt;For Netflix, the logic was hard to avoid: Apple’s 30 percent cut was costing it money any time someone signed up through the iOS app instead of through a web browser. But for a while, Apple was willing to do just about anything to keep Netflix from giving in to the obvious economics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="3OCcP0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple says it doesn’t know how much money the App Store makes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0baW1c"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4] The App Store is wildly profitable, but Apple won’t admit it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="lVNJHf"&gt;One of the running jokes of the trial was Apple’s insistence that it had no idea how much money the App Store makes in profit. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thedextriarchy/status/1394710317033312257"&gt;Phil Schiller said outright&lt;/a&gt; that he had no idea if the App Store had brought in more money than it spent since 2009 “because that’s not how I look at the business.” (For context, the App Store brought in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220873/apple-2020-app-store-revenue-60-billion-dollars"&gt;more than $60 billion in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, which would be quite a lot to burn through without realizing.) Tim Cook was a little bit more reserved, saying he &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thedextriarchy/status/1395773390632464384"&gt;believed it was profitable&lt;/a&gt; but hadn’t calculated by how much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ENvdpj"&gt;The firmest number came from an expert witness hired by the Epic side, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22414402/epic-expert-apple-app-store-fortnite-court-profit"&gt;pegged the profit margin as high as 78 percent&lt;/a&gt;. That would leave Apple with more than $45 billion in profit from the App Store alone — but don’t expect them to admit it out loud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="H5FEcb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5] The economics of the Xbox is kind of weird&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HXfXr6"&gt;Microsoft was a kind of unofficial sidekick to Epic for the trial, providing executives to testify in court and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22411686/microsoft-windows-store-game-fees-change-apple-app-store-epic-games-eu"&gt;abruptly lowering its Windows Store fees&lt;/a&gt; to put extra pressure on Apple. But the most exciting turn came when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421570/epic-apple-trial-iphone-xbox-console-specific-general-purpose-pc-testimony-day-3"&gt;Xbox boss Lori Wright took the stand&lt;/a&gt;, testifying that Microsoft doesn’t make money from Xbox hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qrBtuz"&gt;For lawyers on the Epic side, the goal was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421570/epic-apple-trial-iphone-xbox-console-specific-general-purpose-pc-testimony-day-3"&gt;to distinguish the Xbox from the iPhone&lt;/a&gt;: Microsoft sells Xbox hardware at a loss (or a near-loss), so the company’s approach is different from Apple, which makes money off every iPhone it sells. But any new information about the Xbox business was interesting far beyond Epic and Apple, so things started to spiral almost immediately. Microsoft’s official PR was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422691/microsoft-xbox-consoles-profit-software-services-revenue-apple-epic-games-trial"&gt;quick to walk back the claim&lt;/a&gt;, making sure everyone knew that the overall Xbox business is profitable in spite of the hardware subsidy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J1wVhe"&gt;Apple pressed the issue even further, trying to force Microsoft to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22424668/epic-apple-antitrust-lawsuit-microsoft-xbox-profitability-lori-wright"&gt;release its profit-and-loss statements for the Xbox business&lt;/a&gt; if it wanted to keep Wright’s testimony in the record. It was a chance to see serious jousting between some of the biggest companies in the world — and a reminder of how knotty these businesses are once you look under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0PF2az"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Epic has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on its PC gaming storefront&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="J7EJUA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6] The economics of the Epic Games Store is even weirder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="lNvyLF"&gt;In the lead-up to the trial, &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; case filings showed Epic has spent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22380895/epic-games-store-afford-give-away-17-5-billion-free-games"&gt;hundreds of millions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; on its PC gaming storefront. Much of that went toward pricey deals to attract developers and consumers, including a free games program that earned Epic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22418782/epic-games-store-free-games-cost-apple-trial-arkham-subnautica-mutant-year-zero"&gt;millions of new users&lt;/a&gt; while offering developers a flat fee for participation. Epic also tried to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22424596/epic-games-store-sony-playstation-pc-games-steam-competition"&gt;get Sony and Microsoft’s first-party games&lt;/a&gt; on the Epic Games Store, although it apparently never reached a deal over them. Tim Sweeney said in testimony that he expects the store to turn a profit around 2024 — although Epic has apparently planned out &lt;a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-05-04-epic-expects-epic-games-store-to-be-profitable-by-2024"&gt;several possible scenarios&lt;/a&gt; for its future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="l1nXkR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7] Apple gains a lot by slow-walking progressive web apps on the iPhone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6Kwnxt"&gt;In theory, there’s a way to get software onto iPhones that doesn’t include the App Store. iPhones include web browsers, after all, and there’s a whole range of technologies (usually bundled under the name Progressive Web Apps or PWAs) that are intended &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22421912/iphone-web-app-pwa-cloud-gaming-epic-v-apple-safari"&gt;to make the functionality of an app available through a browser&lt;/a&gt;. Google has been pushing this hard with some support from Microsoft and Twitter — but so far, mobile Safari has been slow to roll out support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gXM4gs"&gt;We didn’t get any new documents saying exactly why that is, but we did get a whole lot of Apple executives saying how important it was for Apple to be able to protect iPhone users from bad apps. In short, Apple sees its stranglehold on iOS software as an important security feature — and progressive web apps threaten that stranglehold. As long as that stays true, it’s hard to imagine mobile Safari catching up in PWA support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="xcTgVI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8] Apple is still worried about malware downloads on the Mac&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="h5TMVg"&gt;One of Epic’s big challenges to Apple is why the company can’t run the iPhone the same way it runs the Mac: with a central app store but lots of other ways to get software outside of it. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444353/mac-malware-not-acceptable-craig-federighi-apple-epic"&gt;On the stand&lt;/a&gt;, Craig Federighi had a simple answer: we don’t actually like how it works on the Mac. Federighi said the level of malware on the Mac was “unacceptable” and that iOS would get “run over” by malware attacks if it adopted the same model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ny71ka"&gt;The whole point of the trial is to maintain App Store exclusivity, so it’s no surprise that Federighi wanted to shut the door — but the sheer anxiety he showed about Mac malware came as a bit of a surprise. It’s particularly notable since &lt;a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2019/04/22/the-true-and-false-security-benefits-of-mac-app-notarization/"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1153814930832777222?s=20"&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; are worried that macOS is inching toward the iOS model, making it a little more difficult to install unauthorized software with each new version. If you were already anxious about the Mac ecosystem closing off entirely, Federighi’s testimony gave you plenty more to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="adApDl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9] Tim Sweeney has been bugging Tim Cook about this for years&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Y95iVl"&gt;Arguably the funniest part of the trial has been the sheer determination of Tim Sweeney to unwind Apple’s app store policies. The fight became public when &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; went nuclear last year, but new emails from Sweeney show he’s been trying to charm, cajole, and annoy Apple into allowing alternate app stores for years now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RsQDff"&gt;That effort peaked with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419618/tim-sweeney-email-tim-cook-wwdc-2015-ios-open-platform-antitrust"&gt;a 2015 email directly to Cook&lt;/a&gt;, laying out the case for an open iOS over the course of four paragraphs. (Cook responded to Schiller and Cue: “Is this the guy that was at one of our rehearsals?”) Three years later, Sweeney was &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20697673-px-2421"&gt;still trying&lt;/a&gt;, pressing the case through the various developer-relations channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXAerr"&gt;Of course, Tim Cook is not going to change Apple’s business model just because some guy emailed him saying it would be a good idea — but there’s no harm in trying, right?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer’s new SpatialLabs tech brings 3D content to laptop screens</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A user uses Acer’s SpatialLabs on a ConceptD notebook at a desk with a pair of glasses to the left side and pens behind, holding a stylus. A 3D model of a building pops out from the screen with a blue background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2jfffIV4EKb72lD88Wizq44xayM=/234x0:2766x1688/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69350338/SpatialLabs_Lifestyle_02.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It doesn’t actually look this polished, but this is the general idea.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Acer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s2hkal"&gt;Acer has announced SpatialLabs, a new 3D technology that will debut on the company’s ConceptD laptops. I got a chance to try it. It’s not something we’ll realistically see on a consumer device anytime soon — but it’s pretty dang cool nonetheless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BySL9R"&gt;SpatialLabs is, according to Acer, “a suite of experiences empowered by cutting-edge optical solutions.” Plainly, it’s a set of tools that makes 3D work look very realistic and cool without requiring special glasses to see it. It delivers content in Stereoscopic 3D, which presents a pair of nearly-but-not-quite-identical 2D images (one to each eye) that combine in your brain to look like one 3D picture. (It’s essentially imitating what your eyes already do.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="56cYHp"&gt;SpatialLabs uses a combination of three things to do this. There’s a stereo camera, consisting of two image sensors, in the laptop’s top bezel, which tracks the position of your eyes and head. There’s an optical lens bonded to the top of the display; the images for each eye are projected through this lens, then refracted to your eyes. And there’s real-time rendering technology inside, which allows you to rotate and move 3D models in certain applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xSfNsg"&gt;That means there are some limitations to how SpatialLabs can be used. For one, only one person can use it at a time; Acer emphasized that I couldn’t have anyone behind me during my demo. You also can’t have a mask on during use and can’t have strong light behind you. And needless to say, you need a powerful system to run this stuff well: Acer sent me a ConceptD 7 Pro with an eight-core Core i7-10875H, an Nvidia Quadro RTX 3000, and 32GB of RAM to test the tech. One of these would cost &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://store.acer.com/en-us/conceptd-7-pro-laptop-cn715-71p-727w?internal_source=us.acer.com&amp;amp;internal_medium=referral&amp;amp;internal_campaign=CLM&amp;amp;internal_content=NX.C59AA.004" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$2,899.99&lt;/a&gt; without the SpatialLabs features, and Acer didn’t specify how much the extra stuff would add to the cost. Regardless, I’m sure it’ll be well outside of my price range, but I can dream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ILXSMh"&gt;Acer showed me SpatialLabs at work in both proprietary and third-party software. In SpatialLabs Model Viewer, which professionals would use to showcase 3D models, I was able to play around with some animated 3D objects. The light and shadows change as the objects move, and you can adjust the light’s intensity and the direction it’s coming from. The very neat thing, though, is that you can move the objects along the Z-axis (that is, pull them toward you and push them away from you), and it looks surprisingly realistic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oVZ8N8"&gt;The experience that really blew me away, though, was SpatialLabs Player, where you can play videos in stereoscopic 3D. You can swap between 3D mode and 2D mode (where you’ll see two images side by side). What I saw wasn’t seamless — there was visible ghosting, especially right after I moved my head — but things really looked like they were popping out of the screen at me. I ducked as a flurry of baseballs was thrown my way. I reached out and tried to touch a flying alien because it looked very real, and I am 12 years old. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zdtIiN"&gt;This isn’t the first time we’ve seen glasses-free 3D on a portable device, of course. All kinds of devices have tried it in the past, from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/10/24/2509085/htc-evo-3d-review"&gt;smartphones&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21441096/nintendo-3ds-production-discontinued-total-sales"&gt;Nintendo’s 3DS&lt;/a&gt;. But this was the first iteration I’ve ever seen where turning my head an inch to the left didn’t ruin the entire thing. It was quite impressive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PLy38o"&gt;You can also edit content in 2D on an external display while viewing it in real-time stereoscopic 3D on the ConceptD, using Maya through PiStage (which allows you to quickly present projects with Unreal Engine) or Blender through SpatialLabs Go. You can also use the latter to view YouTube content that was created for VR or 3D TV.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A user views a 3D model of black headphones on a white ConceptD notebook with a blue background. To its left is a pile of three notebooks, a notepad, and a small potted plant. The user holds a coffee in their right hand. Behind the notebook are two external monitors where the user edits a 2D version of the image in editing software. To the right of the desk is a bookshelf." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MF2kpobylFWLGH3paaBcK3ZrPgw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539389/SpatialLabs_Lifestyle_01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Acer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This could be you, for just $3,000. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iwzmhz"&gt;Finally, SpatialLabs supports Unreal Engine through Acer’s XR Runtime. You could use these to create and present 3D “experiences” (such as virtual showrooms). Acer is running a beta program for Unreal Engine developers and will loan admitted participants a free ConceptD SpatialLabs notebook for three months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W2COPs"&gt;I saw a demo of a game, with all kinds of battle debris flying out of the screen at me, and one of a virtual furniture showroom, which I could wander around in. The ConceptD had trouble with both of these on the first run; the game was stuttery, and the showroom froze and wouldn’t close. Acer says that’s not uncommon due to how demanding the programs are, and restarting the system would do the trick. It did, and they worked fine the second time. But Acer does still have a kink or two to work out, it seems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LnCmEc"&gt;These were all quite fun for me to experience as a layperson. But the main benefit of this technology, of course, would be for users who actually work with 3D. So I asked &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s senior motion designer, Grayson Blackmon, whether something like this would actually be useful for his workflow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zzwg3A"&gt;Blackmon was largely dubious. While he finds the idea of editing models in 3D intriguing, he’s not sure what the practical benefit would be for creators like him. “A lot of times, we’re creating for people who don’t have these technologies who are viewing a 2D image,” he told me. Blackmon also can’t see himself doing these kinds of tasks on a laptop. “If I’m getting into serious work, I’m usually sitting at a desktop,” he says. He’d be more interested if SpatialLabs were built into a bigger monitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="22txky"&gt;But designers like Blackmon are also used to new technologies not holding up to their promises. His team usually holds off on updating to new versions of Adobe, for example, because they bring new bugs, and novel fancy-looking features tend not to be as helpful as they appear. For that reason, Blackmon doesn’t see himself being an early adopter of this kind of tech. “I might do it for my own personal enjoyment, but I’m not going to rely on it for production,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SCZvvg"&gt;So that’s where we are. There are a number of caveats to SpatialLabs. It may be a while before we see professionals adopting it in full force and even longer before consumers can realistically try it out. (Acer is shooting to have SpatialLabs on the market sometime later this year.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o0DYDQ"&gt;But hey, Acer does have a working product. And it’s very cool to witness. If nothing else, like so many other laptop technologies out there, it’s a possible glimpse of the future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer’s Predator Triton 500 SE has a new 16:10 Mini LED display</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Acer Predator Triton 500 SE on a yellow tablecloth in a garden, open. The screen displays the Planet9 logo on a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fo1TFdG0ifOyE3OumCpR5qZHyuc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69350337/mchin_210526_4605_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Take it in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wMyYl4"&gt;There’s a new Acer Predator in town: the 16-inch Predator Triton 500 SE. It has a new subtle design with a touch of RGB as well as the latest chips from Intel and Nvidia. It also has a feature that I am much too excited about: a 16:10 display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uEJXSc"&gt;Put this next to the previous &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Acer-Predator-i7-8750H-Keyboard-PT515-51-71VV/dp/B07NDVGYZQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Triton 500&lt;/a&gt;, and this device looks much more like something you might bring to a meeting or a lecture. It’s not quite as flashy. The last model’s glowing Triton logo has been removed from the center of the lid and squeezed into the top-right corner. The previous Triton also had “Predator” printed along the large bottom bezel, which has been replaced by a smaller and subtler Triton logo as well. The corners are sharper, the keyboard is a bit blacker — it’s a more modern, professional look. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Predator Triton 500 SE open seen from the back on a yellow tablecloth." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oAw4jow7rOYYJa0NTc6-CpSrCqg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541827/mchin_210526_4605_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;No more logo in the center.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="stA1qf"&gt;The biggest thing you’ll probably notice, though, is that the laptop is taller. The new 16-inch 16:10 display affords extra vertical space compared to the 15.6-inch 16:9 display on the previous Triton. I got to spend a bit of time with a pre-production unit of the Triton 500 SE, and I’m going to have trouble going back to a 13-inch 16:9. This is one of the roomiest displays I’ve ever used. I had no trouble stacking 2-3 tabs and apps alongside each other and jumping in between them. I never had to zoom out of anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TEJArZ"&gt;There are three panel options: a 165Hz LCD panel, a 165Hz Mini LED panel, or a 240Hz IPS PolarBlack panel (which Acer says will cover 100 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut). All the screens have 2560 x 1600 resolution. Mini LED, which also powers the screen of Apple’s latest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;12.9-inch iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;, is unusual to see on laptops. It’s designed to emulate the look of an OLED screen on an LCD panel, and it can produce excellent contrast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q5lH5K"&gt;The Triton has new chips as well; it’s configurable with up to an 11th-Gen Intel Core i9 processor and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 GPU. (Acer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266921/nvidia-requiring-companies-share-clock-speed-power-gaming-laptop-rtx-30-series-gpu-specs"&gt;hasn’t shared&lt;/a&gt; the clock speeds and graphics power you can expect from these chips yet, so I look forward to digging those up during the review process.) It also provides more ambitious specs for power users than previous Tritons, supporting up to a whopping 64GB of memory and 4TB of storage. (Last year’s Triton 500 maxed out at 32GB and 2TB, respectively.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Predator Triton 500 SE open on a table with a yellow tablecloth. The screen displays the Planet9 logo on a dark celestial background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k_ZBucAOG085fiWclMETCEjD4R4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541828/mchin_210526_4605_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a roomy screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="D8F8Hg"&gt;The Triton 500 SE has pretty much every port you might need, including two Thunderbolt 4 ports, one on each side, in addition to two USB 3.2 Gen 2, one HDMI 2.1, one 3.5mm audio jack, one SD card reader, an ethernet port, and a DC-in for power. One of the USB 3.2 Gen 2 ports supports power-off USB charging as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z8r7s6"&gt;There’s a fingerprint in the top-left corner of the touchpad. The webcam in the top bezel actually didn’t look too terrible in my testing and produced a viewable picture in low-light conditions. It doesn’t support Windows Hello, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fLRc3x"&gt;Finally, Acer is also very excited about the new cooling system, which features what it refers to as its “5th-Gen Aeroblade 3D fan” in a triple-fan system with five heat pipes. Acer says this will provide up to 10 percent better airflow than the previous Triton 500. We’ll have more specific metrics once we’ve been able to write a full review of this device; my first impression is that the fans were often audible on this pre-production unit, but I never felt an uncomfortable amount of heat and never saw the CPU get anywhere close to a worrying temperature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YviSDw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10520583"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9Wyu0U"&gt;The Predator Triton 500 SE will be available in North America in June, starting at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1741739060675393770" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,749.99&lt;/a&gt;. The base configuration that Best Buy will be selling for that price includes a Core i7-11800H, a GeForce RTX 3060, 16GB of RAM, 512GB of SSD storage, and the 165Hz LCD display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uPp9ls"&gt;Acer also announced an updated version of its bulkier, pricier, and high-performance Predator Helios 500, which also has new 11th-Gen processors and Nvidia 3000-series GPUs. This laptop can come with a 4K Mini LED 120Hz display or an FHD 360Hz display. The Helios can be configured with up to 64GB of RAM as well. That model is coming to North America in August starting at $2,499.99. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Inside Acer’s ambitious and wonderfully messy plans for 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Acer Predator Triton 500 SE on an angled laptop stand, connected to an external monitor, running a strategy game in a dark office space." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PPsoKGcSrR8-w-JyKAJGlSS3vhM=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69350349/PREDATOR_TRITON_500_SE_PT516_51s_Lifestyle_03.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Acer Predator Triton 500 SE.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Acer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;We asked CEO Jason Chen about the company’s path to innovation&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="7XiZgG"&gt;I’ve used more Acer laptops than most people on the planet. I’ve tested &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22256779/acer-swift-5-2021-review-14-inch-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Swifts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21815008/acer-aspire-5-review-2020-15-inch-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Aspires&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22339981/acer-travelmate-p6-review-2021-14-inch-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Travelmates&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy"&gt;Spins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22430445/acer-conceptd-7-ezel-2021-review"&gt;ConceptDs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22219198"&gt;Predators&lt;/a&gt;. More often than not, my assessment is “not bad, but there’s better.” For much of my time covering this company, I’ve associated it with excellent value — and not too much else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="esI2ex"&gt;To some extent, Acer seems to share this view. &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;editor-in-chief&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Nilay Patel and I spoke to Acer CEO Jason Chen and Acer Pan-America President Gregg Prendergast ahead of the company’s global press conference on May 27th, and Patel asked the two to characterize the “Acer customer” — that is, the type of person who seeks out Acer laptops to buy. Chen’s answer implied that the company is still looking for it. “We are building up new business engines,” he says. “We are moving Acer to be a lifestyle brand, to focus on a specific target audience, to offer more products we’ve never done before.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vbKgo1"&gt;Those sorts of ambitions are evident among the company’s recent releases, as well as its long list of announcements from the press conference. The slate includes new gaming laptops, creator workstations, monitors, desktops, Chromebooks, Swifts, Travelmates, and more. But broadly, it looks to me like Acer throwing a lot of things at the wall to see what sticks. And that might be the defining characteristic it needs. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Jason Chen, Acer CEO, in front of a green background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HThWxoxeoqzZriFG30gOpQvv0uM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22542169/acastro_210526_4606_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Acer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Acer CEO Jason Chen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="vnQQ0d"&gt;One of the angles Acer’s trying: sustainability. The company announced that it’s joined the RE100 initiative and has pledged to achieve 100 percent renewable energy use by the year 2035 — the same &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21324575/joe-biden-jobs-climate-change-plan-energy-elections"&gt;deadline&lt;/a&gt; President Biden has set for the US to eliminate carbon pollution from the power sector. Alongside, the company announced the Aspire Vero — its first “sustainability-focused product” — which has keycaps that are 50 percent post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic, and other surfaces (including the top and bottom covers, bezels, and operating surface) that are 30 percent PCR plastic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="rWJhBb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Acer Swift 3X review: not quite swift enough","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22445605/acer-swift-3x-review-14-inch-laptop-specs-features-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="GtjrAZ"&gt;Acer isn’t the first company to launch a product like this; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/9/21247274/hp-elite-dragonfly-2020-review-tile-test-specs-price-features"&gt;HP’s Elite Dragonfly&lt;/a&gt; line, for example, also incorporates some PCR plastics in its speaker box and bezels. But the Vero is the first laptop we’ve seen that’s specifically modeled around sustainability. Acer is touting other features as well, including a box made from recycled paper pulp, a laptop bag made with recycled plastic, graphics printed in soy ink, and inverted text on the R and E keys to emphasize “reduce, reuse, and recycle.” (I asked if Acer has done anything to increase the Vero’s durability — given that e-waste is a cardinal sin of electronics manufacturing from a sustainability standpoint — and Chen said it will have Acer’s usual warranty and that he expects it to have the same lifespan as any “normal” PC.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XNlLXK"&gt;But Chen views the Vero not only as a step toward its sustainability pledge, but also as a milestone for the market, with Acer’s name attached. “This is the first product for the industry,” he says. “Somebody had to be the first one.” And while Chen is open to the possibility of putting these materials in laptops across Acer’s lines, that’s a longer-term project. The Vero will likely start as a regional, online launch. “Hopefully this kind of material usage will be expanded,” Chen says. But “this is the first product, the first trial.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Gregg Prendergast in front of a green background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/blqklO8DUGqZRXDn6uuRPJyLbfc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22542313/acastro_210526_4606_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Acer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gregg Prendergast, president of Acer pan-America.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="6dnhy4"&gt;That wait-and-see sentiment pervaded much of our conversation. I asked whether Chen views &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22445605/acer-swift-3x-review-14-inch-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Acer’s Swift 3X&lt;/a&gt;, released earlier this year as one of very few laptops to include Intel’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/31/21542700/intel-iris-ex-max-discrete-graphics-gpu"&gt;puzzling entry-level GPU&lt;/a&gt;, as a success. “To be seen,” he replied. “We are excited to see more options for graphics for the industry, and we want to try to include them in our product lines and offer to our customers to see how it goes.” Chen added, “We will see.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="G49zuV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are excited to see more options for graphics for the industry”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SweB8p"&gt;The company is releasing another unique gaming product this time around in the Predator Triton 500 SE, its first gaming laptop with a 16:10 display. 16:10 gaming laptops have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238671/16-9-aspect-ratio-hp-elite-folio-dell-latitude-lenovo-thinkbook-plus-legion-7"&gt;picked up steam&lt;/a&gt; this year among premium lines, but they’re still highly unusual. All modern games support the 16:9 aspect ratio, but not all support 16:10, and quality varies among those that do. So a 16:10 Triton 500 isn’t just a taller product; it nods to a shift in the philosophy of the Triton line. It’s a Triton that’s meant to be equally useful for work and for play. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pj6J4d"&gt;But is the Predator family actually moving in that direction? Will we see more 16:10 in the future? Again, Chen wasn’t sure. “We don’t know yet,” he admitted. “We’d like to try the market and see how it goes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rkLxHB"&gt;“Seeing how it goes” will involve a patchwork of metrics and stakeholders. Some design choices are influenced by retailers, and Best Buy, in particular, with which Acer has co-developed some products in the past. “They get to have a lot of influence on the aspect ratio of the screen,” says Prendergast. “It’s worth it, because they’re half the gaming market in the US.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F9FlYK"&gt;That’s a strong statement about Acer’s priorities — it’s hard to imagine Apple bending the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; to Best Buy’s whims. But Acer isn’t targeting the MacBook crowd — certainly not in the gaming sphere. “The top-selling products at Best Buy are not the premium assortment,” Prendergast says. “They’re products like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22218681/acer-nitro-5-gaming-laptop-intel-11th-tiger-lake-h35-amd-ryzen-rtx-3080-qhd-release-date-price"&gt;Nitro&lt;/a&gt; that are $699, $799. That’s where the real velocity is.” And those co-developed products, Prendergast adds, typically sell out through Acer and Microsoft’s online stores once Best Buy releases its exclusive after six months or so. “It’s worth doing for us, given the scale they have.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TUhowy"&gt;The company also watches web searches, reads reviews, listens to hotline calls for feature keywords using AI, and relays information up the chain. And it pays close attention, Prendergast adds, to “how customers are voting with their wallet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Two users operate a ConceptD 5 notebook in a studio space with the touchscreen.

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Acer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s SpatialLabs on a ConceptD 5 notebook.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="VMsYnm"&gt;Of today’s flashiest new releases, there’s one that Chen seems to be behind in full force: SpatialLabs. SpatialLabs is a proprietary system that allows Acer’s ConceptD laptops to present content in stereoscopic 3D without any need for glasses, using a combination of eye tracking, real-time rendering technology, and a lenticular display. I’ve tried SpatialLabs myself, and things really do have depth and pop out at you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MrOPEp"&gt;The target audience for SpatialLabs is limited. Only one person can use it at a time, you can’t have a mask on, and you can’t be in strong light. You also need access to a powerful system — my demo unit included an eight-core Core i7-10875H and an Nvidia Quadro RTX 3000, and Acer’s engineer told me he wouldn’t advise running SpatialLabs on anything weaker. Most importantly, as cool as SpatialLabs looks, the pragmatic use case is fairly specific; many artists and designers who work with 3D are still creating for viewers who don’t have SpatialLabs and will be looking at a 2D image, so the technology would mostly help people who are developing for VR or 3D TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EaNk5A"&gt;Chen agrees that the initial user base will be small. But here, he’s actually confident that the audience will grow. “We think the technology’s getting mature to the level it’s now good for developers,” he says. “Gradually will be next year, or the year after next to the general public. We look forward to it.” While the SpatialLabs is debuting on ConceptD laptops, Prendergast predicts that we’ll see it on future Acer all-in-ones as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sg4S2Q"&gt;Would the company license the tech for more widespread adoption? “We are keeping any possibility open,” Chen says. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The overpowered, overpriced Acer Predator 21X.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="NAoqPp"&gt;Even ephemeral innovations can help put companies on the map. Chen still views Acer’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/22/15672294/acer-predator-21-x-review-gaming-laptop-9000-gtx-1080"&gt;Predator 21X&lt;/a&gt; — a 19-pound, $9,000 gaming rig with two GPUs, five fans, and a curved 21-inch screen — as a success story, despite the fact that it only made and sold around 300 units. “Do we make a lot of money on our 21X? The answer is no,” Chen says. “What do we get? We get a ‘wow’ impact.” (Chen did confirm that Acer has no plans to refresh the 21X.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="odPSph"&gt;“They’re innovation, they’re fun,” Prendergast added. “We’re not trying to sell thousands of units, but it’s good for the brand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="RcX13r"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Acer of the future probably doesn’t look much like Apple&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MGefzP"&gt;I didn’t get a clear image from Chen of what Acer’s transformation into a “lifestyle brand” will look like, apart from a callout to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21300309/acer-gaming-engery-drink-predator-shot-chair-massage"&gt;company’s line of energy drinks&lt;/a&gt;. What I do sense is that the Acer of the future doesn’t look much like Apple, arguably the quintessential &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232554/intel-ceo-apple-lifestyle-company-cpus-comment"&gt;lifestyle brand&lt;/a&gt; of the US tech space. It won’t be a company with a strong, unique vision in a particular sphere, or one with a passionate and deep-pocketed fan base that lives for its products. Acer’s vision is looser and wider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I8gbBW"&gt;It’s possible that in 10 years, Acer will be the company that pioneered 3D laptop screens. It’s possible it’ll be the go-to company for versatile and stylish gaming laptops, the way Razer was once upon a time. It’s possible it’ll be the company leading the way in green manufacturing — a position laptop manufacturers around the world certainly covet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="twR2he"&gt;It may also just be known as the company that’s willing to try anything. And Chen seems to agree that’s not a bad sort of company to be.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer Chromebook Spin 713 (2021) review: victory lap</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The newest Chromebook Spin 713 is just as good as last year’s model&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="NeIr7b"&gt;Acer has made three significant upgrades to the best-in-class Chromebook Spin 713. The first is that the device now has Intel’s newest 11th Gen processors. The second is that the USB-C ports both support Thunderbolt 4. And the third is that it now has an optional fingerprint reader. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gxVBEo"&gt;These aren’t the most revolutionary spec bumps in the world. The rest of the Spin 713 remains the same: it has a fantastic 3:2 touch display, a good backlit keyboard, a smooth touchpad, and good value for its premium components. But the changes add up. And they serve to push the Spin 713 even further ahead of its competition than it was before. It’s very much still the Chromebook to buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VYt9Li"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10515970"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="QmmuFb"&gt;The Spin 713’s standout feature is its 2256 x 1504 panel. It’s one of the best Chromebook screens I’ve ever used. Colors really pop, details are crisp, and it gets plenty bright. Though the screen is glossy, I rarely saw glare, and what I did see didn’t hinder my work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k2IL7D"&gt;But my favorite aspect of this display (and of this Chromebook as a whole) is the 3:2 aspect ratio. You get noticeably more vertical space than you would from a standard 16:9 display of a similar size. Less scrolling, less zooming out, more room for all your tabs and apps. I’m a fan of 3:2, and I’ve been happy to see more laptop models taking it up over the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 open on a table angled to the right. The screen displays a blue background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZPGPEbVmpPQ9y9acEBBZGEtcTWU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539425/mchin_20190815_4597_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screeeeeeeeen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ej4rpl"&gt;Another strength (which Acer has strengthened with this model) is the port selection. This is the first Chromebook to support Thunderbolt 4 — many premium Chromebooks don’t even support older Thunderbolt standards. There are not one, but two USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports on the left side of the Spin. This makes the Spin 713 one of the most affordable machines in the world to include Thunderbolt 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pj9KqG"&gt;The USB-C ports also support USB 3.2 Gen 1, DisplayPort, and 5V charging. Elsewhere, you get an HDMI port and a microSD reader, in addition to a headphone jack and a USB-A 3.2 Gen 1. The Spin also supports Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.0. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 in tent mode, angled slightly to the left. The screen displays a grid of Android apps on a blue background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NKTBfTv9x3z97actsr6fcw_l9pI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539432/mchin_20190815_4597_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flip it around in tent or tablet mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The right side of the Acer Chromebook Spin 713, half open." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n148ToMC64Cdahf_qAoWwuPQ3i4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539429/mchin_20190815_4597_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;USB-A, microSD on the right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 half open seen from the left side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VqeBowf_w4ShwO3xZtZ4yfWmZww=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539428/mchin_20190815_4597_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two USB-C, an HDMI, and an audio jack on the left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WT2cqj"&gt;The fingerprint reader also helps put the Spin 713 above premium competitors; the lack of biometric authentication was one of our very few knocks against the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy"&gt;last model&lt;/a&gt;. The sensor lives on the deck, beneath the arrow keys. It’s the same color as the Spin’s finish and is nicely camouflaged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="pUqFQa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10516021"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P9Fh6u"&gt;The Spin’s keyboard and touchpad are also quite good. The keyboard is comfortable and backlit, though I wish the keys didn’t feel quite so plasticky. The touchpad is smooth, accurate, and quite large.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nR0Pbl"&gt;Like its predecessor, this Spin 713 has two main drawbacks. The first is that its audio is thin, and I heard a bit of distortion at maximum volume. The second is that the Spin’s aesthetic is utilitarian. The finish is somewhat drab, and the screen bezels are chunky. I wouldn’t call it ugly, but it’s something that would fit in on a school laptop cart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zv7Fo6"&gt;That said, the Spin is also fairly sturdy, with an aluminum chassis, and feels better made than many plasticky devices you’ll find at this price point. The 360 hinge is easy to flip around, and I only saw a tiny bit of screen wobble while I was typing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 open on a table seen from the back, angled to the right." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jUlNw1Z4uLk7bo8DZzVng0FPszc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539435/mchin_20190815_4597_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A tiny bit of screen wobble, but I’ve seen much worse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 open seen from the front. The screen dispalys a blue gradient." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1sG7NaRy6OP-4keVOTxJQ2YnRg8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539424/mchin_20190815_4597_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here it is flipped around.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="m78SAc"&gt;Performance is the other area where the new Spin 713 is supposed to have gotten major upgrade. My review model is $699.99 for a Core i5, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage. This is the primary configuration that Acer will be selling to start, but more will be coming in August with pricing to be announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hTXKWE"&gt;The Spin is the first Chromebook to be certified through Intel’s Evo program, which is meant to recognize the best portable Intel laptops on the market. The Spin did everything I needed it to, including editing big batches of photos and running multiple demanding apps at a time on top of Zoom calls and Spotify streams, quite fast and without any performance issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mCul6z"&gt;That was also true of last year’s Spin 713. What’s new this year is that I’m hearing the fans. Last year’s model was very quiet, but the fans were almost constantly spinning in this model. The noise wasn’t always annoying, but it was often audible. This makes me anxious about the Spin 713’s ability to cool a Core i7, so even if Acer sells a Core i7 model later this year, I’d recommend that most people stick with a Core i5 model unless you know you need an i7. (The Core i5’s performance here is going to be enough for 90 percent of people.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 keyboard deck seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iIw31_xsHSOOhxm36KdS26bgk4w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539434/mchin_20190815_4597_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I didn’t feel much heat in the keyboard, so the fans were doing their job.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RUmKAy"&gt;What’s also gotten a bit worse is battery life: I averaged seven hours and 29 minutes of consistent work with the screen at 50 percent brightness, running some trials with a bunch of Android apps and some trials just in Chrome. That’s about an hour worse than what I averaged on the previous model, though both results are respectable for this price. The battery took 55 minutes to juice from zero to 60 percent with light Chrome use, which is a bit slower than last year’s model (but close). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2M6rdI"&gt;The Spin 713 runs Chrome OS, as all Chromebooks do. It supports all Android apps via Google Play. Everything ran smoothly on this system, in both clamshell and tablet modes. Many Chrome OS apps have improved since I used them on last year’s 713. Slack, for example, was crashing all over the place last year, and is technically usable now. That said, I still generally find that most of my preferred services (Messenger, Slack, Reddit, Instagram, the like) are equivalent or better experiences in browser form. I do like being able to offload distractions like Spotify and Twitter into their own apps so I don’t have them mixed in with my Chrome tabs, but that’s about as far as my typical use of Android apps on a Chromebook goes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The right palm rest of the Acer Chromebook Spin 713 seen from above, angled to the right." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uCEEfDcuPBYdqsyygiJbL8euOLo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539431/mchin_20190815_4597_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You could totally miss the fingerprint reader.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The fingerprint on the Chromebook Spin 713 seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T0Zoir_fGe62UULibEolF_NxKZ4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539430/mchin_20190815_4597_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;But it’s there!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="uKvCh0"&gt;As was the case with its predecessor, the Spin 713 isn’t a perfect Chromebook. It’s also not cheap as far as Chromebooks go. But it offered unbeatable value last year, and its value has gotten even better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="t0LT9K"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10516029"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SGwDNu"&gt;To illustrate just how much this device is offering for its $699 price, look to the premium &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931476/google-pixelbook-go-review-the-price-of-simplicity"&gt;Google Pixelbook Go&lt;/a&gt;. To buy a Pixelbook Go with an 8th Gen Core i5 (which is now an old chip), 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage (half of what you get in this Spin configuration), you’d be paying &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/config/pixelbook_go?hl=en-US"&gt;$849&lt;/a&gt;. The Pixelbook does have some advantages over the Spin, of course: you’re getting better build quality, a lighter chassis, and slightly better audio. But the Pixelbook has no biometric authentication, it has very few ports and doesn’t support Thunderbolt 4, it’s 16:9, and it’s not a convertible. It’s miles behind in almost every other way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="MWJtoI"&gt;In other words, if you don’t mind a laptop-cart look, the Chromebook Spin 713 is an incredible value. The more power-hungry processor has changed the calculus slightly, but so have the new features. And ultimately, the Spin still comes out on top. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Borderlands 3 is getting crossplay support, but not on PlayStation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lw-M6B88qe7AXCUX1qCNg0M-l1M=/4x0:1324x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69350110/borderlands3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UEzQzJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Borderlands 3&lt;/em&gt; is set to get crossplay support soon, but not on Sony’s PlayStation consoles. Gearbox, the developer of &lt;em&gt;Borderlands 3&lt;/em&gt;, has revealed it was ready to enable “full crossplay support across all platforms” but that the publisher, 2K Games, required it be removed for PlayStation consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gPj5VE"&gt;Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford revealed the details in a Twitter post today, noting “we have been required by the publisher to remove crossplay support for PlayStation consoles” to pass certification. It’s not immediately clear why 2K Games has asked Gearbox to remove PlayStation crossplay or whether it’s related to Sony’s general disdain for crossplay. We’ve reached out to both Gearbox and 2K Games to comment on the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BL6QIa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Good news or bad news first? Good News: An update for Borderlands 3 has been prepared for release that includes full crossplay support across all platforms. Bad News: For certification, we have been required by the publisher to remove crossplay support for PlayStation consoles.&lt;/p&gt;— Randy Pitchford (@DuvalMagic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DuvalMagic/status/1397872712090099715?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0g6Hfg"&gt;The source of the issue could be Sony. The recent &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial has revealed that Sony has a special agreement with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;developer Epic Games to enable crossplay in the title on PlayStation consoles. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417560/sony-ps4-cross-play-confidential-documents-epic-games-agreements"&gt;Epic Games had to agree to pay additional fees&lt;/a&gt; to Sony to enable &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;crossplay on PlayStation, and Epic CEO Tim Sweeney confirmed in testimony that Sony is the only platform holder that requires this compensation for crossplay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FQDfM4"&gt;“In certain circumstances Epic will have to pay additional revenue to Sony,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417560/sony-ps4-cross-play-confidential-documents-epic-games-agreements"&gt;revealed Sweeney earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;. “If somebody were primarily playing on PlayStation, but paying on iPhone then this might trigger compensation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fUEJBS"&gt;It’s likely that Sony has been seeking a similar deal with 2K Games for &lt;em&gt;Borderlands 3 &lt;/em&gt;crossplay. &lt;em&gt;Borderlands 3&lt;/em&gt; allows players to purchase cosmetic items like skins for their characters and vehicles. Sony takes a 30 percent cut on these purchases, and it’s clear from internal emails that the company has been against crossplay in the past for financial reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lk72hu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/15/15807138/sony-playstation-cross-network-play-xbox-block-response"&gt;Sony initially blocked cross-platform play&lt;/a&gt; for both &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;despite Nintendo and Microsoft both enabling players to play across Xbox and Switch. The issue really blew up when Sony &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/12/17453628/fortnite-nintendo-switch-cross-play-sony-ps4-microsoft-xbox-one-e3-2018"&gt;blocked &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; crossplay&lt;/a&gt; in 2018, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/12/17454606/fortnite-nintendo-switch-ps4-block-accounts-cross-play-e3-2018"&gt;players were angry&lt;/a&gt;. Sony did eventually back down in late 2018 after the backlash, with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/26/17905146/sony-fortnite-ps4-cross-play-support"&gt;new policy change to enable crossplay&lt;/a&gt; in certain games.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This year’s Pokémon Go Fest is also a music festival</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lgvdH0Lriw2c35ipUIKa97P9Rkk=/0x26:3840x2586/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69350056/20210521_gofest2021_hero_3840x2880.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Art for the 2021 &lt;/em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;em&gt; Fest.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Niantic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pl3X3a"&gt;Pokémon Go Fest is just a few weeks away, and this year, the annual event is also going to be a music festival, developer Niantic announced on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8FNPfu"&gt;During the event, you’ll pick one of two Pikachu — Pikachu Rock Star or Pikachu Pop Star, which you can see in the image at the top of this post — and that choice will influence the music you’ll hear in-game throughout the fest. Longtime &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; developer Junichi Masuda has produced special tracks for the event, including “a rock-and-rolling track for Pikachu Rock Star fans” and “a high-energy electro-pop song for Pikachu Pop Star stans,” according to a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EXYo3H"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tickets cost $5 this year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FdwiI8"&gt;If you complete in-game activities during the festival, you’ll be able to encounter a mythical pokémon, though Niantic isn’t saying exactly which one it is yet. (I have a hunch it could be &lt;a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Meloetta_(Pok%C3%A9mon)"&gt;a certain music-themed pokémon&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yBHcGZ"&gt;This year, in honor of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go’s&lt;/em&gt; fifth anniversary, Niantic has also lowered the price of admission from $14.99 to just $5. That could make the event accessible to even more people — and it could mean even more players participate &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21344717/pokemon-go-fest-2020-stats-numbers-niantic"&gt;than last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CdVN35"&gt;The two-day festival will take place on July 17th and 18th and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406090/pokemon-go-fest-2021-dates-july"&gt;will be held online&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bird announces its third-generation electric scooter with automatic emergency braking</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8L9aFnTXrDmuMoTl41MdPOJrVMY=/0x2:7178x4787/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69350065/B3_Press.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Bird&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LAqQRR"&gt;Bird is out with a new electric scooter that’s designed to be the Santa Monica, California-based company’s most durable and sustainable vehicle yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7P10HT"&gt;The Bird Three scooter has a longer wheelbase, a dual-sensor throttle, and a “triple braking system” with dual independent handbrakes and an “autonomous emergency braking” system that the company claims is an industry-first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n2vb0S"&gt;But specifications aside, the really interesting thing about the Bird Three is the company’s insistence on calling it a “micro-EV.” It’s a clear effort by Bird, which recently announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428864/bird-electric-scooter-spac-public-valuation"&gt;intent to go public via a “reverse merger”&lt;/a&gt; with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, to capitalize on the current momentum around electric vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="R1244H"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Autonomous emergency braking”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QWjbBx"&gt;With billions of dollars potentially on the line for the EV industry as part of President Joe Biden’s infrastructure plan, and legacy automakers pouring billions of their own money into the development of EVs, Bird sees an opportunity to align itself with the prevailing winds in the transportation sector. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kmiWnT"&gt;“In the early days, these were really toys if I’m honest,” said Scott Rushforth, chief vehicle officer at Bird, of the company’s original Xiaomi-manufactured products. “We used off the shelf products that didn’t last as long as we’d like them to.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="addsnm"&gt;But that’s changed with the development of more rugged and longer-lasting scooters, earning them the automotive grade title “micro-EV,” Rushforth said. “It really is an EV that’s been shrunken down into the micro form factor,” he added. “So I love that term and I think that it’s hopefully going to become part of the dialogue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="17ZRNS"&gt;One of the most important numbers to consider is the lifespan of each scooter. The more trips and miles a single scooter can cover, the better it is for scooter companies that have to recoup the cost of each vehicle before they can start making money. With the Bird Three, the company thinks it has its longest-lasting scooter yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bFloOL"&gt;That is partly why the company is staking a position against the use of swappable batteries. Other countries, like China, are embracing battery-swapping technology as a way to expand access to their electric vehicles. But Bird claims that “smaller and swappable batteries lead to higher overall manufacturing emissions and require more vehicle miles traveled to retrieve, replace, and recharge scooters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LyhNRD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Bird Three’s battery has a capacity of “up to 1 kWh”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IX5Q7c"&gt;Instead, the Bird Three’s battery has a capacity of “up to 1 kWh,” which the company says means less frequent charging and more miles traveled on a fully charged battery “than any other shared scooter available today.” That’s a significant step above the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18535698/bird-one-electric-scooter-ride-share-own-price"&gt;Bird One scooter’s&lt;/a&gt; battery capacity of 473Wh, and about 150 percent more capacity than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/1/20749511/bird-two-electric-scooter-battery-autonomous-sensors"&gt;the Bird Two&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nEjlnT"&gt;The Bird Three battery is built to outlast the scooter to which it’s attached, with a minimum of 14,000 miles and up to a 20,000-mile lifespan. That’s probably longer than the 24- to 36-month lifespan of the entire vehicle, Rushforth said. And it’s IP68 rated, meaning it’s sealed from any water and dust that may get into the scooter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ekq9W"&gt;“You know what’s better than a swappable battery is a battery that you don’t really need to maintain,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7TPRS9"&gt;The scooter can run over 200 diagnostic checks and can relay messages to Bird’s maintenance crew when repairs need to be made. And when there’s a problem that would make the scooter unsafe to ride, the automatic emergency braking will bring the vehicle to a stop. Rushforth likened it to regenerative braking in an electric vehicle, in which the vehicle comes to a stop when the driver takes their foot off the acceleration pedal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yTLEni"&gt;The Bird Three will be deployed in only a handful of markets to start out, including Tel Aviv, Berlin, and New York City (which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383976/nyc-scooter-permit-selection-lime-bird-veoride"&gt;kicking off its inaugural scooter sharing pilot&lt;/a&gt; in June). After that, the company will begin the process of swapping the new scooter for the older models that need to be retired — which could take a while. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fleFO1"&gt;“It doesn’t make any sense for us to recycle a vehicle that’s out there getting rides,” Rushforth noted. “That’s not very green to just like get rid of the vehicles before their lifespan has ended.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo is bringing Smash and Splatoon esports to high schools</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L0SVAA20g4PWG9c3LLH82G7cmLs=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69350007/Switch_Splatoon2_4.0_090618_PressKit_SCRN_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Splatoon 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fgkN5p"&gt;Nintendo is expanding its esports efforts by moving into high schools. The company has announced a new partnership with &lt;a href="https://www.playvs.com/"&gt;PlayVS&lt;/a&gt;, which will see games like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18128015/super-smash-bros-ultimate-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/18/15986256/splatoon-2-nintendo-switch-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Splatoon 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; introduced into varsity athletics starting in the fall. “What’s magical about this opportunity is that it’s a way for kids to participate, to compete against their peer levels, and to do so as part of high school athletics,” Nintendo’s Bill Trinen tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DErF6p"&gt;PlayVS is an amateur esports platform that has partnerships with state and national high school athletic associations, turning competitive gaming into officially recognized competition. It currently operates at three age brackets — youth, high school, and college — with games including &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dqjK3P"&gt;As part of the partnership with Nintendo, both &lt;em&gt;Splatoon&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Smash&lt;/em&gt; will become officially sanctioned varsity sports when the high school fall season kicks off on September 20th. Early next year, &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&lt;/em&gt; will be added as well. Nintendo will also be providing copies of the games and a year-long Switch Online subscription to “3,000 select qualifying schools.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="w39yJ1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Our first next step in terms of how we can support competitive communities.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RkU8TD"&gt;According to Delane Parnell, founder and CEO of PlayVS, many high school esports programs already featured Nintendo games in an unofficial capacity, making it a good fit. “I was at a school not long ago, and they have a &lt;em&gt;Smash&lt;/em&gt; program organized internally at the school,” he says. “And they’re really excited at the prospect of being able to play &lt;em&gt;Smash&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Splatoon&lt;/em&gt; against other schools in their state.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wQ5ZtO"&gt;For Nintendo, it’s in part a promotional opportunity, opening up these games to a new audience. But Trinen also describes it as “our first next step in terms of how we can support competitive communities.” In the past, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/20/21579392/nintendo-big-house-super-smash-bros-melee-tournament-slippi-cease-desist"&gt;Nintendo has had a somewhat rocky relationship with the grassroots communities around these games&lt;/a&gt;, but the company sees this as a chance to expand its footprint in the space. (Nintendo’s esports approach has historically been much more hands-off compared to competitors like Riot or Blizzard, which operate their own professional leagues and tournaments.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H0ZoLE"&gt;“We view it as a great opportunity to help kids who have an interest in video games, to be able to experience some of the camaraderie, some of the team-based atmosphere that you get with these programs,” says Trinen. “We felt that the high school level was a great place to start. At that level you’re starting to see kids who are already spending time playing the game, their skill level is pretty high, and the interest is there in terms of the competitive side of things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LG7NIR"&gt;When it came to selecting games to be featured as part of the program, he adds that “&lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros.&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Splatoon&lt;/em&gt; are two franchises where the communities have really done a fantastic job of building up a scene and helping to establish them as competitive titles.” As for &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart&lt;/em&gt;, it was chosen as a more approachable option. “I think it’s one that, from an intimidation factor, is a lot lower than a lot of other games. Having something like that in the mix helps broaden the overall appeal of the program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dnLB1x"&gt;Trinen says that, as the partnership continues, Nintendo will look at potentially expanding to other age categories. There might even be some new games added into the mix. “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/9/15759936/arms-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, being a favorite of mine, is definitely in the back of my mind as a potential candidate,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
