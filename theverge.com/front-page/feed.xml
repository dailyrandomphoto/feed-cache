    <title>Samsung begins mass-producing 90Hz OLED laptop screens</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4Gc38E"&gt;Samsung Display is following through on its promise to ramp up OLED production. The company has begun mass-producing laptop-sized 90Hz OLED panels, which will appear in multiple upcoming 14-inch laptops from Asus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HNizcl"&gt;“The demand for laptops is increasing steadily as working from home and remote learning become the new norm,” Asus Vice General Manager Y.C. Chen said in a statement. “OLED displays can meet consumers’ various needs as they’re using laptops for school, virtual meetings, video streaming, gaming, and more.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VfC3PS"&gt;In a statement, Samsung Display said, “The 90Hz OLED panel offers more options for consumers who are looking to enjoy high-performance content on their laptops. With our innovative OLEDs, we’re further pioneering and leading the market in display technologies that offer superior image quality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3a0MvG"&gt;Samsung Display first announced that it would soon begin mass-producing OLED panels &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242005/samsung-display-oled-laptop-production-90hz-14-inch"&gt;back in January&lt;/a&gt;, though it did not specify a list of partners. “OLED panels can best satisfy the diverse consumer needs for laptops used in telework, online education, video streaming, and gaming,” the company &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210120005673/en/Samsung-Display-to-Introduce-First-90Hz-OLED-Laptop-Display/?feedref=JjAwJuNHiystnCoBq_hl-Q-tiwWZwkcswR1UZtV7eGe24xL9TZOyQUMS3J72mJlQ7fxFuNFTHSunhvli30RlBNXya2izy9YOgHlBiZQk2LOzmn6JePCpHPCiYGaEx4DL1Rq8pNwkf3AarimpDzQGuQ=="&gt;stated&lt;/a&gt; at that time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="x6uBu1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“OLED panels can best satisfy the diverse consumer needs for laptops used in telework, online education, video streaming, and gaming.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SuIZ32"&gt;While this is Samsung Display’s first official confirmation that mass-production has begun, the announcement shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone who’s been watching the laptop market. With a few exceptions, OLED has largely been featured on large, high-end laptops in recent years — but it’s soon to become much more commonplace in smaller and more affordable notebooks, if recent OEM announcements are anything to go by. In the past month, major manufacturers including Asus and Lenovo have announced a slew of OLED laptops across sizes and price tags, many with a 90Hz option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eUyqql"&gt;Per Samsung, the new 90Hz panels will appear on an upcoming 14-inch Zenbook (presumably the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22652934/asus-zenbook-14x-oled-laptop-ultraportable-notebook-samsung-screen-display"&gt;Asus Zenbook 14X&lt;/a&gt;) and 14-inch Vivobook Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JU4xwj"&gt;The Zenbook 14X, which Asus announced September 2nd, will be available with either a 4K OLED HDR display or a 2.8K OLED 90HZ display, with models starting at $1,399.99. (That’s a jump from Asus’s most recent ultraportable OLED Zenbook, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22538867/asus-zenbook-13-oled-review-amd-ryzen-specs-features-price"&gt;Zenbook 13&lt;/a&gt;, which has an FHD OLED screen and &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202103AM090000002/A17602-ASUS-ZenBook-13-Ultra-Slim-Laptop%2C-13.3%E2%80%9D-OLED-FHD-NanoEdge-Bezel-Display%2C-Intel-Core-i5-1135G7%2C-8GB-LPDDR4X-RAM%2C-256GB-SSD%2C-NumberPad%2C-Thunderbolt-4%2C-Wi-Fi-6%2C-AI-noise-cancellation%2C-UX325EA-DS51"&gt;starts at $799.99.&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="We6Lcv"&gt;Asus has also outfitted a number of its product lines with new OLED panels. Its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22652549/asus-proart-studiobook-16-pro-oled-vivobook-expertbook"&gt;ProArt StudioBook 16 OLED and ProArt StudioBook 16&lt;/a&gt;, expected in Q4, are among the first 16-inch laptops to include 4K OLED HDR displays. The 14-inch, 15-inch, and 16-inch models in the budget-oriented VivoBook line (starting at $749.99) have also been outfitted with OLED, as has the dual-screen ZenBook Pro Duo 15 and the company’s ultra-light ExpertBook business line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nK3VCG"&gt;Not to be outdone, Lenovo also announced a slew &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22661307/lenovo-ideapad-slim-7-carbon-oled-screen-light-laptop"&gt;of OLED notebooks&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month (also using Samsung OLED panels). An IdeaPad Slim 7 Carbon with a 90Hz OLED screen is coming in October, which Lenovo claims will be the lightest 14-inch OLED laptop on the market at just 2.37 pounds. (That will be a QHD+ OLED screen, lower resolution than the 4K panel on the Zenbook 14X). Also expected in October is the 13.3-inch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22660761/lenovo-chromebook-duet-detachable-release-oled"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet 5&lt;/a&gt;, an OLED Chrome OS tablet with a detachable keyboard case. Starting at just $429.99, it’s likely to be one of the most affordable laptops ever to feature OLED technology.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The iPhone 13 event was a case study in Tim Cook-era product refinement</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nY-wgBmscZppIFjXnbt-lR0xykI=/141x0:1640x999/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69864483/caZMw9TLgc.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L12bxo"&gt;For the past ten years, Tim Cook’s greatest accomplishment as Apple CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22639629/tim-cook-apple-ten-years-decade-steve-jobs-legacy"&gt;has been vastly more of the same&lt;/a&gt;. More iPhones, more iPhone accessories, more apps, and &lt;em&gt;so much&lt;/em&gt; more money. While the Mac and iPad have occasionally fallen into disrepair, the company keeps coming back with new reasons to buy its greatest hits every year — and this year’s iPhone 13 event is a near-perfect case study in how far refinement can take you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZfHWL7"&gt;As my colleague Jon Porter points out, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675797/iphone-13-12s-upgrade-cycle-iterative-improvements"&gt;the iPhone 13 is effectively the iPhone 12S&lt;/a&gt;, an iterative, incremental update to last year’s phones instead of something that feels brand new. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="dXLvBc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Tim Cook’s Apple, ten years later","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22639629/tim-cook-apple-ten-years-decade-steve-jobs-legacy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fZSCix"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Almost everything got better&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9rX6ak"&gt;But oh, what an update. What company wouldn’t dream of being able to say they improved the processing power AND the battery life AND the cameras AND the displays AND the storage capacity AND the connectivity AND the design in the course of a single year, all without changing the price one bit? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7wS1uT"&gt;In 2021, the same $829 you’d pay last year now buys you &lt;em&gt;twice&lt;/em&gt; the storage, a whopping 2.5 additional hours of quoted battery life, more 5G bands, and an additional 175 nits of brightness over the iPhone 12, plus the 47 percent larger sensor and sensor-shift stabilization system that was previously exclusively available in the $1,099-and-up iPhone 12 Pro Max. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22673545/iphone-13-pro-camera-cinematic-mode-video-features-macro"&gt;A new cinematic video mode&lt;/a&gt; isn’t exclusive to the Pros, either (though smooth 120Hz screens, a new macro photography mode and ProRes video will be.) And while the company doesn’t offer any real numbers to back it up, Apple claims even the iPhone 13 Mini will give you the fastest processor available in any smartphone on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FppkXh5u16t5F49SXpgCmjY-yaQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22853924/aCizUZJtka.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 and 12 Mini bento box of upgrades. Notch at lower left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mg0Hef"&gt;Also, you can’t say the design didn’t change at all. While&lt;em&gt; the notch &lt;/em&gt;still exists, it’s smaller! (I like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666884/iphone-13-pro-max-specs-price-release-date-cameras"&gt;the iPhone 13 Pro’s blue&lt;/a&gt; an awful lot, too.) The only tradeoff I can find this year — ahead of our reviews, that is — is that the iPhone 13 lineup is oh-so-slightly thicker and heavier. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22674143/apple-iphone-13-pro-12-samsung-galaxy-pixel-android-comparison-specs"&gt;You can find our comparison charts here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kd0ptM"&gt;This year’s iteration is so compelling that I’m vaguely tempted to upgrade my perfectly good iPhone 12 Mini to get that better camera with sensor-shift and an additional hour or so of battery life. (I probably won’t, since the announcement means the resale value of my existing phone has likely already tanked, but I do worry Apple might still cut off the Mini next year due to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22322843/iphone-12-mini-apple-low-production-numbers-decrease"&gt;reportedly lackluster sales&lt;/a&gt;.) If I had an iPhone 11 or earlier, it’d be a no brainer — I’d definitely be preordering one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22665165/apple-iphone-13-preorder-how-to-buy-price-release-date"&gt;on Friday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="bJplwW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple says it every year, but the iPhone 13 cameras do seem much improved","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675127/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-camera-analysis-specs"},{"title":"Goodbye and good riddance to Apple’s 64GB iPhones","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22675300/apple-64gb-iphone-13-128gb-standard-storage-space-photos-videos-apps"},{"title":"The iPhone 13 is a pitch-perfect iPhone 12S","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675797/iphone-13-12s-upgrade-cycle-iterative-improvements"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="BqqQKq"&gt;And while it might feel criminal that the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22672438/ipad-2021-new-price-specs-release-date-apple-a13-chip"&gt;$329 10.2-inch iPad&lt;/a&gt; still uses a Lightning connector and first-gen Apple Pencil, Apple’s still issuing a decent upgrade there without asking for more money — doubling the base storage from 32GB to 64GB, moving from the A10 Fusion chip to A13 Bionic, and hopefully finally putting a decent front-facing camera (12MP, vs. just 1.2MP!) onto its entry-level tablet computer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kR-Dwve4mGztbuaSeoftPRaRGec=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22853917/uJGfKlMU0L.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new iPad Mini.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="u12G4J"&gt;The story’s a little bit different with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple"&gt;the 6th-gen iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt;, mind, since it starts $100 higher than before at $499. But the upgrade incentives are still strong: it’s a crystal-clear update over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;its predecessor&lt;/a&gt; with a larger and higher resolution 8.3-inch screen despite its slightly smaller and lighter frame, with a magnetic connector to dock a 2nd-gen Apple Pencil. It’s got the A15 Bionic chip from the new iPhone 13, but with the extra graphics core you’ll only otherwise fined on the iPhone 13 Pro. The camera’s bigger and faster at 12MP and f/1.8 (compared to 8MP and f/2.4), with 4K video for the first time, and both the Wi-Fi 6 and 5G support that the 2019 model lacked. Just don’t go looking for a headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yMqdPy"&gt;Apple is managing all of this during a pandemic and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648372/willy-shih-chip-shortage-tsmc-samsung-ps5-decoder-interview"&gt;a global chip shortage&lt;/a&gt;, and so far there’s only been a single indication that Tim Cook’s giant manufacturing machine can’t keep up: The new Apple Watch Series 7 was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650516/apple-watch-series-7-delayed-manufacturing-production-issues"&gt;rumored to be delayed due to production issues&lt;/a&gt;, and while it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22666305/apple-series-7-manufacturing-issues-resolved-september-mass-production"&gt;reportedly overcame them&lt;/a&gt;, we don’t have any release date for the new watch save “later this fall” and Apple’s being cagey about the details.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h2wfR6eU2cufFTX1Lpx7Ey-y5uA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22853915/BCslcISSRg.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XWhnSI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/1nc9br15gf0scjb/Apple%20Watch%E2%80%94Then%20and%20Now%20%28Sept%202020%29_L568943A-en_US.pdf?dl=0"&gt;A leaked spec sheet for the watch&lt;/a&gt; suggests it was supposed to ship in September alongside the new phones, but the fine print says even its specs are “subject to change without notice,” and Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment about the document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OlMIUA"&gt;The watch is why I say this year’s event is a &lt;em&gt;nearly&lt;/em&gt; perfect case study: it’s not as clear why someone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674258/apple-watch-series-7-upgrade-worth-waiting-for"&gt;would buy the Series 7 over a discounted Series 6&lt;/a&gt;, despite the larger and reportedly more durable screen. With the same battery life and no reason to believe there’s more processing power or functionality, plus a late start, it might be the one insufficient iteration this year.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qD4RpU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vy3kpO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Finally, some good news for Quibi</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a7VfS-VJGDE9KdIW2VaMoF-04FQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69864337/acastro_200403_3960_quibi_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NkA0Kj"&gt;Quibi’s zombie may finally be able to rest its weary head. The company’s successor has settled an ongoing feud with eternal thorn-in-its-side Eko.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fWXrBz"&gt;Eko, an interactive video company, and Quibi's successor QBI Holdings &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/09/15/2297837/0/en/Eko-and-Quibi-Settle-Litigation.html"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that they’d reached a settlement in the legal battle over Quibi’s perspective-shifting Turnstyle feature, which Eko alleged the streaming service had swiped from its own proprietary video technology. Both companies have agreed to dismiss their legal action against one another, and Quibi will hand over both the video technology and Turnstyle IP to Eko as part of their agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2jZtw0"&gt;“This result will help ensure that Eko remains the undisputed leader in interactive storytelling technology,” Eko boss Yoni Bloch said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5xsr6v"&gt;Quibi was founded by Jeffrey Katzenberg and Meg Whitman and debuted last year amid a flurry of streaming launches. The mobile-first service was meant to fit those in-between moments on the train or while waiting in line when users had time to kill on their phones, with Quibi serving up high-production-value “quick bite” videos backed by leading creators and A-list talent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XWQ366"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Katzenberg and camp are “satisfied with the outcome”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rScmCh"&gt;The problem was that the service launched amid the pandemic when those on-the-go viewers it hoped to find were stuck indoors. At first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21271346/quibi-apple-ios-airplay-google-chromecast-june-tv"&gt;reluctant to implement&lt;/a&gt; casting support, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21318060/quibi-subscriber-count-free-trial-paying-users-conversion-rate"&gt;service struggled&lt;/a&gt; to hold on to paying subscribers. Quibi was plagued by myriad problems straight through to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21527197/quibi-streaming-service-mobile-shutting-down-end-katzenberg"&gt;untimely demise&lt;/a&gt; less than a year after its launch, including but certainly not limited to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/3/21245864/activist-hedge-fund-eko-lawsuit-quibi-turnstyle-elliott"&gt;ongoing legal battles&lt;/a&gt; against Eko. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ezwylB"&gt;Eko, an interactive storytelling platform, claimed that Quibi stole the idea for its Turnstyle technology that allowed Quibi users to view certain perspectives from a title based on the orientation of their phone in either portrait or landscape mode. Eko called Quibi’s technology “a near-identical copy of its own, from the patented smart video response system down to the way files are created, formatted and stored.” Eko was granted a patent for its own video technology in October 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1mIdbM"&gt;Quibi finally shut down in December, and Roku &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220426/quibi-roku-channel-acquisition-content"&gt;swooped in&lt;/a&gt; to snap up the IP remains from its corpse for its own streaming service, The Roku Channel. But it left behind the Turnstyle tech and its legal woes, which remained unresolved prior to this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FQOMDd"&gt;In a statement, Katzenberg said that his camp was “satisfied with the outcome of this litigation, and proud of the independently created contributions of Quibi and its engineering team to content presentation technology.” If only anyone had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528404/quibi-shut-down-cost-subscribers-content-tv-movies-katzenberg-whitman-tiktok-netflix"&gt;actually used it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="pYdAAO"&gt;There are a lot of 4K TVs available to choose from, complete with a wide variety of prices and performance. And, with many fall sales approaching, now might be the best time of the year to get an amazing TV deal. Even if your budget is less than $500, you can get a good 4K TV in a bigger size than you might expect. Whether you want a secondary TV for the bedroom or a high-end OLED that’s built for a cinema-like experience, we’ve picked out the best TV deals across four common categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="tf9rXR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl#f9MF2Z"&gt;The best 4K TV deals for most people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eeM2RN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl#EYhbja"&gt;The best TV deals on a budget&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vzRoT0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl#qm44jO"&gt;The best deals on OLED TVs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mlO4U5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl#O5Vjam"&gt;4K TVs for the Sony PS5 and Microsoft Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="d2lRkA"&gt;We will provide regular updates to this post so be sure to check back periodically for the most up-to-date info on the best deals available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="MLgUIb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best TV to buy for the PS5 and Xbox Series X","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="f9MF2Z"&gt;The best 4K TV deals for most people&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mszLRr"&gt;A 55-inch TV is a popular size for good reasons. It is not too big, nor is it too small, making it a safe size if you’re looking to upgrade the TV in a living room or bedroom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X3LwO3"&gt;Sony’s 55-inch X80J 4K TV has Google TV software built-in, so you won’t need to purchase any additional streaming boxes, like an Apple TV or Chromecast. The LED panel also supports HDR10, HLG, and Dolby Vision HDR, and has four HDMI ports (one of which is HDMI ARC). It’s a relatively low-frills affair, but it seems like a good deal that’s currently available at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743620079563082108#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, where you can get it for $150 off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gEtknI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10610217"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JbaBai"&gt;The TCL 6-Series R635 model is a good option if you are looking to balance price and performance. The R635 model sports a QLED panel, but it goes a step above with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363318/tcl-2020-5-6-series-4k-tvs-qled-mini-led-backlighting-gaming-ps5-xbox-series-x" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mini-LED backlighting&lt;/a&gt;, which brings better brightness and contrast. The 55-inch model is currently on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0885F5GMP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon for $850&lt;/a&gt;, though, we’ve seen steeper discounts on the R635 in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Osz4r"&gt;If you prefer a larger model, both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0885N17CC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748187444641286142#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; also sell the 65- and 75-inch variants. Best Buy offers $200 off the 75-inch, while both retailers are taking $125 off of the 65-inch models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="y8BpYm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10327662"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kuUEp8"&gt;Samsung’s The Frame blends into your home decor, displaying customizable images that look like a piece of decorative art if its motion sensor detects someone in the room. When turned on, however, it transforms into an HDR-compatible QLED TV with Alexa built-in and support for AirPlay 2. The stylish, 4K TV also boasts a 120Hz refresh rate, access to all the popular streaming services, and four HDMI ports. Right now, the 55-inch model is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Class-Frame-Built/dp/B08VWPBBTF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon for $1,398&lt;/a&gt;, roughly $100 less than its regular $1,500 price tag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JD5CqS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10711541"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EYhbja"&gt;The best TV deals on a budget&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zWYgij"&gt;You don’t have to spend a fortune for a 4K TV; spending $500 or less can still net you a TV with good image quality and features. Insignia’s 55-inch 4K HDR Fire TV Edition model is the perfect case in point, one that supports HDR10, HDMI ARC, and HDMI eArc, among other notable features. You can pick it up from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Insignia-NS-55F301NA22-Smart-Released/dp/B08X7KQQGJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748188127423432886#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy for $420&lt;/a&gt;, a $130 discount on its typical $550 price tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jIOPJT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10605845"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cW4VPC"&gt;Another Fire TV Edition TV deal happening now is on Toshiba’s 50-inch Smart Fire TV Edition 4K LED, which normally retails for $470. As the name might imply, it allows you to stream content from services such as Disney Plus and Netflix, and includes the option to watch live TV. The latest models also tout an Alexa-enabled remote, an easy-to-use interface, and support for Dolby Vision HDR and HDR10. Right now at Amazon, you can pick up the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-55-inch-4K-UHD-Smart-Fire-TV/dp/B0924XSHB2/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch model for $440&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="x443tm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10444802"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="74eOSC"&gt;TCL also has competitively priced televisions, and its 4-series lineup is one of the more affordable options on the market. The S435 model features a built-in Roku interface, dual-band Wi-Fi, HDR10, and support for Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri voice assistants. You can currently get the 50-inch model for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/TCL-4K-Smart-LED-43S435/dp/B08DHFX4FV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$398 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, which is $102 less than the usual retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HtnMEi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9740197"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="9H3H8m"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our 39,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="qm44jO"&gt;The best deals on OLED TVs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="vbJRlM"&gt;OLED televisions offer the best image quality in a mainstream TV. LG’s BX line supports HDMI 2.1, meaning this TV is perfect for people looking to take advantage of the PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X. You can get it in either the 55- or 65-inch configuration and save up to $300, depending on the size. At LG, the popular 55-inch model is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fus%2Ftvs%2Flg-oled55bxpua-oled-4k-tv&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently discounted to $1,300&lt;/a&gt;, $300 less than its normal retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OMVgrF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733758"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MB8PX4"&gt;Despite the high price tag, LG’s Gallery Series GX OLED is a good TV for those looking for a more cinematic experience. It includes support for Google Assistant and Alexa, and for those who want to use their TV for gaming, it features Nvidia G-Sync and HDMI 2.1 support, meaning it can take full advantage of the RTX 30-series cards or Sony’s and Microsoft’s next-gen gaming consoles. Right now, you can get the 55-inch for as low as &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLG-GX-55-inch-Class-with-Gallery-Design-4K-Smart-OLED-TV-w-AI-ThinQ-54-6-Diag-OLED55GXPUA%2F152371849%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_33DRwsUfoxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkESb%253AWnWQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_1943169%26clickid%3D33DRwsUfoxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkESb%253AWnWQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=BestTVDeals04142021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,797 at B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, or for a few dollars more at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1744656950369633474#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1555068-REG%2Flg_oled65gxpua_gxpua_65_class_hdr.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch model is also available at B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Flg-oled-gx-65%2Fp%2F16C-000P-004G0" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg for $2,297,&lt;/a&gt; a savings of more than $1,200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lpiA85"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10445785"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nGYSCL"&gt;Vizio’s 65-inch OLED is a Best Buy exclusive, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748271630959872367#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can get it for $1,800&lt;/a&gt;. Although Best’s Buy’s current discount is nowhere near its steepest — last month, it was on sale for $1,500 — it remains one of the more affordable options if you’re looking for a 65-inch TV. Vizio doesn’t have the same kind of experience in the OLED playing field as LG, but it’s a great deal if you want a high-end viewing experience and HDMI 2.1 ports to display high frame rates from your PS5 or Xbox Series X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="q8lGs4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10462603"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O5Vjam"&gt;4K TVs for the Sony PS5 and Microsoft Xbox Series X &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xr7I2E"&gt;Sony’s PS5 and Microsoft’s Xbox Series X can play 4K games with HDR at up to 120 frames per second. So, naturally, if you don’t have a TV that takes full advantage of your console, it might be time to upgrade to one of our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recommendations&lt;/a&gt;. For the best experience, you’ll want a TV that supports HDMI 2.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Nkhmv"&gt;Deals on those picks are scarce right now, however, there’s one happening on LG’s CX series of TVs, which include support for Nvidia’s G-Sync and AMD’s FreeSync adaptive sync technologies, as well as a low 1ms response time. The big difference between the CX and the cheaper BX model mentioned above is the CX line can have slightly better brightness, which is better for HDR content. It comes in four sizes: 48, 55, 65, and 77 inches. Right now, you can purchase the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748273201373884122#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;48-inch model for $1,300 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, or the 65-inch configuration for as low as &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/lg-65%22-class---cx-series---4k-uhd-oled-tv---%24100-allstate-protection-plan-bundle-included.product.100657326.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,950 at Costco&lt;/a&gt;. The latter deal requires a &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://costcomembershipoffer.com/Purchase/Purchase/cj?qid=e6583bbeb3f911eb830f05100a1c0e10" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Costco membership&lt;/a&gt;, but it also nets you an Allstate Protection Plan — a three-year warranty for your TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="F5GsVe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9534696"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BfJNcm"&gt;If you’re looking for an even more impressive TV, we recommend turning your attention to LG’s C1 line. Like its predecessor, the CX, the 4K C1 touts support for Nvidia G-Sync and AMD Freesync technologies, along with a 120Hz refresh rate and low input lag. The main difference between the two is that the C1 is available in an 83-inch variant and features a better processor. It also utilizes a newer interface that makes good use of a settings pane dubbed “Game Optimizer,” which conveniently brings together a host of game-centric settings — refresh rate, latency, etc. — for quicker access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CkH38i"&gt;If you’re interested in all the bells and whistles that come with the C1, the 55-inch model is on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WFV7L3N/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747318067989758928#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for around $1,500, one of the lowest prices to date on the excellent OLED. You can also pick up the smaller, 48-inch model for around $1,297 at the same retailers (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WFK81RH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747323256242351544#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;), as well as the 65-, 77-, and 83-inch variants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IrDSVn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10618444"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bn523S"&gt;For a viable OLED alternative — one that’s currently seeing a rare discount — there’s the Neo QLED QN90A. Unlike the LG models above, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309077/samsung-2021-8k-4k-tvs-now-available-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s most recent flagship&lt;/a&gt; uses Mini LED backlighting, a technology that allows for better contrast, less “blooming” around white objects on a dark background, and brightness levels that outperform even the best OLED TVs. Like the C1, the QN90A is also built with gamers in mind. The 2021 model features an HDMI 2.1 port and a “Game Bar” that gives you the ability to quickly adjust your screen’s aspect ratio, monitor input lag, and check to ensure settings such as HDR and VRR are active, all of which make for a better gaming experience overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="x9RwhV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung starts shipping its most ambitious TV lineup in years","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309077/samsung-2021-8k-4k-tvs-now-available-price-specs"},{"title":"Amazon starts making its own TVs with new Fire TV Omni and 4-Series","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22662673/amazon-fire-tv-omni-4-series-price-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="TYqOuE"&gt;In terms of discounts, we don’t often see them on the QN90A. Right now, however, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748274080574733405#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08V3W4YXJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; are both offering the 55-inch model for about $1,600, the second-best price we’ve seen on the stunning QLED. There are also varying discounts available on the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08V3W4YXJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08V3K77SC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; 65&lt;/a&gt;-, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08V39W74P/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;75-inch&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08V3B227H/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;85-inch configurations&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UuPbBJ"&gt;In the shadow of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666802/iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-apple-camera"&gt;the iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;, and an aggressive new &lt;a href="https://investor.t-mobile.com/news-and-events/t-mobile-us-press-releases/press-release-details/2021/All-new-iPhone-13-Pro-iPhone-13-Pro-Max-iPhone-13-iPhone-13-mini-iPad-and-iPad-mini-Come-to-T-Mobile-With-Forever-Upgrade/default.aspx"&gt;“Forever Upgrade” plan to sell them&lt;/a&gt;, T-Mobile executives are complaining about Samsung’s phones, &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/operators/t-mobile-cfo-blasts-samsung-device-supply"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fierce Wireless &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, the lack of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qiMQdB"&gt;“Samsung has really fallen behind the eight ball relative to other OEMs on the global supply chain issue,” T-Mobile chief financial officer and executive vice president Peter Osvaldik said &lt;a href="https://investor.t-mobile.com/news-and-events/events-and-presentations/event-details/2021/BofA-2021-Media-Communications-and-Entertainment-Conference/default.aspx"&gt;at an BofA Securities investor event on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. The issue seems to be that a majority of T-Mobile’s customers are “very significant Samsung lovers,” according Osvaldik, and that Samsung “discontinuing” the Galaxy Note — which “customers just loved” — and a shorter supply of S-series phones have had an impact on the carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tiHjH2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;T-Mobile customers apparently love the Galaxy Note&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B5iPnL"&gt;Despite what Osvaldik said, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22335502/galaxy-note-2021-delay-canceled-samsung"&gt;Samsung has not yet officially discontinued the Note&lt;/a&gt;, so far skipping a 2021 version in favor of adding S Pen support into the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227772/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-price-specs-release-date-unpacked"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617206/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-features-specs-price-hands-on"&gt;the Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt;. I’m not sure if Osvaldik is revealing some secret decision Samsung has made based on his comments. When asked, Samsung declined to comment, but the company’s mobile chief DJ Koh &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/samsung-warns-of-serious-imbalance-in-the-chips-industry"&gt;stated in March&lt;/a&gt; that “we seek to release a Note model next year,” leaving some possibility for a 2022 model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kuViPC"&gt;It’s possible in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620397/samsung-fold-flip-future-galaxy-s-past"&gt;the effort to make foldables mainstream&lt;/a&gt;, Samsung has decided to ignore &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22627058/samsung-galaxy-note-stylus-z-fold-3-a-series"&gt;the positives of the Note&lt;/a&gt;, but the company has also been affected by the global semiconductor shortage, just like everyone else. Samsung was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532816/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-production-reportedly-halted"&gt;reportedly considering halting production&lt;/a&gt; of the Galaxy S21 Fan Edition (FE) in June, and was also rumored to be &lt;a href="http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=2776"&gt;running into chip issues&lt;/a&gt; with its lower budget A-series phones. In general, it’s hard to release multiple flagship phones, even in a normal year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FKsPi3"&gt;T-Mobile’s comments are a testament to Samsung’s reach, though, and taking Osvaldik at face value, maybe also further confirmation that the Note should stick around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5P6xno"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 15th, 7:21PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;Added comment from Samsung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dxr9JW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Battlefield 2042 delayed by nearly a month</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kpCStT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt;, Dice’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22524753/battlefield-2042-release-date-trailer-ps4-ps5-xbox-pc"&gt;upcoming entry&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Battlefield&lt;/em&gt; series, has been delayed by nearly a month, &lt;a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Electronic-Arts-Announces-Battlefield-2042-Is-Now-Set-to-Launch-Worldwide-on-November-19-2021/default.aspx"&gt;Dice parent company EA announced Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. The game’s release date has been pushed from October 22nd to November 19th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tmZovQ"&gt;“Building the next generation of &lt;em&gt;Battlefield&lt;/em&gt; during a global pandemic has created unforeseen challenges for our development teams,” Oskar Gabrielson, studio GM at Dice said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Battlefield/status/1438232407119908870"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt; on behalf of the &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt; team. “Given the scale and scope of the game, we had hoped our teams would be back in our studios together as we move towards launch. With the ongoing conditions not allowing that to happen safely, and with all the hard work the teams are doing from home, we feel it is important to take the extra time to deliver on the vision of &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt; for our players.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7Tp5U0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;An update from the Battlefield team &lt;a href="https://t.co/K53VNM2tTz"&gt;pic.twitter.com/K53VNM2tTz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Battlefield (@Battlefield) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Battlefield/status/1438232407119908870?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Wb4nof"&gt;However, Gabrielson also said that news about the game’s forthcoming open beta will be shared later this month, so you might have a chance to try the game ahead of the pushed-back launch soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DM6evQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt; is the latest game to be delayed in part due to difficulties created by the pandemic. Other examples include &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us Part II, &lt;/em&gt;which&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;was delayed by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/27/21238450/sony-playstation-4-the-last-of-us-part-2-ghost-of-tsushima-launch-date"&gt;about a month in 2020&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363769/halo-infinite-delay-launch-2021-release-date-xbox-series-x"&gt;was delayed from its original November 2020 release&lt;/a&gt; that would have coincided with the launch of the Xbox Series X / S; and PS5 exclusive &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;, which was released on Tuesday after two &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/18/21374127/deathloop-the-stanley-parable-ultra-deluxe-delayed-2021-coronavirus"&gt;COVID-19-related&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373588/bethesda-deathloop-ps5-delayed-date"&gt;delays&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yQj0iH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt; will be available on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X / S, and PC.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s rumored Pixel 6 Tensor processor sounds extremely weird</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R8IgMMLMCXbrdQ6538xb-RopNps=/70x0:1543x982/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69863918/Screen_Shot_2021_08_04_at_2.33.39_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/sundarpichai/status/1422228336533676035/photo/1" target="_blank"&gt;Sundar Pichai / Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oedMe5"&gt;Google is set to debut its first in-house smartphone chipset, the Tensor SoC, in its upcoming Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro phones. And if the &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/exclusive-google-tensor-specs-in-pixel-6/"&gt;latest report from &lt;em&gt;XDA&lt;/em&gt; is correct&lt;/a&gt;, the Tensor’s rumored CPU setup could be very, very weird — even by Google standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tmFoij"&gt;So far, Google has largely been hyping up the Tensor SoC’s AI performance; but it hasn’t revealed any information on the basic CPU and GPU specs of the chip. Google’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;Rick Osterloh would only tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that “the standard stuff people look at will be very competitive and the AI stuff will be totally differentiated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="PfKq0t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google’s Tensor chip is only the first step toward truly great Pixel phones","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609924/pixel-6-google-tensor-soc-chip-cpu-gpu-samsung-apple"},{"title":"This is the Pixel 6","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="3gaqxi"&gt;Some aspects of the Tensor’s components have already come to light. An &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pixel-6-same-gpu-exynos-galaxy-s21/"&gt;earlier &lt;em&gt;XDA&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; notes that the Pixel 6 will likely use an off-the-shelf Arm Mali-A78 GPU design (which Samsung uses on its flagship Exynos 2100), while &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-brings-samsung-5g-modem-tech-us-market-with-new-pixel-phone-sources-2021-08-25/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that Google will be sourcing its 5G modem from Samsung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rowUF8"&gt;But the CPU still remained a mystery, until today, when &lt;em&gt;XDA&lt;/em&gt; published a report based on both a Geekbench score and a source who claims to have an actual Pixel 6 Pro. The report claims that the CPU setup on the Tensor will consist of two Cortex-X1 performance cores clocked at 2.802GHz, two Cortex-A76 performance cores clocked at 2.253GHz, and four Cortex-A55 efficiency cores. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google’s new Pixel 6 phones, regular and Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4ckQnWc66L7bV9d2osK3PMYdxPE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22755089/Google_Pixel_6__Portfolio_Shot.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xjMCZV"&gt;If you’ve been keeping up with major flagship smartphone chips, that’s a very weird list to see, one that mixes together powerful new cores with weaker old ones. Let’s take a step back to explain why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fwMKCb"&gt;When we’re looking at most smartphone SoCs, there are generally two main parts: performance CPU cores and efficiency CPU cores. Arm-based designs tend to mix those together in big.LITTLE configurations, to allow for devices that can ramp up performance by using the more powerful “big” cores for intensive things like gaming, while running less demanding tasks (like checking your email) on the “little” efficiency cores to prolong battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="XZf1wB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"ARM’s Cortex-A78 CPU and Mali-G78 GPU will power 2021’s best Android phones","url":"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/26/21267893/arm-cortex-a78-mali-g78-cpu-gpu-designs-smartphones-2021-samsung-qualcomm-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="reOgai"&gt;A typical Arm-based design might include four performance cores (like the Cortex-A78) and four efficiency cores (like the Cortex-A55). &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/26/21267893/arm-cortex-a78-mali-g78-cpu-gpu-designs-smartphones-2021-samsung-qualcomm-apple"&gt;But last year&lt;/a&gt;, Arm added a new, even more powerful performance option for chip makers to use: the Cortex-X1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Q8hnG"&gt;So, the top smartphones of 2021 tend to offer a triple-cluster design: the Snapdragon 888 uses partially customized versions of a single &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/26/21267893/arm-cortex-a78-mali-g78-cpu-gpu-designs-smartphones-2021-samsung-qualcomm-apple"&gt;Cortex-X1, three Cortex-A78, and four Cortex-A55&lt;/a&gt; cores, while Samsung’s Exynos 2100 uses a similar configuration. Tensor, on the other hand, is said to offer two Cortex-X1 cores, two Cortex-A76 cores, and the usual four Cortex-55 cores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lhL6CC"&gt;Which makes for a very strange version of a triple cluster design. By including not one, but two Cortex-X1 performance cores, Tensor could theoretically allow it to outclass even the best chips from Qualcomm and Samsung, on paper, if not for the second half of the rumor, which is that Google is also using two older Cortex-A76 cores... which, simply put, doesn’t make any sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nc1Jjl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Tensor’s rumored CPU design is extremely strange&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CoZeGs"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;XDA&lt;/em&gt; points out, the Cortex-A76 was introduced in 2018 and is a full two generations behind the Cortex-A78 design used in 2021’s flagship chips. There’s no immediately logical reason why Google would use the older design, either; the A78 is both faster &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; more efficient than its older counterpart, making it an &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; strange choice to include as part of the Tensor CPU cluster, especially if Google is already going all out with two X1 cores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L66oBa"&gt;There is the chance that Google is simply obfuscating its CPU design in the Geekbench score, although the report does note that it would be unlikely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZhPNm"&gt;For now, though, the mystery of the Pixel 6’s Tensor chip has gotten even weirder. And it’ll likely stay that way, too, until Google reveals more information when the phones arrive later this fall. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>These climate stars are among the world’s most ‘influential’ people</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Miss Phyllis Omido, a Kenyan environmental activist and..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XZjvPGKy1foyq17lzDYmkUxu9HI=/0x0:3456x2304/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69863882/1229847704.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LUxRmh"&gt;Climate change was a big theme in &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt; Magazine’s &lt;a href="https://time.com/collection/100-most-influential-people-2021/"&gt;2021 list&lt;/a&gt; of “Most Influential People,” with a handful of climate scientists and environmental advocates making the list along with celebrities like Dolly Parton and Naomi Osaka. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2CGU4c"&gt;2021 isn’t the first year rock star environmentalists have made &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt;’s list. Teen activist Greta Thunberg was Time’s “Person of the Year” in 2019. Green New Deal champion Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was also among the “most influential” that year. This year’s honorees may not be as widely known, but they’ve had a huge impact on how the world grapples with an existential crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cT99rl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Possibly the greatest challenge humanity has faced”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DZpCV2"&gt;Tackling climate change is “possibly the greatest challenge humanity has faced,” one of the people who made the list, Fatih Birol, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/news/iea-executive-director-named-on-time-100-list-of-the-world-s-most-influential-people"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; today. Birol heads up the International Energy Agency, which issued a landmark &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/news/pathway-to-critical-and-formidable-goal-of-net-zero-emissions-by-2050-is-narrow-but-brings-huge-benefits"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; this year that called for a stop to investments in new fossil fuel infrastructure. It marked a dramatic shift for an institution that started in the 1970s to monitor oil markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9U6zUh"&gt;People around the world are already reeling from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22654003/floods-wildfires-hurricane-ida-climate-change-disasters-compound-risks"&gt;back-to-back disasters&lt;/a&gt; fueled by climate change: scorching heatwaves, relentless droughts, raging wildfires, and terrifying storms, to name a few. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zmOXCG"&gt;Researchers had already predicted that these kinds of things would grow worse, but Friederike Otto and Geert Jan van Oldenborgh set out to find climate change’s fingerprints in each catastrophe. They joined forces with other scientists around the world to launch the World Weather Attribution project, which has truly changed the game when it comes to our understanding of how &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617371/extreme-weather-science-attribution-un-report-climate-change"&gt;climate change supercharges extreme weather&lt;/a&gt;. The group found that this summer’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22559961/heat-roads-washington-oregon-climate-infrastructure"&gt;road-buckling heatwave&lt;/a&gt; in the US Pacific Northwest and southwest Canada would have been “&lt;a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/western-north-american-extreme-heat-virtually-impossible-without-human-caused-climate-change/"&gt;virtually impossible&lt;/a&gt;” without climate change. Thanks in large part to the group’s work, leading climate scientists can say definitively that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22613531/climate-change-united-nations-report-extreme-weather-ipcc"&gt;human activity is the main driver&lt;/a&gt; behind increasingly apocalyptic weather. Otto and van Oldenborgh are on the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RaX8oz"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gjvoldenborgh?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@gjvoldenborgh&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; myself are on the 2021 &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TIME100?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#TIME100&lt;/a&gt; list: &lt;a href="https://t.co/z9FOeKrtqV"&gt;https://t.co/z9FOeKrtqV&lt;/a&gt;. Wow. Not sure I can quite believe that but it's fantastic to see that science &amp;amp; in particular climate science is seen to be influential. Always hoped &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wxrisk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@wxrisk&lt;/a&gt; actually makes a difference.&lt;/p&gt;— Dr Friederike Otto (@FrediOtto) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FrediOtto/status/1438126354277576705?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AtOdt1"&gt;Time also highlighted a few leaders working on big solutions. Frans Timmermans, executive vice president of the European Commission, was on the list because of his work to get Europe on track to slash heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions by more than half this decade. That &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577162/european-union-climate-change-greenhouse-gas-emissions"&gt;roadmap&lt;/a&gt; includes a plan to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576994/european-union-gas-vehicle-ice-ban-2035-electric-cars"&gt;phase out&lt;/a&gt; gas-powered vehicles by 2035. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UeW7rL"&gt;Then there’s attorney Roger Cox, one of the architects behind &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22455387/big-oil-gas-shell-exxon-chevron-climate-change"&gt;Big Oil and Gas’ no good, very bad day&lt;/a&gt; in May. Cox won a suit against Royal Dutch Shell to cut its pollution nearly in half by 2030 to keep in line with global goals made in the Paris climate agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xDt6a3"&gt;As the world charts out potential solutions to the climate crisis, there will need to be watchdogs to ensure that a new energy economy doesn’t repeat the sins of the old one — particularly when it comes to exposing vulnerable communities to toxins and pollution. Phyllis Omido was named one of Time’s “Most Influential People” after she successfully &lt;a href="https://qz.com/africa/1231792/a-battery-recycling-plant-owned-by-indian-businessmen-caused-a-lead-poisoning-crisis-in-kenya/"&gt;fought&lt;/a&gt; to shut down the lead-smelting plant she once worked at in Mombasa, Kenya. Such smelters popped up in Kenya to feed demand for lead-acid batteries paired with solar arrays, and poisoned children in the process — including Omido’s son. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uRRwA9"&gt;Omido, Cox, Birol, Otto, van Oldenborgh, and Timmermans are just a few of the countless voices around the world holding polluters accountable. So there’s a good chance we’ll see more of their names next year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Become a true impostor with an official Among Us costume</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z-7X7qIIfnOFrnn1vuQM0kiJo9A=/0x8:2429x1627/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69863776/among_us_costumes.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The official &lt;/em&gt;Among Us&lt;em&gt; costumes.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Among-Us-Official-Inflatable-Crewmate/dp/B09151X1VG?ref_=ast_sto_dp" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="alx3m0"&gt;Halloween is just around the corner, and if you still need a costume (smh if you haven’t gotten one yet, Halloween is 46 days away, what are you doing?) might I recommend the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AmongUsGame/status/1438221581117964288"&gt;new official &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; crewmate costumes&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3AGAuo"&gt;If you get one of these ridiculous inflatable outfits, you’ll surely fool everyone around you into believing you’re not suspicious in any way whatsoever. Definitely not an impostor, nope. Just see for yourself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6MDOm3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;roll up into the finest establishments with our new Among Us costumes  ✨ &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/toikido1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@toikido1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;u can grab these on Amazon, Walmart, HMV, and other retailers globally! BE!! THE SPACEBEAN!!! &lt;a href="https://t.co/9LVvKBzvwM"&gt;pic.twitter.com/9LVvKBzvwM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Among Us (@AmongUsGame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AmongUsGame/status/1438221581117964288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UJl91U"&gt;The costumes come in two sizes, an adult version and a kids version, and are available in four colors for each size. The adult size tops out at five feet, nine inches, so if you’re on the taller side, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AmongUsGame/status/1438223053935325184"&gt;your ankles might stick out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Z4OElz"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;5'9"! i mean you could still wear it, ur ankles would just stick out which makes it kinda cursed but also funny&lt;/p&gt;— Among Us (@AmongUsGame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AmongUsGame/status/1438223053935325184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zt1Q2W"&gt;There are holes for your arms, though they don’t look like they let you reach very far in front of you. To stay truly camouflaged, you might want to wear a matching sweater.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dN9qgoOCWaruo9m0QJIrJAn8j4o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22853474/58a45ea0_71ec_458e_b4d8_8bcd932c.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media-library-service-media/58a45ea0-71ec-458e-b4d8-8bcd932c12b7.__CR38,0,2425,750_PT0_SX970_V1___.png" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the left is what your arms will look like in one of the costumes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="o2ZM4Q"&gt;In addition, the adult version looks to have a visor with a mirror effect to help hide your identity, while the kids version seems to have a mesh one so you can see who’s wearing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="x6ZoFL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10755193"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pMZTqA"&gt;On Amazon, the adult costumes cost $49.99, but I couldn’t find the price for the kids ones. Disappointingly, it appears that &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/054B5A97-69B7-4A59-8663-22E2DFAA7A50"&gt;Amazon’s listings for the costumes&lt;/a&gt; are already sold out. But the &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; tweet says they’ll be available at Walmart, HMV, and other retailers around the world, so you might still be able to snag one before the spookiest day of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sd7wgS"&gt;A day that you definitely would not consider sneaking up behind your friends and frightening them in an &lt;s&gt;impostor&lt;/s&gt; crewmate costume. Never.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best iPad deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The 2020 iPad Air and new iPad Mini have the same design and shape as the iPad Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OqDG5sf2dQljUBF65yxBXRiy6oE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66899976/vpavic_4244_20201020_0013.6.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1L3M8j"&gt;Deals on Apple’s iPads are more common than you might think. Whether you’re after the affordable — now outgoing — entry-level iPad from last year, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or iPad Mini, there’s usually some sort of sale happening somewhere. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers. But that’s often what deal our deal hunters at &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;are doing each and every day, so let us help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzVhpS"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each iPads model that is currently available, some of which are also available &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fipad" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;refurbished&lt;/a&gt;. You should also be aware that &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fus-hed%2Fshop%2Fback-to-school&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipadsbestdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple is currently running its back-to-school promotion&lt;/a&gt; until September 27th, meaning you can snag a free set of AirPods with the purchase of either an iPad Air or iPad Pro. If you prefer the AirPods Pro, you can also upgrade for an additional $90. Either way, you have to be a student who’s eligible to check out through Apple’s educational storefront. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jzeS15"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10754964"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="DMtl0v"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;The best iPad (2020) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;2020 iPad&lt;/a&gt; is Apple’s most affordable tablet, however, it’s now being replaced by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22672438/ipad-2021-new-price-specs-release-date-apple-a13-chip"&gt;9th Gen model announced&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674369/apple-iphone-13-event-2021-announcements-missing-m1x-macbook-pros-airpods-3-macos-monterey"&gt;Apple’s recent iPhone 13 event&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re in the market for the new model, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22665133/apple-ipad-mini-2021-preorder-buy-how-to-price-release-date"&gt;preorders are available now&lt;/a&gt;, with shipments slated for Friday, September 24th. As you might expect, there are no discounts currently available on the 2021 model, given the tablet has yet to hit store shelves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fMZ13y"&gt;If you want to try getting the best possible price on last year’s model, though, know that the 32GB model initially retailed for $329 and the 128GB variant for $429. The new, 64GB model goes for the same price as last year’s 32GB variant ($329), while the 256GB configuration jumps to $479. The 2020 model has the same 10.2-inch display and features the older A12 Bionic processor, a front-facing Touch ID fingerprint sensor on the physical home button, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9iBwQg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10431710"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5m6ZrK"&gt;Currently, the outgoing base model iPad is a bit hard to come by at many retailers. It is either out of stock or marked as discontinued at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5J9699?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-ipad-10-2-inch-wi-fi-only-8th-generation%2F-%2FA-81498539%3Fpreselect%3D80596591%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipadsbestdeals"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1751882593844829755#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1594504-REG%2Fapple_myl92ll_a_10_2_ipad_wi_fi_32gb.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21280354%2Fbest-ipad-deals-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt;. Right now, Apple only offers a refurbished one with &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FFW782LL%2FA%2FRefurbished-IPAD-WI-FI-128GB-Silver%3Ffnode%3Df7a6c58dde7329b21579b02c65a17e1f89102b3746bf56fb4fc1e60dbff56530c0f1da3d19e86a9a6f6e6858f96394b5d01117d34b59a73cdea074885f80ed0867aa9a4cdbdcf73ca96c7f42bd02edf1&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipadsbestdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB of storage and Wi-Fi for $279&lt;/a&gt;, though the new ninth-generation model might be a more compelling proposition if you prefer the benefits of the faster A13 Bionic processor and 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Center Stage&lt;/a&gt;, a feature designed for keeping you framed up and centered while on video calls. That said, we’ll keep an eye out for any sale opportunities before the 2020 iPads are completely gone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fmPtFu"&gt;The best iPad Mini (2019) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;Apple released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;latest iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; in early 2019 with the same 7.9-inch display and design as previous iterations, but with refreshed internal specs. Just like the base iPad, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new iPad Mini was announced&lt;/a&gt; during Apple’s “California Streaming” event. While the upcoming, revamped Mini looks promising with its larger screen, top-of-the-line processor, support for USB-C, and 5G option, it also starts at a higher price point of $599. The current iPad Mini has the A12 Bionic processor and normally runs $399 for 64GB of storage and $549 for 256GB. If you want LTE connectivity, the starting price is $529 for the 64GB model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rG7i7T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515887"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QD0sMe"&gt;Sales on the basic Wi-Fi model of the 2019 iPad Mini don’t always come around, though we have seen some recently. The 64GB, Wi-Fi-enabled iPad Mini is &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB%2F207104625%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available right now for $299 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt; in space gray and gold. Amazon does not currently have any 64GB models in stock, but is offering the 256GB unit &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PSK4LGQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in silver for $449&lt;/a&gt; while &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-256GB%2F211304805%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipadsbestdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart offers all three colors of the expanded storage option for the same price&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="skoMEh"&gt;Just like the base iPad, the replacement model looks enticing — and if you’re interested &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22665133/apple-ipad-mini-2021-preorder-buy-how-to-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can preorder it now&lt;/a&gt; — though there will certainly be a bigger price delta with the increased starting price of the new iPad Mini and the fact that its predecessor is sure to continue receiving discounts. Also, as of right now, the 2021 model is not available at a discount, which is expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="66nPkj"&gt;The best iPad Air (2020) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2020 iPad Air&lt;/a&gt; has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to the prior model’s 10.5-inch screen and features thinner bezels around it. Apple has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, too, which is located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGT87b"&gt;The fourth-generation iPad Air comes in 64GB or 256GB storage configurations. The Wi-Fi models start at $599 and $749, respectively, making the starting price slightly more than the prior gen. The units equipped with LTE start at $729. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JhHVno"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546269"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FkUXn4"&gt;Fortunately, if you’ve been waiting for a discount on the iPad Air, the 64GB model with Wi-Fi is available for $539 — $60 off the list price — in all of its vibrant colors at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08J61FCVN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-64GB-Silver%2F694429303&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipadsbestdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. The 256GB, Wi-Fi-enabled version is available for a $100 discount from the same retailers, with your choice of most colors marked down to $650 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J6LJMT4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-256GB-Space-Gray%2F325933358&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipadsbestdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. The one outlier is the green model, which has a more modestly discounted price of &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-256GB-Green%2F705887437%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipadsbestdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$720&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tNTIrn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple is releasing iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 on September 20th","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666881/apple-ios-ipados-15-features-release-date-update"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="7PfM3l"&gt;The best iPad Pro (2020) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="9tR4OQ"&gt;The fifth-generation, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1-equipped iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; came out earlier this year, which means there are many deals to be had on the prior &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPad Pro from 2020&lt;/a&gt;. The fourth-generation iPad Pro looks nearly the same as the 2018 model, when this design was first established, aside from a dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike the less expensive iPad models, the 2020 iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of Lightning. It also features a high refresh display and Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dnrxd6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8lvMKy"&gt;If you’re looking for the 11-inch, 2020 iPad Pro, it’s currently available on clearance in some configurations at Best Buy, B&amp;amp;H, and Target. As far as the Wi-Fi models go, the 128GB base storage is &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1148110/2092?subId1=VergeiPadDeals080321&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-ipad-pro-11-inch-wi-fi-128gb-silver%2F-%2FA-77616876" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;discounted to $700 at Target&lt;/a&gt; — though you may have to pick it up at a brick-and-mortar location near you. The 256GB model is available for $769 at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1553812-REG%2Fapple_mxdc2ll_a_11_ipad_pro_early.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21280354%2Fbest-ipad-deals-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; and $800 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747067025091069041#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; in space gray. Best Buy is also selling the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065575324374726#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065628094129232#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB&lt;/a&gt; variants for $950 and $1,150, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OQi2tt"&gt;Similar discounts extend to the 12.9-inch model at Best Buy and B&amp;amp;H Photo. If you prefer Wi-Fi only, the 128GB model is discounted to $849 at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1553840-REG%2Fapple_my2h2ll_a_12_9_ipad_pro_early.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21280354%2Fbest-ipad-deals-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;.

Lastly, the 512GB model is $1,150 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065793668725731#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; while the massive &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065843218873803#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB&lt;/a&gt; is $1,350&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="0LPHck"&gt;The best iPad Pro (2021) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="M0IoQA"&gt;The 2020 iPad Pro is great, but if display quality is the most important factor to your purchasing decision, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12.9-inch 2021 iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; is the way to go. The larger, fifth-generation model makes use of a Mini LED display, which is engineered to produce deeper blacks and better contrast, much like OLED technology. Additionally, both the 11- and 12.9-inch iPad Pros tout Apple’s blazing-fast M1 chip — the same processor found in the latest Mac computers — as well as new features like Center Stage. They’re the most impressive and expensive iPads to date, with the 11- and 12.9-inch configurations typically starting at $799 and $1,099, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

That shaves $100 off the cost of either of those massive storage options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vj7Nj6"&gt;The desirable Mini LED-equipped 12.9-inch, 128GB model with Wi-Fi is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932D45W8/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-12-9-inch-iPad-Pro-2021-Wi-Fi-128GB-Space-Gray%2F774697337" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; for $999, the second-best price we’ve seen on Apple’s high-end tablet to date.
