    <title>Diablo II is getting remastered for console and PC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yAYTtt9jYFghX2H6VERDG2jGZZ4=/145x0:1767x1081/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68845709/screenshot__170_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7HhRi5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diablo II&lt;/em&gt; is getting a big overhaul in a new remaster. After &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/1/25/22248563/diablo-2-remake-release-dates-pc-blizzard-vicarious-visions-activision-report"&gt;a few leaks&lt;/a&gt;, Blizzard officially announced &lt;em&gt;Diablo II Resurrected&lt;/em&gt; at its online-only edition of Blizzcon 2021. The new version of the game — which first launched back in 2000 — will launch this year on PC, Switch, PS4, PS5, and Xbox Series X and S, with cross-progression between PC and console. The HD remaster will include both the base game and its expansion, &lt;em&gt;Lord of Destruction&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="R1N5Dr"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;                              &lt;br&gt;          Arise,                        &lt;br&gt;               Diablo,     &lt;br&gt;   Lord         &lt;br&gt;                of              &lt;br&gt;                      Terror.&lt;br&gt;                   &lt;br&gt;                             &lt;br&gt;                       &lt;a href="https://t.co/76kxCCMv51"&gt;pic.twitter.com/76kxCCMv51&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Diablo (@Diablo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Diablo/status/1362896494622294017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LNiclb"&gt;The announcement comes at a surprisingly busy time for the long running action-RPG series. In addition to the remaster of &lt;em&gt;Diablo II&lt;/em&gt;, Blizzard is also working on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22180377/diablo-immortal-iphone-android-technical-alpha-preview"&gt;a mobile spinoff called &lt;em&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the next full-fledged title, &lt;em&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ySwr6n"&gt;If &lt;em&gt;Diablo II&lt;/em&gt; is too modern for your tastes, the original game is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/7/18254558/diablo-classic-digital-gog-blizzard-windows-10-purchase"&gt;still available on GOG.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google fires second AI ethics researcher following internal investigation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lvzPJnQ4c-p1vA3D6ORlez-a6tI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68845702/acastro_180427_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VFz7TL"&gt;Google has fired Margaret Mitchell, co-lead of the ethical AI team, after she used an automated script to look through her emails in order to find evidence of discrimination against Timnit Gebru. &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/google-fires-another-ai-ethics-leader-6ef7dcd5-4583-4396-b5b3-129547ff3091.html"&gt;The news was first reported by &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nfxfna"&gt;Mitchell’s firing comes one day after Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289264/google-restructuring-ethical-ai-team-timnit-gebru-firing"&gt;announced a reorganization to its AI teams&lt;/a&gt; working on ethics and fairness. Marian Croak, a vice president in the engineering organization, is now leading “a new center of expertise on responsible AI within Google Research,” &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/marian-croak-responsible-ai/"&gt;according to a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gvV6yD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“These decisions were made behind our backs”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Oxgjl7"&gt;The ethical AI team has been in turmoil since Gebru’s termination in early December. After the announcement yesterday, senior researcher &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexhanna/status/1362477638749626369"&gt;Alex Hanna wrote&lt;/a&gt; that the team was not aware of Croak’s appointment until news broke Wednesday night. “We were told to trust the process, trust in decision-makers like Marian Croak to look out for our best interests,” she said on Twitter. “But these decisions were made behind our backs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yx2EGt"&gt; “After conducting a review of this manager’s conduct, we confirmed that there were multiple violations of our code of conduct, as well as of our security policies, which included the exfiltration of confidential business-sensitive documents and private data of other employees,” Google said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;Axios &lt;/em&gt;about Mitchell’s firing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lv1Nbs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Diablo IV’s latest trailer unveils the rogue class</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q30MkFRCycfmeqLFxQgJ4VaeaM4=/130x0:967x558/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68845651/Screen_Shot_2021_02_19_at_5.44.51_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dJMwlk"&gt;At Blizzcon 2021, Blizzard revealed the latest glimpse at its upcoming RPG &lt;em&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/em&gt;. The cinematic trailer introduced a previously-unknown character class to the latest installment of the game: the rogue. The other already-announced classes are barbarian, sorceress, and druid. The trailer also provided a nice look at the game’s dark atmosphere, getting particularly gruesome towards the end. You might not want to pierce your ears after watching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWmHGz"&gt;Before the virtual convention Blizzard made sure to temper expectations by announcing that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22267131/diablo-4-overwatch-2-release-date-2022-activision-blizzard-earnings"&gt;neither &lt;em&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/em&gt; nor &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt; would be releasing this year&lt;/a&gt;. The action role-playing game has been much-anticipated for some time, as it was originally announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942565/diablo-4-announced-release-date-blizzcon-2019"&gt;way back at the 2019 edition of Blizzcon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gHoF8C"&gt;Meanwhile, Blizzard is also hoping to expand the franchise’s reach with an upcoming mobile adaptation called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22180377/diablo-immortal-iphone-android-technical-alpha-preview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ex-Google engineer Anthony Levandowski has closed his artificial intelligence church</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Anthony Levandowski In Court For Bond Hearing After Being Charged With Stealing Google Trade Secrets" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TjdIjNSnW1Lp6E_OZUAOhtI7MCo=/0x63:4194x2859/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68845574/1172284878.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Justin Sullivan / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CPxfhD"&gt;Anthony Levandowski, a former Google engineer convicted of stealing self-driving car secrets, is closing his artificial intelligence-focused church Way of the Future (WOTF), &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/anthony-levandowski-closes-his-church-of-ai/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a somewhat inauspicious end to the church’s goal of pursuing “the realization, acceptance, and worship of a Godhead based on Artificial Intelligence (AI),” in preparation for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity"&gt;the Singularity&lt;/a&gt;. Now humanity will be left to deal with rampant AI without the religion’s guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fp3QDR"&gt;Levandowski started the process of shuttering WOTF in June 2020, according to documents filed in the state of California found by &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;. WOTF never had regular meetings or a physical church building. The church’s funds, totaling $175,172, have been donated to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4tIEwP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Way of the Future is a thing of the past&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="83DlSm"&gt;Owning and operating an AI church is really just one piece of the larger Levandowski story, which &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has covered as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/2/16965974/uber-waymo-self-driving-car-lawsuit-news"&gt;the legal saga between Uber and Google’s Waymo&lt;/a&gt;. Levandowski worked on autonomous vehicles at Google, then started his own self-driving trucking company Otto, which he later sold to Uber. At some point in the journey from Google to Uber, Levandowski took some internal documents from the search giant, leading to Google suing Uber in 2017 and settling in 2018. Levandowski was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21354906/anthony-levandowski-waymo-uber-lawsuit-sentence-18-months-prison-lawsuit"&gt;convicted of trade secret theft&lt;/a&gt; in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CSrVBK"&gt;Levandowski was sentenced to a shortened 18 months in prison to be served following the pandemic, but was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22240175/trump-pardons-anthony-levandowski-google-uber-waymo-trade-secrets"&gt;pardoned by former President Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; before he left office. With Way of the Future a thing of the past, no prison sentence to serve, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/18/18146339/anthony-levandowski-self-driving-car-cross-country-co-pilot-pronto-uber-waymo"&gt;another autonomous driving company&lt;/a&gt; to oversee, Levandowski seems like he can wait for AI to surpass humans in relative peace.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blizzard Arcade Collection bundles three of the studio’s more obscure classics</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qa3vV4MWu_A6eJTXosFca9h92pA=/172x0:1749x1051/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68845484/Screenshot__156_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9JQr7S"&gt;As part of BlizzCon Online’s opening ceremony, Blizzard Entertainment announced a new video game anthology that includes some of the earlier titles created by the &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; developer. &lt;a href="https://blizzard.gamespress.com/en-CA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blizzard Arcade Collection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a compilation featuring three titles developed by Blizzard around the early and mid-1990s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VH1OnR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blizzard Arcade Collection&lt;/em&gt; includes &lt;em&gt;The Lost Vikings&lt;/em&gt;, a puzzle platformer that was originally released on SNES in 1993, back when the studio was known as Silicon &amp;amp; Synapse. The game would also see previous ports on other consoles like the Amiga and Game Boy Advance, and was even made available on PC &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/5/3/5678044/the-lost-vikings-free-blizzard-deal"&gt;as a free download on Battle.net&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TF6V9D"&gt;The other games available include another platformer called &lt;em&gt;Blackthorne&lt;/em&gt;, which was released originally in 1994 on the SNES, as well as &lt;em&gt;Rock n’ Roll Racing&lt;/em&gt;, a vehicular combat racer. And just like &lt;em&gt;The Lost Vikings,&lt;/em&gt; both titles would make their way onto &lt;a href="https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/download?show=classic"&gt;Blizzard’s digital storefront as free titles&lt;/a&gt; in 2013 and 2014, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MgNnXt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blizzard Arcade Collection&lt;/em&gt; is available now on PC, PS4, Switch, and Xbox One.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Street Fighter icons Chun-Li and Ryu are joining Fortnite</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/16s9UED8v3kOiP-3lF1_EDuqdBA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68845433/Screen_Shot_2021_02_19_at_1.58.14_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AYd8l2"&gt;Famous video game fighter Chun-Li may not be &lt;a href="https://jezebel.com/who-forgot-to-invite-chun-li-to-the-mortal-kombat-1846300631"&gt;in the new &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat&lt;/em&gt; movie&lt;/a&gt;, but she and fellow &lt;em&gt;Street Fighter&lt;/em&gt; icon Ryu will be playable characters in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;soon. Both Chun-Li and Ryu will be available in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; in-game shop on Saturday, February 20th at 7PM ET. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h1EWB9"&gt;Chun-Li and Ryu aren’t the first video game stars to appear in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; this season — fans have also had the chance to pick up skins based on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22151470/fortnite-god-of-war-kratos-skin-now-available"&gt;Kratos from &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22166187/fortnite-master-chief-halo-the-walking-dead-the-game-awards"&gt;Master Chief from &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QXE3H7"&gt;This entire season of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; has been jam-packed with other crossovers, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22276283/fortnite-tron-crossover-skins-light-cycles"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tron&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/30/22256564/fortnite-gi-joe-snake-eyes"&gt;G.I. Joe’s Snake Eyes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fortnitegame/status/1337245726477348865?lang=en"&gt;two characters from &lt;em&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22231705/fortnite-soccer-skins-manchester-city-juventus-ac-milan-faze-clan"&gt;soccer kits from real-world teams&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22028767/the-mandalorian-fortnite-perfect-character-season-5"&gt;even the Mandalorian and Baby Yoda&lt;/a&gt; (who is absolutely adorable in-game). And the game’s last season was a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402707/fortnite-chapter-2-season-4-marvel-nexus-war-thor-iron-man"&gt;huge Marvel-themed crossover&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6NhmWW"&gt;As unexpected as Chun-Li and Ryu’s arrivals may be, they’re just another reminder that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22242696/fortnite-predator-marketing-brands-cross-promotion"&gt;no brand is safe from &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Audeze Penrose gaming headset nails almost everything except for comfort</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Great sound, full of features, but the fit might be a deal-breaker&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="SiQb3F"&gt;The Audeze Penrose has almost everything I want in a wireless gaming headset. Its high-end planar magnetic drivers deliver rich, balanced sound quality that’s easily superior to other models I’ve tested recently. It’s feature-packed, too, with individual volume and microphone levels, USB-C charging, the option for wired connectivity via 3.5mm, as well as support for simultaneous Bluetooth 5.0 audio connections. As a gaming headset, it’s stacked — which it should be for something that costs $299.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JXjG6j"&gt;After reviewing a headset, I usually can’t wait to return to the familiar, plushy, warm-sounding cans of my own Sony WH-1000XM3, but the Penrose is a joy to listen to. Game audio sounds punchy without being over-delivered, I don’t need to blast the volume to hear subtle details, and even though this headset doesn’t have active noise cancellation, I was almost convinced it did due to a combined effort from its closed-back design and thick ear pads that yield better-than-average sound isolation. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Audeze Penrose" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0qNNz9Hrb4jtaK6kZ_hvUzPfizE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22275062/cfaulkner_210128_4394_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In addition to 2.4GHz and Bluetooth, you can connect via 3.5mm.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Z8zGl9"&gt;The particular model that Audeze sent along for review is made to be compatible with PS4 and PS5 consoles and with PCs via its 2.4GHz wireless receiver. (It also works with the Nintendo Switch, even though that isn’t advertised.) It’s clad in black with blue trim to signify which family of consoles it was designed for. The company also makes an Xbox version called the Penrose X that has green trim, and that model’s unique receiver has a two-position toggle switch that lets it work with Microsoft’s proprietary wireless tech in one mode, then on PC in the other. Otherwise, it’s the same hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qgctql"&gt;There’s a caveat to all of this goodness: I didn’t find the Penrose to be comfortable to wear for even short gaming sessions. I never forgot that it was on my head because I felt squeezed the whole time, and that’s a deal-breaker for me. I should note that I have a somewhat large head, so it’s likely that people with smaller noggins won’t feel as compressed. But I imagine that its 320g weight would feel heavy on just about any noggin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pxKz7E"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10315655"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uwzqb6"&gt;Other recent headsets I’ve liked, such as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21519747/hyperx-cloud-ii-wireless-pc-gaming-headset-ps4-ps5-nintendo-switch-usbc-review-release-date-price"&gt;HyperX Cloud II Wireless&lt;/a&gt;, are 320g as well, but its weight is distributed much better. I barely notice that model on my head even after some time has passed, and that’s what I’m personally looking for in a headset. Granted, HyperX Cloud II doesn’t have hefty 100mm magnetic drivers like the Penrose does, which amounts to better sound at the expense of heavier ear cups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W7DXy4"&gt;I’d give Audeze more of a pass if the Penrose was an original design, but it’s almost identical to the $399 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/14/17118960/audezes-mobius-headphones-gaming-3d-audio"&gt;Audeze Mobius&lt;/a&gt; released in 2018, which had enhanced 3D sound processing and head-tracking. (The Penrose lacks both features.) It also looks like the $299 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18171636/hyperx-cloud-orbit-gaming-headphones-planar-magnetic-price-release-date-ces-2019"&gt;HyperX Cloud Orbit released in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, which features Audeze’s planar magnetic drivers, and much of the Mobius’ design. The Penrose’s build quality is still exceptional, but I wish the company had put more focus on refining the design, particularly as it relates to comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Audeze Penrose" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BuHb_pwekMQ2d6QnzvrhmGq2I5M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22275059/cfaulkner_210128_4394_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The dials look easy to access, but they aren’t so simple to discern without looking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TrMLtb"&gt;As for the controls, the layout isn’t unintuitive, but some of the buttons don’t stand out enough when you’re feeling for them — specifically, the volume and mic level dials. Those are integrated into the backside of the left ear cup, and they’re raised, as opposed to being built flush into the ear cup, to make feeling for them easier (at least, that seems like the goal). Those raised hunks of plastic actually make the thin dials tough to discern and adjust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9A5xe0"&gt;Otherwise, it’s easy to take advantage of the Penrose’s main features, like being able to mute the mic with the switch on the left ear cup’s outer shell, or switching wireless modes with the multifunction button near where the detachable mic plugs in. The Penrose isn’t the only headset that lets you connect to a phone via Bluetooth while also being connected to your game console, but I think the execution here is great. If you get a call while you’re gaming, tapping the Penrose’s power button will pick up or hang up. (Careful, though: Audeze says your voice will be transmitted over both Bluetooth and wireless channels.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JvOpfF"&gt;Battery life is lackluster. I’ve gotten around 10 hours of use per charge, whereas some less expensive competing models in our headset buying guide offer 30 or more hours per charge. It’s not great considering the price, but it’s not a huge issue for me since I usually leave my headset at my PC or PS5 charging overnight anyway (made easier by the reversible USB-C port).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Audeze Penrose" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G6_9U36Qf_BPATpxodGu3W0L3GQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22275063/cfaulkner_210128_4394_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The wireless receiver is shaped like a thumb drive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8IVNi7"&gt;It’s easy for me to recommend the Penrose based on its features and sound quality alone, but comfort plays an equally large role for me — and that’s where this headset is lacking the most. It’s a shame that the fit is so fatiguing because it’s really the only deal-breaker. Otherwise, the Penrose could be an ideal addition to any gamer’s life, especially those who want a headset that can connect to multiple devices simultaneously. Just heed the warning that, for certain head shapes and for people sensitive to wearing hefty headphones, it might not fit your head very well. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>After firing a top AI ethicist, Google is changing its diversity and research policies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fSRf0P6uBYYVaSFtyuAFFg84kZs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68845027/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IztY5Z"&gt;Google is changing its policies related to research and diversity after completing an internal investigation into the firing of ethical AI team co-leader &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150355/google-fires-timnit-gebru-facial-recognition-ai-ethicist"&gt;Timnit Gebru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/google-tweaks-diversity-research-policies-following-inquiry-8baa6346-d2a2-456f-9743-7912e4659ca2.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company intends to tie the pay of certain executives to diversity and inclusivity goals. It’s also making changes to how sensitive employee exits are managed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ky9MHl"&gt;Although Google did not reveal the results of the investigation, the changes seem to be direct responses to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150355/google-fires-timnit-gebru-facial-recognition-ai-ethicist"&gt;how the situation with Gebru went down&lt;/a&gt;. After Google demanded that a paper she co-authored be retracted, Gebru told research team management that she would resign from her position and work on a transition plan, unless certain conditions were met. Instead of a transition plan, the company immediately ended her employment while she was on vacation. This sparked backlash from members of her team, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266513/google-engineers-quit-timnit-gebru-ethical-ai-april-christina-curley-firing"&gt;caused some Google engineers to quit in protest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="meaLAL"&gt;Google had claimed that Gebru’s paper was not submitted properly, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22158501/timnit-gebru-team-google-public-statement-fired"&gt;though the research team disagreed&lt;/a&gt;. Google has now said it will “streamline its process for publishing research,” according to &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;, but the exact details of the policy changes weren’t given. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9aTdW"&gt;In an internal email to staff, Jeff Dean, head of AI at Google, wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="kpD1tF"&gt; I heard and acknowledge what Dr. Gebru’s exit signified to female technologists, to those in the Black community and other underrepresented groups who are pursuing careers in tech, and to many who care deeply about Google’s responsible use of AI. It led some to question their place here, which I regret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wr1cPJ"&gt;He also apologized for how Gebru’s exit was handled, although he stopped short of calling it a firing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GUunXx"&gt;The policy changes come a day &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289264/google-restructuring-ethical-ai-team-timnit-gebru-firing"&gt;after Google restructured its AI teams&lt;/a&gt;, a change which members of the ethical AI team were “the last to know about,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexhanna/status/1362476196693303297"&gt;according to research scientist Alex Hanna&lt;/a&gt;, who is a part of the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ODC3Md"&gt;Google declined to share the updated policies with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, instead pointing to &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/google-tweaks-diversity-research-policies-following-inquiry-8baa6346-d2a2-456f-9743-7912e4659ca2.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;’s article&lt;/a&gt; for details. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s DOTA 2 anime gets a proper teaser trailer full of dragon-fighting action</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u45WCZA2dE4CNrA6b3WtBNX3OI4=/307x0:2164x1238/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68844778/Screen_Shot_2021_02_19_at_3.16.29_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IThYjh"&gt;It’s only been a few days since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286539/netflix-valve-dota-2-anime-series-dota-dragons-blood"&gt;Netflix announced&lt;/a&gt; that it was working on an anime series based on &lt;em&gt;DOTA 2&lt;/em&gt; — &lt;em&gt;DOTA: Dragon’s Blood — &lt;/em&gt;but in that time, the streamer has already released a proper teaser trailer that actually shows off the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p3rxA3"&gt;And while the original announcement from earlier in the week showed off just &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM-NqFX2jU8"&gt;a few seconds of footage&lt;/a&gt;, the new trailer is just that — a full-fledged teaser for the series that shows off characters like Davion, the Dragon Knight whose quest will be at the heart of the show, and Princess Mirana (&lt;em&gt;DOTA 2 &lt;/em&gt;players will likely recognize both of those names as heroes playable in the popular online game.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nMcG8M"&gt;The release of a new trailer this soon makes a certain amount of sense, though, given how little time there’s going to be between the show’s announcement and its release on March 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jZJACe"&gt;As previously announced, &lt;em&gt;DOTA: Dragon’s Blood &lt;/em&gt;will be produced&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;by Studio MIR, the group behind &lt;em&gt;Legend of Korra &lt;/em&gt;and Netflix’s&lt;em&gt; Voltron: Legendary Defender, &lt;/em&gt;with Ashley Edward Miller (co-writer on &lt;em&gt;X-Men: First Class &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Thor&lt;/em&gt;) serving as showrunner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="83ZUDX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Good lord, my cast. I’ll have much more to say in the next few days but for now let me drop some names on you… &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/YuriLowenthal?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@YuriLowenthal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/larapulver?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@larapulver&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TonyTodd54?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TonyTodd54&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TroyBakerVA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TroyBakerVA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AustralianFreya?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AustralianFreya&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AlixWiltonRegan?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AlixWiltonRegan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KariWahlgren?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@KariWahlgren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sjacobsen22?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@sjacobsen22&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ansonmount?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@ansonmount&lt;/a&gt; … their acting on DOTA is just phenomenal. &lt;a href="https://t.co/SoB885HEnd"&gt;pic.twitter.com/SoB885HEnd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ashley Edward Miller (@ashmasterzero) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashmasterzero/status/1362061285358063617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Wv4iEB"&gt;Miller has also started teasing some of the series’ cast on Twitter, revealing earlier in the week that the show will feature a mix of popular video game voice actors like Yuri Lowenthal, Troy Baker, Alix Wilton Regan, and Kari Wahlgren — fitting, given the franchise’s gaming pedigree — alongside more traditional film and TV actors like Lara Pulver (&lt;em&gt;Sherlock&lt;/em&gt;), Tony Todd (&lt;em&gt;Candyman&lt;/em&gt;), Anson Mount (&lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Discovery&lt;/em&gt;), and Freya Tingley (&lt;em&gt;Once Upon A Time&lt;/em&gt;.) More details on the cast and show should also arrive before it releases next month. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instacart, Uber, Lyft, Postmates, and DoorDash totally conned you into paying for Prop 22</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Instacart" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EPPQmgTZj9wo0Y1ZVeYnJTdOFgE=/0x2:5194x3465/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68844745/1147794851.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Smith Collection / Gado / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dERsNh"&gt;Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, Instacart, and Postmates spent over $200 million campaigning for Proposition 22, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21546037/prop-22-california-uber-lyft-ballot-measure-result"&gt;the most expensive ballot measure in California history&lt;/a&gt;, successfully convincing voters that they couldn’t properly pay and protect their workers if they were forced to classify them as full employees — at least, not without cutting back service or substantially raising the price you’d pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="03nbJ8"&gt;But now the dust has settled, &lt;em&gt;every single gig economy company&lt;/em&gt; that backed Prop 22 has raised those prices anyway. &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Instacart-is-raising-prices-for-its-California-15961886.php#:~:text=Customers%20will%20now%20pay%20an,pay%20%248%20instead%20of%20%245."&gt;Instacart was the last to join the bait-and-switch today,&lt;/a&gt; according to the &lt;em&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;’s Carolyn Said&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; who &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Here-s-what-you-re-paying-for-Prop-22-15870617.php"&gt;previously told us in January&lt;/a&gt; exactly how much some of these companies are charging Californians to pay for worker benefits: $1-$2 per meal with Uber, $1.50 with Grubhub, up to $1.50 per ride with Lyft, and a whole additional 3 percent increase per order with Instacart (for a total of 8 percent, though it doesn’t apply to the company’s “Express” subscription plan yet). Postmates is charging &lt;a href="https://sf.eater.com/2021/1/20/22240818/postmates-delivery-fees-prop-22"&gt;as much as $2.50 extra per order&lt;/a&gt;, our sister site &lt;em&gt;Eater&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="a9HW9A"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Instacart threatened price increases if they lost Prop 22.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now that they won, they're raising them anyway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gig corporations have no shame.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We cannot let them roll this horrible law out to other States. &lt;a href="https://t.co/FAF9LJ91yA"&gt;pic.twitter.com/FAF9LJ91yA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Gig Workers Rising (@GigWorkersRise) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GigWorkersRise/status/1362804941153210370?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="NABuAY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Instead of paying their workers, gig corporations pumped  $200M to pass prop 22, claiming the worker protections guaranteed under the law would force them to drive up cost &amp;amp; pass it on to customers. Well guess what? They did it anyways. It's honestly disgusting at this point. &lt;a href="https://t.co/tMH2jBjWPE"&gt;https://t.co/tMH2jBjWPE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— California Labor Federation (@CaliforniaLabor) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CaliforniaLabor/status/1338588542004391936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 14, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZUmEb3"&gt;Just to be clear, these companies explicitly pushed voters into supporting Prop 22 to &lt;em&gt;avoid&lt;/em&gt; higher prices. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-fares-double-small-cities-if-voters-reject-prop-22-2020-10#:~:text=%22The%20vast%20majority%20of%20our,on%20what%20city%20you%20are.%22"&gt;publicly said&lt;/a&gt; prices would increase between 20 and 40 percent in big California cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles, and up to double in smaller towns. &lt;a href="https://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/propositions/22/arguments-rebuttals.htm"&gt;In California’s official Voter Guide&lt;/a&gt;, which accompanied mail-in ballots, supporters of the bill warned there would be “significantly higher consumer prices” if Prop 22 failed to pass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s3Cov8"&gt;Companies like Uber and Lyft succeeded in part due to those scare tactics, and by appealing to voters that they could help workers get more protections and higher pay this way instead of potentially putting those workers’ jobs at risk. (It probably didn’t hurt that the app companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21549760/uber-lyft-prop-22-win-vote-app-message-notifications"&gt;bombarded both drivers and passengers with messages using their own apps&lt;/a&gt;, which triggered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21529082/uber-drivers-lawsuit-prop-22-alerts-california-gig-workers"&gt;a lawsuit from drivers&lt;/a&gt; who claimed Uber was bullying them.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0WTiPZ"&gt;But there’s still an open question whether Prop 22 is actually helping workers, regardless of how much more we’re paying to supposedly make that happen. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/feb/18/uber-lyft-doordash-prop-22-drivers-california"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian &lt;/em&gt;reported yesterday&lt;/a&gt; that some drivers claim pay has actually fallen and the job has become less reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZJsp1"&gt;In the UK, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/21330906/uber-uk-supreme-court-employee-rights"&gt;Uber just lost a five-year legal battle today&lt;/a&gt; over a similar issue, which will give workers there a guaranteed minimum wage, paid holiday, and other protections (though they will not necessarily be “employees”). But here in the US where Prop 22 succeeded, it’s opened the door for other parts of the country to potentially replace many regular employees with contractors too. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; has a good piece &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288488/prop-22-gig-economy-expansion-industries-bloomberg"&gt;you should read&lt;/a&gt; about what that future might look like, for better or for worse.&lt;/p&gt;
