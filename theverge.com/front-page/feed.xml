    <title>Razer’s new Blade 15 Base model is just $1,499</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Razer Blade 15 Base sits on a stand on a table with a pair of headphones and a mouse." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/leQolvdkLYpUJeJk_sX0lHli2q0=/0x0:8256x5504/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68473475/Razer_Blade_15_Base_Model___GTX_1660_Ti__Late_2020__Setup.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sUVaxL"&gt;Razer’s Blade 15 is one of the best 15-inch gaming laptops. It’s far from a budget purchase, but Razer has released the most affordable model you can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C4qnBu"&gt;As of today, there’s a new &lt;a href="http://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-15%2FRZ09-03519E11-R3U1&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Blade 15 Base&lt;/a&gt; model up for preorder that is just $1,499. It’ll ship on December 25th. The model includes a Core i7-10750H, 15.6-inch 120Hz screen, GeForce GTX 1660 Ti, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of SSD storage, plus an open M.2 slot. For ports, you’ll get two USB 3.2 Gen 2, two USB-C 3.2 Gen 1, and an HDMI 2.0. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pfMdD4"&gt;Note: these are almost the exact same specs as the $1,599 Blade 15 Base that you can already buy. The biggest difference is that more expensive model has a 144Hz display. As of this writing, that model is on sale for &lt;a href="http://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-15%2FRZ09-03289E21-R3U1&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,499&lt;/a&gt; on Razer’s website. That means there’s little reason to preorder the upcoming Base model when you can get a better screen right now for the same amount of money. (Both of those prices will likely change down the line.) &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uWZMnNurDUy_p2ZtqZCUzfTzpkY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22151755/Razer_Blade_15_Base_Model_GTX_1660_Ti__Late__2020__01.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;aside id="vPwpsI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Razer’s Blade 15 Advanced review: runs fast, runs hot","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21499199/razer-blade-15-advanced-edition-gaming-laptop-2020-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="pKR4gF"&gt;Another thing to note is the storage. Let’s face it, 256GB is not a lot of storage for a gaming laptop. You won’t be able to fit a ton of titles on there. The expandable storage means the 256GB is more forgivable, but you’ll still need to go through the hassle of buying an additional drive if you plan to upgrade. Alternatively, a Blade 15 Base with a 512GB SSD is currently on sale for &lt;a href="http://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-15%2FRZ09-03286E22-R3U1&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,599 on Razer’s website&lt;/a&gt;, which is only $100 more than the base model. As long as it stays at that price, it’s certainly better value. (You’ll also get the 144Hz screen, as well as a GeForce RTX 2060, and you can buy the model right now rather than having to preorder.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bw8EJ1"&gt;But if $1,499 really hits the sweet spot for you, and you’ve missed the sale on the 144Hz model, you can preorder the &lt;a href="http://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-15%2FRZ09-03519E11-R3U1&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new Blade 15 Base model&lt;/a&gt; on Razer’s website. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple and Google’s COVID contact tracing tech is finally coming to their home state of California</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KgYcPpAYyppTXI5dXs4jNWVGPyU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68473379/acastro_200428_1777_coronavirus_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qQmGdz"&gt;After a month of testing on university campuses, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GavinNewsom/status/1336006920923013122"&gt;California’s governor just announced&lt;/a&gt; that the state is launching its &lt;a href="https://canotify.ca.gov/"&gt;COVID contact tracing app&lt;/a&gt; to the public this Thursday, December 10th. The app is called CA Notify, and its launch makes California &lt;a href="https://www.komando.com/coronavirus/states-with-contact-tracing-apps/758717/"&gt;the 18th state&lt;/a&gt; (plus Washington, DC) to release a contact tracing app. It’s also the largest to have done so since the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/10/21216484/google-apple-coronavirus-contract-tracing-bluetooth-location-tracking-data-app"&gt;technology was announced&lt;/a&gt; in April. The first app of its kind was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355500/virginia-apple-google-contact-tracing-app-covid-alabama"&gt;released in Virginia&lt;/a&gt; back in August, so it’s been quite a long time coming, especially considering California is home to Apple and Google, the two companies that developed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/10/21216484/google-apple-coronavirus-contract-tracing-bluetooth-location-tracking-data-app"&gt;contact tracing technology&lt;/a&gt; the app uses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GSNLgb"&gt;Apple CEO Tim Cook and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai have tweeted in support of the app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dOJSYC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;As we work together to fight the rise in cases in California, exposure notifications will help slow the spread of COVID-19 and put our neighbors’ health first. Thank you &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GavinNewsom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@GavinNewsom&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Google?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Google&lt;/a&gt; for helping bring CA Notify to Californians while putting privacy at the very center. &lt;a href="https://t.co/LbsBQn6zCD"&gt;https://t.co/LbsBQn6zCD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Cook (@tim_cook) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1336026658201997318?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 7, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Z33EIl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;California is facing one of its biggest challenges yet in its fight against COVID-19. CA Notify with the exposure notification technology we developed with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Apple&lt;/a&gt; will be a helpful tool as we work together to slow the spread. Thank you &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GavinNewsom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@GavinNewsom&lt;/a&gt; for your leadership. &lt;a href="https://t.co/mnAJBdL1bb"&gt;https://t.co/mnAJBdL1bb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sundarpichai/status/1336010297883066368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 7, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1gfRhj"&gt;The app uses the contact tracing API that was added to iOS and Android back in May, and it requires an iPhone with iOS 14.2 or a phone running Android 6.0 or above with Bluetooth Low Energy. Basically, your phone will automatically exchange a private key with another phone if they’re within Bluetooth range. (The key doesn’t contain location or any personally identifying information.) When someone tests positive, they can press a button to send a notification to every other person using the app whose phone virtually bumped into theirs, letting them know that they should get tested and quarantine. If you’re concerned about privacy, it’s worth noting that the exposure notification won’t include any information about who exposed whom or when and where it happened. It will only say that you’ve been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k7K8rN"&gt;If you have an Android phone, the CA Notify app will be available on December 10th for download on the Google Play Store. California’s site &lt;a href="https://canotify.ca.gov/#section4"&gt;has a guide&lt;/a&gt; for iPhone users, but it’s pretty simple: go to the Settings app then to Exposure Notifications. Tapping “Turn on Exposure Notifications” will let you select California as your region and turn on the tracing. (iPhone owners won’t need a separate app.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vZeafs"&gt;Since California is home to the tech companies behind the tracing technology, I’m hoping we’ll see a high rate of adoption. It’s just unfortunate that it’s taken seemingly tech-forward states like California (which is currently seeing a spike in cases) this long to roll out the app. Washington state, the home of Microsoft and Amazon, &lt;a href="https://www.king5.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/more-than-1-million-sign-up-for-covid-19-exposure-app-in-washington-state/281-45e39f68-2663-49f4-a8e9-ef0ac8398a6d"&gt;just rolled out its app last week&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Comcast extends offer of free Wi-Fi at community centers through June 30th, 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="comcast" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9yul-6KM4eWRpUy39cofQPGInG0=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68473280/comcast.1419979278.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MLxDP6"&gt;Comcast is extending its COVID-19 support programs &lt;a href="https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/covid-support-extended"&gt;through June 30th, 2021&lt;/a&gt;, including the free Wi-Fi and educational resources it offers at local community centers throughout the US. The company says this is the third time it has extended its programs during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ka57rH"&gt;Community centers that offer free Comcast internet access are called “Lift Zones” by the company, though what’s most important is how they’re meant to reach low-income students who might have inconsistent internet access at home. Switching to remote learning or a combination of in-person and online instruction has made internet access critical for students, so having a place to log on that’s theoretically close to home helps. Comcast is also extending its Internet Essentials service for low-income households free for 60 days to new subscribers, and access to free Xfinity WiFi hotspots to this new June 2021 deadline as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="u5wXPV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Switching to remote learning has made internet access critical for students&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="34RGdj"&gt;Comcast isn’t alone in offering discounts during the pandemic. AT&amp;amp;T’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Finternet%2Faccess%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F7%2F22158985%2Fcomcast-free-wifi-internet-extension-2021-low-income-students#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;“Access from AT&amp;amp;T” program&lt;/a&gt;, which offers discounted internet service for families that participate in certain government assistance programs, was expanded to include families that meet a basic income eligibility during the pandemic. AT&amp;amp;T is also waiving data overage fees for all of its home internet plans, though both changes are currently slated to end on December 31st, 2020. Verizon’s offerings are slightly different. The company has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2Fupdate-verizon-serve-customers-covid-19&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F7%2F22158985%2Fcomcast-free-wifi-internet-extension-2021-low-income-students#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a $20 discount on monthly payments for new Fios subscribers&lt;/a&gt; who qualify for the Federal Communications Commission’s low-income Lifeline discount program, along with 60 days of free router rentals. Sign-ups are accepted through the end of 2020, and customers can keep the discount as long as they qualify, according to Verizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SbPbhP"&gt;All three companies signed on to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21178451/fcc-coronavirus-keep-americans-connected-pledge-att-comcast-charter-att"&gt;“Keep Americans Connected” pledge&lt;/a&gt; created by the FCC in March when the main focus at the time was not terminating internet service for 60 days, whether or not customers were able to pay their bills. Those 60 days have long been up, and despite the pandemic continuing to infect wide swaths of the country, there’s currently no equally expansive measure to protect customers. AT&amp;amp;T, Verizon, and Comcast are all offering ways to maintain your connection — but not without subscribers taking action first. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FCC awards SpaceX $886 million for satellite internet network</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="Spectators watch from Canaveral National Seashore as a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying 60 Starlink satellites launches from pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center on October 6, 2020 in Cape Canaveral, Florida.

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Paul Hennessy/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SzNvoC"&gt;The Federal Communications Commission &lt;a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-368588A1.pdf"&gt;announced $9.2 billion in awards&lt;/a&gt; to companies providing broadband internet to rural areas across the US, and Elon Musk’s SpaceX was one of the biggest winners. The company will receive $886 million over the next 10 years for its Starlink satellite broadband project, under the Federal Communication Commission’s Rural Digital Opportunity Fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kaVfWg"&gt;Starlink is SpaceX’s constellation of satellites that will fly at low altitudes around the Earth, providing internet on the ground below. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317082/spacex-falcon-9-starlink-blacksky-rideshare-launch-time-visor-watch-live"&gt;SpaceX already has launched&lt;/a&gt; 900 of the planned 12,000 satellites needed for the Starlink system into low-Earth orbit. Musk has said the company needs 800 satellites in space to provide “significant operational capabilities.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536073/spacex-starlink-public-beta-testing-email-user-terminal"&gt;SpaceX kicked off its Better Than Nothing Beta&lt;/a&gt; for Starlink broadband in October after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21325413/spacex-starlink-user-terminals-antennas-internet-satellite-constellation-beta-testing"&gt;introducing a private beta&lt;/a&gt; over the summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99Pj40"&gt;Other big winners in the FCC auction included LTD Broadband, which will get  $1.3 billion; Charter Communications, which will receive $1.2 billion; and the Rural Electric Cooperative Consortium, which is getting $1.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6BjxEg"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/3/21117306/iowa-caucus-rural-broadband-access-election-campaign-sanders-warren"&gt;Between 24 and 163 million people&lt;/a&gt; lack broadband internet access in the US, and the problem is especially acute in rural areas. The incoming &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/11/20/biden-congress-broadband-internet/"&gt;Biden administration is expected to increase&lt;/a&gt; federal broadband spending in 2021 to bridge the so-called “digital divide.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber’s fraught and deadly pursuit of self-driving cars is over</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pGkruYQlihoV3tvv9WkPJ-AmZAA=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68472998/__CA9908_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qX93lZ"&gt;Uber is selling its autonomous vehicle business to Aurora Innovations, a San Francisco-based startup founded by the former head engineer of Google’s self-driving car project, the two companies announced Monday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lUknaS"&gt;As part of the deal, Aurora’s self-driving cars will eventually operate on Uber’s ride-hailing platform. Uber will invest $400 million in Aurora and Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi will join the startup’s board of directors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jYMTLE"&gt;It’s unclear whether the acquisition will result in any layoffs. “Aurora has committed to making offers to the majority of ATG employees,” an Uber spokesperson said. “We are working through the details with Aurora and will notify our teams in the coming weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wu8vzv"&gt;The deal marks the end of Uber’s ambitious dream of replacing it’s fleet of human-powered taxis with robot drivers. The ride-hailing company believed that by pouring millions of dollars into developing its own technology, it could eliminate its main cost factor — drivers — and take over the world of transportation with cheap, plentiful autonomous vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="e6juUR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The deal marks the end of Uber’s fraught pursuit of a fleet of robot taxis to replace its human-powered one&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tidyDF"&gt;Instead, Uber faced one disaster of its own making after another. The company was sued by Waymo for allegedly stealing the Google offshoot’s trade secrets. The companies eventually settled, but Uber’s former star engineer (and ex-Googler) Anthony Levandowski was recently sentenced to 18 months in jail for the crime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AvvjNz"&gt;More troubling than that, though, was the death of Elaine Herzberg in March 2018. The 49-year-old woman was struck and killed by a self-driving Uber vehicle while walking her bike across the street in Tempe, Arizona. It was likely the first known fatality by an autonomous vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GotU3P"&gt;After a lengthy investigation, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/19/20972584/uber-fault-self-driving-crash-ntsb-probable-cause"&gt;National Transportation Safety Board split the blame&lt;/a&gt; between Uber, the safety driver, the victim, and the state of Arizona in a blistering official report that also took the federal government to task for failing to properly regulate the industry. The company was cleared of any criminal wrongdoing by local authorities. Uber settled a lawsuit with Herzberg’s family for an undisclosed sum. Police later filed criminal charges against Uber’s safety driver, claiming she wasn’t watching the road but was instead streaming &lt;em&gt;The Voice &lt;/em&gt;on her phone at the time of the crash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MI9KDC"&gt;After the crash, Uber resumed testing its self-driving cars but in a much diminished capacity. The company’s Volvo SUVs were only allowed to operate in a closed loop in downtown Pittsburgh, where the Advanced Technologies Group is headquartered. The company recently unveiled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/12/18662626/uber-volvo-self-driving-car-safety-autonomous-factory-level"&gt;its third-generation vehicle&lt;/a&gt;, with plans to begin testing in Washington, DC, and its hometown of San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IMQFYe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the coronavirus pandemic has pulled the rug out from under Uber&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="khhpOb"&gt;But the coronavirus pandemic has pulled the rug out from under Uber, which has never had a profitable quarter in its existence. With the evaporation of demand of its ride-hailing business, Khosrowshahi has been pushing to sell off the money-losing parts of the business in his pursuit of profitability. Most recently, Uber reportedly sold its air taxi division to a California-based startup called Joby Aviation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qxmxiU"&gt;Aurora is an interesting choice for a buyer. The startup was founded in 2016 by former lead engineer for Google’s self-driving project Chris Urmson. His co-founders are Sterling Anderson, who helped lead Tesla’s Model X project, and Drew Bagnell, who ran a research lab at Carnegie Mellon then left to work on autonomous vehicles at Uber. The company is pursuing autonomous semi trucks (which Uber was also working on but eventually abandoned) as well as self-driving taxis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xO7abD"&gt;To date, Aurora has raised $690 million in funding, and Urmson has been hailed as the &lt;a href="https://news.greylock.com/our-investment-in-aurora-a-safe-path-to-scale-autonomous-vehicles-bd0680fa4fe0"&gt;“Henry Ford of autonomous vehicles,”&lt;/a&gt; thanks to his work helping to pioneer Google’s self-driving car initiative. Fiat Chrysler, Hyundai, and EV startup &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/09/aurora-will-power-byton-evs-autonomous-driving-features/"&gt;Byton&lt;/a&gt; are also Aurora customers. The company raised half a billion dollars last year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/7/18215575/amazon-innovation-self-driving-car-startup-google-tesla-executives"&gt;in a funding round led by Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TNieh7"&gt;When it comes to the Echo smart speakers, Amazon has a slew of devices to choose from. With so many Echo devices currently available, there is a device for every occasion. Maybe you simply want to add Alexa to a room, or you are looking for an Echo device that will allow you to easily manage your other smart home products. Regardless of the reason, these are the best Echo deals currently available right now. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon Echo Dot with LED display&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zNwIju"&gt;Echo Dot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="maQ5h0"&gt;This year, Amazon released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;4th generation of the Echo dot&lt;/a&gt;, which looks more like a sphere than an actual dot. But if you prefer the previous design, don’t worry — Amazon has not discontinued the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;3rd-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which still retains the familiar dot shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KKAXTh"&gt;Currently, the 3rd-gen Echo Dot gets frequent price drops, and right now you can get it for $25 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot/dp/B07FZ8S74R?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725321348360875873" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-3rd-generation%2F-%2FA-54148143&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyVkKL"&gt;During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we saw the 4th-gen Echo Dot go down to its lowest price of $30. That deal is still available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Echo-Dot-4th-Gen/dp/B08LX6M79Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724598862588130784" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-smart-speaker-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795702&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QG96M6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zX6pQw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;Echo Dot Kids Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LzhwpX"&gt;The 4th-gen Echo Dot Kids Edition is by far the most adorable smart speaker on the market right now. The Kids Edition is as spherical as its adult version, but is designed to look like a tiger or panda. The device also comes with a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which provides access to a slew of kid-friendly content, like audio books and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmKSqg"&gt;Right now, you can get this device for $40 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LY7VXZM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725323423176814123" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. If you purchase it on Amazon, you can also get six months of Amazon Music Unlimited at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MJlccr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9574374"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3wlc-Ltveym1Cj192vf7w6zK8BU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989890/dseifert_201025_4263_00010.0.jpg"&gt;

&lt;h2 id="3GbSWO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review"&gt;Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wOHvPj"&gt;The 4th-gen Amazon Echo smart home hub has also gotten an updated look. Like the 4th-gen Echo Dot, the 2020 Amazon Echo also includes a sphere-shape design, but it’s noticeably bigger than the Echo Dot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JjodUT"&gt;If you are looking for just one Amazon Echo, it is down to its lowest price ever of $70 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085HK4KL6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724598980020491868" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-4th-gen-smart-home-hub-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795705%3Fpreselect%3D80770247%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. If you buy the Echo from Amazon, you also get six months of Amazon Music Unlimited for free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9HtqAa"&gt;If you are looking for two Amazon Echo devices, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589613981487950" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is currently selling an Amazon Echo two-pack for $140&lt;/a&gt;, which knocks $60 off its normal retail price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xR7jKq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508352"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bWxMRCIzkMkj1C2m89z7LaAIYx4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16389069/dseifert_190620_3500_5249.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Echo Show 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oiVOWB"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18714432/amazon-echo-show-5-alexa-smart-alarm-display-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WiqTO4"&gt;If you are looking for an Echo device that functions more as a smart clock than an entertainment speaker, the Echo Show 5 is one of two smart displays to consider. The Echo Show 5 includes a 5.5-inch display, making it easy to fit just about anywhere inside your home. Not only does the device include a built-in camera, but there’s also a physical shutter on the device, allowing you to block the camera’s view while keeping the always-on microphone active. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wsps6q"&gt;The Echo Show 5 usually costs $90, but right now, you can buy the device for at its best-ever price of $45 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HZLHPKP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589653641321861" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-5-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-77282772%3Fpreselect%3D76612867%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wwkfpq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513095"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Echo Show 8&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GGyBnu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20983661/amazon-echo-show-8-review-alexa-smart-display-price-specs-features"&gt;Echo Show 8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="efoU4U"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Show 8 features an eight-inch display; it costs $40 more than the Echo Show 5. When stacked up against the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price"&gt;Google Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;, which is its closest competitor in terms of price and functionality, the Echo Show 8 is the better option for a few reasons: it has a slightly larger display, better speakers, and a camera, allowing you to use it as a video chatting device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcMAEq"&gt;Normally, this device costs $130, but it has seen some good price reductions in the past. We have seen the device go down as low as $65. But if you are looking to buy the device now, you can get it for just $80 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PF1Y28C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589734209430134" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-8-hd-8in-smart-display%2F-%2FA-81795783%3Fpreselect%3D78656158%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="TQX4oe"&gt;Last year, Amazon released its first pair of true wireless earbuds: the Echo Buds. The Echo Buds offer superb sound quality, a comfy fit, and Bose’s noise reduction features. And of course, they also include Alexa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="itnaQP"&gt;Right now, you can get the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LYZJ868?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Buds, plus six months free of Amazon Music Unlimited, for just $80 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="cZGT85"&gt;If you’re interested in an Alexa smart speaker with better audio quality and Dolby Atmos support, the Echo Studio is the Amazon product you may want to purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8dmbf"&gt;There are no active deals right now for a new Echo Studio, but you can get it right now for its usual price of $200 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Studio/dp/B07G9Y3ZMC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725325990660946512" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. There is, however a deal on a bundle at Best Buy, which includes a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725326053000014488" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Studio and a Fire TV Stick 4K for $230&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Health care is coming to grips with its pollution problem</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An ambulance drives down a road in Brooklyn on December 01, 2020 in New York City.&amp;amp;nbsp;" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/16NbqPvK7BvkE1_DqfM4F0klQHk=/0x2:8192x5463/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68472975/1288910280.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An ambulance drives down a road in Brooklyn on December 1st, 2020, in New York City.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Spencer Platt / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ukc6hl"&gt;Pollution from the health care industry is harming the communities it serves, says a study published today in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Health Affairs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. If you count up how many fewer healthy years people in the US lived as a result of all the pollution the industry pumped out in 2018, it would add up to a collective sum of 388,000 years, the research found. That’s similar to the number of years of life lost due to preventable medical errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="j86AaO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’m putting a bandaid on a bullet wound”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wBFkX3"&gt;“I feel like I’m putting a bandaid on a bullet wound,” says Renee Salas, an emergency medicine physician and lead author of another article also published in &lt;em&gt;Health Affairs&lt;/em&gt; today that urges health care policymakers to consider the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22007541/climate-change-health-disaster-doctors-lancet-report"&gt;threats posed by climate change&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zj1hwm"&gt;Salas is already seeing the effects in her practice, from older adults suffering from heat strokes to patients struggling to breathe because of pollution and &lt;a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/c-change/subtopics/climate-change-and-allergies/#:~:text=Burning%20fossil%20fuels%20releases%20carbon,can%20make%20allergy%20symptoms%20worse."&gt;seasonal allergies&lt;/a&gt; that have gotten worse as the planet heats up. “I can try to open their lungs back up with treatments in the emergency department,” Salas said. “But then I send them back out into the very same environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p8eTOX"&gt;The problem is only growing over time, with greenhouse gas emissions from health care rising 6 percent between 2010 and 2018. That’s why health care providers are increasing pressure on their industry to tackle its environmental footprint. The new research is part of an entire December issue of &lt;em&gt;Health Affairs&lt;/em&gt; dedicated to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22007541/climate-change-health-disaster-doctors-lancet-report"&gt;climate change and public health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="rX5mEX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Health care makes up 8.5 percent of all US greenhouse gas emissions&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wwqeF1"&gt;Overall, health care makes up 8.5 percent of all US greenhouse gas emissions. The biggest source of health care pollution was its supply chain, which accounted for 82 percent of health care-associated emissions. That means the way medicines, medical supplies, and equipment are made could be contributing to pollution that’s making people sick. The numbers in the study on greenhouse gas emissions and toxic air pollutants are estimates based on how much money health systems spent on goods and services. Since this method doesn’t account for gases used for anesthesia that escape operating rooms, the true environmental footprint could be even larger. Anesthetic gases are &lt;a href="https://www.popsci.com/anesthesia-greenhouse-gas/"&gt;even more potent&lt;/a&gt; than carbon dioxide when it comes to heating up the planet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PXCjQR"&gt;Instead of simply sending patients back out to an unhealthy environment, health care providers need to step up and eventually eliminate their contributions to climate change, Salas tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Salas and the authors of the emissions study both recommend that Medicaid offer incentives to health care providers to cut down pollution. Medicaid reimbursements, for example, could be tied to climate efforts in the same way they were tied to efforts to &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2690142/"&gt;desegregate hospitals&lt;/a&gt; in the 1960s. The emissions study also recommends mandating that health care systems report on how much pollution they’re generating and make plans to cut down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MqNUmO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The health care system should be the first.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZNNTxs"&gt;England is the only country in the world that mandates reporting already, according to the study. In October, England’s National Health Service declared that it would become the first national system &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21497815/uk-nhs-national-health-service-net-zero-greenhouse-gas-emissions-climate-change"&gt;to slash emissions to net zero&lt;/a&gt; by 2040. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jzENfn"&gt;“I personally believe that the health care system should be the first to try to reach net zero [carbon dioxide emissions] because we have to practice what we preach,” Salas says. The global economy needs to get to net zero emissions — a combination of cutting down pollution as much as possible and then offsetting whatever is left — by the middle of the century to avoid the worst effects of climate change, according to climate scientists. “Climate action is a prescription for health; we have to lead and fulfill that prescription for our patients.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Kindle deals right now</title>

  &lt;p id="MyfWR7"&gt;When it comes to finding a device to use to read your ebooks, you have a few options to choose from. You can always buy a tablet or simply use your smartphone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doom-scrolling through Twitter. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while a niche piece of tech, are designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with no other functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDKHVT"&gt;Amazon has dominated the space for years with its Kindle products. Right now, there are three Kindle models you can choose from, each with pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRHBaM"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each of the current Kindles available for purchase. Sometimes, there isn’t a deal for one or, in some instances, all of the products. In that case, we’ve mentioned the most recent sale price so you know when is a good time to buy the e-reader at a discounted rate. But most of the time, there’s some deal going on. Whether you’re looking for a new model or to grab a bundle that includes a few extras, these are the best Kindle deals right now.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kindle (2019).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jqPttv"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/4/10/18302177/amazon-kindle-base-model-low-resolution-screen-backlight-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kindle (10th Generation)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mXAcFi"&gt;This is Amazon’s most affordable e-reader, usually costing $90. Released in 2019, this base Kindle model includes a front light, comes in one storage configuration of 8GB, and comes with or without ad support. Despite including the same 167ppi resolution as its predecessors, this model has a slightly higher contrast than earlier models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIAlEv"&gt;Right now, you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Essentials-including-Amazon-Printed-Adapter/dp/B08C6NDPFM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=08c9fedb17174c7a7fe940944cd78418&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Essentials Bundle&lt;/a&gt;, which is $120 ($15 off its usual price), and it includes a printed cover and a power adapter. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ze80m8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/7/20902588/kindle-kids-edition-amazon-bundle-young-e-reader-case-replacement-program-freetime"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kindle Kids Edition (2019)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JypT34"&gt;The entry-level Kindle and Oasis models were not the only ones that received a refresh in 2019, Amazon also announced and released a Kindle Kids Edition Bundle, which provides age-appropriate content for younger readers who prefer digital books for $109 ($20 more than the base Kindle). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LlYfl"&gt;The Kindle Kids Edition consists of five items: the device, a case, a two-year extended replacement guarantee (in the event the device breaks), and one year of Amazon’s FreeTime Unlimited service. The latter is the biggest selling point of this device, as it allows parents to grant access to a digital library of kid-friendly books like &lt;em&gt;Percy Jackson&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit &lt;/em&gt;at no additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7AYlh"&gt;Right now, Amazon is offering the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Essentials-including-Protector-Adapter/dp/B07XW24MVK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Kids Edition Essentials Bundle, which is $128&lt;/a&gt; and includes all of the things previously mentioned above, plus a power adapter. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kindle Paperwhite (fourth-generation).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="t6m9om"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/7/18065960/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2018-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kindle Paperwhite (Fourth Generation)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="P1C5xu"&gt;Amazon released the fourth-generation Kindle Paperwhite in 2018. Starting at $130, the Paperwhite comes in three different configurations: 8GB Wi-Fi, 32GB Wi-Fi, and a second 32GB model that drops the ads from the lock screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qneu65"&gt;The Paperwhite features a six-inch, pin-sharp backlit display, which is the main reason to get one over the base Kindle. The 2018 model added a few useful features normally found on Amazon’s flagship reader, the Oasis, such as water resistance and Audible audiobook support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z8PKNl"&gt;Currently, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CXG6C9W?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724858487720989771" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; have discounted the fourth-gen Kindle Paperwhite 8GB model with ad-support, bringing its retail price down to $100. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bJrHrN"&gt;Amazon has also knocked $20 off its Kindle Paperwhite Essentials Bundle, which includes either an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HKWNVSD/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=261395a0382ce2c0aecf3c9f9e099dcc&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HKX97CR/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=3a5cb4645a5b1f86f9b8e704cc584654&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB&lt;/a&gt; Paperwhite (with ads), plus a leather cover and a power adapter. If you are a fan of &lt;em&gt;The Hunger Games&lt;/em&gt; book series, the e-commerce giant has four bundles that include the Paperwhite (with ads) and exclusive covers designed by the series’ author, plus a power adapter for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Bundle-including-Ad-Supported/dp/B087NMH2F7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$160 if you buy the 8GB&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Bundle-including-Ad-Supported/dp/B087NM77FC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$190 if you buy the 32GB&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vOUHwk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552401"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/50C1xWX4q-mLYmoXmHAKkoXLX1s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18329976/akrales_190723_3560_0055.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kindle Oasis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="X5jbTU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707619/amazon-kindle-oasis-2019-e-reader-review-price-specs-features-display"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kindle Oasis (Third Generation)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IByP4u"&gt;The Kindle Oasis is the most expensive of the lineup, starting at $250. The device comes in two storage configurations: 8GB or 32GB, and like the other models, you can get the product with or without ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1AvXZM"&gt;The Kindle Oasis 2019 model looks very similar to its previous model. It still maintains its waterproof, seven-inch, 300ppi E Ink display and supports Audible audiobooks by connecting to Bluetooth. Yet, the biggest change to the Kindle Oasis 2019 is that it can adjust the color temperature to a yellow-toned display, making it easier to read at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxP7sb"&gt;In the past, we have seen the Kindle Oasis go down to as low as $200 if you get the 32GB model, which is the lowest it has ever been for that configuration to date. While there are no deals on just the Oasis itself, Amazon is currently offering an Essentials Bundle for $30 off its normal price. You can get either the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087YZGRGQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=e940143295b150503dca7aa3985b2fd5&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087Z7Z3DF/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=7b5fe424246439c89a69b3302267e073&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB&lt;/a&gt;, and it will also include a leather cover, a power adapter, plus three months of Kindle Unlimited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hPPu8s"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552599"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Here’s where you can buy a Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SrSHDHNRiQrX7uCuXdtZyYvmZKk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66793958/akrales_190820_3597_0355.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YIrWef"&gt;The Nintendo Switch, like everything else that can lighten the mood during this incredibly tough time, is in short supply. And as soon as retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart get it in stock, it quickly sells out. It can be disheartening to miss out on the opportunity to buy a Switch — but fear not! The purpose of this article is to help you do just that without paying more than it would usually cost at retail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BazuMH"&gt;We’re keeping a lookout across the web to find where, when, and how you can buy a Nintendo Switch (the one you can dock to your TV or remove for portable use) or a Switch Lite (the portable-only version of the console) as well as any bundles that seem like good deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nOmgX"&gt;Keep in mind that stock — even Switch consoles that are preowned or refurbished — will likely continue to sell out quickly during the pandemic. But we’ll do our best to keep this article up to date with the latest in-stock offers, and we’ll tell you when each offer was posted. When something gets sold out, we’ll try to let you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="D0nXc0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The 8 best games for your new Nintendo Switch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/25/21012569/nintendo-switch-best-games-2019-pokemon-zelda"},{"title":"The best games of 2020","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/25/21126558/best-games-2020-ps4-ps5-xbox-nintendo-switch-pc"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Switch Lite is the smaller, portable-only version of the console that comes in a few different color options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lxqTuB"&gt;Where can I buy a Nintendo Switch or Switch Lite right now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="hKnMOF"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Animal-Crossing-New-Horizons/dp/B084DDDNRP/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=9a44240b76583966c44a81aba7e7c185&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; has the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/30/21116081/nintendo-animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-unique-joy-con-colors"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt;-themed Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt; consoles. Unlike the regular Switch, this model has a few standout features that make it one of the best-looking Switch models to date. It includes pastel green and blue Joy-Con, a white dock adorned with images of the Nook family, and the back of the Switch has an embossed design with little icons associated with the game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZaaYGt"&gt;

&lt;li id="Lwy57E"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b/ref=as_li_ss_tl?node=16227130011&amp;amp;pf&amp;amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=cdc1feec68a340047fb6e28d4e61c5b9&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; has been sold out of the regular Switch for a while now and is usually among one of the first retailers to sell out when new stock arrives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tUJLvUA3JhGEkMaXYRnoetEh8aM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21940650/nintendo_switch_animal_crossing_new_horizons_edition.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Special edition Animal Crossing Nintendo Switch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="o2G175"&gt;If you’re not against buying a preowned or refurbished console, you’ll want to check out GameStop. Another good place to look is &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-switch/systems.html"&gt;Nintendo’s own online store where it sells refurbished Switch consoles&lt;/a&gt;. Those have been sold out recently, but there’s no telling when it will restock the page with some repaired, refreshed consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tqBPoZ"&gt;Oddly enough, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Frover.ebay.com%2Frover%2F1%2F711-53200-19255-0%2F1%3Fmpre%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.ebay.com%252Fstr%252Fnintendo%26campid%3D5338421472%26toolid%3D20008&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21257643%2Fnintendo-switch-lite-how-to-buy-in-stock#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nintendo has its own official seller page on eBay&lt;/a&gt;, which usually hosts refurbished Switch consoles, though it has been closed “until further notice” due to the pandemic. Still, that’s worth keeping an eye on, too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

&lt;p id="hgAR00"&gt;Frankly, the Switch comes with everything that you need to get started and have fun. However, a few extra purchases can help you get a little more out of your console, and in some cases, help it weather the wear and tear that it’ll undoubtedly endure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sHCpf"&gt;First off, a microSD card will help you extend your Switch’s default 32GB of storage. Amazon, Best Buy, and other retailers regularly sell cards with up to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SC7BZHR/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=d9d13492d7a2383ae455b1e464853cbe&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;th=1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB of storage for around $75&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074RNRM2B/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=ebcbe0aae0692190d419f2c892d31718&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A 400GB microSD card will cost you around $46&lt;/a&gt;, and with each game ranging in download size from 1GB to tens of gigabytes, the card has enough space to store several of them.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nintendo Switch does not include a Pro Controller.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QGdvLy"&gt;Let’s talk quickly about controllers. The Switch Joy-Cons have a somewhat unconventional look. Nevertheless, the Pro Controller is a great alternative to play most Switch games, though some &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Party&lt;/em&gt; titles require the Joy-Cons to play. If you are looking for a Switch Pro controller, Walmart also has the normal &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller-Black%2F55485228&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Switch Pro controller for $59&lt;/a&gt;, knockings $11 off its normal retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7UL8Rr"&gt;Of course, there are also third-party options to choose from, especially if you liked the GameCube controller’s design. Amazon is currently running a deal that allows you to buy &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3qu1XX6" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three of PowerA’s wireless game controllers for $70&lt;/a&gt;. This is a great deal, especially if you plan to play multiplayer games like &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt; with friends.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2BZPIqmUqpLcZoV5GVxdxMULT3I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9537475/akrales_171025_2091_0010.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Switch doesn’t include a screen protector, so make that one of the first things you buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UODwlY"&gt;Next up, get a tempered glass screen cover. The display on the Switch and Switch Lite is covered in plastic, and it’s just asking to get scratched as soon as you take it out of the box. Save the heartbreak by getting an affordable, easy-to-apply glass cover at Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ulULMw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N3ASPNV/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=03e07706174eba9d98e121bd33c717da&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A two-pack of amFilm tempered glass protectors for the Nintendo Switch is $8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="l1NCcr"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2YZPQpf" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TCPVHTM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=40eaf677c94a1341b4ed7beb385dbb06&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; three-pack of amFilm tempered glass protectors for the Switch Lite is $7&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="cx5X9k"&gt;If you want to play online with friends, ensure that your saves are backed up in the cloud, and get access to a slate of on-demand games from the original Nintendo console and SNES console era, you’ll want to get a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FV64QLX/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=e9815cab861c6f59255b7b948189eef3&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It’s $20 per year for a single user&lt;/a&gt; on a console or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KY69YFM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=a424685866013735203d8722ee49a601&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$35 a year for up to eight users on different consoles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offer noise cancellation and better sound than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZuVjFm"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Apple AirPods 2 review: even more wireless|63428" data-volume-uuid="c798b260f" data-volume-id="63428" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-429" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;These are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. The AirPods usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted.  You can currently find Apple’s most affordable AirPods at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $129 or $130 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725261146929567782" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725328034162471061" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yHjw-MSSOE9krvMa6cC9qYmHU9s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15993019/akrales_190327_3315_0004.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PK1JRu"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods (with wireless charging case)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature (if you have no use for it, just get the more affordable option above), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;even the best ones are fairly inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but keep a lookout for deals that bring the price down to $160, which is what this pair of wireless earbuds are currently going for at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724675251539044953" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OGXtAu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Uv43TD"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="AirPods Pro review: the perfect earbuds for the iPhone|73652" data-volume-uuid="c840e1e11" data-volume-id="73652" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-23" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt; Compared to the options above, Apple’s high-end truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality, noise cancellation, and now support Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. We think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;they’re the best wireless earbuds that iPhone owners&lt;/a&gt; can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yaMGwU"&gt;The AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their $249 retail price, and in fact sometimes drop down to $200 and lower. The best deal right now is at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon, which has the Apple’s flagship earbuds for $199&lt;/a&gt;. If that deal sells out, you can currently get them at &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1513304-REG%2Fapple_airpods_pro_with_wireless.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo for $220&lt;/a&gt; or for $234 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724966188075813300" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FDsE87"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
