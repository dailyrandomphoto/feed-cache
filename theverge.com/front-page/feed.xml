    <title>AMD CEO Lisa Su downplays the company’s role in crypto mining</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IVIbwI"&gt;Can’t get a new graphics card for your PC? You might be tempted to blame &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372721/amd-radeon-rx-6800-xt-midnight-black-ebay-scalpers"&gt;bots, scalpers&lt;/a&gt; or cryptocurrency miners for that — but AMD CEO Lisa Su is downplaying the impact of crypto at the &lt;a href="https://voxmediaevents.com/code2021"&gt;2021 Code Conference&lt;/a&gt; today. When asked about how big a deal crypto is for the chipmaker, she told the audience that it’s a rather small part of AMD’s business, called it “a pretty volatile space,” and suggested that it shouldn’t be a focus for AMD going forward either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wf2klE"&gt;That’s not a particularly surprising stance for several reasons. First, what upside there was for GPU makers like AMD and Nvidia has drastically shrunk — GPU prices have slowly been dropping amidst &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22544367/china-crypto-crackdown-bitcoin-mining-sichuan-ban-hydro-cryptocurrency-trading'"&gt;China’s cryptocurrency crackdown&lt;/a&gt;, which only got stronger this past week as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22691472/china-central-bank-cryptocurrency-illegal-bitcoin"&gt;China’s central bank officially banned cryptocurrency transactions entirely&lt;/a&gt;. There have been reports of mass GPU sell-offs from mining regions going back months, although prices are still quite high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9tMyZS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A few reasons why Su isn’t going to boost crypto right now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5XNFTH"&gt;Second, if she were to publicly say she supports AMD chasing crypto sales, that could be a really unpopular look when it comes to AMD’s hyper-vocal audience of gamers who believe that every sale to a crypto miner is a sale at their expense — and who also drive purchases of desktop CPUs and motherboards for AMD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aNbU5L"&gt;Su made it very clear in her reply at the Code Conference that gamers are top of mind: “We are trying really hard to get more products to gamers; I get so many ‘Dear Lisa, can you help me get a gaming card?’” she said. AMD already took some flak from gamers when it revealed &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/amd-cryptocurrency-mining-limiter-ethereum/"&gt;it wouldn’t block mining workloads with its new GPUs&lt;/a&gt;, unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/18/22290362/nvidia-will-not-reduce-3060-ti-3070-3080-3090-eth-mining"&gt;Nvidia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OB4r5F"&gt;But third, AMD may just not have a large enough supply of GPUs to tempt miners to begin with. While we don’t know how many current-gen GPUs the company has actually shipped, there are many signs that the company has sold precious few of them compared to its rival Nvidia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4q0gZ"&gt;It’s far rarer to see an AMD GPU in stock, there are far fewer of them changing hands on sites like eBay, and not even one AMD GPU has broken into &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam"&gt;Steam’s Hardware Survey&lt;/a&gt;, which provides a rough glimpse at how many of them have made it into PC gamers’ hands. Over 6 percent of gaming PCs included in the survey have one of the Nvidia 3000-series GPUs, but there isn’t a single recent AMD GPU on the list, which suggests none of them have accumulated more than a 0.15 percent share of Steam gamers. When Su says that crypto is “not a large piece of our business,” it’s possible she also means that new desktop GPUs are not a large piece of AMD’s business. Su did say in May that AMD was having to &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/chip-shortage-causes-amd-to-pivot-away-from-lower-end-pc-processors"&gt;prioritize some components over others&lt;/a&gt;, though she didn’t mention GPUs specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CGrFZh"&gt;Speaking of shortages, Su also addressed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648372/willy-shih-chip-shortage-tsmc-samsung-ps5-decoder-interview"&gt;the ongoing global chip shortage&lt;/a&gt; onstage, reiterating that supplies will be “tight” this year and “likely tight” the first half of next year, but that “it’ll get better in 2022” as additional production capacity comes online. “It gets better next year, not immediately, but it’ll gradually get better as more plants come up,” she told the attendees at Code Conference. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford reveals plans for massive EV and battery factories in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o_1p2Qfrx3kXJS0GvzZusuxV5f4=/169x0:1992x1215/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69917844/Blue_Oval_City_16x9_02.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3RuXOV"&gt;Ford and South Korean battery manufacturer SK Innovation will spend a combined $11.4 billion to build several new factories in the Tennessee and Kentucky focused on the development and production of electric vehicles and the batteries that power them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AbjnJ8"&gt;The new facilities represent the first new plants built by Ford, completely from scratch, in over 50 years. The Tennessee plant will be a “mega campus” that houses a vehicle-production facility for Ford’s F-series pickup trucks and a battery assembly division, while the twin factories in Kentucky will manufacture lithium-ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WuZiSQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is show, not tell time”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4moH0o"&gt;The facilities won’t come online until 2025, but Ford CEO Jim Farley says the investment signals the seriousness with which the company is taking its commitment to EVs. The new campus in Stanton, Tennessee, for example, will cover nine square miles and represents the largest facility ever built in the company’s 118-year history, Farley said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hLkwy9"&gt;“This is a new Ford,” Farley told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “This is show, not tell time.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U700BY"&gt;Ford, like the rest of the auto industry, is scrambling to shift its attention to EVs, even as they only represent a small fraction of vehicles sold every year. The announcement comes as Congress is debating whether to approve an infrastructure deal that would fund the construction of hundreds of thousands of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22419150/ev-charging-us-joe-biden-infrastructure-plan"&gt;new charging stations&lt;/a&gt;, as well as new consumer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22669809/honda-toyota-criticize-democrats-proposed-tax-credit-union-made-electric-vehicles"&gt;incentives for EV sales&lt;/a&gt;. It also comes as the auto industry grapples with new proposals banning the sale of gas cars in foreign markets and some US states &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452825/california-ban-combustion-gas-vehicles-cars-2035"&gt;like California&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZtLWKE1TmJDZbuQcdxykuATnZM0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22638200/akrales_20210526_4595_0085.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dFXtiQI_3ADfeQocD71ITegXtAo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22280373/sokane_210125_4386_1765.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Wv7myT"&gt;Farley made the analogy that electric cars are now at a similar place as smartphones in 2007. “This story ... is not about propulsion,” Farley said. “This story is about digital vehicles with embedded systems, and a customer experience led through software that gets better every day, and changes the definition of a car from something that gets you from point A to point B, to something that enables your full life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bCUbE1"&gt;The new facilities represent a shift in Ford’s approach to EV manufacturing. It’s a more financially risky move with potentially lucrative rewards in the future if the company can successfully supplement production from its own suppliers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="neDRMO"&gt;Ford currently sources its batteries from SK Innovation, which recently lost a trade secret dispute with rival LG Chem that could hinder its imports to the US. (The companies &lt;a href="https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/ford-vw-battery-supplier-sk-innovation-said-to-reach-deal-to-avoid-import-ban-11618073730550.html"&gt;recently reached an agreement&lt;/a&gt; that could avert a possible import ban.) By making its own batteries in the US, Ford can avoid some of the conflicts that arise from sourcing batteries overseas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="poQtW3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Ford CEO Jim Farley on building the electric F-150 — and reinventing Ford","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22444294/ford-f150-lightning-pickup-truck-jim-farley-interview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="2TNO85"&gt;Farley estimates that Ford will need 140GWh of battery manufacturing capacity a year, and in total, the company’s three new battery plants will enable 129 gigawatt-hours (GWh) a year of production capacity. By comparison, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313251/gm-ev-second-battery-factory-lg-chem-tennessee"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt; is planning four new battery factories in the US with partner LG Chem for a total annual capacity of 140GWh, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22325813/vw-volkswagen-power-day-battery-electric-car-announcement"&gt;Volkswagen&lt;/a&gt; is aiming to have six battery cell production plants operating in Europe by 2030 for a total of 240GWh a year. And Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said his company’s first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/12/20961812/elon-musk-berlin-tesla-ceo-fourth-gigafactory-construction"&gt;battery factory in Berlin&lt;/a&gt; would produce 250GWh — roughly equivalent to the current world battery cell production capacity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eXnmC1"&gt;Globally, battery production is expected to grow from 95.3GWh in 2020 to 410.5GWh in 2024, according to GlobalData, a data and analytics company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XD5QQy"&gt;Farley said Ford’s contribution to the massive investments in battery capacity will be significant because of its status as maker of the F-150 pickup truck, which has been the most popular vehicle in the US for decades. “This is different than Tesla and the other announcements [because] this is enormous scale,” he said. “America’s best selling vehicles going electric. We’re totally sold out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZPKQbe"&gt;Ford says it will spend $7 billion, while SK Innovation will contribute $4.4 billion, for a total of $11.4 billion. Previously, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454728/ford-plus-pro-electric-explorer-suv-investment"&gt;Ford has said it would spend $30 billion by 2025&lt;/a&gt;, and that 40 percent of its global fleet will be electric by 2030. The company is currently at work &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21441276/ford-electric-f150-truck-factory-break-ground-michigan"&gt;retrofitting its historic Rouge factory&lt;/a&gt; for the production of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22442777/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-truck-specs-price"&gt;all-electric Ford F-150 Lightning pickup truck&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J8rIdrRYw_IerpqoGmL_ksutCeo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882601/Blue_Oval_City_05.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ford&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blue Oval City will cost $5.6 billion and generate 6,000 new jobs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AFGtBE"&gt;The “mega campus” in Stanton, Tennessee, will be called Blue Oval City. At a cost of $5.6 billion, the facility will generate approximately 6,000 new jobs, Ford says. Blue Oval City will become a “vertically integrated ecosystem” for Ford’s assembly of an expanded lineup of electric F-series vehicles. It will also include a battery plant, key suppliers, and recycling. (Ford recently struck a deal with Redwood Materials, a battery recycler founded by a former top executive from Tesla.) Ford said that Blue Oval City is also designed to be carbon neutral with “zero waste to landfill” once fully operational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="521erF"&gt;In central Kentucky, Ford plans to build a “dedicated battery manufacturing complex” with SK Innovation. Dubbed the BlueOvalSK Battery Park, the complex will cost $5.8 billion and create 5,000 jobs. Batteries for the company’s next-generation Ford and Lincoln EVs will be assembled at the site’s twin battery plants. The construction money will flow from a new joint venture called BlueOvalSK (which is still subject to “regulatory approvals and other conditions,” Ford says).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XeYkWP0Kg17vmqqMYon9LGeBdrE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882602/BlueOvalSK_Battery_Park_02.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ford&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;BlueOvalSK Battery Park will cost $5.8 billion and create 5,000 jobs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LPGQDJ"&gt;Ford projects that it will create a total of 11,000 new jobs in the two states. As such, the company says it is prepared to spend $525 million on a nationwide job training program, starting with $90 million on a pilot project in Texas. The hope is to train the next generation of workers on the intricacies of EV manufacturing and maintenance, not only to work at Ford’s factories but also at its dealerships and to make repairs in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gpgZVf"&gt;“Our industry has an enormous shortage of technicians,” Farley said. “We need to recruit a huge number of technicians who are good at doing service on the road.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fK7Ij5"&gt;Ford is receiving financial incentives from both states in exchange for agreeing to build there. Tennessee and Kentucky are also both contributing money in the form of training grants to ensure that future workers have the necessary skills. But Farley said the primary consideration was finding locations with competitive energy rates, since a battery plant uses five times the energy of a traditional assembly plant. Ford also prioritized finding “greenfield” sites with no prior environmental issues so that it could build quickly. “We need to move fast,” said Farley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nm9WFE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ford’s shift to electric vehicles has not been without its speed bumps&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uDUc85"&gt;Ford’s shift to electric vehicles has not been without its speed bumps. This week, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696482/ford-mustang-mach-e-glass-windshield-recall-roof"&gt;issued two recalls for its Mustang Mach-E&lt;/a&gt;, after determining that the adhesive used to attach the windshield and optional glass roof wasn’t secure enough. It was the Mach-E’s second recall, after an earlier investigation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316055/ford-mustang-mach-e-recall-loose-bolt-delivery-delays"&gt;discovering loose subframe bolts&lt;/a&gt;. Customer deliveries of the Mach-E were delayed, too, after the company discovered a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373903/mustang-mach-e-deep-sleep-12v-battery-jump-start"&gt;software problem that led to the 12-volt battery dying&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;first reported in April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HkcTig"&gt;When asked about the recalls, Farley acknowledged that Ford has “a lot of work to do as a company around quality” and added “we have to get it right.” He also employed a baseball metaphor that he is fond of using in media interviews. “This is the first inning,” he said. “But boy, the demand is strong. And people absolutely love this car. We just have to make it better every day. And that’s on us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ctwkOw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hwzfhq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Activision Blizzard strikes $18 million settlement with US employment watchdog</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bqUW_bMkSQ1_xE-NHCkdJuzFnv8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69917617/acastro_210729_1777_blizzard_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9Mlkm8"&gt;The US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and Activision Blizzard have &lt;a href="https://investor.activision.com/consent-decree-with-EEOC"&gt;settled a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; over the games company’s allegedly pervasive sexual harassment and discrimination. The news follows an EEOC suit &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.832570/gov.uscourts.cacd.832570.1.0.pdf"&gt;filed Monday in California court&lt;/a&gt; that was based on a three-year investigation including cooperation from the games publisher. As part of the settlement, Activision Blizzard will create an $18 million fund to compensate employees who claim damages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dRy9Za"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-is-investigating-activision-blizzard-over-workplace-practices-disclosures-11632165080"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; last week that Activision Blizzard was in settlement talks with the EEOC, and the company &lt;a href="https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/activision-blizzard-provides-update-workplace-initiatives"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt; that it was “actively engaged in continued discussions with the EEOC.” In its complaint, the EEOC says it notified the company of its findings on June 15th after launching an investigation in September of 2018, then engaged in “extensive conciliation discussions” with Activision Blizzard. In addition to establishing the fund for restitution, the company agrees to cease any discriminatory practices (a position Activision Blizzard has committed to in past statements), retain a consultant to ensure compliance, upgrade its training and performance review processes to prevent future offenses, and submit to future EEOC audits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cHPPqw"&gt;“We will continue to be vigilant in our commitment to the elimination of harassment and discrimination in the workplace. We thank the EEOC for its constructive engagement as we work to fulfill our commitments to eradicate inappropriate conduct in the workplace,” said Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick &lt;a href="https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/activision-blizzard-commits-expanded-workplace-initiatives"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt; on the agreement. Any unclaimed funds will go toward non-profit organizations that focus on “advancing women in the video game and tech sectors” or promoting awareness of gender quality, or toward future diversity and inclusion investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="91TxSg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Activision Blizzard confirmed it was under investigation last week&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WZCXBb"&gt;The EEOC complaint was one of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686183/blizzard-chief-legal-officer-leaves"&gt;several legal battles for Activision Blizzard&lt;/a&gt;, which had previously been sued by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;California Department of Fair Employment and Housing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-investor-lawsuit-210106008.html"&gt;the company’s investors&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674269/activision-blizzard-sued-nlrb-labor-violations"&gt;Campaign to Organize Digital Employees&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; also reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684779/activision-blizzard-investigation-sec-activision-bobby-kotick"&gt;investigating the company&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZhBUvp"&gt;The lawsuits — as well as stories from employees at Activision Blizzard — paint a picture of a company with a “frat house” atmosphere where female employees were verbally and physically harassed without consequence. Multiple executives, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607356/blizzard-president-leaving-harassment-protest-brack"&gt;Blizzard president J. Allen Brack&lt;/a&gt;, have departed the company in the wake of the revelations, and the company has updated elements of its games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22638947/blizzard-overwatch-mccree-name-change-lawsuit"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22597006/blizzard-world-of-warcraft-activision-remove-references-harassment-lawsuit"&gt;&lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to remove references to employees accused of harassment or other offending behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix reveals how many accounts are actually watching its top titles </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6QC6VcqOeNZYB4Zr2IRCk-4F9JU=/1x0:1600x1066/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69917512/REC_ASA3_CODE21_20210927_143331_0193_X3.5.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Asa Mathat&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nCrTC0"&gt;During this year’s Code conference, Netflix co-CEO and chief content officer Ted Sarandos shared a significant haul of data about some of the streaming giant’s top titles — a rare move for a company that traditionally holds numbers close to the chest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nii9Cx"&gt;In one slide, shared while Sarandos was speaking on the Code stage with Kara Swisher, Netflix shared numbers about how many accounts viewed its top 10 films and series based on the number of accounts that watched at least two minutes of the title during the first 28 days it was on Netflix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EVadpP"&gt;The first season of &lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt; led its top series list with 82 million accounts having viewed the title, followed by part one of &lt;em&gt;Lupin&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Witcher,&lt;/em&gt; with 76 million accounts having watched each. &lt;em&gt;Extraction&lt;/em&gt; led its top films list with 99 million accounts, followed by &lt;em&gt;Bird Box&lt;/em&gt; with 89 million accounts and &lt;em&gt;Spenser Confidential&lt;/em&gt; with 85 million.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qAyd9acUZ4Xd6vaUg0dSgPLbqgE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883359/Netflix_Code_Conference_V2.001_X3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Code 2021&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="a4LZLz"&gt;A second slide ranked Netflix’s top 10 films and series based on their total viewed hours during their first 28 days on the service. &lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt; still topped its series list with a whopping 625 million hours viewed. The fourth installment of &lt;em&gt;Money Heist&lt;/em&gt; followed with 619 million, followed by the third season of &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; with 582 million hours of viewing. &lt;em&gt;Bird Box&lt;/em&gt; led its list for most popular films based on the metric, with 282 million hours viewed. &lt;em&gt;Extraction&lt;/em&gt; swooped into second place with 231 million hours viewed, while &lt;em&gt;The Irishman&lt;/em&gt; took third with 215 million viewing hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hkEH9w"&gt;“We’re trying to be more transparent with the market and talent and everybody,” Sarandos said. “It’s a big black box for everybody.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RWvQikvNyH3aZPYnATRab-Evhq8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883365/i_L578TP9_X3.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Code 2021&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NC8fRy"&gt;The decision to share the figure comes at a key moment for creatives and talent in streaming. Services across the board have traditionally offered limited information about how titles perform on their platforms, an issue that’s become a point of frustration in a rapidly changing entertainment space that’s seen even highly anticipated titles meant for theaters instead head straight to streaming services — or debut as hybrid releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9fa4Ci"&gt;But the numbers also show that there are many ways to define a “hit.” Netflix’s data was tracked by total hours of viewing and the length of time viewers spent watching a title during its first month on the service. Talent and production companies, however, might be more interested in the number of times a title was viewed start to finish, or how many total people — not just accounts — are watching their shows. Ultimately, without a unified standard among services for what those metrics for success look like, streamers are still very much playing by their own individual rules.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic’s CEO has bad news if you were hoping to see Fortnite NFTs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dQD4QE5Oq53CpwdhVzseGZX493Q=/0x0:1863x1242/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69917260/Screen_Shot_2021_08_17_at_9.21.59_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apparently the glowing orb is not an NFT.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Epic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s0QjHe"&gt;On Monday, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1442519522875949061?s=20"&gt;Tim Sweeney tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that Epic isn’t touching NFTs, in a public response to what was presumably an NFT pitch. He cites the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683766/nft-scams-theft-social-engineering-opensea-community-recovery"&gt;space’s problem with scams&lt;/a&gt; as the reason for his hesitancy, which sparked some &lt;em&gt;discussion&lt;/em&gt; in the comments (as strong statements about crypto tend to do). Sweeney has since clarified his views on NFTs a little, saying that, to him, owning an NFT is about as valuable as liking an image on Twitter and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1442541632885182466?s=20"&gt;calling into question&lt;/a&gt; whether NFT ownership is actually non-fungible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q9RcG8"&gt;While Sweeney’s publicly made his position clear, it’s not likely to stop him from getting a wave of NFT pitches, which you can see for yourself by searching “@TimSweeneyEpic nft” on Twitter. It’s understandable why people try, though — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417447/fortnite-revenue-9-billion-epic-games-apple-antitrust-case"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; has made billions&lt;/a&gt; through the sale of virtual objects, and there’s been a lot of discussion around using &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632765/vine-creator-dom-hofmann-blockchain-video-game-nft-supdrive"&gt;NFTs in video games&lt;/a&gt; (not that Epic and Sweeney were small fries before &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; took off). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kcZBYd"&gt;While the NFT space does have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650594/banksy-nft-scam-pranksy-ethereum-returned-duplicates-art"&gt;fake art&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676075/opensea-insider-information-nft-trading-nate-chastain"&gt;shady goings-on at major companies&lt;/a&gt; (along with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/20/22334527/nft-scams-artists-opensea-rarible-marble-cards-fraud-art"&gt;various other scams&lt;/a&gt; that have taken off as NFTs rocketed to prominence this year), that’s probably not why we aren’t seeing V-NFTs take the place of V-Bucks. A more likely answer is that, so far, Epic doesn’t need to use blockchain tech to make money, and NFTs aren’t ready to solve problems like its fight with Apple over what’s allowed in the App Store. It’s not like scams are stopping other well-known companies from diving into the space — the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22348858/nba-nft-top-shot-dapper-labs"&gt;NBA-licensed Top Shots&lt;/a&gt; has operated without &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/27/investing/top-shot-withdrawal-nba-nft/index.html"&gt;incidents&lt;/a&gt; raising too many eyebrows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dda8jx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Replied:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We aren’t touching NFTs as the whole field is currently tangled up with an intractable mix of scams, interesting decentralized tech foundations, and scams.&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1442519522875949061?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="AmGOir"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gJFPJu"&gt;Interestingly, Sweeney also retweeted part of a semi-viral thread about “Web 3,” or a &lt;a href="https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-web-3"&gt;popular concept in the crypto community&lt;/a&gt; of rethinking the web, focusing on blockchains and tokens. The idea is that Web 3 is a return to the decentralized nature of Web 1, as opposed to “Web 2.0,” where most people spend their days on platforms owned by massive companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Google. Of course, cryptocurrency (especially Ethereum) plays a big part in that vision. The part of the thread Sweeney retweeted recalls an early version of the web with open protocols and more community government, though how that relates to the future of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is unclear — perhaps it was just some nostalgia for a web that seems to be long gone. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fitbit’s newest fitness tracker, the Charge 5, is now available</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7oTw3UgNWOkFUmZpIKKB-E0diDg=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69917127/jpeters_210914_4757_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fitbit Charge 5.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EkjLeB"&gt;Fitbit’s newest fitness tracker, the Fitbit Charge 5, is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fitbit.com%2Fglobal%2Fus%2Fproducts%2Ftrackers%2Fcharge5&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F27%2F22697200%2Ffitbit-charge-5-fitness-tracker-price-available" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;now available for purchase&lt;/a&gt;. The $179.95 tracker offers a number of improvements over the Charge 4, including a slimmer design and a bright color screen. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22680300/fitbit-charge-5-review-fitness-tracker"&gt;in my review&lt;/a&gt;, I had some frustrations with the software and the lack of any sort of physical button. And you should know that two of the new tracker’s headline features, an ECG app and the ability to give a new Daily Readiness Score, aren’t available just yet. Those are arriving in the coming months, Fitbit says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e68Lfb"&gt;Fitbit is also announcing new features coming to some of its devices for people who subscribe to its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fitbit.com%2Fglobal%2Fus%2Fproducts%2Fservices%2Fpremium&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F27%2F22697200%2Ffitbit-charge-5-fitness-tracker-price-available" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fitbit Premium service&lt;/a&gt;, which costs $9.99 per month. Snore and noise detection is now available for all &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21450123/fitbit-sense-review"&gt;Fitbit Sense&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fitbit.com%2Fglobal%2Fus%2Fproducts%2Fsmartwatches%2Fversa3&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F27%2F22697200%2Ffitbit-charge-5-fitness-tracker-price-available" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Versa 3&lt;/a&gt; users who are Fitbit Premium subscribers, and content from the meditation app Calm is now available in the Fitbit app, also for Premium subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>RIP Android TV remote app, hello Google TV remote app </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fqSqbj8dB_LJU5bwMHshBHc7RP0=/0x180:1080x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69916955/AFS_01A_VirtualRemote_IJ_Realistic_1x1_Frame_11.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qm4bhr"&gt;Google is killing its older Android TV remote. The move follows the company’s launch of its long-awaited Google TV remote app last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QNnlgL"&gt;The company confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the Android TV remote app will take a bow after the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22688867/google-tv-mobile-remote-android"&gt;Google TV remote app&lt;/a&gt; — which can be used for other Android TV OS devices as well — is widely available. &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/09/27/looks-like-google-has-put-the-old-android-tv-remote-control-app-out-of-its-misery/"&gt;earlier reported&lt;/a&gt; the remote news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8XPRg"&gt;“We’re making the experience of using your phone as a virtual remote control faster to access and easier to use by upgrading the UI and integrating the feature directly into the Android mobile OS as well as the Google TV app,” a spokesperson said. “After the new remote feature is widely available, the Android TV remote app will no longer be supported and available for use.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ePF7tj"&gt;To use the remote, the Android TV OS television or device will need Android TV Remote Service 5.0, which has already started rolling out. Users will not need to manually update their devices to get it. A spokesperson said that the rollout will continue through this week and will update automatically through the Google Play Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="caV3x9"&gt;The new remote is available to Android users from Quick Settings or through the Google TV app. A spokesperson &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22688867/google-tv-mobile-remote-android"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last week that the new remote app will be available only to Android users at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s gamer-friendly C1 OLED is down to its best price to date</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zWumHjIbdaBffC0XrXG08s6RsW0=/212x0:2497x1523/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69916840/LG_C1_Lifestyle_Photo.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LG C1 OLED TV supports HDMI 2.1 and 120Hz Variable Refresh Rate for use with modern consoles.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2Pz0Nj"&gt;LG’s various OLED offerings include some of the most well-received models across the industry. The C1 OLED is one of these universally praised panels, and it comes in a variety of sizes to fit people’s preferences and home theater setups. Now, some C1 models have received their biggest discounts yet, which may please those with a penchant for large TVs. Amazon, for instance, currently has the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WG4HKKY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch C1 for $1,797&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WGFKSMW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;77-inch model for $2,997&lt;/a&gt;, which factor out to be $703 and $500 off, respectively. For roughly the same price, you can also get either TV with a $100 streaming credit at &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/lg-65-class-c1-series-4k-uhd-oled-tv-allstate-protection-plan-bundle-included.product.100761679.html"&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt; or a $50 Visa gift card at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buydig.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FLGOLED65C1PUB%2FLG-OLED65C1PUB-65-Inch-4K-Smart-OLED-TV-with-AI-ThinQ-2021-Model&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F9%2F27%2F22696856%2Flg-c1-4k-oled-tv-ps5-xbox-series-x-amazon-buydig-costco-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BuyDig&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BhRll2"&gt;These are the lowest prices to date on each of these large displays, both of which feature 120Hz refresh rates and Dolby Vision HDR compatibility, as well as support for VRR (variable refresh rate) and FreeSync and G-Sync technologies, thus ensuring high frame rates without screen tearing. Both configurations of the 4K OLED also support HDMI 2.1 to ensure all these gaming-focused specs work seamlessly with Xbox Series X / S and PlayStation 5. Another gamer-friendly feature, Game Optimizer, allows you to dial in the ideal settings for specific genres, such as fast-action first-person shooters or densely detailed real-time strategy titles. These features alone make the C1 one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"&gt;best TVs for gaming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="BnbCpR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"LG’s C1 and G1 OLEDs get even better at gaming with 120Hz Dolby Vision","url":"https://www.theverge.com/games/2021/6/28/22554939/lg-dolby-vision-hdr-xbox-c1-g1-4k"},{"title":"The best delas on 4k TVs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="vnZmIS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10596469"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U5ucxv"&gt;The C1 model, like many OLED TVs, is known for its richer contrast and deep, ink-like blacks, which bring out more detail in the shadows. Dolby Vision HDR also ensures vibrancy and accuracy in the colors, and on the smart side of things, the C1 supports both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa voice assistants. It also comes with LG’s speedy, fourth-gen Alpha9 processor and support for LG’s webOS platform. That last one might not earn everyone’s love, but it’s got built-in support for most of the popular streaming apps.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The beloved Babylon 5 is getting rebooted, and series creator JMS is running the show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rxsFJFVFXYtbLVENsMVLnh6LKnk=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69916698/babylon_5.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t7sQ06"&gt;In 1994, J. Michael Straczynski (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/28/8673391/sense8-review-matrix-wachowskis-netflix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sense8&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changeling_(film)"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Changeling&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;) &lt;/em&gt;brought the world a science fiction show like nothing we’d ever seen. &lt;em&gt;Babylon 5 &lt;/em&gt;told a single five-year story, filled with foreshadowing, deep political intrigue, and characters who grew and evolved, at a time when most TV shows still reset the agenda after every single episode. He wrote the vast majority of the award-winning show himself, and it appears he may be about to do it again — Warner Bros. Television is now in development on a “from-the-ground-up reboot” of &lt;em&gt;Babylon 5&lt;/em&gt; with Straczynski as writer and showrunner, designed to air on the CW. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iCPYWw"&gt;Here’s the full description &lt;em&gt;Warner Bros&lt;/em&gt;. provided to &lt;em&gt;The Verge:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="6RJdlV"&gt;In a from-the-ground-up reboot of the original series, John Sheridan, an Earthforce officer with a mysterious background, is assigned to Babylon 5, a five-mile-long space station in neutral space, a port of call for travelers, smugglers, corporate explorers and alien diplomats at a time of uneasy peace and the constant threat of war. His arrival triggers a destiny beyond anything he could have imagined, as an exploratory Earth company accidentally triggers a conflict with a civilization a million years ahead of us, putting Sheridan and the rest of the B5 crew in the line of fire as the last, best hope for the survival of the human race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="G5uUiq"&gt;That’s pretty much a dead-on description of the original show, minus some big surprises. So as a long-time fan myself, I have extremely mixed feelings! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="REM7L5"&gt;In one sense, it’s pretty exciting because Straczynski told fans&lt;em&gt; for years&lt;/em&gt; that Warner Bros. wanted nothing to do with the show ever again. “They literally told my agent ‘We have no plans, and no intentions, of letting anything else be done in terms of television with Babylon 5,’” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/straczynski/status/987208419558834176"&gt;he tweeted in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, and that seemed to be that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZvWHPJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Won't work.  They literally told my agent "We have no plans, and no intentions, of letting anything else be done in terms of television with Babylon 5."  And a kickstarter wouldn't pay for even a fraction of a season.  That won't change for years, when those execs are dead/gone. &lt;a href="https://t.co/NZ80WiIIcR"&gt;https://t.co/NZ80WiIIcR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— J. Michael Straczynski (@straczynski) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/straczynski/status/987208419558834176?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 20, 2018&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zt4Kzs"&gt;So if Warner Bros. and Straczynski have now abandoned their feud and might expand on the intriguing universe JMS built nearly three decades ago, that’s pretty exciting. But if it’s just a straight reboot rather than a sequel or spin-off, one aimed at the CW at that, it makes me wonder why bother — particularly when the excellent original series has a newly remastered version you can stream on HBO Max and purchase &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I5SYHS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;via Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Ftv-season%2Fbabylon-5-the-complete-series%2Fid1149081337%3Fmt%3D8&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F27%2F22696836%2Fbabylon-5-reboot-j-michael-straczynski-warner-bros-the-cw" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt; since January of this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PHzC1d"&gt;A few hours after we published this post, Straczynski &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/straczynski/status/1442621159221043202"&gt;tweeted his answer&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="SzrYTg"&gt;To answer all the questions, yes, it’s true, Babylon 5 is in active development as a series for the CW.  We have some serious fans over at the network, and they’re eager to see this show happen.  I’m hip deep into writing the pilot now, and will be running the series upon pickup. The network understands the uniqueness of Babylon 5 and is giving me a great deal of latitude with the storytelling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6sHHZW"&gt;As noted in the announcement, this is a reboot from the ground up rather than a continuation, for several reasons.  Heraclitus wrote “You cannot step in the same river twice, for the river has changed, and you have changed.”  In the years since B5, I’ve done a ton of other TV shows and movies, adding an equal number of tools to my toolbox, all of which I can bring to bear on one singular question: if I were creating Babylon 5 today, for the first time, knowing what I now know as a writer, what would it look like?  How would it use all the storytelling tools and technological resources available in 2021 that were not on hand then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U6qza7"&gt;How can it be used to reflect the world in which we live, and the questions we are asking and confronting every day?  Fans regularly point out how prescient the show was and is of our current world; it would be fun to take a shot at looking further down the road. So we will not be retelling the same story in the same way because of what Heraclitus said about the river.  There would be no fun and no surprises.  Better to go the way of Westworld or Battlestar Galactica where you take the original elements that are evergreens and put them in a blender with a ton of new, challenging ideas, to create something fresh yet familiar.  To those asking why not just do a continuation, for a network series like this, it can’t be done because over half our cast are still stubbornly on the other side of the Rim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gdyMaf"&gt;How do you telling continuing story of our original Londo without the original Vir?  Or G’Kar?  How do you tell Sheridan’s story without Delenn?  Or the story of B5 without Franklin?  Garibaldi?  Zack?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HextRZ"&gt;The original Babylon 5 was ridiculously innovative: the first to use CGI to create ships and characters, and among the very first to shoot widescreen with a vigorous 5.1 mix.  Most of all, for the first time, Babylon 5 introduced viewers accustomed to episodic television to the concept of a five-year arc with a pre-planned beginning, middle and end…creating a brand new paradigm for television storytelling that has subsequently become the norm. That tradition for innovation will continue in this new iteration, and I hope to create additional new forms of storytelling that will further push the television medium to the edge of what’s possible.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="If8UNR"&gt;Let me conclude by just saying how supportive and enthusiastic everyone at the CW has been and is being with this project. They understand the unique position Babylon 5 occupies both in television and with its legions of fans, and are doing everything they can to ensure the maximum in creative freedom, a new story that will bring in new viewers while honoring all that has come before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aGwBcS"&gt;Onward!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="Eb0678"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10776756"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yrcBFR"&gt;I should add that the remastered version still has its issues. &lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt; has a great story about &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-22-babylon-5-digital-video-quality.html"&gt;why the original &lt;em&gt;Babylon 5&lt;/em&gt; will never look its best&lt;/a&gt;, partly due to aging CGI that might have looked groundbreaking at the time. Some of the early episodes feature hamfisted plots, scenery-chewing actors and a general lack of subtlety, and I can see how they might turn off a modern audience used to shows like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/1/14429646/expanse-season-2-syfy-relevant-science-fiction-show-television"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Expanse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. (&lt;/em&gt;Straczynski &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/straczynski/status/1441658114973974531"&gt;certainly still seems to feel&lt;/a&gt; the first season is worth it, and I think you’d lose a lot by skipping it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zJtQXG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10776767"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oEDk3i"&gt;And while the remaster’s 4:3 transfer does an excellent job of cleaning up old artifacts and counteracting the bonkers decision to &lt;em&gt;zoom in&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; the low-quality CG (see examples above and below), the noisy footage still doesn’t necessarily look great on a 4K TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nLx4hd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10776769"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aBl072"&gt;Still, there’s never been a better time to watch &lt;em&gt;Babylon 5 &lt;/em&gt;in the modern era than this remaster, which is &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much better than the DVDs. You just might want &lt;a href="https://babylon5.fandom.com/wiki/Viewing_Order"&gt;this guide to the agreed-upon proper viewing orders&lt;/a&gt; since HBO Max and co. seem to have ordered the episodes in a new way entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="f2BFXK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10776771"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oguNXr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 8:13PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added JMS’s full statement about why Babylon 5 is returning as a reboot instead of a continuation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Overwatch League grand finals were a storybook sendoff ahead of Overwatch 2</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Erc8OrOnP_XhRlLIhWSa41bZ4X4=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69916614/MY_DRAGONS.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QlZTaC"&gt;The Shanghai Dragons’ very first &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; match was an 0-4 shellacking delivered by the Los Angeles Gladiators in 2018. The team would go on to lose the next 41 straight games — encompassing the entire first season of the league and the first two games of the second season — earning them the dubious honor of having the longest losing streak in esports history. The Shanghai Dragons’ very last &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; match of 2021 — and the last professional Overwatch match ahead of the sequel’s launch next year — was a 4-0 beatdown they themselves visited upon the Atlanta Reign to win the 2021 Grand Finals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C2rDEw"&gt;It is a long-time fan in-joke to call the &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League “scripted.” Like a TV show, teams are given story arcs, villains and heroes are cast, and any match that ended &lt;em&gt;just so&lt;/em&gt; was pre-determined by a writer’s room. That the Shanghai Dragons are the team that closes the chapter on professional &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; as we know it is proof positive that some kind of cosmic force is at play. Stories that good just don’t happen by chance, and yet, here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UauZKU"&gt;The Dragons’ grand finals run started off inauspiciously. In the first round, higher-seeded teams were given the opportunity to choose their opponents. Shanghai, as the highest seed, got first pick and decided to choose the San Francisco Shock as their opponents. Oh no.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q_8K3EA_J-1iMB5qMPRY8bqLphQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882673/OWL_Press_Asset_BZ655Q.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The San Francisco Shock after winning the 2020 Overwatch League Grand Finals over the Seoul Dynasty&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tagXKz"&gt;The Shock are the winningest team in the league, period. They are the only team to have completed a “golden stage,” meaning they won all seven games in a stage without losing a single map — just straight 4-0s across the board. They are &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; the only team that’s won back-to-back championships. &lt;em&gt;And&lt;/em&gt; they are the team that sent Shanghai into the loser’s bracket during the 2020 playoffs. In the previous nine matches between these two teams, Shanghai has &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/7/19/20699180/shanghai-dragons-overwatch-league-stage-3-champions-explainer"&gt;only won one of them&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s easy to see why I thought this was a terrible pick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Pv5si"&gt;My concerns were unfounded as Shanghai made quick work of San Francisco, bouncing them to the lower bracket with a 3-0 embarrassment. But my relief didn’t last. The Dallas Fuel was their next big challenge after having lost to them in the May Melee earlier in the season. When the playoffs began, I said that the finals &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League 2021 deserved was Dallas vs. Shanghai. The only other team even close to Shanghai in performance has been Dallas. Fuel vs. Dragons was the rivalry the league’s writers demanded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WkLRly"&gt;And, by the grace of Goddess Victory, Shanghai came out on top again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KElUJ8"&gt;By this point, I’m sweating. Yes, my Dragons are in the grand finals, but the Shock are destroying the loser’s bracket, sending Philadelphia and Chengdu home — two teams stuffed with big Dark Horse Bracket Busting energy. More than anything, I do not want a 3-peat. I have no personal animosity toward the Shock, I simply find dynasties boring, and for a moment, it looked like the Shock of old were back, ready to reclaim their crown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eIJ7TF"&gt;But then I was granted a boon from an unlikely source: the Atlanta Reign.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lZG74AQ4F13LNMvPxsW6guUQ6fo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882679/OWL_Press_Asset_BZ61AX.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Atlanta Reign&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="y7sN0S"&gt;I’ve always enjoyed Atlanta. They’re a neat team with an incredible tank line and excellent proof that you don’t need a mono-culture team to have success. Atlanta’s always been the gatekeepers of the upper rankings — good enough to keep everyone else out but never good enough to break through themselves. So imagine my shock (heh) when they’re the ones to grant me my wish of eliminating San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V5h6Cm"&gt;Then they beat Dallas, and then I got scared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OGCICn"&gt;As I said, the playoffs are built differently. Good teams fall fast, and mediocre teams suddenly rise from nowhere. Dallas was a devil Shanghai knew. Atlanta wasn’t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CWMSVD"&gt;No grand finals match has been terribly competitive. The Philadelphia Fusion won only a single map of the eight played against London for the inaugural championship. After being tied in their head-to-head records and tying in stage playoff wins, San Francisco sent Vancouver home in 2019 four to nothing. Only Seoul has made a grand finals match interesting, and even then, they lost to the Shock 4-2. I hate when games are blowouts, especially finals. But for this final between Atlanta and Shanghai, I wanted total domination. My heart did not have the strength to endure a close match. And, in keeping with the tradition of one-sided grand finals, Shanghai granted my wish. There was no magical moment like there was when the Dragons &lt;a href="https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2019/2/28/18243584/shanghai-dragons-win-first-game-boston-uprising"&gt;finally won their first match&lt;/a&gt; ever against Boston in 2019. No screaming or crying — just me observing Shanghai wipe out Atlanta in overtime and going, “that’s it, that’s the game.” After four years, the Shanghai Dragons’ redemption arc is complete.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iwsS1Y1G-Er62t24GoQCGkaaTdo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882683/OWL_Press_Asset_BZ61AZ.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Shanghai Dragons&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9eFlfT"&gt;The Dragons are a lot of firsts and a lot of lasts. They’re the first team to lose every game in a season. They’re the first (and only) team &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/2/14/17012010/overwatch-league-first-female-player-geguri-shanghai-dragons"&gt;to field a female player&lt;/a&gt;. They were the last team to win a stage championship before the league changed its format, and now, they are the last team to win a championship in &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 1&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NL9VDO"&gt;Jon Spector — &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League commissioner — &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Spex_J/status/1433889109349650435?s=20"&gt;confirmed that the next season will be played on &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The switch in game brings with it a host of other changes. The starting lineups for teams will reduce in size from six players to five, and the much-maligned assault map type will be replaced with push — a map type in which teams fight to control a robot that pushes a payload. We even got a glimpse at what competitive play will look like in 2022 with an exhibition game of league pros demoing &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt; during halftime. The changes are interesting, and while I’m eager to see how &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt; will transform the league, that excitement is tempered by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597113/activision-blizzard-california-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-discrimination-employee-action"&gt;abuse, harassment, and discrimination allegations&lt;/a&gt; levied at its developer, Blizzard Entertainment, and the news that Chacko Sonny, Overwatch 2’s executive producer, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22686563/overwatch-2-boss-quit-activision-blizzard"&gt;has left the company&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DE1Jck"&gt;As I celebrate my Dragons, mourn the end of &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; prime, and continue to watch Blizzard implode in slow motion, I am reminded of the reason I came to this game in the first place: its community. Some of my best friends and colleagues have come from my time as a fan and a reporter, and my favorite memories come from matches I saw live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mJUx12"&gt;I’ve never truly participated in a sports fandom before, and yet, I latched onto this esport and the Shanghai Dragons with it, &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/why-im-a-fan-of-owls-shanghai-dragons-even-after-they-went-0-40/"&gt;with such fanatical devotion&lt;/a&gt; that a tattoo of their logo is now a foregone conclusion and a promise fulfilled. I know that the &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League was never scripted, but I’m glad the league’s story ended like this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DxeYft"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="epm3eK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
