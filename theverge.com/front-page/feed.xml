    <title>Facebook brings cloud gaming to Apple devices with a web app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lZNgi_U6Ik1Fj2r7rlmm9IQtBh4=/0x0:720x480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69622505/acastro_210722_1777_facebookgaming_720.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Hrbq5g"&gt;Starting Friday, Facebook is bringing its nascent cloud gaming service to iPhones and iPads &lt;a href="http://www.fb.gg/play"&gt;through a web app&lt;/a&gt; people will be able to add to their homescreens like a native app. The site will let you play simple web games like Solitaire and match-threes and stream more graphically intensive titles like racing games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p0ICjR"&gt;But thanks to Apple’s rules, it’s unclear how people will find it, since third-party developers like Facebook are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22431356/epic-v-apple-anti-steering-ios-fortnite-subscriptions-web-day-7"&gt;barred from steering their app users&lt;/a&gt; to websites featuring purchasing mechanisms that aren’t Apple’s own. It’s a huge point of friction with not just Facebook, but other gaming companies like Epic that have strongly protested Apple’s grip on iOS payments. Facebook’s library of web games, which include HTML5-based ones alongside more advanced titles that stream directly from the cloud, use the social network’s custom payments system called Facebook Pay to accept in-game purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ykHrd8"&gt;Facebook’s decision to bring its game platform to iOS via the web mimics the approach of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21455343/amazon-luna-apple-app-store-rules-cloud-gaming-streaming-google-nvidia"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554267/microsoft-xcloud-game-streaming-xbox-pass-ios-iphone-ipad-pc"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, which have also released Progressive Web Apps, or PWAs, for their respective cloud gaming services to get around the App Store. Last year, Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/7/21358355/facebook-apple-app-store-policies-comments-facebook-gaming-ios"&gt;complained loudly&lt;/a&gt; when Apple blocked its attempt to put games in a standalone app for iOS and said it would look into alternatives. Shortly after that, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/20912689/apple-cloud-gaming-streaming-xcloud-stadia-app-store-guidelines-rules"&gt;changed its rules&lt;/a&gt; to allow for cloud-based games as long as they were submitted individually as apps to the App Store for review — a policy that Microsoft and others said didn’t address their desire to release their own gaming storefronts on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G8ef6Hy3DmGvzfMi12vPjLnb-7M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22734643/Facebook_gaming_web_app.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="e1CZXB"&gt;“We’ve come to the same conclusion as others: web apps are the only option for streaming cloud games on iOS at the moment,” Facebook’s vice president of gaming, Vivek Sharma, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a statement. “As many have pointed out, Apple’s policy to ‘allow’ cloud games on the App Store doesn’t allow for much at all. Apple’s requirement for each cloud game to have its own page, go through review, and appear in search listings defeats the purpose of cloud gaming. These roadblocks mean players are prevented from discovering new games, playing cross-device, and accessing high-quality games instantly in native iOS apps — even for those who aren’t using the latest and most expensive devices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ja2wpt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple’s policy to ‘allow’ cloud games on the App Store doesn’t allow for much at all”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e575v3"&gt;Facebook isn’t a major player in gaming yet, as it has mostly focused on courting streamers to broadcast their gameplay for fans to watch. But last year it acquired a cloud gaming startup and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21528438/facebook-cloud-gaming-beta-android-web-jason-rubin-interview"&gt;released a handful of free-to-play titles&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;em&gt;Asphalt 9&lt;/em&gt;. It has since made its service available in more regions, added other titles like &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed: Rebellion&lt;/em&gt;, and said 1.5 million people play its cloud games per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RID2dQ"&gt;While Facebook ultimately found a solution for getting its cloud games on iOS, there are still big limitations &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22421912/iphone-web-app-pwa-cloud-gaming-epic-v-apple-safari"&gt;imposed by Apple’s Safari&lt;/a&gt; browser on web games. Sound is turned off by default, games can’t send push notifications, and graphics aren’t as powerful as they can be in native apps. And then there’s the problem of discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R1yA4z"&gt;A Facebook spokesperson declined to comment on its growth plans for the gaming website, but &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#in-app-purchase"&gt;Apple’s rules&lt;/a&gt; say that developers can’t send users from a native app to a website with payments technology other than its own. Developers of the games Facebook features could do their own marketing, but those efforts would pale in comparison to the traffic that the main Facebook app could send.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ulFZi"&gt;Facebook’s cloud games are currently available in the US and parts of Canada and Mexico, while HTML games are accessible elsewhere as cloud games are slowly brought to more regions.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon to investigate allegations of harassment and discrimination in its AWS unit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/65it0m7FMQ1XqXI2wn2PjAB9OIU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69622115/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0001.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mY6QZ5"&gt;Amazon will investigate allegations of discrimination and harassment within its Amazon Web Services (AWS) unit, following an employee petition that criticized AWS’s culture, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/05/19/amazon-suit-race-gender-discrimination/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. More than 550 Amazon workers signed the petition, which calls out AWS for its “underlying culture of systemic discrimination, harassment, bullying, and bias against women and under-represented groups,” the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; reported. The petition further alleges that Amazon’s system to investigate claims of discrimination is “not fair, objective or transparent.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GIZztV"&gt;The petition pointed to allegations from former AWS employees: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LaB7PJ"&gt;In May, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444635/amazon-five-discrimination-retaliation-lawsuits-warehouse"&gt;five women sued Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, alleging race and gender discrimination. One of the women, Cindy Warner, worked in the AWS division and had accused a manager of making homophobic comments. When she hired a lawyer, Warner said she was fired in retaliation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S741Ub"&gt;An Amazon spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company had conducted a thorough investigation of Warner’s complaints when she made them, and “we have found her allegations to be unsubstantiated.” Warner detailed her allegations in a &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@cindylwarner1/amazon-fired-me-for-reporting-gender-bias-now-others-are-speaking-out-e1ca420c3692"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medium&lt;/em&gt; post&lt;/a&gt; on Friday, saying she intended to move forward. “I will pursue my claims as far as I need to in order to show Amazon how wrong management’s actions were,” she wrote. “My wonderful colleagues at AWS will not be intimidated or silenced, either.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qd9qio"&gt;Another incident referenced in the petition was an August 2020 &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-i-left-aws-laudon-williams/"&gt;LinkedIn post&lt;/a&gt; by former AWS employee Laudon Williams, who said he left the company because he saw instances of what he considered gender discrimination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kE8hyp"&gt;Amazon said in its email to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it does not tolerate discrimination or harassment in any form. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7UBPCR"&gt;The petition was sent to new Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, the former head of AWS, and current AWS chief executive Adam Selipsky, the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; reported. Selipsky later wrote an email to the petition’s authors saying he shared their concerns, and that said Amazon was hiring an outside firm to investigate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mFrM3P"&gt;“Given the nature of the concerns here, we have retained an outside firm to investigate and understand any inappropriate conduct that you or others may have experienced or witnessed,” according to the letter, which was provided in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;by a company spokesperson. “This firm is experienced and objective, and I personally will review their independent findings, which will help guide any further actions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zAAb9H"&gt;The petitioners want the company to conduct an independent investigation of AWS, to be completed by October 30th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8iBrrU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 23rd 10:59AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added comment from Amazon and Cindy Warner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ODlVRp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dlbC7P"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chevy Bolts recalled again for fire risk, as GM admits battery defects</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ahJJwydJnC5NwRlNzLSAzesydjM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69622476/akrales_170405_1582_0324.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BhCXo4"&gt;General Motors is &lt;a href="https://my.chevrolet.com/how-to-support/safety/boltevrecall"&gt;recalling&lt;/a&gt; 2017-2019 model year Chevy Bolts a second time because of a risk that the battery packs could catch fire. The new recall comes after two Bolts &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577757/gm-chevy-bolt-fires-recall-fix-software-update-not-working"&gt;recently caught fire despite having received the purported software fix&lt;/a&gt; from the previous recall, which was first announced in November 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FoOFsR"&gt;GM has also finally shed a little light on the source of the problem. The automaker says that, working with battery supplier LG Chem, it discovered that some of the cells that make up the Bolt’s pack can have two simultaneous manufacturing defects. The company did not say specifically what these defects are, but when they are present they can cause a fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D3T8Pd"&gt;GM says it’s still preparing the recall, and so it’s telling owners to take a bunch of precautions in the meantime until they’re able to check and attempt to fix every vehicle. The company says owners shouldn’t charge the vehicle to more than 90 percent, or let it drop below 70 miles (which is roughly 27 percent). That means owners will only be able to use about 60 percent (around 155 miles) of their vehicle’s capacity until GM is able to complete the new recall fix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gqZBxq"&gt;Owners should also charge their vehicle after each use, according to GM. Of course, GM is still warning owners not to park their vehicles inside or near their house, and says they shouldn’t leave Bolts charging overnight. GM has more information, including customer support numbers, on &lt;a href="https://my.chevrolet.com/how-to-support/safety/boltevrecall"&gt;its recall website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="E5iOVX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Don’t charge over 90 percent, below 27 percent, or charge overnight, or inside&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PK0YC4"&gt;Once GM is ready to perform the recall, technicians will inspect the battery packs for this particular defect and replace any modules that contain problematic cells. They were already supposed to be checking Bolt battery packs for defects like this during the prior recall, but GM tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that the new defects were only recently discovered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FQflES"&gt;About a dozen fires are thought to have occurred in these model year Bolts. The previous fix, which was shared in May — months after the recall was first announced — involved installing software on the affected Bolts that was supposed to “detect potential issues related to changes in battery module performance before problems can develop.” This extra software wasn’t enough to stop two more fires from happening, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ivy48"&gt;LG Chem also supplies the cells for the Kona EV, which Hyundai recalled after reports of fires, and even discontinued altogether in South Korea. The battery supplier has run into all sorts of problems with other products, too. It has recalled some home battery systems, and one of its grid storage projects caught fire, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/07/23/gm-announces-recall-after-a-dozen-bolt-ev-fires-6-key-questions-we-need-answers-to/"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;. Porsche recently recalled the LG Chem-powered Taycan &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22559051/porsche-taycan-ev-recall-12-volt-audi-etron-gt"&gt;over power loss problems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D542OG"&gt;While it takes some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/3/17530646/tesla-battery-fire-electric-vehicles-transportation-science"&gt;special care and instruction&lt;/a&gt; to know how to extinguish a fire in an electric vehicle, there isn’t any data that shows they happen at any higher rate than fires in internal combustion engine cars. Occasional fires are bound to happen. But the situation that GM — and, really LG — has found itself in with these Bolts is much different. A few years ago the Bolt was one of the first legitimate long-range electric vehicles on the market. But now it’s running the risk of taking on a much different mantle. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Tokyo 2020 opening ceremony was filled with some of gaming’s greatest tunes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Dragon Quest XI" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r2yCBAoh0FWxwJmc-0HGLROg6Cs=/65x0:1685x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69622437/DQXI_InGameScreenshot_March28_C01.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="POdVWT"&gt;The opening ceremony of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics kicked off this morning, and tunes from classic video games played as all of the athletes from participating countries were welcomed into a crowd-free arena. There was plenty of representation on the RPG front, with well-known songs from franchises including &lt;em&gt;Dragon Quest&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Phantasy Star&lt;/em&gt;, and more. Perhaps more surprising were some of the deeper cuts from &lt;em&gt;Chrono Trigger&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ace Combat&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Nier&lt;/em&gt;, and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NaCLah"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22590146/olympics-2020-games-athletes-parade-of-nations-video-game-music-dragon-quest-kingdom-hearts"&gt;Our pals at &lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have the full list of songs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="c3CUbA"&gt;Naturally, you might want to hear some of these clips from the ceremony. You’ll need to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22589095/olympics-opening-ceremony-watch-start-time-how-to-live-stream"&gt;run through some steps to watch them at home&lt;/a&gt; (which includes some free options) to see the ceremony uninterrupted. Though, there are some clips on Twitter that feature a few highlights from the ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Judge rejects Wisk Aero’s effort to block rival air taxi startup Archer from using ‘stolen’ patents </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UbMC8ICOjkN1Zp79QLVgo-Z8_J0=/0x0:4884x3256/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69622410/Archer4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Archer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1n1k5w"&gt;A federal judge in San Francisco rejected air taxi startup Wisk Aero’s request for a preliminary injunction against rival startup Archer Aviation, as Silicon Valley’s first big “flying car” legal drama heats up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DsiDhj"&gt;Wisk, a joint venture between Boeing and Kitty Hawk, wanted to block Archer Aviation from using any of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/6/22369921/wisk-sues-archer-trade-secrets-theft-flying-taxi"&gt;52 trade secrets it alleges were stolen&lt;/a&gt;. Wisk is also seeking unspecified monetary damages from Archer in a lawsuit that was filed April 6th. Federal investigators are also looking into the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mHKXLj"&gt;In his ruling, US District Court Judge William Orrick wrote that Wisk’s request was “too uncertain and equivocal,” though he acknowledged that there were “some arguable indications of misappropriation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="R87aKl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“some arguable indications of misappropriation”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uH1cWz"&gt;Archer celebrated the ruling by blasting Wisk’s lawsuit as meritless. “The record makes it clear that Wisk has provided no evidence — not a single document, not a single witness — that Archer ever received or used any Wisk trade secret,” Archer’s deputy general counsel, Eric Lentell said in &lt;a href="https://archer.com/news/archer-wins-defeats-wisks-motion-for-preliminary-injunction"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “Wisk’s charges of massive theft are based entirely on conspiracy theories and outright misrepresentations of the actual record.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pnVgPS"&gt;Archer claims that evidence introduced in the case will prove that its 12-rotor, battery-powered Maker aircraft was designed “independently, and well in advance of any effort by Wisk to develop a similar eVTOL [electric vertical and takeoff] aircraft.” Archer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22529534/archer-maker-air-taxi-evtol-reveal-specs"&gt;officially unveiled&lt;/a&gt; its demonstrator aircraft at an event in Los Angeles last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zb3d1n"&gt;In its lawsuit, Wisk alleged that former employee Jing Xue improperly downloaded almost 5,000 data files onto a personal device that he subsequently gave to Archer after joining the company in January 2020. Lentell claims that Wisk is trying to defame Xue as the “poster child for the covert theft.” But when questioned in court about the files, Xue pled the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination, citing the federal investigation into the case. Archer has place Xue on administrative leave.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5Ye-Ld4O-JOetVLk3xmyW8fkBSs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19683651/wisk_cora.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wisk.aero&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wc1NHt"&gt;Despite the setback, Wisk says that it intends to take its lawsuit all the way to a jury trial. “We are in the very early stages of a long legal process,” a spokesperson said in &lt;a href="https://wisk.aero/news/press-release/wisk-looks-ahead-to-archer-trial/"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt;, “with in-depth evidence-gathering now to begin, and we fully intend to hold Archer accountable at trial.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DlbJOa"&gt;Archer was founded by Adam Goldstein and Brett Adcock, co-founders of Vettery, a marketing software-as-a-service company, which the two sold to Switzerland-based staffing firm Adecco Group in 2018 for $100 million. The company came out of stealth in the spring of 2020 after having poached key talent from Wisk, which is jointly owned by Boeing and Kitty Hawk, the flying taxi company bankrolled by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/19/17586878/larry-page-flying-car-opener-kitty-hawk-cora"&gt;Google co-founder Larry Page&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0AX4nM"&gt;But Wisk argues that Archer didn’t just steal talent — it also stole trade secrets. Wisk has accused Archer of misappropriating “thousands of highly confidential files containing very valuable trade secrets, as well as the use of significant innovations Wisk has patented.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CIau0A"&gt;Air taxis, sometimes misidentified as “flying cars,” are essentially helicopters without the noisy, polluting gas motors. A number of startups have emerged in recent years with prototype aircraft that are electric-powered, able to carry a handful of passengers, and intended for short flights within a city or regionally. Analysts predict that the flying taxi market could grow to $150 billion in revenue by 2035.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to ‘dislike’ TikTok videos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WRqQAP37QU5kxnMrDEXS7SAyBBc=/13x0:1488x983/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69622346/microsoft_tiktok.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Based on wallpaper by Michael Gillett (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://wallpaperhub.app/wallpapers/7509" target="_blank"&gt;Wallpaper Hub&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="seuq6L"&gt;TikTok’s algorithms &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22574404/tiktok-videos-for-you-page-curate-algorithm-discover-how-to"&gt;can be very perceptive&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to the types of videos you want to see in your For You feed. But when it doesn’t work, you may find yourself facing a steady stream of the type of video you really don’t want to deal with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ch3ZpB"&gt;I’m not just talking about something egregious — like, for example, political or religious or social statements that you might feel are completely counter to your beliefs. I’m also referring to videos that you might simply find annoying, such as a type of music that you don’t like, or a type of humor that doesn’t suit. For example, for some reason I suddenly found myself swiping though a bunch of videos from so-called fortune tellers offering advice to their commenters. I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; didn’t need to see those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fFEpkH"&gt;So what can you do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pnr7d4"&gt;Well, it turns out that you can actually “dislike” TikTok videos — or, at least, you can tell TikTok that you are not interested in it, and so (hopefully) tweak the algorithm to not show you other videos like it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yVxZW2"&gt;Here’s how:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="PfF7oO"&gt;Long press on the video that you don’t like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1BIPxk"&gt;You’ll get a pop-up menu that lets you save the video, add it to your favorites, report it (if you feel it’s really offensive), or say that you’re simply not interested. In this case, tap on “Not interested.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="38xiJ0"&gt;You’ll then get the choice to either hide videos from that user or hide videos that use that sound (if you’re just tired of a particular audio track).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Long-press on the screen to bring up this menu. (Note: this is just an example; I had nothing against this video.)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/69jMc3bkU-8AyXaxpfKKMuDsezE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22735457/Screenshot_20210723_093201.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Long-press on the screen to bring up this menu. (Note: this is just an example; I had nothing against this video.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can either hide all videos from the creator, or hide all videos that use that sound clip." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JbI6P2kHBGF1Xlm3QEnwhGY4qoA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22735456/Screenshot_20210723_093254.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can either hide all videos from the creator or hide all videos that use that sound clip.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pyBU48"&gt;And that, hopefully, will be that. You can also, by the way, long-press on live videos that you don’t like; in that case, you’ll immediately get the choice to either say you’re not interested or report the video.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="foKHZb"&gt;Despite having to weather &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525953/biden-tiktok-wechat-trump-bans-revoked-alipay"&gt;a variety of controversies&lt;/a&gt; having to do with its content and its ownership, TikTok persists as a popular video app — and no wonder. It allows you to quickly create videos, add a variety of effects, text captions, and audio backgrounds, and show to the world what you think is cute, funny, politically problematic, deadly serious, or in need of fixing. TikTok is full of cute animals, weird dances, snarky remarks, and imaginative dialogues between the same individual dressed up in two different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MW4f9C"&gt;In fact, it is hard to say who is having the most fun: those who are swiping through the wide variety of videos out there, discovering what other people are doing, dancing, and discussing, or those who are creating these imaginative videos and enjoying the attention and comments that they engender. (Or not enjoying it, depending on those comments — this is social media, after all, and so there are a lot of angry people out there.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRGXUK"&gt;If you want to know what all the fuss is about and want to give the app a try, either as a watcher or as a creator, we have your back. In &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; Guide to TikTok, we’ve got step-by-step directions for new users and some excellent tips for knowledgeable creators. We explain how to find what you’re interested in, how to decline what you’re not interested in, and how to deal with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22587113/tiktok-algorithm-wsj-investigation-rabbit-hole"&gt;algorithms that determine&lt;/a&gt; what you’re going to see next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gH3bBD"&gt;We hope you find them useful in your explorations of the wonderful world of TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HTC’s Vive Focus 3 is a great prototype for a true Oculus Quest rival</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;But it’s not for home VR&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="skHwfh"&gt;Let’s get this out of the way: you shouldn’t buy the HTC Vive Focus 3 for home VR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="wplj6q"&gt;The Vive Focus 3 is HTC’s latest virtual reality headset, part of the Vive line that it first released in 2016. The Vive helped establish the modern VR industry, and the Focus 3 is one of only two big-brand standalone (as opposed to PC- or console-tethered) headsets on the market alongside Facebook’s Oculus Quest 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FKzItM"&gt;But as Facebook lengthens its lead in consumer VR, HTC has voluntarily taken itself out of the running. The Focus 3, which opened for preorders last month, is meant for businesses, research institutions, and other professional settings. It’s equipped with a small suite of apps that hold little consumer appeal, and it is sold with HTC tech support and other enterprise-oriented features. At $1,300, it costs more than four times as much as the Quest 2’s $299 base price. Again: if you want a device for playing video games, exercising, or using most VR social spaces, don’t buy HTC’s standalone headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OqIVDZ"&gt;So why write about it? Because I’m holding out hope that in a few years that could change. The Vive Focus 3 has polished, premium-feeling hardware that would feel great in a consumer product, while not being weighed down by the Quest’s Facebook-shaped baggage. It feels like a formula for building genuinely competitive home VR hardware — even if HTC isn’t making a play for that yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hp7eTh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10664853"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zp7tSB"&gt;The Focus 3 is HTC’s third generation of standalone headsets, or VR systems that are totally self-contained rather than plugged into a computer. It’s also the first Focus that really looks like a finished product. Where the 2018 Vive Focus and 2019 Focus Plus had a strange, swept-back look, the Focus 3 has a no-nonsense matte black design that resembles bulky goggles, with a shiny front plate where you’ll find the four cameras that handle head and hand tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBcTeT"&gt;HTC’s headset is larger and heavier than the Oculus Quest 2; it’s closer in size to the original Oculus Quest. But its design makes it far more comfortable than the original Quest &lt;em&gt;or &lt;/em&gt;the Quest 2 with its default strap. The Focus 3 ships with a cloth and plastic headband that tightens with a ring at the back, similar to the Elite Strap that Facebook sells for $49. VR headsets can still be tricky to wear without getting a headache, but the Focus 3 is more comfortable than most, as long as you’re careful to get a good fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="mAbIH1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s as crisp as anything you’ll find in a consumer VR system&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ia152K"&gt;The Focus 3’s big selling point is a 5K screen (or 2448 x 2448 pixels per eye, compared to the Quest 2’s 1832 x 1920) with a 90Hz refresh rate and 120-degree field of view (compared to 110 degrees on most consumer headsets). The display isn’t as extraordinarily sharp as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21720748/varjo-vr3-xr3-vr-ar-dual-resolution-headsets-price-shipping-specs"&gt;Varjo’s professional headsets&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s as crisp as anything I’ve seen in a consumer system. While there’s still a noticeable black ring around your field of view, it’s a little less intrusive than most of its competition. The only real drawback is some prominent “god rays” — a side effect of some VR lenses that can introduce halos of light in high-contrast images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhz1gk"&gt;It’s hard to practically evaluate the Focus 3’s maximum performance because HTC’s software selection is extremely limited — you won’t find graphically demanding games that clearly push its limits. But there also aren’t any red flags with its SnapDragon XR2 — the same chip used in the Quest 2 — even with the demands of the higher resolution display. The headset’s tracking worked perfectly for me under bright and dim light, especially compared to the earlier Vive Cosmos’ cameras at launch, and my battery lasted just shy of three hours with a mix of 3D experiences and web browsing, which is comparable to the Quest 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PRvzxRzgMDB7x2R4MlnOYIhoD6o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22727556/arobertson_210630_4670_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Focus 3 has more comfortable padding than other headsets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lkPEJT-3KYScmg7ixAPoR3e5tbA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22727555/arobertson_210630_4670_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The dial on the back makes it easy to adjust the size quickly, which is important for businesses that might have multiple people sharing the Focus 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hpp6AR"&gt;I don’t love the Focus 3’s use of directed speakers instead of headphones; as with basically all speaker-based headsets, some sound bleeds out and is audible to people around you. But it’s less noticeable than, say, the Valve Index’s speaker bleed, and the audio itself generally sounds just fine. (There’s also a 3.5mm headphone jack and the option to pair Bluetooth headphones.) The only odd note is an unusually loud fan that also blows a very light breeze across your face — which, like the god rays mentioned above, is noticeable but not usually disruptive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vxD0On"&gt;Meanwhile, the Focus 3 is full of thoughtful little hardware touches. Its face mask is padded with the soft, non-absorbent material you’d find on a nice pair of headphones, not the porous padding many headsets (including the Quest 2) use — so you can clean it easily after sessions instead of dealing with a sweat-soaked ring of foam. The battery is swappable and located at the back of the headset for better balance, with a four-light charging indicator that gives you an immediate, detailed look at how much battery power you’ve got. There’s a microSD card slot for expanding the default 128GB of storage, as well as a wheel at the bottom to let you focus the headset, rather than the Oculus Quest 2’s awkward three-setting slider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pl2PpB"&gt;Features like swappable batteries are more useful for business customers — who might want to run a headset all day — than the average consumer. But they add up to a well-made device with bells and whistles Facebook either doesn’t have or sells separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oykpeD9B9lVG6bkmOZaFW9UIIz0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22727558/arobertson_210630_4670_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Focus 3’s controllers aren’t quite as nice as the headset itself.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QXG2fJ"&gt;The Focus 3’s controllers are a big step up from earlier Vive designs. HTC held onto the original Vive’s wand-like controller shape for years, but it’s thankfully given the Focus 3 a now-standard Oculus Touch-style interface: each motion controller has two triggers, two face buttons, a menu button, and an analog stick, and they’re contoured to fit your hands. Like most Vive headsets, they use built-in rechargeable batteries instead of disposable AA ones — which sacrifices the immediate convenience of a swappable battery but also feels distinctly less wasteful, particularly when the controllers last much longer than the headset and both charge in an hour or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nCeKd1"&gt;Unfortunately, the Focus 3 controllers still feel cheap compared to the much less expensive Oculus Touch controllers — or, for that matter, the Focus 3 headset hardware. Also, the main triggers have a distinct click, but they oddly fire just before you hit it. It creates a confusing delay if you’re pulling them quickly and repeatedly, like you do when hitting letters on a VR keyboard, and it feels simply pointless if (as I did) you just learn to not fully pull the triggers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9tWG0K"&gt;Put the hardware aside, and the Focus 3 drives home how important native app ecosystems are for standalone headsets. The Focus 3 has a small “Business App Store” with specialized productivity tools and a few games, but you can’t even directly buy apps inside it; you have to open a separate window to get a license that will put them in your library. Companies can run their own software or use some of the default apps like Vive Sync, a virtual meeting room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="O1IEEB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;WebXR is a frustrating reminder of how useful VR web apps could be&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vxam6H"&gt;The most broadly consumer-oriented app I’ve found is Firefox, which works like any VR browser: normal websites appear in a box in front of your face, and WebXR sites let you click a button to enter a web-based VR experience. WebVR is a frustrating reminder of how powerful the web &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be for VR. It easily supports lightweight VR apps and games like a &lt;em&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/em&gt;-style rhythm game called &lt;em&gt;Moon Rider&lt;/em&gt;. But there’s no clear demand to build or optimize these apps, either — so most remain in the experimental or tech-demo stage. While the web holds the promise of easy cross-platform VR, it’s no substitute for a native app store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v9uPenkTKDYPQ5aL2_vu_lybT_0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22727552/arobertson_210630_4670_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can use the Focus 3 entirely standalone from a PC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="voSiIj"&gt;That’s not a knock on the Vive Focus 3, because I think HTC is right to avoid the consumer market. Facebook is likely subsidizing the super-cheap Oculus Quest 2 with its monumental ad revenue elsewhere, and it’s acquired a library of first-party games HTC couldn’t currently match. HTC’s Viveport PC VR store has always felt like a shadow of the Oculus Store or Valve’s SteamVR, and abruptly jumping into mobile VR would just make the gap more pronounced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r2Oipk"&gt;Even so, HTC has built the first product that feels like a potential competitor to Oculus’ mobile VR, and the VR world needs that kind of competition. Facebook has funded a lot of excellent experiences, but it’s also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21375118/oculus-facebook-account-login-data-privacy-controversy-developers-competition"&gt;alienated some VR fans&lt;/a&gt; with its aggressive Oculus-Facebook integration, particularly as it starts &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22544468/facebook-oculus-quest-ads-resolution-games-blaston"&gt;introducing ads into the Quest&lt;/a&gt;. Some developers feel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21455665/facebook-oculus-vr-indie-developers-power-monopoly-concerns"&gt;pressured by its market power&lt;/a&gt;. And while PlayStation’s upcoming PSVR 2 could offer solid indirect competition, it still won’t have a Quest-style self-contained design. But the Vive Focus 3 proves that making a true rival is more than possible — for a price.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Music’s spatial audio and lossless streaming are now available on Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JEEq4hgQe0J1hx7btXgB9fEu1TQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69622020/acastro_180927_1777_apple_music_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Az5rUL"&gt;Apple Music listeners on Android can now take advantage of the Dolby Atmos spatial audio and lossless-quality streaming features that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523228/apple-music-lossless-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-features"&gt;debuted on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS&lt;/a&gt; over a month ago. The latest update of the app for Android adds support for both features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8UUoqv"&gt;Lossless should be available pretty universally on Android devices. Apple includes all the same warnings as on iOS about it consuming “significantly more data.” Like on Apple’s own platforms, Apple Music advises that external hardware like a DAC is required if you want to step up to hi-res lossless. (I’m curious whether this still applies on LG’s audiophile-friendly phones, which have an excellent built-in DAC, but haven’t had the chance to test yet.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="xMQl1h"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Music’s spatial audio is sometimes amazing but mostly inconsistent","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="H6fzOe"&gt;Spatial audio support on the Android side seems a more limited, however. Although the feature works with any headphones — just like on iPhone — Apple notes that your phone itself needs to support Dolby Atmos to enable spatial audio. On my Pixel 4A 5G, there’s no option for “Dolby Atmos” in the audio section of Apple Music’s settings. Other colleagues with more flagship-tier devices have a toggle for Atmos there. So I guess that’s the easiest way to tell whether your phone is capable of spatial audio playback. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L4YuHP"&gt;The beta version of Apple Music for Android actually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436575/apple-music-android-lossless-audio-airpods-3"&gt;tipped off&lt;/a&gt; that lossless and hi-res audio were coming to the service even before Apple made an official announcement. But now both are available on the regular Apple Music app for Android. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s last-gen WH-1000XM3 cost less than ever at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Sony WH-1000XM3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qm1L5QV7GPedzu71laHN9Xgtk50=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69622012/jbareham_180823_2895_0075.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2c0FQB"&gt;It’s sometimes easy to dismiss the previous generation of a product in favor of the latest version. In most cases, that’s smart to do, unless a deal is just too good to pass up. Case in point, Sony’s WH-1000XM3 noise-canceling headphones that released in 2018 are down to their lowest price yet at Best Buy today and through Sunday. Originally $350 (but usually selling between $220-$270 most days), &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743780474724360893#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can get them new in the black colorway for $170&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon was offering this price earlier today, but &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07G4MNFS1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it appears to have sold out&lt;/a&gt; for the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uo5C9c"&gt;Compared to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1000XM4 that released in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, the XM3s aren’t far behind. They are comparable in terms of sound quality, battery life, comfort, and with their noise cancellation effect. Though, the XM4 are unique in that they have an auto on / off playback sensor when you put on or take off the headphones, and they can connect with two Bluetooth sources simultaneously. We’ve seen that newer model go for as low as $250 during Prime Day recently, but you’d currently be able to buy two sets of XM3s at Best Buy to match the XM4’s price as it stands today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZCCH3D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10326538"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uJiSbs"&gt;Also part of &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747024753714194232#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy’s three-day “Black Friday in July” sale&lt;/a&gt;, MSI’s Sword 15 gaming laptop is a couple hundred dollars off its normal price. Normally $1,200, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747024670748190489#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s $1,000 now&lt;/a&gt;. That’s not a bad deal for what specs are inside, including the Intel Core i7-11800H processor, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22423474/nvidia-rtx-3050-ti-60fps-gaming-laptops-features-specs-performance-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nvidia’s RTX 3050 Ti graphics chip&lt;/a&gt;, a 512GB NVMe SSD, and 8GB of RAM. It has a 1080p display with a 144Hz refresh rate. The sum of its components equal a solid midrange gaming laptop that should be capable of delivering playable frame rates in many games after some tweaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mX1ul7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10665627"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vt8QaL"&gt;We featured a similar deal recently for the newly released &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD&lt;/em&gt; for the Nintendo Switch, but the cartridge version of the game &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747024806913770606#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is $9 off at Best Buy right now&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, this deal doesn’t extend to the digital version, but the discount is nice if you were thinking about grabbing this game at your local Best Buy ahead of the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jQ5zIi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10660223"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
