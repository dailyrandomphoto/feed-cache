    <title>Chipotle hides the assembly line, testing new online-order-only ‘Digital Kitchen’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2JPFIc8bEtwqQrc1ladUXfxtWyM=/0x113:2699x1912/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70287026/Chipotle2_1639602514933_HR.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chipotle’s Digital Kitchen for Pickup &amp;amp; Delivery kind of looks like a regular Chipotle&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Chipotle&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DzjKNI"&gt;Chipotle &lt;a href="https://ir.chipotle.com/2021-12-16-CHIPOTLE-TO-OPEN-FIRST-CHIPOTLANE-DIGITAL-KITCHEN#assets_all"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; it’s opening a new “Digital Kitchen” restaurant this month in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio (about 40 miles south of Cleveland) — which will exclusively accept online orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="1rfLlw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Hungry customers should avoid knocking on that pickup window expecting to have their order taken&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n539OS"&gt;The prototype location will offer its pickup-only drive-thru “Chipotlane,” some outdoor seats and tables for eating (no dining room), and a walk-up window. Hungry customers should avoid knocking on that pickup window expecting to have their order taken. Instead, order online or on the Chipotle app and then check back at the window or roll up to the drive-thru.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cVCZ5uX_8449LsViGnS4hNFEd84=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23103405/chipotle_5oz_0014.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Tabasco&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Imagine begging the Chipotle worker at the window to let you get a few drips of this magical kicker of a sauce.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0qToky"&gt;Chipotle says that there are about 300 restaurant locations with a drive-thru window already, which only accounts for about &lt;a href="https://www.scrapehero.com/location-reports/Chipotle-USA/"&gt;10 percent&lt;/a&gt; of all its burrito procuring destinations. Should this prototype digital kitchen store be successful, we can probably expect to see fewer dining rooms with soda stations, and say goodbye to DIY smoked chipotle Tabasco sauce application (as of right now, you can’t select this sauce in the order system).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gnfsye"&gt;Chipotle might run into issues with customers trying to take orders at the window, only to be turned away to go order online. As long as the restaurant looks like a Chipotle, which is a place people expect to line up and build a burrito, there’s going to be some confusion. It could be beneficial for Chipotle to visually differentiate its digital kitchen more and lean into being a ghost kitchen, from which the company seems to be borrowing a bit of the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ueRdUn"&gt;The concept of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22456930/chicken-wings-delivery-virtual-brands"&gt;ghost kitchens&lt;/a&gt;, an online-only virtual restaurant that has no customer-facing location, has gained in popularity. Ghost kitchens like MrBeast Burger have operated out of restaurants that need another source of revenue during the pandemic. The concept has also evolved into kitchens running out of &lt;a href="https://medium.com/hngry/cloudkitchens-turns-shipping-containers-into-drive-thru-of-the-future-f1ff9a9c5f07"&gt;shipping containers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807607/go-read-ghost-kitchens-uber-eats-doordash"&gt;parking lots&lt;/a&gt;. A ghost kitchen is, by design, only going to invite online delivery orders with no customers trying to knock on doors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7uoiK4tlfsoIKhA1dmIGOsyOjTM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23103400/Screen_Shot_2021_12_17_at_1.32.29_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chipotle drive-thru locations are still pretty scarce, only one of seven locations near the Rutherford, New Jersey area have it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="78cCk0"&gt;Although not a ghost kitchen, concepts like Chipotle’s Digital Kitchen are popping up everywhere in this pandemic world — including new spots for Jack in the Box, Del Taco, and Taco Bell. In an effort to practice social distancing, more people are ordering food online, using delivery services, and hitting the drive-thrus. Chipotle’s Chipotlane locations are also growing to accommodate this, and one easy way to do that is to take over buildings that already have a drive-thru.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ixsxs7gfQ4kw0Asnr580cvMl30I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23103808/Screen_Shot_2021_12_17_at_1.37.41_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Via Apple Maps Look Around&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This North Bergen, New Jersey Carl’s Jr. was permanently closed and is now a “Chipotlane” restaurant.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="threads_view_CQ1J4TN8G-1639755988.256000-1639763524.286800"&gt;At least one location I found in North Bergen, New Jersey used to be a Carl’s Jr., but now it’s a Chipotlane. Chipotle will probably continue to do this — new restaurants with Chipotlanes apparently have 15 percent higher sales than ones without — until they can output beans and guac nearly as fast as Taco Bell can, perhaps further &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/31/22753447/go-read-this-story-online-orders-employee-burn-out-chipotle-workers-fast-food"&gt;risking burnout&lt;/a&gt; for its workers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fc4IkSKC4oxrc_fS5b7gKWlGSW4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23104232/newsroom_2021_E04_taco_bell_defy.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Taco Bell&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Taco Bell Defy” has four drive-thru lanes, three for delivery services. Orders are made online.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zEkpnh"&gt;Taco Bell, the recently alternative-meat &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22827004/taco-bell-beyond-meat-carne-asada-test-canceled-plant-based-fast-food"&gt;snubbing&lt;/a&gt; fast-food chain, &lt;a href="https://www.tacobell.com/news/taco-bell-and-franchisee-partner-to-revolutionize-the-drive-thru-experience-with-taco-bell-defy"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in August its first “Taco Bell Defy” location in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota that is exclusively a four-lane drive-thru. The new locations will have an upper-level kitchen that sends digital orders down via a lift without any human contact. Three of those four lanes are also dedicated to delivery services — while Chipotle will be sharing just the one with both DoorDash type delivery services and regular customers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon tries to defend collecting browsing data on its network</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lAushCodxkqVEjGJHgyQjuGnM6M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70286702/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YPknxr"&gt;Verizon has sent an email to customers to let them know they’re getting opted in to its Custom Experience data collection scheme after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/5/22818783/verizon-app-data-collection-browsing-history"&gt;reports came out&lt;/a&gt; about it being turned on by default for some users. If you (understandably) trashed the email without reading it, the TL;DR is that Verizon’s program collects data about your apps and web browsing activity to help “provide you more personalized experiences with Verizon.” But of course, Verizon says, you have a choice — you can turn it off anytime because your privacy is important to it (though not important enough to make the program opt-in instead of opt-out).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C6pi66"&gt;Custom Experience is a sort of spin-off / successor / rebrand of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/2/16085062/verizon-up-rewards-program-track-browsing-history-data-select-oath"&gt;Verizon Selects&lt;/a&gt;, which people were enrolled into when they used the Verizon Up rewards program. Verizon Selects has now been rebranded as Custom Experience Plus, while the Custom Experience with a few limits on tracking is rolling out to most customers who don’t actively opt out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9bzhiO"&gt;Verizon is letting its customers know about the program through emails, like one a member of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s staff received, and texts &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jamesreb/status/1471603532730040324?s=20"&gt;like this one&lt;/a&gt; a reader says they got. The email promises that “you’re in control,” saying that you can opt out within the next 30 days before the Custom Experience is turned on for your line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mEB4Nz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Verizon is now letting its customers know that the Custom Experience is coming&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xk1K05"&gt;Doing nothing, however, will likely end with Verizon using your data to “personalize [its] communications with you, give you more relevant product and service recommendations, and develop plans, services and offers that are more appealing to you.” The &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/support/verizon-custom-experience-programs-faqs/?CMP=CRM_M_CU_AC_EM_NOT_21_11_LEGAL_CTM_EXP_NON_SLCT_ENG_NUS&amp;amp;EMHID=c96b4811be3d4808a642b94ba5f0fe873310c7077504f5b29ca77de541c45883&amp;amp;CUHID=398078901cccf63d677d949665702ed2995acb4db919825c6f5eb16102951ba7&amp;amp;BID=452102968" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;company’s FAQ for the program&lt;/a&gt; says that “consumer and small business customers with smartphone lines are included in the Custom Experience program.” It does note that corporate and government lines, as well as lines for children and people in Maine, aren’t included in the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ofay85"&gt;As we note &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/5/22818783/verizon-app-data-collection-browsing-history"&gt;in our explainer&lt;/a&gt;, there are actually two levels to what Verizon is doing here — Custom Experience, which is the automatic enrollment one, and Custom Experience Plus, which is much more invasive but supposedly is opt-in. However, it does seem like people have found that they’ve inadvertently signed up for Custom Experience Plus while using other rewards programs. Verizon says with Plus, it collects location data straight from its network (so turning off location tracking on your phone won’t help), as well as metadata about your phone calls like who you talk to and when you talk to them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2QSFnj"&gt;You can read the full instructions on how to turn off Custom Experience and erase the data it’s collected on you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/5/22818783/verizon-app-data-collection-browsing-history"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but the short version is that it can be done in the “Manage privacy settings” preference pane of the My Verizon app (&lt;a href="http://m.vzw.com/CE"&gt;or the web&lt;/a&gt;). Verizon says that it doesn’t sell the data from Custom Experience to advertisers and that it’s for Verizon’s use only. One reader reported that Verizon even sent an alert that linked users to a page explaining how &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/dam/support/pdf/device-installment-privacy-notice.pdf" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon uses the personal data you provide when you sign up for its service&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok says it’s removing ‘alarmist warnings’ about school violence</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tessellated TikTok logos against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZWKfyZhBx7pqhBs6Lfp-xeaKb5A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70286674/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;TikTok says it has not found any videos threatening school violence on December 17th | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Rx8qKK"&gt;TikTok said Friday that it’s working to remove “alarmist warnings” about a supposed day of school violence that was rumored to take place on Friday, December 17th. A supposed threat of a nationwide day of violence at schools across the country, that allegedly started as a TikTok challenge, prompted some districts to cancel classes Friday even as law enforcement mostly determined that the threats were not credible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3sRcME"&gt;TikTok said on Twitter that the warnings &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/helping-our-community-stay-safe-while-having-fun-on-tiktok"&gt;violated its misinformation policy&lt;/a&gt;, which prohibits the spread of hoaxes or warnings about hoaxes that treat them as real. After searching “exhaustively,” Tiktok said it had not found content on its platform promoting violence at US schools on Friday, despite the widespread but unsubstantiated rumors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="id__remxkxdr2y"&gt;“What we find are videos discussing this rumor and warning others to stay safe,” TikTok’s communications team posted in a thread on Twitter. “Local authorities, the FBI, and DHS have confirmed there’s no credible threat, so we’re working to remove alarmist warnings that violate our misinformation policy.” The company said it would remove and report any threats it did find, adding that it was “deeply concerned that the proliferation of local media reports on an alleged trend that has not been found on the platform could end up inspiring real world harm.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fe2cXG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;4/ We understand it can be difficult to know how to assess viral warnings online. We have a guide on our Safety Center to help people assess this kind of content  &lt;a href="https://t.co/nZuxGBolrd"&gt;https://t.co/nZuxGBolrd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— TikTokComms (@TikTokComms) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TikTokComms/status/1471881040105029640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

Districts in a handful of states said they would close Friday; other districts planned increased police presence and notified parents. While districts and local police departments mostly reported hearing about a trend referencing the possibility of shootings or bombings on December 17th, it wasn’t not clear how many saw any specific threats or threats against their schools.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tencent is acquiring Back 4 Blood developer Turtle Rock Studios</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fggwAVBJvapqyjQwDsiziTSIioY=/38x0:1163x750/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70286612/extreme_replayability_1.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tencent is acquiring Turtle Rock Studios.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Turtle Rock Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="96iHTI"&gt;Tencent is adding to its already large roster of video game studios by &lt;a href="https://turtlerockstudios.com/news/trsandtencent"&gt;acquiring Slamfire&lt;/a&gt;, the parent company of &lt;em&gt;Back 4 Blood&lt;/em&gt; developer Turtle Rock Studios. Turtle Rock will be “retaining its independent operations” in California and the current leadership team will still run the studio, &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211217005008/en/"&gt;according to a press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uxbR6D"&gt;Tencent is behind some of the biggest games on the planet. It owns the studio behind &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/17/10410952/riot-games-league-of-legends-acquired-tencent"&gt;the hugely popular MOBA &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; the developer of the mobile hits &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Mobile,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Honor of Kings, and Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt;; and has a 40 percent stake &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/3/21/4131702/tencents-epic-games-stock-acquisition"&gt;in Epic Games&lt;/a&gt;, the developer of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; and Unreal Engine. And the company has made many significant investments just this year, including acquiring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583186/tencent-sumo-digital-buyout-announced-price-acquisition"&gt;British game studio Sumo&lt;/a&gt;, buying a majority stake &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/1/22/22244805/klei-tencent-majority-stake"&gt;in &lt;em&gt;Don’t Starve&lt;/em&gt; developer Klei Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;, and taking minority stakes &lt;a href="https://www.playtonicgames.com/news/playtonic-is-levelling-up/"&gt;in &lt;em&gt;Yooka-Laylee&lt;/em&gt; creator Playtonic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bohemia.net/blog/bohemia-interactive-minority-investment-tencet"&gt;&lt;em&gt;DayZ&lt;/em&gt; developer Bohemia Interactive&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-01-27-tencent-acquires-minority-stake-in-dontnod"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Life is Strange&lt;/em&gt;-maker Dontnod&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Alan Wake&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/announcements/tencent-holdings-acquires-3-8-of-shares-in-remedy-entertainment-from-accendo-capital-accendo-owns-14-0-after-the-transaction/"&gt;developer Remedy Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mmu8pe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We can now ensure that the ‘Back 4 Blood’ franchise is here to stay”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lmmWvI"&gt;While it’s unclear exactly what’s next for Turtle Rock, the studio is emphasizing its commitment to &lt;em&gt;Back 4 Blood&lt;/em&gt; (which got &lt;a href="https://www.back4blood.com/en-us/news/december-2021-update"&gt;a big update just this week&lt;/a&gt;). With Tencent’s acquisition, “we get to do something we have never done before as a studio: turn a universe we created into a true long-standing AAA franchise,” Turtle Rock &lt;a href="https://turtlerockstudios.com/news/trsandtencent"&gt;said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “We can now ensure that the &lt;em&gt;Back 4 Blood&lt;/em&gt; franchise is here to stay and we will be working on it well into the future.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZgvUID"&gt;The Christmas holiday is just one week away. I repeat: seven days from now is Christmas Eve. Let that sink in for a moment, but don’t panic just yet. There is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22833986/ups-usps-fedex-amazon-walmart-best-buy-target-shipping-deadlines-2021"&gt;still time to get gifts in time for the holidays&lt;/a&gt; before we reach cutoff times for shipments, though we’re getting a little tight on time. Just because you’re cutting it close doesn’t mean you have to overspend. Today, we have a bunch of great deals at a variety of price points — many of which can make exceptional gifts for a friend, family member, or yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JL2VfT"&gt;Starting off, Vizio’s midrange 70-inch MQ7 4K LED TV (M70Q7-J03) with voice controls and HDR is just &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgd341IQaDG" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$749.99 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. That’s a $350 discount on quite a large TV. You may ask, “How can I gift a 70-inch TV to just one family member?” Well, this is one of those great gifts you get for the whole household — which, pro tip, is how you get away with buying something nice for yourself at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xgnvy4"&gt;Selfish-adjacent gift scheming aside, the Vizio offers a lot of value for such a large TV. It features a QLED panel for vivid contrast and color with a 60Hz refresh rate and FreeSync support. Though it’s billed as having HDMI 2.1, it only supports HDMI 2.0 throughput, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22833233/hdmi-2-1-fake-marketing-brand-frl-vrr-allm-bandwidth" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;which is a larger problem in the world of TVs and monitors&lt;/a&gt;. If a 70-inch isn’t the right size for you, Best Buy has discounts on the MQ7’s other sizes as well — including a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgd36a5D2CN" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch for $499.99&lt;/a&gt; ($200 off), a jumbo &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgd382wHvEJ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;75-inch for $999.99&lt;/a&gt; ($300 off), and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="aRInKO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Vizio’s profit on ads, subscriptions, and data is double the money it makes selling TVs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22773073/vizio-acr-advertising-inscape-data-privacy-q3-2021"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="bDwLEA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10929142"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yiioWq"&gt;Switching gears to smaller screens — much smaller screens — the Lenovo Chromebook Duet is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our pick for the best budget Chromebook&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s down to one of its lowest prices of all time. For just &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgd4maosrTB" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$219 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, the Chromebook Duet is an incredible value for a very capable device. When it was reviewed at its regular $299 price point, it already felt like a steal for everything it is capable of, so saving $80 makes it all the more sweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6gKjMg"&gt;It features a 10.1-inch screen with a convenient 2-in-1 design for a whole lot of versatility and mobility thanks to its keyboard case and kickstand, all of which are included in the purchase. Part tablet, part mini laptop, the Duet is a great device for kids to get work done or huddle around and binge a little Netflix at home or on the go. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tohMwF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10894753"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hd68B8"&gt;When you’re getting work done or studying, it’s nice to have some musical accompaniment to help you focus and fill the air with the sound of something other than keyboard clacks. Amazon has a special promotion sale right now, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b/?node=21390537011" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offering its Echo Dot smart speaker for just $0.99 when you subscribe to one month of Amazon Music Unlimited&lt;/a&gt;. Its Amazon Music service costs $9.99 per month for an individual plan or $7.99 if you subscribe to Amazon Prime. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0873B5ZVQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;So you can pay $10.98 (or $8.98 with Prime)&lt;/a&gt; and get one month of Amazon Music, plus a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot/dp/B07FZ8S74R?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;third-gen Echo Dot that right now costs $19.99&lt;/a&gt; on its own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EtXgPZ"&gt;This promotion is limited to new subscribers of Amazon Music Unlimited and first-time Echo device owners, and the subscription is set to auto-renew after an introductory month. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review of the third-gen Echo Dot here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="xcPzP8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon Music launches its first true podcasts feature: synced transcripts","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22752750/amazon-music-podcast-transcripts-synchronized"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="ufJ9ZL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10929199"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ryoheK"&gt;Speaking of subscription services, we have an exclusive deal for you on one of the most popular subscriptions in the world of video games. &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeDeals121721&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Eneba has one year of PlayStation Plus for just $34.75&lt;/a&gt; when you use code &lt;strong&gt;VERGE365DEC&lt;/strong&gt;. The same one-year subscription normally costs $59.99, so this deal saves you $25.24 and brings it down to about $2.90 per month. You don’t have to be a new subscriber to PlayStation Plus to take advantage of this deal, though it is limited to USA accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Mwesr7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sony’s ‘Spartacus’ could be PlayStation’s answer to Xbox Game Pass","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22816087/sony-playstation-5-game-subscription-service-xbox-games-pass-now-spartacus"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="i0qKsj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10929247"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u7uZXi"&gt;For the Xbox owners looking for a good deal, we haven’t forgotten about you. If you have been lusting over a customizable controller like Microsoft’s Elite Series II but are a little unsure of spending upwards of $140, the PowerA Fusion Pro is an inexpensive way to test the waters a bit. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgd5bYEnkRF" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is selling the wired Xbox version of the Fusion Pro for just $29.99&lt;/a&gt;, discounted $50 from its usual $79.99 selling price. This controller comes with swappable thumbsticks, anti-friction rings for less stick drag, and mappable back paddle buttons. Paddles are an excellent way to get an edge in competitive games, allowing you to execute moves in FPS games that normally require you to take your thumb off the stick for a brief moment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kc62vL"&gt;Since advanced buttons like paddles may not be for everyone, the PowerA Fusion Pro allows you to test the waters of an advanced controller without breaking the bank. For Nintendo fans, the wireless Switch version of the Fusion Pro — which is similar to the wired Xbox pad but with Bluetooth — is also discounted. That model is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgd5ogTMEbo" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;down to $79.99 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; from its usual $99.99. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22608203/powera-fusion-pro-customizable-analog-sticks-paddles-nintendo-switch-controller-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review of the wireless FusionPro for the Switch here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="P8T1na"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10929275"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ajFKZd"&gt;Some further deals to peruse further&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="phYZm5"&gt;Sony’s popular WH-1000XM4 noise-canceling Bluetooth headphones are once again down to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0863TXGM3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$248 on Amazon&lt;/a&gt; ($101.99 off). These are still one of the best pairs of headphones money can buy, and at their best price. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xcnHd4"&gt;If you’re in the market for an Intel-based Mac, the best deal around today is on the 2020 model of the 21.5-inch iMac with Core i5 CPU, 256GB SSD, and 8GB of RAM. It’s just &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08F92GZG7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$799 on Amazon&lt;/a&gt; ($300 off). We recommend springing for the newer M1 iMac, but you can’t deny that’s a very good price for a home computer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8cX65V"&gt;If you or a loved one watch a lot of Twitch streams, you can get a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Twitch-Gift-Card-50/dp/B08J9D5PWY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$50 Twitch gift card for $40 today on Amazon’s deal of the day&lt;/a&gt;. The recipient can use that gift card to support and subscribe to their favorite streamers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bI3A1N"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo has a sizable discount on a DJI Mini SE kit. The DJI Mini SE drone normally costs $299 on its own, but this bundle offers extra accessories to help get you started, such as a microSD card, cleaning kit, Lowepro carrying bag, and spare battery. All together, it costs &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1675803-REG%2Fdji_mini_se_with_outdoor.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F17%2F22839973%2Fvizio-mq7-tv-lonovo-chromebook-duet-amazon-music-echo-dot-playstation-powera-sony-apple-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$354.95 on B&amp;amp;H’s daily deal&lt;/a&gt;, a savings of $150.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Clockwork Aquario brings a long-lost arcade game back to life</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NHu4gwp39Xin4W0HHa-4TBoc2Ek=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70286522/CWA_Screenshot_3.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bu4Viz"&gt;If &lt;em&gt;Clockwork Aquario&lt;/em&gt; had come out in the early ’90s, it would have cost me &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of quarters. It’s the kind of arcade game that lures you in: big sprites, bright colors, inventive worlds, a bubbly soundtrack. You see it, and you want to play it. Unfortunately, I never got the chance to experience it in an arcade because it was never actually released. But a few decades later, it’s finally available in a new format — you can now play it on both the PS4 and Nintendo Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IavSuV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clockwork Aquario&lt;/em&gt; was initially a victim of the game industry’s shift to 3D games. Development started in 1992 at Westone Bit Entertainment, a now-defunct studio best-known for the &lt;em&gt;Wonder Boy&lt;/em&gt; series. The game was completed after two years, but by that time, arcades had mostly moved on to 3D experiences and fighting games, and so it was shelved entirely. It stayed that way until retro-focused publisher Inin Games snapped up the rights and reworked it to run on modern devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="w33pCJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10929180"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q6Rn4e"&gt;As a game, &lt;em&gt;Clockwork Aquario&lt;/em&gt; is pleasingly straightforward. It’s an action-platformer where you play as one of three characters running through a futuristic world, jumping on mechanical fish and popping strange balloons with your head. You have two main actions, jump and grab, which you can use to bash enemies or throw them at each other. It’s fairly simple yet chaotic, and each of the five worlds has its own giant boss to defeat at the end, which — in the tradition of arcade games — will require some pattern memorization and quick reflexes to defeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2RYkA5"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3YbN_pnWass?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYhuk7"&gt;The most striking thing about the game, though, is how it looks. There’s some incredible pixel art on display here, with huge, expressive characters and a wide range of odd enemies. Everything is mechanical, so you’ll see robotic fish and squids floating through the air while giant clams shoot fireballs at you. I played on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review"&gt;the new OLED version of the Switch&lt;/a&gt;, and it looked incredible; there are also a lot of visual options, so you can make the game look really crisp and clean or add some scanlines for a retro effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XsBlhU"&gt;You can tweak a few things beyond the visuals. Arcade games are notoriously hard — more challenge meant more quarters spent — so &lt;em&gt;Clockwork Aquario&lt;/em&gt; offers three different difficulty options, which don’t actually change the game itself but instead offer more or less credits to get through the whole thing. There’s even a training mode where you can just mess around to get the hang of how things work. Plus, you can pause the game now, which wasn’t really an option in the days of arcade cabinets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ssY3n5"&gt;I’m not sure how long &lt;em&gt;Clockwork Aquario &lt;/em&gt;will hold my attention, but I sure am glad it exists. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21347074/nintendo-gigaleak-controversy-history-preservation-archives"&gt;Video game preservation is a complex subject&lt;/a&gt;, but with so much being lost to history, it’s nice to see a project that clearly shows love for long-forgotten source material. The various game modes make it easier to play than it would’ve been originally, and there’s a collection of original art along with the soundtrack that you can dig through after playing. This release takes something I didn’t even know existed and turns it into a piece of history that I can play.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>H&amp;R Block is suing Block, formerly Square, over its new name</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ejWGQN"&gt;Tax preparation service H&amp;amp;R Block &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrblock.com%2Ftax-center%2Fnewsroom%2Faround-block%2Fabout-us%2Ftrademark-infringement-lawsuit%2F%3Fcid%3Dsf252192484%26amp%3Bsf252192484%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F17%2F22841182%2Fsquare-block-hr-block-trademark-lawsuit-jack-dorsey" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;filed a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against Block, Inc. (formerly Square, Inc.) for trademark infringement on Thursday, CNBC &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/16/hr-block-sues-over-squares-new-name-block.html"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PIYMvH"&gt;“Today’s filing is an important effort to prevent consumer confusion and ensure a competitor cannot leverage the reputation and trust we built over more than six decades,”  said H&amp;amp;R Block president and CEO Jeff Jones in a press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g1JB7q"&gt;H&amp;amp;R Block claims that Square’s new name competes directly with Block in several areas of financial services, including a recently purchased tax service named &lt;a href="https://cash.app/taxes"&gt;Cash App Taxes&lt;/a&gt; — previously Credit Karma Tax — a $0 tax filing service similar to H&amp;amp;R Block. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2FfMBt"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We are protecting the reputation and trust we have built over 65+ years. This morning, we filed a trademark infringement lawsuit, seeking to prevent Block, Inc.—formerly Square, Inc.—from improperly using the Block name and family of trademarks. &lt;a href="https://t.co/6mF55e32GR"&gt;https://t.co/6mF55e32GR&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/L0bRGp2tyk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/L0bRGp2tyk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— H&amp;amp;R Block News (@HRBlockNews) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HRBlockNews/status/1471458878428782598?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8zS4Pc"&gt;H&amp;amp;R Block said that the company experienced numerous indications that consumers are drawing a link between the companies due to their names being similar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1m4pDQ"&gt;Block, Inc., co-founded by Jack Dorsey, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22812752/square-changing-name-block-jack-dorsey-cash-app-tidal-crypto-spiral"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the company’s name change on December 1st, saying it “acknowledges the company’s growth.” The company cited numerous inspirations for the name change in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Square/status/1466158911413760004?s=20"&gt;Twitter post&lt;/a&gt; following the announcement, saying that the name represents the neighborhood blocks where the company finds its sellers, a blockchain, block parties full of music, obstacles, and more. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="RaRYTM"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories. On the final Vergecast of 2021, Nilay and Dieter invite &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; managing editor Alex Cranz and senior space reporter Loren Grush to the show to cover the last bits of news before the holiday break. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9cDmYt"&gt;Next week on Christmas Eve, we will see the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722559/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-arrives-kourou-french-guiana-launch"&gt;James Webb Space Telescope&lt;/a&gt; — successor to NASA’s famed Hubble telescope — finally launch into space. Loren explains what the JWST will be used for, how the telescope will launch, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22663027/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-launch-date"&gt;the complications with its launch&lt;/a&gt; along the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qAVg7d"&gt;In the second half of the show, Nilay, Dieter, and Alex go through all the gadgets and software updates announced this past week — from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22834645/sony-glass-sound-speaker-lspxs3-review"&gt;a Sony speaker that looks like a bong&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22837149/oppo-find-n-hands-on-announcement-specs-price"&gt;latest phones that fold in half&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google reportedly under investigation for how it treats Black female workers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Epj5Q0OE89KtNR5QR6Y0E7w5Y_0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70286219/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oOWJzZ"&gt;The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) is looking into how Google treats its Black female employees, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/exclusive-california-probes-googles-treatment-black-female-workers-2021-12-17/"&gt;according to a report by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The report says that the regulator has been asking employees questions about harassment and discrimination, after receiving formal complaints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aJ3Fub"&gt;The report doesn’t make any mention of the DFEH bringing charges against Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;as it did with Activision Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; and says that the interviews being conducted don’t necessarily mean that Google could face charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JnxmW2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Black women made up 1.8 percent of Google’s workforce in 2021&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Uw0bFE"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560628/google-diversity-report-departures-black-women"&gt;a diversity report Google released earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, Black women make up around 1.8 percent of its workforce and departed the company at a higher than normal rate. In the report, the company said it had “room for improvement” when it came to keeping underrepresented talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0M2DmA"&gt;We’ve heard about issues relating to equity from former employees. Earlier this year, a lawsuit brought against Google by four former female employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22457421/lawsuit-former-google-women-class-action-gender-bias-pay-disparity"&gt;was given class-action status&lt;/a&gt;, with the women claiming that they received lower bonuses and salaries than male counterparts. The company also made headlines after AI ethicist Timnit Gebru &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150355/google-fires-timnit-gebru-facial-recognition-ai-ethicist"&gt;claimed she was retaliated against and fired&lt;/a&gt; for asking the company to be more transparent with its paper publishing process. (Gebru says she faced pushback from the company about her work criticizing its language models.) Another female member of Google’s AI ethics team &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22292011/google-second-ethical-ai-researcher-fired"&gt;was also fired&lt;/a&gt; after she says she searched her email for evidence of Gebru facing discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="bVjCus"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Timnit Gebru was fired from Google — then the harassers arrived","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22309962/timnit-gebru-google-harassment-campaign-jeff-dean"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="OgWI1l"&gt;In an emailed statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Google spokesperson Shannon Newberry said that the company has invested in retention programs to make Google a more welcoming place for Black employees. You can read the full statement below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="dMWMle"&gt;Our goal is to ensure that every employee experiences Google as an inclusive workplace and we’ve been focused on building sustainable equity for Google’s Black community. For example, 2020 was our largest year ever for hiring Black+ Googlers in the U.S.—both overall and in tech roles—and we’ve also made investments in our retention programs and practices to help Black employees grow and thrive at Google. We’ll continue to focus on this important work and thoroughly investigate any concerns, to make sure our workplace is representative and equitable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="nfBU5y"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 17th, 1:35PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statement from Google.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Horseshoe crabs are in danger because everyone wants their blood </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dis1QT_SK7-LoMVSA34PdjTIHeQ=/81x0:1191x740/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70286162/Horseshoe_Crabs_Fadek_059_e1554413653315.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Horseshoe crabs are bled at the Charles River Laboratory in South Carolina. | Timothy Fadek&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mfLf3M"&gt;Conservationists fear that horseshoe crabs, a 450-million-year-old living fossil, will be pushed to the brink of extinction because of the value of their blood to the pharmaceutical industry. Horseshoe crab blood provides a natural source of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/limulus-lysate-test"&gt;limulus amebocyte lysate&lt;/a&gt; (LAL) which is used to test vaccines, drugs, and medical devices to ensure that they aren’t contaminated with dangerous bacterial toxins called endotoxins. With hundreds of thousands of horseshoe crabs captured and bled of their milky-blue blood each year, conservation groups are now stepping up their advocacy efforts and taking legal action to help save horseshoe crabs and the other species that rely on them.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K16qe2"&gt;Fortunately, there’s already an alternative to horseshoe crab blood: in the late 1990s, biologists at the University of Singapore created a synthetic version of the LAL called &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28733334/"&gt;recombinant Factor C&lt;/a&gt; (rFC). Multiple &lt;a href="https://www.future-science.com/doi/pdf/10.2144/btn-2020-0165"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; show that rFC is just as effective as horseshoe crab-derived LAL, and it is currently commercially available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EF4eCt"&gt;Some 60 countries have approved rFC for use, including the EU countries and China. But in the US, conservationists were dealt a setback last year when Maryland-based US Pharmacopeia (USP), an organization that sets guidelines for the pharmaceutical industry, &lt;a href="https://www.uspnf.com/notices/bacterial-endotoxin-test-gen-announcement-20200529"&gt;decided&lt;/a&gt; it needed to see more data before it would put rFC on equal footing with LAL. Companies can still opt to use rFC as a substitute for LAL (Eli Lilly already does) — but only if they go through additional bureaucratic processes first. Many environmentalists see the lack of approval by USP as short-sighted and unwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kzDLDU"&gt;“We’re going to live in a world where we have more and more pathogens and the trend is for more pharmaceuticals requiring endotoxin testing,” says Ryan Phelan, executive director and co-founder of the environmental nonprofit &lt;a href="http://reviverestore.org/"&gt;Revive &amp;amp; Restore&lt;/a&gt;. “At some point, that’s going to put pressure on the supply of a non-sustainable product. Why would you not ensure your supply line?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x3rjKc"&gt;The global pharmaceutical and medical industry uses LAL to make sure that vaccines and a wide variety of medical devices and products are free from &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/inspection-technical-guides/bacterial-endotoxinspyrogens"&gt;endotoxin contamination&lt;/a&gt;, which can cause fever, anaphylactic shock, and diseases like the bubonic plague. During testing, LAL clots around endotoxins, flagging their presence and quantifying the level of contamination. High demand for the compound can cause a quart of LAL to sell for $15,000 or more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ahnjAY"&gt;As a result, the business of bleeding horseshoe crabs is thriving. Today, American biomedical companies capture some &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2006607"&gt;500,000&lt;/a&gt; horseshoe crabs a year, a practice overseen by the &lt;a href="http://www.asmfc.org/"&gt;Atlantic State Marine Fisheries Commission&lt;/a&gt;. But there are few laws or regulations in place to protect or limit the take of horseshoe crabs. And although the horseshoe crabs are eventually returned to the sea, conservation groups estimate that up to &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2006607#sec002"&gt;30 percent&lt;/a&gt; of them die in the process. Due to pressure from the biomedical industry, along with habitat loss and the harvest of horseshoe crabs by commercial fishermen to use as bait, populations both in the US and worldwide have plummeted in recent decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HExETd"&gt;In the Delaware Bay, home to the largest population in the US, horseshoe crab numbers have declined from &lt;a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a67c452bff2004b42a313d9/t/5e3e0869c0b9914844db6a6a/1581123692672/1990+HSC+Survey+Report.pdf"&gt;1.24 million&lt;/a&gt; in 1990 to less than &lt;a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a67c452bff2004b42a313d9/t/5e3e07c5f875f52b5637a9b6/1581123528301/2002+HSC+Survey+Report.pdf"&gt;334,000&lt;/a&gt; in 2002. Although the population appears to have stabilized, conservationists worry that increased demand for American horseshoe crab blood by the pharmaceutical industry could force it to go the way of the Asian horseshoe crab, &lt;em&gt;Tachypleus tridentatus&lt;/em&gt;, which is rapidly disappearing in China and which the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists as &lt;a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/21309/149768986"&gt;endangered&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, the American horseshoe crab is listed as a &lt;a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/11987/80159830"&gt;vulnerable&lt;/a&gt; species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dDjhYc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They’re actually one of the most valuable marine species on the East Coast.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M80j59"&gt;Relying on horseshoe crabs for pharmaceuticals has knock-on effects to other species. As part of the bleeding process, &lt;a href="https://www.criver.com/"&gt;Charles River Laboratories&lt;/a&gt;, one of the primary producers of LAL, sequesters crabs in holding pens away from the beach from May to June — the season when they lay eggs. During that window, a female horseshoe crab can lay as many as 80,000 eggs. &lt;a href="https://defenders.org/blog/2021/11/work-remains-safeguard-south-carolinas-horseshoe-crabs"&gt;Environmentalists&lt;/a&gt; contend that removing horseshoe crabs from the beach decreases the availability of horseshoe crab eggs as a food source for shorebirds such as the migratory red knot. The population of red knots, a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, has &lt;a href="https://www.nrdc.org/experts/elly-pepper/red-knot-listed-threatened-under-endangered-species-act"&gt;dropped&lt;/a&gt; 80 percent in recent decades. Conservationists maintain that this decline is linked to a diminished supply of horseshoe crab eggs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UodH4g"&gt;As a result of this linkage, the environmental nonprofits &lt;a href="https://defenders.org/"&gt;Defenders of Wildlife&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.coastalconservationleague.org/"&gt;Coastal Conservation League&lt;/a&gt; recently &lt;a href="https://www.southernenvironment.org/press-release/state-sanctioned-horseshoe-crab-confinement-threatens-shorebirds/"&gt;notified&lt;/a&gt; the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources and Charles River Laboratories of their intent to sue both entities for alleged violations of the Endangered Species Act. The lawsuit seeks to protect the red knot’s food source and habitat by asking the state to end Charles River Labs’ practice of penning horseshoe crabs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A7Qx8P"&gt;“The ponds maintained by agents of Charles River Labs further imperil the existence of red knots, a species whose fate already hangs in the balance,” Lindsay Dubin, staff attorney for Defenders of Wildlife, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GtEmlg"&gt;South Carolina’s Department of Natural Resources declined to comment on the lawsuit. Charles River Labs declined to provide specific responses about their horseshoe crab penning practices or its effect on red knot populations. Sam Jorgensen, a spokesperson for Charles River Labs, wrote in an email statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company doesn’t see merit in the lawsuit and that it has taken strides to “protect and preserve a healthy and growing horseshoe crab population,” including by supporting an effort to ban the use of horseshoe crabs as fishing bait in eel and whelk fisheries. Jorgensen also noted that horseshoe crabs play a “vital role” in the healthcare system and that synthetic alternatives to LAL are “not readily available” or FDA-approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QWxKJ4"&gt;But despite the bureaucratic obstacles that currently stand in the way of widespread adoption of rFC in the US, advocates continue to urgently press for a switch away from a reliance on horseshoe crab blood. In addition to being more humane, rFC is lab-produced, so companies don’t have to worry about variance in the size of individual crabs or changes in their population, factors that can affect the production of LAL. If demand increases, manufacturers could produce more rFC at scale, which could lower the cost of production and make it less expensive. Critics of rFC like Charles River Laboratories — which, notably, stands to lose business if rFC becomes more widely used —&lt;a href="https://www.criver.com/eureka/recombinant-factor-c-under-the-microscope"&gt; maintain&lt;/a&gt; that rFC needs further study and testing to prove that it is completely safe and fully establish its efficacy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="umNd2m"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s a win-win for any pharmaceutical company that adopts this technology.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YIZ8vY"&gt;The debate is particularly critical today; the COVID-19 pandemic has fueled a huge surge of &lt;a href="https://www.bio.org/policy/human-health/vaccines-biodefense/coronavirus/pipeline-tracker"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; into vaccines and potential COVID-19 treatments which rely on the use of LAL to ensure product safety. As demand for vaccines and other medical products increases, conservationists worry that without a rapid switch to rFC, strain on the American horseshoe crab and the other creatures that rely on them will only get worse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EvX57N"&gt;Larry Niles, a wildlife biologist and expert on the environmental issues of the Delaware Bay, says there is an inherent contradiction in the way state and federal agencies view horseshoe crabs. Horseshoe crabs are not a protected species and therefore they don’t see them as valuable, he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0QCjsO"&gt;“Yet they acknowledge that there’s a $500 billion industry for their blood, so they’re not worthless,” Niles says. “They’re actually one of the most valuable marine species on the East Coast.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Re6UNd"&gt;It remains to be seen if lawsuits and increasing pressure from the public and environmental groups will force state and federal agencies to more rigorously regulate and protect horseshoe crabs or promote the adoption of rFC. However, Phelan hopes eventually labs and other pharmaceutical industry players will recognize the benefits of rFC, both in terms of cost and reliability. Adopting rFC will benefit companies as well as horseshoe crabs, she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="feGXbQ"&gt;“It’s a win-win for any pharmaceutical company that adopts this technology because they are going to have better quality control, better scientific output,” Phelan says. “Also, their employees, their stakeholders, or shareholders will feel better since they’re doing the right thing for the ecosystem.”&lt;/p&gt;
