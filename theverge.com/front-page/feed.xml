    <title>Fortnite is getting updated visuals on PC alongside season 7 launch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nK-kP7kvT-VdRM5iAuBW6S6c2T8=/360x0:3164x1869/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69384484/Fortnite_20210329165502.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jUrL7W"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is getting a visual boost on PC very soon. As part of the upcoming Chapter 2: Season 7, which will launch on June 8th, the PC version of the game is getting a new “epic” graphical setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MquaUq"&gt;Epic says it will include “new and enhanced effects plus improved post-processing features and shadow quality.” Among other changes, it sounds like many of the great visual enhancements that came to the PS5 and Xbox Series X versions of the game are coming to PC, including “more advanced explosion effects.” In other words, after you update, try to find a rocket launcher to play with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="od2sAL"&gt;As part of the update, the system requirements for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; are now getting a tweak. Basically, there are now three ranges: epic, recommended, and minimum. Here’s what you’ll need:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tf0Q1V"&gt;Epic specs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="4QPD1X"&gt;Nvidia GTX 1080, AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT, or equivalent GPU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iWPGZ6"&gt;4GB VRAM or higher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BbYAuY"&gt;Intel Core i7-8700, AMD Ryzen 7 3700x, or equivalent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5z9l7T"&gt;16GB RAM or higher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0gJeoD"&gt;NVMe solid state drive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SYmZLo"&gt;Windows 10 64-bit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="VuQqyu"&gt;Recommended specs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="MShfLo"&gt;Nvidia GTX 960, AMD R9 280, or equivalent DX11 GPU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YKGSLk"&gt;2GB VRAM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ea82aU"&gt;Core i5-7300U 3.5GHz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="C1QDqM"&gt;8GB RAM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ouJFCX"&gt;Windows 10 64-bit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kMzWdq"&gt;Minimum specs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="07pyiz"&gt;Intel HD 4000 on PC; Intel Iris Pro 5200&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AJVNwC"&gt;Core i3-3225 3.3GHz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="43QDA4"&gt;4GB RAM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4nnLUk"&gt;Windows 7 / 8 / 10 64-bit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="EsBnxf"&gt;Season 7 kicks off on June 8th — and it looks like it’ll add &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465577/fortnite-epic-games-ufos-aliens-abducted-teaser-season-7"&gt;an extraterrestrial element&lt;/a&gt; to the game.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Twitter Blue subscription service starts rolling out Thursday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nDVAkQZ_5CYffgKx7MUUZzOutSg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69383695/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ECmy4P"&gt;Twitter has officially announced Twitter Blue, a paid subscription service that offers access to new features like undoing tweets and viewing threads in an easier to digest “Reader Mode.” Starting Thursday, it will roll out first in Canada and Australia, where the subscription will cost $3.49 CAD or $4.49 AUD per month, respectively. We already had a good idea of what features to expect from Twitter Blue thanks to sleuthing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/15/22437690/twitter-blue-subscription-service-299-undo-tweets"&gt;from app researcher Jane Manchun Wong&lt;/a&gt;, but now Twitter has detailed everything the service includes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2eINro"&gt;A new undo send feature gives you the option of retracting your tweets before they actually go live, and you can set a timer for undoing your tweets that can last up to 30 seconds. A Bookmark Folders feature lets you group saved tweets to make them easier to find later. “Reader Mode” lets you keep up with threads by “turning them into easy-to-read text” and mashing together tweets into one page. Other Twitter Blue features are purely aesthetic: it adds new color theme options as well as the ability to change the color of Twitter’s app icon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jIFPnK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10529553"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0DJsli"&gt;Twitter Blue subscribers will also get access to “dedicated subscription customer support,” the company says. This means that Twitter Blue users will get an expedited timeframe for resolving issues, Twitter tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;The expedited timeframe applies to any type of &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/forms"&gt;support ticket&lt;/a&gt; that you might file, which means you’ll get faster support both for account-related problems as well as if you’re reporting someone for harassment. Abuse and harassment continue to be an issue for Twitter, and paid prioritization for support could cause some controversy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FQK4It"&gt;Twitter says it’s launching Twitter Blue first in Australia and Canada “to gain a deeper understanding of what will make your Twitter experience more customized, more expressive, and generally speaking more [fire emoji].” The company didn’t have a timeline to share for when Twitter Blue might expand to other regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lc1ECQ"&gt;Offering a paid subscription service is a significant change to Twitter’s business model that the company has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/23/15043422/twitter-subscription-service-tweetdeck-survey"&gt;considering for some time&lt;/a&gt;. Previously, the company has relied mainly on advertising for its revenue, but intense competition from Facebook and Snapchat’s ad businesses, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/3/10/21171477/jack-dorsey-elliott-silver-lake-deal-ceo-twitter-take-private"&gt;pressure from activist investors&lt;/a&gt; has pushed it to explore new sources of revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vPKaQU"&gt;In early May, Twitter began testing a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423583/twitter-tip-jar-feature-sending-money-venmo-cashapp"&gt;Tip Jar service&lt;/a&gt; that lets users send one-off payments to their favorite accounts. A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301375/twitter-super-follows-communities-paid-followers"&gt;Super Follows feature&lt;/a&gt;, announced in February, will eventually let users charge subscriptions for things like bonus tweets, community groups, or newsletters. (Newsletters were made possible after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250156/twitter-revue-newsletter-acquisition-email-service"&gt;Twitter acquired newsletter service Revue&lt;/a&gt; at the beginning of the year.) Twitter has not yet announced when its Super Follows feature will launch. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia’s RTX 3080 Ti is available online right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l6hRb8txFV_KSYCjKWXIt3tanBI=/13x0:2040x1351/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69382152/twarren_20210601_4611_0009.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZAmB8N"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22463608/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-ti-review-test-benchmarks"&gt;Nvidia TX 3080 Ti&lt;/a&gt; is here, at least for those lucky enough to find one. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22461660/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-ti-specs-price-release-date-features"&gt;Announced earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; alongside the forthcoming RTX 3070 Ti, the 3080 Ti serves as the pricier successor to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21435926/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-review"&gt;GeForce RTX 3080&lt;/a&gt;, an excellent graphics card that made 4K gaming that much more affordable and exemplified just how transformative DLSS technology could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AbE3b0"&gt;Like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/1/21417048/nvidia-rtx-3090-gpu-flagship-8k-pc-gaming-price-specs"&gt;RTX 3090&lt;/a&gt;, Nvidia’s newest flagship touts impressive 1440p and 4K performance, albeit in a smaller, quieter package with half the VRAM. It certainly isn’t cheap at $1,200, but given the ongoing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385261/nvidia-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-warning-comments-2021"&gt;semiconductor shortage&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;outlandish street prices&lt;/a&gt; of most GPUs right now, the RTX 3080 Ti might be more affordable at MSRP than if you were to succumb to the resale market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sAXA33"&gt;While we expect availability to be limited at launch and throughout the remainder of the year, several retailers currently have the RTX 3080 Ti in stock. Best Buy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465116/best-buy-stores-nvidia-rtx-3080-ti-founders-edition-thursday-line-up"&gt;announced yesterday&lt;/a&gt; that it would give customers a chance to purchase a Founder’s Edition of the card at &lt;a href="https://corporate.bestbuy.com/what-to-know-about-nvidias-geforce-rtx-3080-ti-founders-edition-graphics-card/"&gt;select stores&lt;/a&gt; today, however, unlike previous years, Best Buy will only offer the GPU in-store. Customers who are hoping to pick it up at launch will need to line up early and secure a ticket at 7:30AM local time before it officially goes on sale at 9:00AM local time. If you’re reading this now, chances are good that you’re already too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="FrcW3u"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nvidia is nerfing new RTX 3080 and 3070 cards for Ethereum cryptocurrency mining ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441847/nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-ethereum-mining-drivers-limit-cryptocurrency"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ctbNK4"&gt;Heading to your local Micro Center might be your only other viable option, if you’re hoping to get one in-store. That retailer &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/search/search_results.aspx?Ntt=GeForce+RTX+3080+Ti"&gt;lists five RTX 3080 Ti models on its site&lt;/a&gt; from Gigabyte, Asus, EVGA, and MSI. If you’re looking to purchase the RTX 3080 Ti online, your options are limited. The cards will go on sale at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fsearch%3FNtt%3Drtx%25203080%2520ti%26N%3D0%26InitialSearch%3Dyes%26sts%3Dma&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F3%2F22465644%2Fnvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-ti-stock-gpu-availability-where-to-buy-graphics-card" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fpromotions%2Fnvidia%2F21-1195%2Findex.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/search/search_results.aspx?Ntt=GeForce+RTX+3080+Ti"&gt;Micro Center&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=RTX+3080+Ti"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, however, we expect stock to sell out fast. You might have luck getting one online through &lt;a href="https://us-store.msi.com/index.php?route=product/category&amp;amp;path=75_76_246&amp;amp;page=2"&gt;MSI&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.pny.com/consumer/shop-pny"&gt;PNY&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://us.zotacstore.com/us/"&gt;Zotac&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.evga.com/products/ProductList.aspx?type=0&amp;amp;family=GeForce+30+Series+Family&amp;amp;chipset=RTX+3080+Ti"&gt;EVGA&lt;/a&gt;’s site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CkAEyr"&gt;Here are some of the specific models available at the online retailers above (we’ll add more individual listings as they go live at other sites):&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Halo will use your smartphone camera to assess your ‘Movement Health’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Amazon’s new Movement Health feature in Halo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ir_NOvHL-9Jwwrw7p2I8aO7Mezk=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69382068/amazon_halo_movement.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Amazon’s new Movement Health feature in Halo | Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fLivFM"&gt;Soon, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402493/amazon-halo-band-health-fitness-body-scan-tone-emotion-activity-sleep"&gt;Amazon’s Halo fitness service&lt;/a&gt; will offer to use your smartphone’s camera and some cloud-based AI to create a scan of your “Movement Health.” After a five- to 10-minute session where you put yourself into different poses for the camera, Amazon’s servers will analyze the video and use it to create a customized workout routine to improve your “stability, mobility, and posture.” The service is expected to launch “in the coming weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jj9o0W"&gt;As with Halo’s body fat scan, Amazon says that the video it records for Movement Health is sent to its cloud servers, analyzed &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; by its algorithms (and not humans), and is then promptly deleted both from the cloud and from your phone. The videos are encrypted in transit and when they’re (briefly) at rest in Amazon’s cloud. The Halo fitness band isn’t used in any particular way during the scan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="faynR6"&gt;After the scan, you’ll get a readout like the image you see above, which breaks down the mobility of your body in terms of percentages — presumably percentages of the ideal range of movement. Njenga Kariuki, senior technical product manager for Amazon Halo, says that its machine learning algorithms were created with a diverse set of bodies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="UJObyb"&gt;We take a responsibility to ensure that our algorithms deliver comparable performance across demographics and body types and we extensively test different dimensions across things like body types, different ethnicity groups, a number of different demographic dimensions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="DG4F2Z"&gt;However, the result of that training is an algorithm that applies the same assessments to all users, regardless of body type or level of mobility. “The limitations we look at during the assessment are consistent across all customers,” Kariuki says. Kariuki also claims that the new tool “delivers comparable accuracy to an in-person assessment with a professional trainer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f278Gj"&gt;Amazon uses those percentages to create a “personalized program of corrective exercise videos” that are designed to improve your mobility. The company says that Halo will offer each user about five to 10 videos that will range from simple stretches to full workouts specific to their needs. So while it’s nowhere near as ambitious as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22299628/apple-fitness-plus-review-price-classes-features"&gt;Apple Fitness Plus&lt;/a&gt; (or even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22215172/samsung-neo-qled-4k-8k-tv-announced-specs-ces-2021"&gt;Samsung’s Smart Trainer&lt;/a&gt; feature), it’s not designed to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ve3u7m"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402493/amazon-halo-band-health-fitness-body-scan-tone-emotion-activity-sleep"&gt;Halo launched last August&lt;/a&gt; as a combination of a $99.99 fitness band and a $3.99 / month health subscription service. It was (and is) an obvious example of Amazon’s willingness to push the envelope of what kinds of metrics people might want from their quantified self gadgets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yoeGLY"&gt;It offers a body fat scan that works very much like the Movement Health scan. The Halo Band can do all the typical health tracking things you’d expect from a fitness tracker (like sleep and activity), but you also have the option to leave the microphone on so it can give you its take on your tone of voice throughout the day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s9L9IZ"&gt;Movement Health doesn’t feel quite as invasive as those assessments, but whether it’s a useful enough feature to drive users to Amazon Halo remains to be seen. Apple Fitness Plus recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385653/apple-fitness-plus-new-workouts-pregnant-beginner-older-users-jane-fonda"&gt;began offering videos specifically designed&lt;/a&gt; for beginners as well as “workouts tailored for both pregnant and elderly users.” Amazon’s new offering for Halo might be a part of a larger trend of providing more approachable fitness content for people who don’t aspire to have a daily workout routine. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is making it harder for Android apps to track you once you’ve opted out</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xtVuAo"&gt;It’s going to get harder for Android apps to track users who’ve opted out of receiving personalized ads, the &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ff67e5a6-ca3e-42d2-98b8-01e656a6d396?sharetype=blocked"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, after Google announced changes to how it’ll handle the unique device identifiers that allow marketers to track them between apps. Starting later this year, Google is cutting off access to these “Advertising IDs” after a user opts out, and will show developers a “string of zeros” in its place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xrhpy4"&gt;The news was announced in an email to Play Store developers, and Google has also updated its &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6048248"&gt;support page for Advertising IDs&lt;/a&gt; with the announcement. Google told developers the changes will “provide users with more control over their data, and help bolster security and privacy,” the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iFwE6I"&gt;The change comes a few short months after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;Apple overhauled how advertising IDs work&lt;/a&gt; on iOS in an apparent attempt to compete with the new policy. Recently, Google also announced that it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422894/google-play-app-privacy-info-apple-app-store-labels"&gt;adding privacy info to its Play Store listings&lt;/a&gt;, mirroring a similar feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174017/apple-app-store-new-privacy-labels-ios-apps-public"&gt;Apple added to its App Store&lt;/a&gt; last year, and is also limiting which apps &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364632/google-play-store-apps-see-other-installed-may-5-query-all-packages"&gt;can see what you have installed&lt;/a&gt; on your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="plpq1Q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The changes will start rolling out later this year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZmATO"&gt;Users have long been able to opt out of personalized ads on Android (you can do so by heading into the Settings app, going into the Google menu, and selecting “Ads”), but it seems this doesn’t currently stop developers from being able to access your device’s advertising ID entirely. &lt;a href="https://www.adexchanger.com/mobile/google-tightens-limit-ad-tracking-policies-for-android-ad-id/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AdExchanger &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that apps have previously been able to use the identifier for non-advertising purposes like analytics and fraud prevention, and Google’s support page says it will announce an “alternate solution” for these use cases next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uUVXol"&gt;Google’s support page says that the rollout of the new policy will happen in phases. Android 12 devices will start seeing the change in “late 2021,” before it rolls out to all devices with Google Play early next year. &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-play-services-delete-ad-id-opt-out-personalization/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that Google Play Services will also notify existing apps with access to your advertising ID and related data, so that this can be deleted where appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CzhOlh"&gt;Although Google’s announcement follows hot on the heels of Apple’s own ad tracking changes, it’s not yet clear how similar the two approaches will be. Google’s support page still refers to the decision to stop ad tracking as an “opt out” process, while Apple’s changes effectively make tracking an opt-in decision. But regardless of how Google eventually handles the process, it’s another potentially huge shake-up for the digital advertising industry.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch Netflix’s Geeked Week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w5GgkC-Vd3dPmTAPx1IYQhDPOec=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69381785/LUCIFER_403_Unit_00191R.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QRZwVA"&gt;Netflix is holding &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22448313/netflix-geeked-week-event-the-witcher-sandman-cuphead-resident-evil"&gt;its first “Geeked” virtual event&lt;/a&gt; starting on June 7th, an entire week dedicated to genre stories across film and TV. That means sci-fi and fantasy, and shows based on comic books and video games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ZabuE"&gt;The company says that more than 50 projects will be featured, including big names like &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Sandman&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Lucifer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417254/league-of-legends-animated-series-arcane-netflix"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; animated series&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;em&gt;The Cuphead Show&lt;/em&gt;, and more. In addition to big announcements and trailers, the event will also include “first looks, behind-the-scenes footage, cast interviews, celebrity games, script table reads, live performances, and much more,” according to Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9YMT7"&gt;It’s a lot to spread across five days. Here’s how you can keep up with everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Z6PNMH"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UTi1pLgi1vY?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="5RV0um"&gt;What time is Netflix’s Geeked Week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Su4im6"&gt;The event takes place from June 7th to the 11th, and Netflix says that things will kick off at  9AM PT / 12PM ET. The company will also be posting daily recaps at 10AM PT / 1PM ET, suggesting that things will last around an hour each day. There isn’t an exact schedule, but Netflix says that “each day will be broadly themed to different genres: film, comic books, fantasy, anime / animation, and gaming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="pJMbUQ"&gt;Where can I watch the event?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="lLn9Wa"&gt;If you want to watch everything, it seems like it’ll be hard to miss, as Netflix will be utilizing just about every video platform imaginable. That means you can watch and follow the daily events on &lt;a href="http://youtube.com/netflix"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/netflixgeeked"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitch.tv/netflix"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://facebook.com/netflixgeeked"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://tiktok.com/@netflixgeeked"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;. And be sure to stay tuned to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; for coverage of the biggest announcements.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft looks ready to launch Windows 11</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JgA2sVO8AEXsyUZESl5LYCXnWzA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69381801/RWF5uB.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wSNjTr"&gt;Microsoft has been teasing a “next generation” of Windows for months now, but new hints suggest the company isn’t just preparing an update to its existing Windows 10 software, but a new, numbered version of the operating system: Windows 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MNZDDn"&gt;The software giant &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465126/microsoft-windows-event-june-24th"&gt;announced a new Windows event for June 24th&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, promising to show “what’s next for Windows.” The event invite included an image of what looks like a new Windows logo, with light shining through the window in only two vertical bars, creating an outline that looks very much like the number 11. Microsoft followed up with an animated version of this image, making it clear the company intentionally ignored the horizontal bars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="23AbkU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Join us June 24th at 11 am ET for the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MicrosoftEvent?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MicrosoftEvent&lt;/a&gt; to see what’s next. &lt;a href="https://t.co/kSQYIDZSyi"&gt;https://t.co/kSQYIDZSyi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Emb5GPHOf0"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Emb5GPHOf0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Windows (@Windows) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Windows/status/1400125115765907458?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IimQvJ"&gt;Microsoft’s Windows event also starts at 11AM ET, not the usual start time for typical Windows and Surface events. Following the event invite, Microsoft exec &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/yusuf_i_mehdi/status/1400125771746746371"&gt;Yusuf Mehdi said&lt;/a&gt; he hasn’t “been this excited for a new version of Windows since Windows 95!” It’s the first time we’ve heard Microsoft specifically mention a “new version” of Windows is on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83VbqA"&gt;The event invite also comes just a week after Nadella &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453222/microsoft-windows-next-generation-announcement-sun-valley-build-2021-keynote"&gt;teased a “next generation of Windows” announcement&lt;/a&gt;. Nadella promised that Microsoft would soon share “one of the most significant updates to Windows of the past decade.” Microsoft’s chief product officer, Panos Panay, also teased a “next generation” of Windows earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="au4LOt"&gt;If Microsoft is truly readying to move beyond Windows 10 and towards Windows 11, we’re expecting to see big visual changes to reflect that. Microsoft has been working on something codenamed Sun Valley, which the company has referred to as a “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212817/microsoft-windows-10-visual-changes-update-sun-valley-2021"&gt;sweeping visual rejuvenation of Windows&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X_SH6v9iEEDYwVrtRSrlYFtbWGM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22495503/Windows_10_Sun_Valley_refresh.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Big UI changes are coming to Windows.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sAm7wK"&gt;A lot of these visual changes will come from the work Microsoft completed on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230554/microsoft-windows-10x-leak-chrome-os-chromebooks-hands-on"&gt;Windows 10X&lt;/a&gt;, a lightweight version of Windows intended to rival Chrome OS, before it was scrapped. That includes a new Start menu, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313037/microsoft-windows-10-new-system-icons-ui-overhaul-sun-valley"&gt;new system icons&lt;/a&gt;, File Explorer improvements, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422553/microsoft-windows-95-era-icons-removal-windows-10-update-sun-valley"&gt;end of Windows 95-era icons&lt;/a&gt; that drag Windows users back to the past in dialog boxes. Rounded corners and updates to the built-in Windows apps are also planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n8Us7C"&gt;Significant changes are also on the way for Windows beyond the user interface. Microsoft appears to be ready to address a lot of lingering problems, with fixes planned for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407995/microsoft-windows-apps-rearranging-sleep-resume-fix-directx-12"&gt;rearranging apps issue&lt;/a&gt; on multiple monitors, an upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336240/microsoft-windows-10-auto-hdr-pc-gaming-directx-11-12"&gt;Xbox Auto HDR feature&lt;/a&gt;, and improvements to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410088/microsoft-windows-10-bluetooth-aac-support-update"&gt;Bluetooth audio support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hku6Eq"&gt;Perhaps the biggest lingering issue waiting to be fixed is the Windows store. Microsoft has been working on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393655/microsoft-windows-app-store-overhaul-apps-games-rumor"&gt;new app store for Windows&lt;/a&gt; in recent months, and rumors suggest it will be a significant departure from what exists today. Nadella has promised to “unlock greater economic opportunity for developers and creators” with Windows, and the Windows store seems like the obvious way to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gFgXen"&gt;Microsoft is reportedly overhauling its Windows app store to allow developers to submit any Windows application, including browsers like Chrome or Firefox. This would significantly improve the store alone, but Microsoft might also be considering allowing third-party commerce platforms in apps. That would mean Microsoft wouldn’t take a cut from developers who use their own in-app purchase systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y11yGrzfA0LcAlNJ7zr-_Fh2pNY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22235025/10xactioncenter.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some of the changes Microsoft planned for Windows 10X are now coming to Windows.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="StQAMK"&gt;So far, Microsoft has only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409285/microsoft-store-cut-windows-pc-games-12-percent"&gt;announced a cut to 12 percent&lt;/a&gt; commission for PC games in the Windows store, but allowing developers to bypass Microsoft’s cut would be a significant change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PS37fV"&gt;Moving to Windows 11 branding would also back up Microsoft’s reinvestment in Windows. The software maker signaled a renewed interest in Windows last year, during a pandemic that has demonstrated how important the operating system is. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246561/microsoft-windows-10x-single-screens-windows-usage-demand-coronavirus-pandemic"&gt;Windows usage jumped&lt;/a&gt; as workers and students across the world turned to laptops and PCs to work from home. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/10/21319750/pc-shipments-coronavirus-pandemic-idc-gartner-q2-2020"&gt;PC shipments have also surged&lt;/a&gt; over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPLbSQ"&gt;After slicing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/29/17176220/microsoft-windows-reorg-business-terry-myerson-ai-cloud"&gt;Windows into two parts&lt;/a&gt; back in 2018, Microsoft moved parts of Windows development back under Panos Panay’s control last year. The move was a clear admission that Microsoft’s Windows split didn’t work, after months of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/30/18645609/microsofts-universal-windows-app-dead-microsoft-store-windows-store"&gt;messy development experiences&lt;/a&gt; for Windows 10, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/1/21276653/microsoft-windows-10-may-2020-update-block-known-issues-list"&gt;delayed Windows updates&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/2/20678596/windows-10-19h2-update-september-feature-update"&gt;lack of major new features&lt;/a&gt;, and lots of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/8/17951298/microsoft-windows-10-bugs-issues-report"&gt;Windows update issues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f1c0xE"&gt;Moving to Windows 11 would still be a surprise move for Microsoft, though. The company previously referred to Windows 10 as “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/7/8568473/windows-10-last-version-of-windows"&gt;the last version of Windows&lt;/a&gt;” in its big push to position the OS as a service that’s continually updated. While there are monthly updates to Windows, the more significant changes are typically delivered twice a year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Microsoft Surface Laptop" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P3VIY-kOjCaRuTO0nG0RM9V8yd4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8451737/akrales_170502_1637_0519.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new version of Windows always helps boost PC sales.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ta7qIh"&gt;Microsoft has struggled with naming these updates, though. We’ve seen the Windows 10 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/25/12269736/microsoft-windows-10-anniversary-update-features-review"&gt;Anniversary Update&lt;/a&gt;, Fall &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/17/16487760/microsoft-windows-10-fall-creators-update-features-review"&gt;Creators Update&lt;/a&gt;, and simple dates like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/11/20885221/microsoft-windows-10-october-update-release-date-download-features-how-to"&gt;November 2019 Update&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft has also adopted yet another naming scheme recently, referring to updates as 20H1 or 21H1 to signify both the release year and part of the year the update launched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x4pLi7"&gt;A move to Windows 11 wouldn’t necessarily clear up Microsoft’s update naming issues, but if the company also adopted point releases like Windows 11.1, that would certainly help both consumers and IT admins to quickly understand which version is the latest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iMGD6s"&gt;OEMs would also be happy to see a Windows 11 release. A new version of Windows always drives new hardware sales and renewed interest in the operating system. If Microsoft backs that up with a new UI and a fresh look and feel for Windows, it will be the typical playbook we’ve seen for Windows for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I42Eoc"&gt;It’s not long until we find out whether Microsoft is ready to dial the version number of Windows up to 11. The Windows elevent (as I’m now calling it) will start at 11AM ET on June 24th, and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; will be covering all the news live as it happens.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp says accounts will soon be usable across up to four devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2qcVNtiOj1khqlolLlEgV8fBDtg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69381533/acastro_210119_1777_whatsapp_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ucgf95"&gt;WhatsApp has confirmed that its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/10/21361542/whatsapp-multiple-devices-support-ipad-app-chat-sync-rumors"&gt;long-rumored multi-device support&lt;/a&gt; will be entering public beta in the coming months, allowing users to access their accounts from up to four linked devices. New “view once” and “disappearing mode” features were also officially announced. The news came in an interview &lt;a href="https://wabetainfo.com/will-cathcart-and-mark-zuckerberg-confirm-to-wabetainfo-3-features-to-come-on-whatsapp/"&gt;between &lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and WhatsApp head Will Cathcart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uw3ZLj"&gt;Cathcart stopped short of confirming reports that WhatsApp has an iPad app in development, but said that multi-device support will make WhatsApp on iPad a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o1oDl4"&gt;As well as multi-device support, Zuckerberg also confirmed that WhatsApp is adding a new “view once” feature, which will allow users to send content that disappears after it’s been viewed. The service is also expanding its disappearing messages feature, which currently allows messages to be deleted after a set period of time. In the future, a new “disappearing mode” will let you turn on disappearing messages across all chat threads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Pvw0PM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s been a big technical challenge”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nKkfMZ"&gt;Facebook’s CEO confirmed that the multi-device feature will not compromise the end-to-end encryption that WhatsApp offers for messages sent between individuals. “It’ll still be end-to-end encrypted,” Zuckerberg wrote. “It’s been a big technical challenge to get all your messages and content to sync properly across devices even when your phone battery dies, but we’ve solved this and we’re looking forward to getting it out soon!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dxNy9s"&gt;WhatsApp did not confirm when the “view once” and “disappearing mode” features are expected to launch, but Cathcart said that multi-device support will be entering public beta “in the next month or two.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PWaomi"&gt;Alongside multi-device support, &lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo &lt;/em&gt;has also reported that WhatsApp is working on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319136/whatsapp-cloud-backups-icloud-google-drive-password-encryption-security"&gt;new password-protected encrypted chat backups&lt;/a&gt; feature which could finally allow users to transfer their chat histories &lt;a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-to-allow-chat-history-migration-between-ios-and-android/"&gt;between iOS and Android devices&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt; has previously discovered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21267292/whatsapp-qr-codes-adding-contacts-beta-ios-android"&gt;numerous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20893033/whatsapp-disappearing-messages-beta-self-destruct-privacy-security"&gt;features&lt;/a&gt; before their official release, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21309982/whatsapp-contact-qr-codes-animated-stickers-video-call-improvements"&gt;adding contacts via QR codes&lt;/a&gt; and WhatsApp’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21550634/whatsapp-disappearing-messages-feature"&gt;disappearing messages&lt;/a&gt; feature.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ring will require video requests to be public in Neighbors app starting next week</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OHfItJ"&gt;Ring is adjusting how public agencies such as police and fire departments are able to request video clips from Ring camera owners in its Neighbors app. Starting next week, agencies will only be able to request clips be sent to them through public posts that are viewable in the app’s main feed; they will no longer be able to send individuals specific requests for clips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NKWy2g"&gt;Ring says this new method provides greater transparency to what public agencies are requesting, as all requests will now be logged on the agency’s profile and reviewable by anyone using the app. Agencies will not be able to remove or delete the posts, according to Ring, though they can be marked as “resolved.” Ring says it limits video clips requests to “verified public safety agencies” and has a &lt;a href="https://support.ring.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061496911"&gt;set of guidelines that agencies must abide by&lt;/a&gt; in order to be able to request footage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TcmCgB"&gt;Prior to this change, law enforcement agencies were able to send private emails through Ring to owners who lived in an area of active investigation in order to request footage, which the owners could then approve or deny. Though the app allowed Ring owners to blanket deny all requests for footage, these emails were not publicly available for review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lu2gA-QhyALWGvHXrlKJX2dMYFM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22555229/Neighbors_Feed.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ring&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Requests for footage from public agencies will now show up in the main Neighbors feed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vf0hPx34LD1KaOrUJ9gtCTob8RQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22555230/Agency_Profile_Posts.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ring&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Each agency will have a public profile page with their history of video requests visible by all in the app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vrz63O"&gt;Once the change is live in the app, Ring owners will see posts from their local authorities in the main app feed. They can then click on those posts to securely share footage from their cameras. Ring says that if you previously opted out of receiving requests for video clips, you will not receive notifications when agencies post to the feed. It will also be possible to hide the requests from the feed entirely. In general, the change makes the whole process more opt-in than opt-out, as it was before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q3YJHA"&gt;The Neighbors app has been one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/17/21141336/amazon-ring-cameras-spy-neighbors-police-nbc-news-intelligencer"&gt;most controversial aspects&lt;/a&gt; of Ring’s product line, as it has long faced criticism for amplifying mundane issues and providing a way for minorities to be harassed. It is a separate app from Ring’s main app, which is used for setup and control of Ring cameras, and is similar to hyperlocal social networks such as Nextdoor.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Philips Hue gets a sleeker new app rebuilt ‘from the ground up’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4lOdM9uuVETfe4VRBOS5hsFcsJU=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69381351/hue_app4_home_dashboard.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FeSmzT"&gt;The Philips Hue app is getting a big update on Thursday. The team at Signify, which makes Hue lights, has rebuilt the app “from the ground up” to make it easier to use. The new version looks mostly the same as the existing app, but it has tweaks around the edges to make it quicker to access different controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4VwFTw"&gt;One of the bigger changes is faster access to room controls. Now, when you tap on a room or zone, the app will present a grid of all the available lights and pre-set scenes so you can find them right away. In the prior version, you had to switch back and forth across different tabs that were easy to get lost in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3xLAy"&gt;You’ll also now be able to add new lights from within the Room tab — not just the Settings menu — and if you’re a power user with multiple Hue bridges, the app will let you switch between them from a button on the main screen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EBnn4b95yN9kCwGqZXwjlL44F60=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22555837/hue_app4_tile_view.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Signify&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When you open a room, you’ll now see a grid of scene and light options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KT7j2V"&gt;Signify is replacing the “routines” feature with a new “automations” tab, which is supposed to offer more advanced options for triggering your lights on and off. The app can also now take into consideration whether another person is already home when triggering “coming home” or “leaving home” automations, so the lights won’t all turn off just because the Hue app’s controller stepped out of the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c6J8yB"&gt;The new app launches Thursday for iOS and Android. Signify says that later this summer, it’ll follow up with an update introducing “dynamic scenes” that allow lights to cycle through different colors over time.&lt;/p&gt;
