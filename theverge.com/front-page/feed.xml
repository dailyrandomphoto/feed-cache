    <title>ToneStone is a music production app from the people behind Guitar Hero and Left 4 Dead</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: ToneStone&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oqPe9i"&gt;ToneStone is an app designed to make producing music easy, even for users without any musical experience, and it’s created by people who worked on &lt;em&gt;Guitar Hero&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Left 4 Dead&lt;/em&gt;. Even though the app is officially being announced today, it’s still in closed beta, and &lt;a href="https://tonestone.com"&gt;there’s a waitlist&lt;/a&gt; for those who want to try it out. As a music production hobbyist, ToneStone’s interface and game-like features very much seem like my kind of jam, based on videos I’ve seen of the app and my conversation with founder Greg LoPiccolo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lqDvjI"&gt;If you’ve never heard of LoPiccolo, you’ve probably heard of games he helped make. He worked at Harmonix, the studio that made music-based games like &lt;em&gt;Rock Band &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Guitar Hero&lt;/em&gt;. Another ToneStone founder is Tom Leonard, who has some of Valve’s greatest hits, like &lt;em&gt;Left 4 Dead &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Half-Life 2, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-leonard-49386b/"&gt;listed on his LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;. LoPiccolo said that the mission for ToneStone is to “empower a global community to create and share music,” which he sees making songs as a “critical human need that everybody wants.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4OegT7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;ToneStone uses a system of loops and decks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S8hm9d"&gt;In an attempt to make music production novice-friendly, ToneStone uses a system of loops and decks. Imagine loops as building blocks to a song — they can be used to add drums, synths, strings, etc. The loops are then organized into decks, which represent different music genres like synthwave, trap, or pop. ToneStone has premade decks built in, but you can also create your own, and even add your own sounds or recordings as loops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="p6VQYZ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dfi5yqtMENA?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J0kEpt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This tutorial video illustrates what the process of actually making music is like in the app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="giK2kS"&gt;The team behind ToneStone also hopes it’ll act as a sort of music creation social platform, by making it easy to share your music and remix songs that others have made (at the moment, most of the sharing is being done on Discord). There have been other games that let users make music, but it's difficult to navigate the line between being &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jBR5OSqxVw"&gt;too complex for beginners&lt;/a&gt; and too simple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sjrd8A"&gt;Remixing another ToneStone user’s song (which are currently shared in the Discord) gives you access to the entire project file, or as LoPiccolo put it, the musical DNA, which lets you really change things up from the original. You can also share any songs you made by exporting them as an MP3 file and uploading them to services like SoundCloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="G0PU4Y"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x4gazyLegSg?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SQuFCI"&gt;With founders who have years of experience in making games, it’s not surprising that ToneStone has gamified elements. LoPiccolo told me that the tutorials, which are meant to teach the basics of both the software and music composition, are lightly gamified. He also talked about the similarities between building a deck of loops and building a card deck in games like &lt;em&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Magic: The Gathering&lt;/em&gt; — there are built-in decks, too, but the real fun comes when you start making your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="noczBf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;ToneStone takes inspiration from games like ‘Magic: The Gathering’ and ‘Hearthstone’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PKoymX"&gt;LoPiccolo told me that the team has “some, I would dare say, revolutionary ideas” that are currently in development, that would “let people make musical decisions, and write and perform music as gameplay.” While what the actual gameplay will look like is unclear, the idea is to give the player enough decisions to get them into a groove, sort of like what can happen when playing more traditional games like &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty. &lt;/em&gt;The difference would be that, at the end, you’d have a musical creation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rSDFzj"&gt;I came away from the discussion imagining a series of quick-time events where you were deciding where the song was going to go, which sounds like a really fun thing to play around with (though it’s unclear if there’s some sort of seed or another process that prevents everyone from ending up with similar-sounding songs). LoPiccolo said that the ultimate goal was to make the experience either single or multiplayer, giving you the ability to collaborate with someone else to make music. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tYoJXK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;ToneStone’s modability reminds me of the DIY music production world&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xi2HyT"&gt;Like video games, LoPiccolo says that ToneStone will also be moddable and extendable. Its engine is written in JavaScript, and he says that users will be able to contribute not just music but interactive content like tutorials, guides, or even game modes. As someone who’s spent some time in the DIY music production world, the idea of those kinds of community contributions reminds me of the YouTube tutorials, shared project files, and VST plug-ins.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compare this image of ToneStone’s UI from one of its tutorial videos to FL Studio’s UI, seen below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rsRxs8TbPeOHUlMO7SFb9MPlC9U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22776459/Screen_Shot_2021_08_11_at_10.46.43_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A project file for a relatively simple song in FL Studio.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4oOjNq"&gt;While ToneStone seems to have a good number of advanced features, simplicity is still a priority for its creators. They say users should be able to go from opening the app to making music “within seconds” — the more advanced stuff can wait if you’re not interested or ready to learn it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="70rHuR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Users should be able to go from opening the app to making music “within seconds”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l7Kizs"&gt;I’ve spent hours and hours learning how to make music in apps like FL Studio and Logic Pro (mostly for fun), and hearing LoPiccolo enthuse about ToneStone makes me wish I had something like it years ago. I suspect I may end up using it for quick sketches and soundtracks that I would’ve used Logic for, just for the speed and ease of use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dPh1ZE"&gt;Of course, ToneStone isn’t the first app designed to let music novices create songs. Apple’s GarageBand has a feature called Live Loops, which has a &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/garageband-ipad/live-loops-overview-chsca7ff9ced/ipados"&gt;similarly user-friendly interface on iPads&lt;/a&gt;. I remember my experience using Live Loops as being fun but extremely frustrating when I tried to really make the song my own. GarageBand is also limited to Macs, iPads, and iPhones, where ToneStone runs on Macs and PCs and is distributed &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1627320/ToneStone/"&gt;through Steam&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYNbra"&gt;ToneStone’s goal is to blend the social aspects of gaming with the creator-driven content of platforms like Instagram to ultimately create music. While the social aspects of music production that ToneStone is leaning on aren’t new (especially in the indie and hobbyist music scene), it does have a point that actually making music can be daunting to beginners. When I first started, beginner tutorials &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OmX3PYE0Hw"&gt;looked like this&lt;/a&gt;, which is significantly scarier than &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfi5yqtMENA"&gt;ToneStone’s own tutorial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="S3pWWX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;LoPiccolo talked about game developers being able to score their own indie games with ToneStone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2zTxcE"&gt;ToneStone is still in its early stages, but its team has high hopes for it. LoPiccolo painted a picture of what the app can currently do, saying that it can be used to “create license-free soundtracks for indie games or live streams,” and said that the team is working on making things like live performances and collaboration possible. With the app still in closed beta, there’s not a set-in-stone business model yet, but LoPiccolo told me that the intent is to offer a base app for free, with access to advanced features unlocked by a subscription (though he didn’t share pricing information). He also said that the app will include a marketplace where you can buy new loops, effects, or modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EOccJH"&gt;You can sign up to the beta waitlist on &lt;a href="https://tonestone.com/waitlist/"&gt;ToneStone’s site&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix reveals cast for its live-action Avatar: The Last Airbender series</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Avatar: The Last Airbender" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gOmgob6hq0vrjVXjBWd4k19_SE0=/5x0:2366x1574/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69715358/Screen_Shot_2020_07_21_at_9.38.25_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Nickelodeon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EglA0N"&gt;It’s been some time since we’ve heard news about Netflix’s live-action adaptation of &lt;em&gt;Avatar: The Last Airbender&lt;/em&gt;, but today the streaming company is finally revealing details: namely, the cast for some major roles. The show will feature Gordon Cormier (&lt;em&gt;The Stand&lt;/em&gt;) as Aang, Kiawentiio (&lt;em&gt;Beans&lt;/em&gt;) as Katara, Ian Ousley (&lt;em&gt;13 Reasons Why&lt;/em&gt;) as Sokka, and Dallas Liu (&lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legends of the Ten Rings&lt;/em&gt;) as Zuko.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yJo8tS"&gt;The live-action adaptation was &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/9/18/17874344/avatar-the-last-airbender-live-action-series-netflix"&gt;first announced in 2018&lt;/a&gt; and ran into some trouble last year when &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt; creators Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko stepped away from the project citing creative differences with Netflix. “I realized I couldn’t control the creative direction of the series, but I could control how I responded,” &lt;a href="https://www.michaeldantedimartino.com/an-open-letter-to-avatar-the-last-airbender-fans/"&gt;DiMartino wrote in a blog post at the time&lt;/a&gt;, adding that “Netflix’s live-action adaptation of &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt; has the potential to be good... but what I can be certain about is that whatever version ends up on-screen, it will not be what Bryan and I had envisioned or intended to make.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uvuJpvHdZjRLVuMfXq04SyL9ZyE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22778025/FINAL_16x9_Cast_rounded_v3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UdgLbV"&gt;Taking over as showrunner is Albert Kim (&lt;em&gt;Sleepy Hollow&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Nikita&lt;/em&gt;), who posted a blog today about the process of creating what will be the second live-action take on the series, following M. Night Shyamalan’s 2010 film. “The more I thought about it, the more intrigued I became,” &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/bringing-avatar-into-the-live-action-realm-for-fans-old-and-new"&gt;Kim wrote&lt;/a&gt;. “VFX technology has advanced to the point where a live-action version can not only faithfully translate what had been done in animation — it can bring a rich new visual dimension to a fantastic world. We’ll be able to see bending in a real and visceral way we’ve never seen before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZPQmkI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The more I thought about it, the more intrigued I became.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xLUbjX"&gt;He also touched on the casting specifically, noting that “a live-action version would establish a new benchmark in representation and bring in a whole new generation of fans. This was a chance to showcase Asian and Indigenous characters as living, breathing people. Not just in a cartoon, but in a world that truly exists, very similar to the one we live in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="saERwN"&gt;There’s no word yet on when the new show will debut on Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Even Microsoft is mocking its Xbox Series X name</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_EoDqGlUVMI_4MqQgvfFDYzekzQ=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69715224/xboxmeme.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qvO6Rv"&gt;Microsoft has been the subject of many memes about its Xbox naming decisions in recent years. The Xbox Series X follows the Xbox One X, and the Xbox Series S is the successor to the Xbox One S, and before that there was the Xbox One. That’s led to the internet making memes about one Xbox One X box, and a series of Xbox Series X boxes. After many Xbox box memes, Microsoft has now started openly mocking its Xbox naming decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Edntrg"&gt;In a video on Instagram, Microsoft has made its own Xbox box meme, which includes an Xbox Series X, an Xbox Series X box, an ex-boxed Xbox Series X next to its box, a series of ex-boxed Xbox Series X next to their boxes, and a series of ex-boxed Xbox Series X next to their boxes in the shape of an X. Dizzy yet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="vThzuv"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hncK88"&gt;Now that Microsoft has adopted the meme, the official internet rules state it’s no longer cool. Microsoft has officially killed the Xbox box meme, even if it says “we’ll keep going until someone tells us to stop.” Perhaps that was Microsoft’s grand plan, as the Xbox maker also killed the Xbox fridge meme by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/3/16/21181399/microsoft-xbox-series-x-size-fridge-comparison-measurements"&gt;embracing it early on&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBVRbe"&gt;In fact, the Xbox team has been using memes frequently since the Xbox Series X was announced in late 2019. Even the leak of the Xbox Series S last year prompted the Xbox Twitter account &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Xbox/status/1303213264441024514"&gt;to respond with a meme&lt;/a&gt;, before the console was officially detailed hours later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l5VCuq"&gt;Microsoft also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/4/2/22364073/microsoft-xbox-series-x-mini-fridge-skittles-twitter-brand-poll"&gt;beat Skittles in a Twitter poll&lt;/a&gt; and decided to make mini Xbox Series X fridges a reality. The mini fridges will be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22532185/xbox-series-x-mini-fridge-available-holiday-2021"&gt;available this holiday season&lt;/a&gt;, in a case (or a box, if you like) of a meme turning into reality.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HP Elite Folio review: style over substance</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Good looks, but average performance&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="nk9zJV"&gt;HP has put out what I can best describe as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21526702/microsoft-surface-pro-x-2020-review-arm-windows-10-apps-features-specs-price"&gt;Surface Pro X&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18196266/hp-spectre-folio-leather-laptop-convertible-2-in-1-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Spectre Folio&lt;/a&gt; form factor. The Elite Folio is a lightweight, leather-covered, convertible Windows laptop powered by a Snapdragon processor with Arm architecture. It’s a neat-looking, futuristic system that’s meant to be used on the go, rather than for intensive tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SdE0p7"&gt;I often view products like this as the ideal secondary device — something to bring to a conference, or to run Netflix on at night. But with a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fmdp%2Flaptops%2Felitebook-folio-356504--1%23%21%26tab%3Dvao&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22620111%2Fhp-elite-folio-2021-review-arm-windows-10-apps-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starting price of $1,629.73&lt;/a&gt;, the Elite Folio is priced like a primary work driver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ec43J5"&gt;Arm for Windows has certainly improved since we first reviewed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/5/20948092/microsoft-surface-pro-x-review-arm-windows-10-apps-features-specs-price"&gt;Surface Pro X in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. App compatibility is no longer the complete disaster it was then. Still, purchasing this device is compromising on performance and may be compromising on software options, depending on the apps you’re using. Some people are certainly well-suited to the Elite Folio, but if you think you’re in that group, just make sure you know what you’re getting into. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XjBrbi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10696535"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kWVg1t"&gt;The primary reason the Elite Folio is able to command that premium price tag is its design. The entire chassis is wrapped in leather (vegan leather, per HP, so technically polyurethane), which will make you look like you’re carrying around a fancy notebook. It’s 2.9 pounds, but it feels lighter than it is to me, maybe because the leather cover makes it so comfortable to carry. The keyboard deck is a dark onyx color (matching the leather cover) with a nice, smooth texture; it’s not a fingerprint magnet, which black computers (even at this price point) often are. An included stylus lives in a silo below the chin, which charges when it’s not in use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mgZO2b"&gt;But the most unique feature is the form factor. The Folio is a convertible laptop, but you have more than the usual tent, tablet, and clamshell options. You can also pull the screen over the keyboard and rest it in the middle of the deck (either above or below the touchpad), creating a sturdy easel for note-taking or drawing. (I ended up using this formation a lot when I was writing or drawing with the stylus, because the Folio’s hinge isn’t super sturdy, and there’s noticeable wobble when you touch the screen in clamshell mode.) There aren’t a ton of laptops with this sort of form factor, especially outside the creativity space. The last one I reviewed was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22430445/acer-conceptd-7-ezel-2021-review"&gt;Acer’s ConceptD Ezel&lt;/a&gt;, a hulking 5.6-pound affair with a GPU inside. HP has used the design before, of course, with its 2019 Spectre Folio that the Elite Folio succeeds, but HP isn’t selling that anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhgx2L"&gt;The Folio’s screen is smooth to move, and I was never worried about it sliding around. Pulling it over the keyboard does take a firm tug, and it’s a bit difficult to do without touching the screen in the process and potentially messing up my tabs. I think this is the first laptop I’ve ever reviewed that I wish had slightly larger bezels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The HP Elite Folio open on an outdoor table with a railing and the river in the background.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here it is in clamshell mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The HP Elite Folio stylus and top bezel angled to the left, seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rMaqqQjxV_91Hs9VxJrOoEVBH1c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774697/mchin_191104_4704_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The stylus easily pops in and out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The HP Elite Folio keyboard seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1bzah6oRWaR4RcJQyMxIkqPu0ZQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774699/mchin_191104_4704_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The keyboard has 1.3mm of key travel and is quite clicky.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The HP Elite Folio in tablet mode leaning against a railing with a river in the background on a wooden table. The screen displays a lock screen with a twilight city along a river." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tmQHQ1uzQJN4uoGAioWCLWQ0CXE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774700/mchin_191104_4704_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here it is in tablet mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zZP1t4"&gt;In addition to the form factor, the Folio’s audio makes it a decent videoconferencing machine. The four-speaker array, including upward-firing grills on either side of the keyboard, delivers clear, excellent sound with strong vocals and even audible bass — a rarity on laptops of this size. There’s one catch, which is that there was a bit of audible distortion around some high treble tones (like when Olivia Rodrigo sings the words “deja vu” in the beginning of “Deja Vu”) that I couldn’t totally eliminate without bumping the volume significantly down. I’ve asked HP about this issue.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7hnJYU"&gt;The HD camera, on the other hand, is standard mediocre laptop fare, delivering a grainy and somewhat dark picture even in a bright office setting. It does check various useful boxes, though: it supports Windows Hello (which didn’t give me any trouble) and has a physical privacy shutter that’s pretty easy to snap back and forth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="2Hayla"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10696556"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G2PAZB"&gt;Inside, the Elite Folio is running Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8cx Gen 2, an Arm chip that’s common to see in lightweight Windows convertibles (including some versions of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/8/7/20759423/samsung-galaxy-book-s-laptop-hands-on-unpacked-2019"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Book S&lt;/a&gt;). It supports 5G and 4G LTE (one of the main benefits of an Arm machine), with an X55 modem. Wi-Fi 6 is on board as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nJ5rl1"&gt;I remember trying out the first Surface Pro X in 2019, when Windows on Arm was painfully slow. (It’s not an apples-to-apples comparison since the Surface Pro uses Microsoft’s custom Qualcomm chips, but there aren’t too many Arm-based Windows devices at this price point for comparison.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vWiCz7"&gt;The Elite Folio’s performance is night and day. (And it’s running Windows 10 Pro, not Windows 10 Home.) The device boots instantly when you open it up, and Windows Hello facial recognition takes less than a tenth of a second to sign you in. And while all kinds of apps were either unavailable or unusable on the first Surface Pro X, most of what I needed worked just fine here. (Keyword being most — more on that in a second.) For those unfamiliar, Windows apps that are compiled to x86 (the architecture Intel uses) need to be run through an emulation layer to be usable on Arm devices. The Folio can currently run 32-bit apps (though your mileage may vary), but 64-bit emulation is currently only available through the Windows Insider beta testing program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzr9lK"&gt;Spotify, which has been sluggish on Arm in the past, had no problems here. It even ran more smoothly than I’ve seen it do on some recent Windows laptops. I had no problem downloading and running various web-conferencing apps like Zoom, Slack, or Microsoft teams either. Some apps were available but not the best experience. Lightroom and Photoshop, for example, could both be downloaded but were stuttery as I scrolled through various functions. That would’ve been a pain if I were using those apps day in and day out. The software we usually use to calibrate screens could also be downloaded but never recognized my colorimeter once I got it up and running. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T5zkPE"&gt;And some programs aren’t available at all. Dropbox is a no go — you’ll have to settle for the S-Mode version in the Windows store, a bare-bones app that doesn’t allow you to save files to Dropbox directly. You can download Steam, but a bunch of games aren’t there. I got &lt;em&gt;CS:GO&lt;/em&gt; but couldn’t get &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt;. But the main disappointment for me was the slim Adobe offerings. I could only access Photoshop, Lightroom, and Acrobat DC from the Creative Cloud desktop app; no Premiere Pro, no Audition, no InDesign, no Illustrator, etc. Plenty of people don’t need those apps, of course, but it’s still a shame since the Folio’s form factor could make it an appealing device for editing on the go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o5slKf"&gt;There’s no way I could test every possible app on this device, so the takeaway here is: do some research and make sure that the programs you use are available. Call the companies if you have to. I’d really hate for someone to spend $1,700 on this product only to find out that an app they need won’t work on it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The HP Elite Folio in easel mode seen from the left side on a wooden table. In the background are a railing, a river, and a cityscape across the river." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jemdd2FV8quNKum6sjLCmNObD0c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774702/mchin_191104_4704_0012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Elite Folio doesn’t bend backward like a traditional convertible, but you can still flip the screen around.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="Zhj2zt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10696585"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yNUDsA"&gt;When it comes to general office use (mostly in Chrome, in my case), the Folio was functional but certainly a step-down from the best similarly priced Intel and AMD laptops. I used it to jump between around a dozen Chrome tabs and a couple apps, and there was just a bit more lag than I was used to. Text took a smidge longer to catch up with my typing in Google Docs, Slack took a smidge longer to refresh and load new conversations, scrolling through long articles was a smidge more stuttery and less smooth. The smidges weren’t the end of the world, but since I was using the Folio all day as my primary driver, they added up. My experience editing a big batch of pictures in the Windows Photos app was annoyingly slow — the program actually crashed at one point, which I’ve never seen Photos do before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nFMr8Z"&gt;So what’s the benefit of an Arm chip, if not snappy performance? They allow for thinner chassis and are easy to integrate with LTE — but the primary benefit is supposed to be battery life. We’ve seen this in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22412759/acer-chromebook-spin-513-review-specs-price"&gt;Arm-based Chromebooks&lt;/a&gt;, which have delivered over 10 hours in our testing, and in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;Apple’s M1-powered MacBooks&lt;/a&gt;, which have the best battery life of any MacBooks in recent memory. So I dove into the Folio with big expectations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L87aEc"&gt;Unfortunately, this device’s battery life, while good, is not astonishing. Using it as my primary driver with the screen at medium brightness, I averaged eight hours and 15 minutes. To be clear, that’s not a bad result at all. But there are all kinds of Intel convertibles that perform better, last longer, and are cheaper. I easily get 10 hours with that same workload out of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22264792/hp-spectre-x360-14-laptop-stylus-oled-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP’s Spectre x360 14&lt;/a&gt;, and close to nine out of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575308/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 13 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt;. The Folio is also a case where different workloads may yield very different results, however, since emulated apps will likely consume more power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The HP Elite Folio closed on a wooden deck seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ihJDJ5WZDej48CMIkWXs8Q-rrP4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774698/mchin_191104_4704_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a neat notebook.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nEDDQm"&gt;I’ve been looking for a portable, durable secondary device that I could use to get some work done or watch a movie or two on weekend trips. I wish the Elite Folio were half its price, because then it would be perfect for that use case, and I’d be snatching it up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QG3EuI"&gt;But I’m a fairly traditional business user, and Elite Folio still doesn’t have enough processing power to be my primary driver. And there are too many apps I use, including Premiere Pro, Dropbox, and a number of games, that I’d have to give up (for now, at least). That’s too big of a sacrifice to make, even for a beautiful and unique chassis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EkmpYd"&gt;That doesn’t mean the Elite Folio is a bad laptop. It could be a great choice for people with light day-to-day tasks who are mostly working in a few tabs at a time, or who do a lot of drawing and note-taking on the move and would use the easel form. Folks who value style and presentation over other characteristics should also give it a look. It’s a gorgeous product to hold and play around with. If I got it for free, I’d bring it everywhere I went. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="LzVKQM"&gt;But if you’re considering buying the Folio, you should try the device yourself if you can or (and I know I’m biased here) read a bunch of reviews before you do so. Just make sure you won’t be caught off-guard by the slower performance, and that any apps you use can work as you need them to. Otherwise, you’re looking at a lot of wasted money. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Galaxy Watch 4 is still more a Samsung wearable than a Google one</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jIV4JYlipufeD8LsgTP84cr3Dkw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69714896/BFARSACE_210810_4707_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XqMAWD"&gt;This week was supposed to be the first day of Google’s big reentry into flagship smartwatches. Samsung is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;back on board&lt;/a&gt; after years of Tizen-based wearables, with its new Galaxy Watch 4 that runs the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22550828/samsung-mwc-2021-one-ui-watch-smartwatch"&gt;new, revitalized Wear OS 3&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the smartwatch OS that merges the best of Google and Samsung’s discrete platforms together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OVOqm0"&gt;But there was just one issue: Google was strangely absent from the proceedings. In fact, aside from a few oblique mentions of working with Google on the software, you might have watched Samsung’s whole presentation and not even caught that the new watches were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22617462/galaxy-watch-4-classic-samsung-apple-watch-google-ecosystem"&gt;running on Wear OS at all&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pMomM2"&gt;On the one hand, this is extremely par for the course for Samsung. It’s practically a running gag at this point that Samsung goes out of its way to avoid mentioning Google or Android when it discusses its new phone releases. And indeed, the Galaxy Z Flip 3 and Fold 3 sections were full of praise for Samsung’s One UI, with nary a mention of Android 11 or Android 12 or any improvements Google has been making on an OS level to enable those devices to work better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qkVlon"&gt;Seeing a similar dynamic here with the Galaxy Watch and Wear OS 3 — one that focused more on Samsung’s One UI improvements and software layer more than anything that the new Google collaboration enables — makes sense given Samsung’s history. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1eXHvULW6AqOtYBVmhDfugp7fYc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775097/BFARSACE_210810_4707_5.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jHmkTS"&gt;But the Samsung-heavy announcement highlights just how much of an uphill battle Google has here, and how much it’s going to have to rely on Samsung (which has very different goals than Google) as it looks to revitalize its wearables. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fnY7h7"&gt;And it’s hard to look at the Galaxy Watch 4 as anything other than a compromise of a device for Google. It’s a flagship Wear OS 3 watch that runs Samsung’s UI on top, won’t ship with Google Assistant, and comes packed with default apps that compete with Google’s own services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="azOrQw"&gt;The default health tracking app on Wear OS is Samsung Health. And the default payment app? Samsung Pay. The default assistant? Bixby. The list of default apps goes on: Messages, Photos, Calendar, Clock, Music and more are all Samsung’s version. You can manually install Google’s version of these apps, but it’s a hassle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6FFGJC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It may be Google’s operating system, but this is definitely &lt;em&gt;Samsung’s&lt;/em&gt; watch&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pKR0Bj"&gt;It may be Google’s operating system, but this is definitely &lt;em&gt;Samsung’s&lt;/em&gt; watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zS5FVh"&gt;And while Samsung is arguably a more selfish partner than Google may have hoped for to relaunch its Wear OS platform, Google also doesn’t have much of a choice. The list of Wear OS partners in 2021 isn’t long or distinguished. Motorola and LG haven’t made smartwatches in years, OnePlus, ​​RealMe, and Oppo are all using their own operating systems, and Fitbit — while now owned by Google — has yet to embrace Google’s operating system at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h1TKdE"&gt;In 2021, your best bet for a Wear OS watch is either TicWatch or Fossil, which — while having done an admirable job of trying to carry the platform thus far — aren’t the kind of big name partners on the caliber of Samsung. Neither of those companies looks ready to release a Wear OS 3 watch for some time, either, with Fossil already confirming that its holiday releases will still be stuck on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/6/22521256/fossil-not-upgrade-existing-watches-wear-os-google-android"&gt;old Wear OS platform&lt;/a&gt;. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588440/google-wear-os-3-update-smartwatch-samsung-2022"&gt;With upgrades coming sometime next year&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wec2Bj"&gt;There’s added confusion, too: Samsung’s Galaxy Watch, for example, will use Samsung Health for at least some of its fitness services. You can install Google Fit, but it feels like it’s tacked on this watch. And so far as we can tell, you &lt;em&gt;can’t &lt;/em&gt;switch from Samsung Pay to Google Pay or from Bixby to the Google Assistant on this watch. And the Galaxy Watch won’t work with iOS devices, something that Google won’t clarify as limited to just Samsung’s model or a potential limit of all Wear OS 3 watches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6baD32"&gt;So what does Google get out of the Galaxy Watch? Well, at the end of the day, the new Wear OS-powered Galaxy Watch &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; on Google’s OS and does rely on critical Google services like the Play Store for apps. It’s more compatible with non-Samsung Android phones and will work with Google services like Maps and Gmail (even if some of those will have to face Samsung-branded competition). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FUINJz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;At the end of the day, every new Galaxy Watch is also a new Wear OS user&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uXbH0a"&gt;Additionally, the Wear OS smartwatch market is still pretty stagnant right now, so it’s not like Google has anything to lose by letting Samsung do a heavily Samsung-focused watch. Anyone who buys into the Galaxy Watch 4 is another user to help bolster the Play Store, and a bigger audience for developers looking to invest in Google’s platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vProsx"&gt;Plus, with Google’s past investments in smartwatches (a list that includes its $2.1 billion purchase of Fitbit and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/17/18187026/google-fossil-group-smartwatch-sale-40-million-wear-os-android"&gt;mysterious $40 million acquisition from Fossil&lt;/a&gt; in 2019), it’s possible the current status quo won’t last forever. If Apple and Samsung have shown anything, it’s that sometimes the best way to get a great smartwatch is to just do it yourself — and the upcoming Pixel 6 seems like it could use a matching high-end smartwatch to go with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="dZgQ2g"&gt;

    <title>Honor’s Magic 3 is its first post-Huawei flagship</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EtkKQORn-43zg0BXgxFue7BGK40=/60x0:2940x1920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69714885/HONOR_Magic3_Pro_Front.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Honor Magic 3 Pro.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Honor&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cRDra4"&gt;Honor has announced its first flagship smartphones since being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570744/huawei-honor-sale-announced-us-sanctions"&gt;sold off by former parent company Huawei&lt;/a&gt;: the Magic 3 series. The lineup consists of three phones, the Magic 3, Magic 3 Pro, and Magic 3 Pro Plus. They’re coming first to mainland China, but Honor says they’re getting a global release at a later date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KgGMug"&gt;When they launch globally, the phones will come with Google’s apps and services, which Honor wasn’t previously able to include while a subsidiary of Huawei due to US sanctions. It should make the Magic 3 series much more competitive outside of China compared to Honor’s recent Huawei-era phones, which had to rely on Huawei’s own services and AppGallery to download software. This setup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/25/21193639/huawei-mate-30-google-apps-services-appgallery-p40-preview"&gt;came with significant drawbacks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oOPGbyTORkiB8KxGywbOOR323zI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22777959/HONOR_Magic3_Blue_Hour.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Honor Magic 3 (left) and the Honor Magic 3 Pro Plus (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NoTYks"&gt;The Magic 3 Pro and Pro Plus are powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 Plus processor, while the standard Magic 3 has a Snapdragon 888 processor. Around front they have a 6.76-inch 1344p OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and an aggressive curve around the sides of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJsGfu"&gt;Rear cameras vary significantly between the three phones. On the standard Magic 3, there are three cameras: a 50-megapixel 1/1.56-inch main camera, a 13-megapixel 1/1.31-inch ultrawide, and a 64-megapixel monochrome camera. The Magic 3 Pro adds a 64-megapixel telephoto camera with a 1/2-inch sensor, 3.5x optical zoom, and OIS. Finally, the Pro Plus increases the size of the main 50-megapixel sensor to 1/1.28-inches, and the resolution of the ultrawide sensor to 64 megapixels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4EqMgk"&gt;The Magic 3 Series has a battery capacity of 4,600mAh and supports wired fast-charging up to 66W. On the Pro and Pro Plus, there’s wireless charging up to 50W with support for reverse wireless charging, as well as an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance (the regular Magic 3 has an IP54 rating). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rCnl29"&gt;The announcement of the Honor Magic 3 series follows the launch of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22243559/honor-v40-announced-huawei-google-sanctions-specs"&gt;V40 in January&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536512/honor-50-series-pro-release-date-news-features-google-mobile-services-apps-play-store"&gt;Honor 50 in June&lt;/a&gt;. However, despite confirming that the Honor 50 will eventually receive a global release, complete with Google’s apps and services, an exact release date is yet to be confirmed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gxYSiU"&gt;The Honor Magic 3 with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage will sell for €899 (about $1,055), while the Magic 3 Pro with the same configuration of RAM and storage will cost €1,099 (about $1,290). The Honor Magic 3 Pro Plus, which comes with 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, will cost €1,499 (about $1,760). The exact date of the phones’ global release is yet to be announced.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jabra’s Elite 65t are just $50 at Best Buy right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pTHZAWQmgqUG-S6ZdWa3NODcdX4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69714831/akrales_180411_2462_0052.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;With decent sound and a stable connection, the Elite 65t were once our go-to alternative to the AirPods. | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="synnAq"&gt;It seems like the market for true wireless earbuds becomes more and more crowded each week, with products like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22598920/nothing-ear-1-earbuds-review-features-specs"&gt;Nothing Ear 1s&lt;/a&gt; being two of the latest contenders to jump into the already-burgeoning field. And while the Jabra Elite 65t are beginning to show their age in comparison and are by no means top of the field, they’re still a great pair of earbuds with enjoyable sound and a customizable fit, not to mention a two-year warranty that covers any potential damage they may sustain from prolonged exposure to sweat or dust. Normally $80, you can pick up the copper-black model at &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fjabra-elite-65t-true-wireless-earbud-headphones-copper-black%2F6230036.p%3FacampID%3D0%26cmp%3DRMX%26irclickid%3DQJaSroQtuxyLRzW0UfQwQyYMUkBRJYTkExnTRM0%26irgwc%3D1%26loc%3DNarrativ%26mpid%3D376373%26ref%3D198%26skuId%3D6230036&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy for $50&lt;/a&gt;, slightly more than their best price. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/17/17247354/jabra-elite-65t-truly-wireless-earbuds-review-airpods"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="xJtr6U"&gt;When talking TV recommendations with the rest of &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;staff, there’s one model that seems to come up more often than any other: the LG C1. It’s not particularly surprising, however, especially since the 4K OLED is the successor to the LG CX, one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"&gt;best TVs you can buy for the PS5 or Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;. Every configuration of the C1 offers support for Nvidia G-Sync and AMD FreeSync technologies and comes with a 120Hz refresh rate, low input lag, and HDR. It also has a faster processor than the CX and a gamer-friendly interface that lets you quickly toggle between various settings without having to delve deep into the settings pane. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iaN1ct"&gt;If you don’t mind sticking with a smaller panel, you can pick up the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FLG-C1PU-48-HDR-4K-Ultra-HD-Smart-OLED-TV-2021-Model-%2F184898835257%3F_trksid%3D%26mkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26customid%3DVergeDeals081221%26toolid%3D10001%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F8%2F12%2F22620961%2Fjabra-elite-65t-earbuds-lg-c1-48-inch-oled-anker-nintendo-switch-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;48-inch model for an additional $100 off at eBay&lt;/a&gt; with coupon code &lt;strong&gt;SAVE20FORBTS&lt;/strong&gt;, bringing the final sale price down to just $1,197.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rFbsD2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10697443"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PZM0Kg"&gt;The Nintendo Switch and Switch Lite are great consoles when it comes to portability, but keeping either console juiced on the go can prove challenging, especially if you’re using an older Switch model that doesn’t offer the same kind of battery life as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/17/20697601/nintendo-switch-new-model-battery-life-improvements"&gt;second-gen model&lt;/a&gt; or forthcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"&gt;OLED edition&lt;/a&gt;. That’s where a device like Anker’s PowerCore 13400 Powerbank can prove handy. The compact, Nintendo-licensed battery pack — which is currently &lt;a href="http://adorama.rfvk.net/2rQzAA"&gt;on sale at Adorama for $30&lt;/a&gt; — provides nearly enough power to charge the standard Switch twice over and can be used with a range of other USB-C devices.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reddit is now valued at more than $10 billion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XFjqLoDbgITDdQ8G-GQiYLXeoBI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69714632/acastro_180413_1777_reddit_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U58DcO"&gt;Reddit, the self-declared ‘front page of the internet,’ says it is now &lt;a href="https://redditblog.com/2021/08/12/reddit-secures-funding-to-continue-growth-plans/"&gt;valued at more than $10 billion&lt;/a&gt; after raising an additional $410 million in funding, with the final round expected to grow to up to $700 million. The company continues to build and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21364019/reddit-bans-racist-subreddit-co-founder-alexis-ohanian-twitter-thread"&gt;sanitize its business&lt;/a&gt;, removing racist, misogynist, and otherwise controversial communities, as it prepares to go public at some point in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="574zEp"&gt;“We are still planning on going public, but we don’t have a firm timeline there yet,” Reddit’s co-founder and CEO Steve Huffman told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/12/technology/reddit-new-funding.html"&gt;in an interview&lt;/a&gt;. “All good companies should go public when they can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D4LUZJ"&gt;The company previously raised $250 million in funding &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274077/reddit-funding-round-250-million-double-employees-investment"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; for a valuation of $6 billion. But Huffman told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; the company was approached with this recent financing round by Fidelity Investments and were made “an offer that we couldn’t refuse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aNSnzp"&gt;Reddit makes most its money from advertising on the site, and although it’s a minnow compared to the likes of Facebook and Google, it’s growing its business quickly. The company says it made $100 million in advertising revenue in the second quarter of 2021, up 192 percent compared to the same period last year. Though for context, Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596592/google-q2-2021-record-revenue-profit-youtube-ad-cloud-search"&gt;made $61.9 billion&lt;/a&gt; in this year’s second quarter, mostly from YouTube and Search advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TlauzM"&gt;Reddit now has roughly 52 million daily users (compared to 1.85 billion daily Facebook users) and more than 100,000 active sub-reddits. Earlier this year, the company said it planned to double its staff count by the end of 2021 to around 1,400 employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfEQfU"&gt;Huffman told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; that the new funding would be used to make the site easier for first-time users and help its communities expand internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Meet users have more options to add co-hosts, limit screen sharing, and mute others</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nsy-EcbVP9_BlHit8lD1XT7MNFc=/0x0:1980x1320/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69714425/googlemeetnewui.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="svljGT"&gt;Google is adding a bunch of &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/08/add-up-to-25-cohosts-expanded-safety-features-for-meet.html?"&gt;new features to Google Meet&lt;/a&gt;, making it easier for users to control and direct meetings. However, exactly which controls will be available depends on whether you are using Meet as a regular user or as part of a Google Workspace team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MKoHZC"&gt;The main update is that all users will now be able to assign up to 25 co-hosts per meeting, who will have access to host controls. This will let them limit who can share their screen and send chat messages, as well as mute all participants with a single click, end the meeting, and control who can enter the meeting (though this last feature is only available to certain Google Workspace versions). Previously, assigning co-hosts was only available to Google Workspace for Education customers. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WXSv181Esl0gLcE6zfIxIovPFmQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22777885/host2.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Hosts can assign other call participants as co-hosts by clicking the three-dot menu next to their name&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uEisbB"&gt;Google Meet is also getting new Quick Access settings if you’re a Google Workspace customer. This will be enabled by default, but if it’s turned off, it means meetings won’t be able to start until the host joins. Users can also do things like block anonymous users from joining or only let invited participants join without asking — ensuring only people who are &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to be in a meeting are actually in there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B4qXfy"&gt;The changes are scheduled to roll out on web and Android from August 16th and on iOS from August 30th. For full details of the changes and availability based on different Workplace versions, check out the blog post from Google &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/08/add-up-to-25-cohosts-expanded-safety-features-for-meet.html?"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify’s Wear OS app is getting offline playback in the coming weeks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-_d13u-UaD3xsRI6anxOz-YpYVo=/591x0:1416x550/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69714396/Spotify_wearOS_banner01_1_1440x550.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wNFepC"&gt;Spotify’s updated Wear OS app is releasing “over the coming weeks,” &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-08-11/enjoy-all-your-music-and-podcasts-offline-on-smartwatches-running-wear-os/"&gt;Spotify has announced&lt;/a&gt;, and it’ll support offline playback on smartwatches running Wear OS 2.0 and up. The new functionality was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442880/spotify-youtube-music-download-offline-playlists-podcasts-updates"&gt;announced in May&lt;/a&gt; alongside the news of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;Google’s collaboration with Samsung&lt;/a&gt; on the next-generation of the wearable operating system, Wear OS 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PUFVtq"&gt;The fact that offline downloads will be available on Wear OS 2 means that it’s not exclusive to upcoming Wear OS 3 watches like Samsung’s recently announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22618532/galaxy-watch-4-classic-smartwatch-fitness-tracker-price-specs-features"&gt;Galaxy Watch 4 and the Galaxy Watch 4 Classic&lt;/a&gt;. Spotify says it should work on watches from the likes of Fossil, Mobvoi, and Suunto. Meanwhile Google’s new YouTube Music Wear OS app, which also supports offline listening, is &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/11/youtube-music-wear-os-maps-release/"&gt;exclusive to Wear OS 3&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W1RM7Y"&gt;Similar to Spotify’s offline listening on the Apple Watch, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447222/spotify-adding-feature-music-downloads-offline-apple-watch"&gt;launched in May&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll need a Premium subscription to use the feature. Spotify says you’ll be able to download music or podcasts by hitting the “Download to watch” button in the Wear OS app. A small green arrow will appear next to a playlist, album, or podcast once it’s available for listening offline. Free users will be able to download podcasts directly to the watch for offline playback, but when it comes to music they’ll have to stream in shuffle mode over Wi-Fi or cellular. &lt;/p&gt;
