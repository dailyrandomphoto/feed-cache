    <title>TikTok and Snap want to prove they’re not Facebook</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hFAqJB"&gt;Snap, TikTok, and YouTube set out with one important goal for Tuesday’s Senate hearing on child safety: to convince lawmakers that they are nothing like Facebook. While lawmakers were encouraged by the companies’ transparency, their humble approach hasn’t dissuaded lawmakers from pursuing new legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZb8Vv"&gt;While YouTube’s parent company Google has testified before, it was the first time representatives from Snap and TikTok testified before Congress, and they came prepared to differentiate themselves from the social media giant at the center of yet another series of scandals. It was Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen’s leaks that led senators to pursue these hearings. The Facebook Papers loomed over the event, reinforcing Snap and TikTok’s desire to set themselves apart and promising Congress greater transparency into their internal research and algorithms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LqQEAM"&gt;“Snapchat was built as an antidote to social media,” Jennifer Stout, Snap’s vice president of global public policy, &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/services/files/0AACA9BA-49C8-4AC3-8C2E-E62ACC3F73BC"&gt;said on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, attempting to remove Snapchat from the Facebook comparison. “In fact, we describe ourselves as a camera company.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VA0mBw"&gt;“TikTok is a global entertainment platform where people create and watch short-form videos,” said Michael Beckerman, TikTok’s vice president and head of public policy for the Americas. Beckerman continued, noting that direct messages and other social features are turned off by default for young users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IhKFBk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Being different from Facebook is not a defense”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6U11zl"&gt;Still, the testifying companies’ statements did not quell lawmakers who feared these platforms could be used in the same harmful ways as Facebook and Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9lGbmp"&gt;“Being different from Facebook is not a defense,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), chair of the subcommittee, said in his opening remarks on Tuesday. “That bar is in the gutter. It’s not a defense to say that you are different.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p5tH2j"&gt;Before Tuesday’s hearing, lawmakers brought in Facebook head of safety Antigone Davis and whistleblower Frances Haugen to discuss how the company’s products, like Instagram, drive young users to content encouraging self-harm and unhealthy behaviors. For years, lawmakers have vowed to produce new legislation to protect children online, but recent &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reporting on a cache of internal Facebook documents leaked by Haugen breathed new life into their willingness to regulate tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L8tc3k"&gt;Specifically, lawmakers pointed to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739"&gt;internal research&lt;/a&gt; from Facebook noting that Instagram makes “body image issues worse for one in three teen girls.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BfG0Nd"&gt;At a September hearing, lawmakers noted Davis’ unwillingness to answer questions and her refusal to publish Facebook’s entire body of research on the effects its platforms have on young users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2jJXW"&gt;“I don’t understand, Ms. Davis, how you can deny that Instagram isn’t exploiting young users for its own profits?” Blumenthal asked her at the time. “This research is a bombshell. It is powerful, gripping riveting evidence that Facebook knows of the harmful effects of its site on children and that it has concealed those facts and findings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MkyrYX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Facebook knows of the harmful effects of its site on children”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UZPEuE"&gt;While Facebook may have refused to publish the research, reporters from a variety of different news publications gained access to additional documents leaked by Haugen and authored a deluge of articles on Monday examining Facebook’s own research and documents on teens and other issues like content moderation lovingly titled the “Facebook Papers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4mP7G"&gt;Clearly, Snap, TikTok, and YouTube didn’t want to be on the receiving end of their own “Papers” scandals. During Tuesday’s hearing, all three companies committed to releasing research, data, and independent studies they have conducted to Congress. Lawmakers like Sen. John Thune (R-SD) said that the committee could send these documents to independent experts to review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P1aUzD"&gt;In a press call with reporters Tuesday, Blumenthal said that his subcommittee would “hold them” to that promise and that lawmakers were “going to pursue legislation,” including updates to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/9/21058562/eraser-button-childrens-data-coppa-walberg-rush-hawley-markey-congress-house"&gt;the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act&lt;/a&gt; (COPPA) and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/5/21166705/youtube-kids-act-markey-blumenthal-coppa-tiktok-ryans-toy-review"&gt;potential markup on the KIDS Act&lt;/a&gt;. The latter bill would place new limits on the types of features and content tech companies could provide for children under the age of 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xWuw8t"&gt;Even as Snap, TikTok, and YouTube try to remove themselves from Facebook’s toxic regulatory groundswell, CEO Mark Zuckerberg &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745622/facebook-young-adults-refocusing-teams"&gt;tried to pull them closer&lt;/a&gt; in the company’s latest earnings call on Monday. Zuckerberg explained that the company has made changes to its services to support older users, many of whom don’t use platforms like Snap and TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5MOecf"&gt;“So much of our services have gotten dialed to be the best for the most people who use them, rather than specifically for young adults,” Zuckerberg said. Later, he called TikTok “one of the most effective competitors we’ve ever faced.” He also announced that the company would refresh Instagram’s app design, making its Reels product “a more central part of the experience.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21354117/instagram-reels-tiktok-vine-short-videos-stories-explore-music-effects-filters"&gt;Reels is Facebook’s answer&lt;/a&gt; to TikTok’s growing popularity with young people, allowing users to post videos in a similar style. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PQt9Jq"&gt;Still, it’s unclear when the companies that testified Tuesday plan to release the internal reporting. Snap, TikTok, and YouTube did not immediately answer requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;regarding the timing of these disclosures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v4r7ys"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J7Vics"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Office, Windows, and cloud boosts Q1 2022 earnings</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/osw_gmw4n2qVJU0YZY-yGxkNsbM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70048846/acastro_180507_1777_microsoft_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2s3sEE"&gt;Microsoft posted the first quarter of its 2022 &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2FInvestor%2Fearnings%2FFY-2022-Q1%2Fpress-release-webcast" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;financial results today&lt;/a&gt;, reporting revenue of $45.3 billion and a net income of $20.5 billion (GAAP). Revenue is up 22 percent, and net income has increased by 48 percent. Microsoft has seen strong revenue performance in its cloud, server, and Office businesses this quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xslOYU"&gt;Microsoft might have just launched Windows 11 earlier this month, but in the months ahead of this new version of Windows, PC sales have started to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722151/us-pc-market-decline-supply-issues-windows-11-launch"&gt;decline in the US due to supply issues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1IrO88"&gt;That doesn’t seem to have impacted Microsoft’s Windows revenues, though. Windows OEM revenue has increased by 10 percent this quarter, despite what Microsoft calls “continued PC demand impacted by supply chain constraints.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Laptop mode on the Surface Laptop Studio." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bVYvlHooV5At7VcO4-YBn437PTA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22868481/vpavic_210921_4770_0058.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s new Surface Laptop Studio.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VgqJw6"&gt;Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue has also increased by 12 percent, thanks to demand for Microsoft 365. Windows 11 has only just arrived on new devices earlier this month, so Microsoft and OEMs will be hoping the supply issues improve and that the new operating system drives even more demand for laptops and PCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xNTwE5"&gt;Over on the Surface side, we’re now into the second quarter of Surface Laptop 4 and Surface Pro 7 Plus sales for Microsoft’s Surface revenues. Surface revenue has decreased by 17 percent this quarter, and Microsoft says that’s related to a stronger prior year by comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eZ7vNAyD-6ow6aFHR9OmhluA76g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22012262/vpavic_4275_20201030_0050.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox Series S and X consoles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7TSd1d"&gt;It’s nearly been a year since Microsoft’s Xbox Series X and Series S consoles have been on the market, and they’ve been continually growing hardware revenue for Xbox in recent months. Hardware revenue is up again this quarter by 166 percent, thanks to continued demand for Xbox Series X and Series S consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bU7Ley"&gt;Microsoft’s overall gaming revenue is also up by 16 percent, nearly $3.6 billion for the quarter and a record Q1 for Xbox. But Xbox content and services revenue has only increased by 2 percent. Microsoft says there has been some “growth in Xbox Game Pass subscriptions,” but the company isn’t listing a new figure for its subscriber count. The last publicly disclosed one was 18 million Xbox Game Pass subs in January 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMpsu2"&gt;As always, it’s the cloud growth that has been impressive for Microsoft’s revenues, particularly as businesses adjust to hybrid work. Revenue in intelligent cloud is up 31 percent year over year, including Azure and other cloud services revenue growth of 50 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KE7hjJ"&gt;Office has also had a strong quarter, with Office consumer products and cloud services revenue up 10 percent, and Microsoft 365 consumer subscribers up 19 percent to 54.1 million in total.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3HUxDhWeKppfdEe8NhmBmC9Jor4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957612/GgVRXki.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s business highlights for Q1, 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NwczEo"&gt;Microsoft’s business versions of Office and associated cloud services are also up 18 percent in revenue year over year, with Office 365 commercial revenue up 23 percent. If you’re wondering whether businesses are moving to the cloud, Office commercial products revenue dipped 13 percent year over year, thanks to the ongoing shift to cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3JQTYX"&gt;While Microsoft’s three core business segments are still well balanced in terms of revenue, the intelligent cloud business is gradually pulling away. Productivity and Business Processes, which includes Office, LinkedIn, and Dynamics, makes up around 33 percent of Microsoft’s revenues. Intelligent Cloud, which includes Auzre, server products, and cloud services, now generates 38 percent of Microsoft’s revenues. That leaves More Personal Computing, which includes Xbox, Windows, and Surface, with around 29 percent of Microsoft’s overall revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ycjwF"&gt;Microsoft will now hold an investor call at 2:30PM PT / 5:30PM ET, and we’ll update this article with any relevant comments and information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="18i4M5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google just had another record quarter because or in spite of everything going on</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nsIWe2CVI-_vdDt5LWdjvBQQNYw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70048824/acastro_180130_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="APmJv3"&gt;Google has done it again — raking in more money than ever before for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596592/google-q2-2021-record-revenue-profit-youtube-ad-cloud-search"&gt;the second quarter in a row&lt;/a&gt; as the COVID-19 pandemic continues on. Alphabet’s Q3 2021 earnings show an all-time record revenue of $65.1 billion and record profits for the &lt;em&gt;fifth &lt;/em&gt;quarter in a row at $18.9 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4uluIU"&gt;As we mentioned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596592/google-q2-2021-record-revenue-profit-youtube-ad-cloud-search"&gt;last quarter&lt;/a&gt;, the growth we’re seeing in 2021 is unusually large: a huge leap over 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="i8DibB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="fr" dir="ltr"&gt;Google’s revenue in Q3&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2021: $65.1 billion&lt;br&gt;2020: $46.2 billion&lt;br&gt;2019: $40.5 billion&lt;br&gt;2018: $33.7 billion&lt;br&gt;2017: $27.8 billion&lt;br&gt;2016: $22.5 billion&lt;br&gt;2015: $18.7 billion&lt;br&gt;2014: $16.5 billion&lt;br&gt;2013: $13.8 billion&lt;br&gt;2012: $13.3 billion&lt;br&gt;2011: $9.7 billion&lt;br&gt;2010: $7.3 billion&lt;br&gt;2009: $5.9 billion&lt;/p&gt;— Jon Erlichman (@JonErlichman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JonErlichman/status/1453089818402041857?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="49nLLH"&gt;Revenue increased 41 percent year over year; profits increased nearly 69 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qzkKr2"&gt;Proportionally, Google’s businesses seem to all be doing roughly the same was they were last quarter, just slightly better in each case — like $37.9 billion for Google’s all-important search business this quarter compared to $35.8 billion last quarter. (It’s the jump year-over-year that’s boggles the mind: search is pulling in &lt;em&gt;$11 billion more&lt;/em&gt; this year than it did last year at this time.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ome97u"&gt;YouTube advertising revenue went up from $7 billion last quarter to a record $7.2 billion this quarter, despite some fears that Apple’s iOS Ad Tracking Transparency would have hit YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738940/snap-q3-2021-earnings-ios-ad-tracking"&gt;like it hit Snap&lt;/a&gt; as users get the ability &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;to easily opt out&lt;/a&gt;. But it sounds like YouTube would have seen even bigger gains without the feature; CFO Ruth Porat reportedly said it had a “modest” impact on ad revenue. Last quarter, we saw YouTube revenue nearly double year over year and add $1 billion over the previous quarter, so this isn’t quite as impressive growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1TlPVU"&gt;Google Cloud is still not yet profitable, and is actually bleeding very slightly more, with operating losses of $644 million instead of the $591 million it lost last quarter. Still, cloud revenues grew by an entire $1.5 billion year over year to $4.99 billion from $3.44 billion in 2020, and that’s still an improvement over last quarter’s $4.6 billion in revenue as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uwpk-zXoSnjbk7Cl9atGkDmIE68=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22934831/bfarsace_211014_4802_0002.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, which won’t factor in these earnings because they’re brand-new, but may not next quarter either because Google doesn’t break out hardware.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AG9Lw7"&gt;As usual, the way Google reports earnings makes it impossible to tell whether its hardware products like the Pixel phone, Nest, Chromecast, and Android in general are doing OK or not. Android, Chrome and all of Google’s hardware initiatives are bundled into a catch-all “Google Services” category that includes big hitters like Search and YouTube. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sE0sWt"&gt;One contributor to the growth: Google chief business officer Philipp Schindler explained on the call that while shoppers are returning to physical stores, the company’s also seeing “strong growth in local shopping queries” at the same time. CFO Ruth Porat says the growth is a combination of continued “broadbased” ad spending and continued consumer interest. (Both of these been high since the middle of the pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348652/pandemic-earnings-antitrust-google-facebook-apple-amazon"&gt;but Big Tech has been doing fine throughout&lt;/a&gt;.) Porat says that Google expects less growth from the Google Play app store next quarter due to the impact of &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=google+play+fee+verge&amp;amp;rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS968US968&amp;amp;oq=google+play+fee+verge&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i64j69i60.2707j0j7&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;the new lower fees for subscription apps&lt;/a&gt; that it announced last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xr0MtB"&gt;Google is facing down &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22186994/google-search-antitrust-lawsuit-colorado-nebraska-state-ags"&gt;a bevy of antitrust lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; arguing that at least some of its profits are ill-gotten gains. They suggest Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/11/22378296/google-secret-project-bernanke-ad-buying-competitors-texas"&gt;boosted its own ad buying system over competitors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/13/22329240/judge-rules-google-5-billion-lawsuit-tracking-chrome-incognito-privacy"&gt;that it tracked users even in incognito mode&lt;/a&gt;, collected location data &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/29/22460070/google-difficult-android-privacy-settings-arizona"&gt;even after users turned off location sharing&lt;/a&gt;, tried to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632804/epic-google-lawsuit-unredacted-complaint-antitrust"&gt;pay off phone makers and app developers&lt;/a&gt;, and more. Most recently, it was accused of &lt;a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-throttled-amp-page-speeds-created-format-to-hamper-header-bidding-antitrust-complaint-claims-375466"&gt;throttling webpage load speeds&lt;/a&gt; to promote its own AMP competitor.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iPuU28"&gt;Apple hit Intel hard with its first M1 chips, offering a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;rare step-change improvement in performance&lt;/a&gt; with its 2020 MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro. Less than a year later, it’s already starting to compete with the best GPUs from AMD and Nvidia as well. The new MacBook Pros with M1 Pro and M1 Max offer a first glimpse at how well Apple’s M1 chips can scale to provide raw performance that rivals the discrete graphics cards we typically find inside Windows-powered laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RLeQQw"&gt;Nvidia has been trying to woo many of Apple’s professional and creative customers with its Studio laptops, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22734645/apple-macbook-pro-2021-ports-magsafe-touch-bar-usb-c-future"&gt;Apple has not only managed to fix the mistakes it made&lt;/a&gt; with its MacBook port selection and keyboard, but it’s also scaled up its M1 chips to meet the performance expectations of 14- and 16-inch laptops, too. The result has creative professionals excited, and it’s easy to see why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2UUNIH"&gt;While Windows laptops had looked increasingly tempting to the Mac crowd over the past five years, Apple’s new M1 Pro and M1 Max chips &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22733328/apple-macbook-pro-ports-professional-specs"&gt;shift the balance&lt;/a&gt;, particularly in the GPU realm. They look like early warning shots at the AMD- and Nvidia-powered competition. Apple seems confident it can deliver the same performance as a top discrete graphics card while consuming a lot less power. This is all part of Apple’s ambitious plan to transition its Mac lineup fully to Apple Silicon by the end of 2022 and just a glimpse at what the company must have coming to its most powerful Mac, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161358/mac-pro-review-apple-display-xdr-adobe-hardware-software-price-video"&gt;the towering Mac Pro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple has compared its M1 Max to two RTX 3080 laptops.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7V070m"&gt;Apple proudly compared &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22726444/apple-m1-pro-max-chip-processor-arm-macbook-fastest"&gt;its new M1 Max chip&lt;/a&gt; to two high-end Windows laptops last week, claiming the M1 Max is able to use 100W less power and offer the same relative performance at close to or above Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 3080 mobile chip. While the M1 Max might be Apple’s largest chip it has ever made, it’s still integrating the graphics into a system-on-a-chip (SoC) architecture, compared to the dedicated and separate RTX 3080 cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m8k7Ko"&gt;While there are caveats, it wasn’t just talk: early reviews seem to back up some of Apple’s claims. &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/17024/apple-m1-max-performance-review/6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anandtech &lt;/em&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that both the M1 Pro and M1 Max perform well on productivity-focused loads, with a GFXBench test even putting it close to beating an RTX 3080 laptop equipped with Intel’s Core i9-11980HK &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22423545/intel-tiger-lake-h-mobile-processors-11th-gen-laptops"&gt;flagship notebook processor&lt;/a&gt;. These are the types of loads you’d expect the M1 Max to perform well in, especially given Apple’s work on improving its chips for productivity tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rHZKCi"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhqCC70ZfDM"&gt;YouTuber Dave2D found&lt;/a&gt; the M1 Max was slightly slower than a comparable RTX 3080 system for Adobe Premiere Pro tasks and that M1 Max performance depends on the work involved. While an Adobe Premiere Pro render took 10 minutes and 17 seconds in Dave2D’s testing, an identical render took just 4 minutes and 16 seconds using Apple’s Final Cut Pro software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eqiWIb"&gt;Where the M1 Max and M1 Pro really fall down is in gaming. The M1 Max performs similarly to an RTX 3060 system in &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider. &lt;/em&gt;While midrange gaming might be impressive for an SoC, it’s disappointing compared to Apple’s claims because an RTX 3060 is a notable step down from an RTX 3070, let alone an RTX 3080. &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/17024/apple-m1-max-performance-review/6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anandtech&lt;/em&gt;’s tests&lt;/a&gt; also show the flagship M1 Max offering less than half the performance of an RTX 3080 laptop in &lt;em&gt;Borderlands 3&lt;/em&gt;. We’re still reviewing Apple’s latest MacBook Pros, but we’ve also found the M1 Max is mostly comparable to an RTX 3060 notebook for gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Fi17v5i2_3h2Opzpj16rn7JBP4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22948080/akrales_211020_4803_0024.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s new MacBook Pros include some impressive GPU performance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yAArlN"&gt;Given most macOS cross-platform games are still x86 and the fact macOS has never really been a platform for gaming, it’s no surprise to see the M1 Max struggling here. So another way to think about it is that Apple’s &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; matching the RTX 3060 without the benefit of game developers optimizing for its M1 chips. That’s an impressive start for Apple, even if there’s no indication yet that the Mac will attract optimized games in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rUD5Qj"&gt;It’s also impressive when you consider the power draw and thermal headroom involved. We’ve already seen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21559228/apple-new-macbook-air-pro-difference-arm-m1-fan-thermal-performance"&gt;the difference a fan can make&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;MacBook Pro 13-inch model&lt;/a&gt; compared to the fanless MacBook Air. Now, we’re seeing what it can do with a 140W power adapter and a larger 14- or 16-inch chassis to dissipate the heat. What could Apple do in an iMac or Mac Pro, with plenty of time and plenty of room to build an even bigger and better GPU with fewer thermal and power constraints? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JNGgfz"&gt;“It’s clear that Apple’s ongoing experience with GPUs has paid off with the development of their A-series chips, and now their M1 family of SoCs,” writes &lt;em&gt;Anandtech’s&lt;/em&gt; Andrei Frumusanu. “Put succinctly, the new M1 SoCs prove that Apple can build the kind of big and powerful GPUs that they need for their high-end machines. AMD and NVIDIA need not apply.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="An5Yv9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1450233957350576129"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reporter Mark Gurman says&lt;/a&gt; those bigger chips are already coming, with Apple designing two variations for the next desktop Mac Pro that offer “2x and 4x the number of CPU and GPU cores as the M1 Max.” That will result in up to 40 CPU cores and up to 128 GPU cores on the very high-end Mac Pro models, and it will be the real test of Apple’s ability to scale its M1 advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="j1U9aP"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;For those who think the M1 Pro and M1 Max in the MacBook Pro are impressive, the new Mac Pro desktop is expected to come in at least two variations: 2X and 4X the number of CPU and GPU cores as the M1 Max. That’s up to 40 CPU cores and 128 GPU cores on the high-end.&lt;/p&gt;— Mark Gurman (@markgurman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1450233957350576129?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dZeXgC"&gt;AMD currently supplies Radeon Pro GPUs inside Apple’s existing Mac Pro models, and if Apple’s core count and performance can scale well on the GPU side, then it’s easy to see how Apple’s own GPUs could blow past &lt;a href="https://www.amd.com/en/graphics/radeon-apple-w6000x-series"&gt;AMD’s Radeon PRO W6000X&lt;/a&gt; cards. Apple is already close to mobile RTX 3080s in some tasks with the M1 Max — we’re looking forward to seeing what it will do when Apple’s chip designers can focus less on mobility and more on cooling its hardware for maximum performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xKTRDh"&gt;If more software and even games become optimized to take advantage of the M1 Pro and M1 Max chips, and Apple’s desktop chips deliver the performance improvements we’ve seen so far with M1, Apple could be on course to redefine the performance expectations of desktop PCs, just like it redefined the expectations around laptop chips late last year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blizzard will ‘pause’ plans for an online BlizzCon event in 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NiUi8Q3Gx4OWKZZSJDSRoJYISJo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70048481/acastro_210729_1777_blizzard_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g6XSGA"&gt;The pandemic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22455077/blizzcon-canceled-global-event-blizzconline-blizzard"&gt;canceled BlizzCon 2021&lt;/a&gt;, and it appears that a planned online event next year from Blizzard will also be a scratch. An &lt;a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/blizzcon/23738004/reimagining-blizzcon"&gt;uncredited blog post&lt;/a&gt; says, “We’ve decided to take a step back and pause on planning the previously announced BlizzConline event scheduled for early next year.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MJVSzm"&gt;It didn’t specifically cite a reason, but after revelations surfaced about a company culture rife with sexual harassment and discrimination, the last several months have seen an employee walkout, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607356/blizzard-president-leaving-harassment-protest-brack"&gt;the departure of president J. Allan Brack&lt;/a&gt;, and several competing investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zVYylW"&gt;Most recently, Blizzard &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/22/22740836/blizzard-overwatch-jesse-mccree-name-change-cole-cassidy"&gt;renamed the cowboy hero in &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; to Cole Cassidy&lt;/a&gt;. The employee the character got his name from was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620800/activision-blizzard-departures-lawsuit-diablo-4-director"&gt;one of several high-profile departures following the filing of a sexual harassment lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;. He was also pictured in a room dubbed the “Cosby Suite” during an earlier BlizzCon event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KBo1w4"&gt;Now, Blizzard says that it still sees a role for BlizzCon in communicating with its players, saying after 16 years, “we would also like to take the time to reimagine what a BlizzCon event of the future could look like.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung announces cloud gaming for Tizen TVs, offers no further details</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/25mxnt_k7UwTLdSILEeOcd6kzEQ=/459x0:2880x1614/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70048327/Screen_Shot_2021_10_26_at_11.09.32.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SEqnMp"&gt;Samsung &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/ElMqHkG26sM?t=1517"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s jumping into the cloud gaming arena with an offering for its Tizen smart TV platform. The news came during its Samsung Developer Conference keynote, and the company didn’t provide any more details about what games would be available, what other platforms it would be available on, if any, or when it will launch. Cloud gaming is an area that many of its big tech competitors are getting into, but it’s also an area Samsung has dabbled in before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JJoENz"&gt;In the early 2010s, Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/6/5/3066544/samsung-gaikai-cloud-gaming-service"&gt;worked with a game streaming company called Gaikai&lt;/a&gt; to bring an early version of cloud gaming to its high-end TVs. The pitch was basically the same as it is these days — Samsung Cloud Gaming would let you play games with only a TV, internet connection, and controller. The system &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/7/4/3137144/gaikai-cloud-gaming-samsung-smart-tv-beta-launched"&gt;even launched in beta&lt;/a&gt;, but then Gaikai’s new owner decided to go in a different direction. That owner, by the way, was Sony, and the tech was &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/1/7/5284504/sony-playstation-now-gaikai-based-streaming-service-ps-ps2-ps3"&gt;eventually folded into&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20993828/sony-playstation-now-cloud-gaming-gaikai-onlive-google-stadia-25th-anniversary"&gt;underwhelming PlayStation Now service&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1RP9cf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Samsung will face more competition in 2021 than it would’ve in 2012&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fOkpkf"&gt;In 2021, Samsung will face more competition than it would’ve in the early days from some big tech rivals — Google runs its Stadia service, Amazon is working on Luna, and more gaming-focused companies like Microsoft and Nvidia have their own offerings as well. Generally, though, the goal is to get game streaming services on as many platforms as possible, offering the same gaming experience on phones and TVs. &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/changing-the-daily-life-of-the-future-sdc21-experts-discuss-next-generation-technologies"&gt;On a Q&amp;amp;A on its website&lt;/a&gt;, Samsung says that its goal with its cloud gaming service is allowing “users to play the latest games on their Samsung Smart TV equipped with the Tizen platform.” To me, that reads as a pretty exclusive service, though that could change in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k2kD12"&gt;Samsung also says that it’s working with partners on the service and that it’s using web tech to power it. Samsung didn’t immediately respond to a request for more information about the service, but we’ll update if we hear back. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Springboard: The Secret History of the First Real Smartphone is out now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/64E5gTYOD_9PcpCWYE_Gf49CTQw=/148x0:1771x1082/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69963739/Screen_Shot_2021_10_06_at_4.28.55_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;How the early pioneers of the smartphone almost made it big.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="uAR9g2"&gt;A decade before Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone, a tiny team of renegades imagined and tried to build the modern smartphone. Nearly forgotten by history, a little startup called Handspring tried to make the future before it was ready. In &lt;em&gt;Springboard: the secret history of the first real smartphone&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Dieter Bohn talks to the visionaries at Handspring and dives into their early successes and eventual failures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="80clsG"&gt;It’s a half-hour-long documentary featuring the key players at Palm and Handspring: Donna Dubinsky, Jeff Hawkins, Ed Colligan, and more. It’s one of our most ambitious video projects to date, and we can’t wait to show it to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CO8iuz"&gt;Handspring may no longer be a household name, but it was briefly one of the fastest growing businesses in American history, selling Visor personal digital assistants. But the company had bigger aspirations: it saw a mobile future and took the first steps toward what would become the modern smartphone — even as it faced skepticism from the entire industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TGlhgO"&gt;The dream of the Handspring Treo turned out to be too far ahead of its time — before either the technology inside smartphones or the industry that sold them was ready for it. And a number of bad internal decisions and outside disasters would stall Handspring long enough that Apple would go on to do what Handspring couldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S6Bphu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Springboard&lt;/em&gt; is also a look at an earlier time in tech — when the dot com bubble was bursting, but big tech hadn’t coalesced into five or six titanic monoliths. It was a time when many futures seemed possible, even one where a tiny startup could win the coming smartphone wars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Myh7cb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Springboard&lt;/em&gt; is now streaming worldwide. You can watch it on &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s new app on Android TV, Amazon Fire TV, Roku, or Apple TV. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung promises Matter support for SmartThings hubs, Galaxy devices, TVs, and fridges</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uSVbEIbbZjqWdBg_IQW8HdMP6YQ=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70047799/RF23A9771_Lifestyle_4D_Flex_FH_Counter_depth_BSS_scaled.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung announced its Family Hub refrigerators will be getting support for Matter and built-in SmartThings hubs. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vby8jA"&gt;The Matter smart home train is picking up steam. Following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738584/google-smart-home-developer-summit-2021-matter-thread"&gt;Google’s commitment to the new standard&lt;/a&gt; at its developer conference last week and Apple’s addition of &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10298/"&gt;Matter support in iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; at WWDC, Samsung is now following suit. The company announced a complete adoption of Matter across ​Samsung’s Galaxy devices, televisions, Family Hub appliances, and SmartThings hubs at SDC21, &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.developer.samsung.com_sdc&amp;amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;amp;c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&amp;amp;r=Su-ijVCWM-EpsR7XUMEZwdX5A6GYA0UuAkKC7MrcZ3s&amp;amp;m=puQ5sRH_KYMGh44I4hv3EJ2Y_NgpeBcTFqp_VZE9kbU&amp;amp;s=crqv2qfHy7p2efmbuHUM0-flyO9_AzJybZsWRfYdZnU&amp;amp;e="&gt;its virtual developer conference&lt;/a&gt; being held this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g82fsv"&gt;A founding member of the Matter group (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430666/matter-project-chip-smart-home-partnership-apple-amazon-google-zigbee"&gt;formerly known as Project ChiP&lt;/a&gt;), Samsung also announced that it has joined the &lt;a href="https://www.threadgroup.org/thread-group"&gt;Thread Group Board of Directors&lt;/a&gt;, where it will sit alongside the likes of Apple, Google/Nest, Lutron, Qualcomm, and Silicon Labs to shape the future of the primary protocol that Matter devices will run on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZILIez"&gt;Matter is a new connectivity standard created through an industry collaboration that aims to become the de-facto smart home application protocol. Once it goes live in early 2022, the idea is to simplify the purchase and setup of connected devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FujyOe"&gt;With Matter, consumers should be able to buy any Matter-compliant smart home device and know it will work with their smart home platform and voice assistant of choice, regardless of who made it. They should also be able to set up and connect each device with the same process, using the same app, to make the whole thing as easy to do as screwing in a light bulb used to be.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="smartthings hub-news-smartthings" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GuxXH3Sr4yaMW4pR0B-xDZlwGUk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6384453/products-hub.e9aba541.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The SmartThings hub, which Samsung stopped manufacturing last year, will now be built-in to Samsung televisions and smart fridges.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xrKnV4"&gt;With Samsung SmartThings adopting Matter, it will be possible to add devices that previously couldn’t connect to the SmartThings app or hub and, in reverse, connect SmartThings compatible devices to other Matter-enabled smart home ecosystems. For example, an Eve LED light strip that previously only worked with Apple’s HomeKit could be added to and controlled by the SmartThings app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JNZWcg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;All existing SmartThings hubs will adopt the standard&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mvLESx"&gt;Consumer choice is the significant feature here. If you like using the Google Home app, the SmartThings app, or the Apple Home app to control your devices, you can do so without having to worry if it’s Google-enabled, SmartThings-enabled, or HomeKit-enabled. If it works with Matter, it will work with all three apps and all three compatible voice assistants (along with many more). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jCJUe3"&gt;SmartThings, founded in 2015, was already one of the most open platforms of the big smart home ecosystems, offering support for both Zigbee and Z-Wave protocols, and now, it’s adding Matter. Regarding which SmartThings products will be Matter-enabled, Samantha Fein, Vice President of Business Development and Marketing at SmartThings, said the SmartThings app would be fully Matter-enabled, and all existing SmartThings hubs will adopt the standard, including those now being made by Aeotec. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AiWsUc"&gt;In terms of Samsung products, Samsung will enable Matter as a controller for its televisions and smart appliances, “As well as other Galaxy products,” Fein said. She couldn’t share specific product names as they are still working on the rollout, which will begin next spring. But it’s safe to assume, at this stage, that will include Samsung smartphones to enable easy setup and control of Matter-enabled smart home devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RsP3EL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re utilizing Matter as a central thought for us around what the future smart home looks like”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="lKC6M3"&gt;SmartThings hubs move inside&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="QPS6mc"&gt;Samsung also announced that it will build SmartThings hubs into its TVs and Family Hub refrigerators. This means, in theory, there should be no need for a separate SmartThings hub device. This is something Samsung had previously announced but is only just implementing. Fein couldn’t confirm if there would be upgrades for existing televisions and smart fridges or if this would only apply to new devices going forward. But she did confirm that it will be a software-based “hub,” saying there will not be smart home radios in the products, as there are in the existing stand-alone hubs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9fUO3Z"&gt;However, when pressed about the future potential for a smart fridge or TV to be a Thread Border Router, she hinted that would be possible. “We’re very excited about the future and utilizing Matter as a central thought for us around what the future smart home looks like,” Fein said. Thread is the low-powered mesh protocol that is a primary way Matter devices will communicate, and border routers are devices that will help extend connectivity throughout a home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Va0q2p"&gt;Ultimately, Fein made it clear that SmartThings is moving away from its physical hub-based origins and towards a more integrated hardware experience with Samsung products. The recent launch of &lt;a href="https://developer.samsung.com/smartthings/blog/en-us/2021/08/19/new-smartthings-edge-for-devices-and-automations"&gt;SmartThings Edge&lt;/a&gt;, which allows device-to-device communications to run locally, even without an internet connection, enables a future where multiple hardware radios might not be necessary to keep a smart home running smoothly. “Directionally, that’s what we’re hoping to achieve,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tWrnwG"&gt;As everyone sits around and waits on Matter and its promise of smart home interoperability, there is one company that has been suspiciously silent of late. Amazon has had very little to say on the &lt;em&gt;matter&lt;/em&gt; since announcing its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586377/amazon-echo-matter-standard-dot-show-studio-flex-plus-upgrade"&gt;Echo speakers will get Matter-support&lt;/a&gt; earlier this summer. At this stage, I’ll classify that as slightly worrying for the forward momentum of the adoption of Matter, although we’re not quite at “completely concerning.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2ZyF3s"&gt;Bixby buzz&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5zDef"&gt;Samsung also had a few updates for Bixby, its beleaguered smart voice assistant. While there is no word on whether the Galaxy Home Bixby smart speaker will ever see the light of day — “We ... will provide updates on the availability of Galaxy Home in the near future,” said a spokesperson — Bixby is getting a new ability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hX65l3ydVQfW3oSNVZ0mI0j0c34=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11959599/galaxy_home.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Home Bixby smart speaker still doesn’t have a release date, but the voice assistant has some new tricks. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="369qiR"&gt;The Bixby Home Platform announced at the developers’ conference will bring something close to Alexa and Google Home Routines to the voice assistant. Now, with a single voice command, you can execute multiple tasks. For example, if you say “Bixby, play a movie from Netflix,” you can have more than one SmartThings-connected device respond. So the lights could dim, the soundbar would turn on, and the movie begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRevZh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3X0x7W"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 26th, 2:22PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Clarified that SmartThings Edge allows device-to-device communications to run locally, without using the cloud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xrsJj9"&gt;			&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tzg9ic"&gt;		&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9enuyo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dune: Part Two is officially happening to adapt the other half of the book</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gBYEwa_7mP6CV7H0XmPQUc37C1U=/94x0:1107x675/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70048202/download.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mbijbo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22737214/dune-review-hbo-max-denis-villeneuve-timothee-chalamet-sandworm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is officially getting a sequel, with Warner Bros. and Legendary announcing that &lt;em&gt;Dune: Part Two&lt;/em&gt; will continue the story (and, presumably, adapt the rest of the original novel) that began in the recently released film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XbnXKh"&gt;The sequel is set to hit theaters in October 2023, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/10/dune-sequel-greenlit-by-legendary-warner-bros-theatrical-release-1234862383/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, with director Denis Villeneuve returning for &lt;em&gt;Part Two&lt;/em&gt;. Core cast members like Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsgård, Dave Bautista, and Javier Bardem will presumably return to reprise their roles as well, although there’s no official word on casting yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="GsdQew"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Dune puts an epic franchise ahead of its epic story","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22737214/dune-review-hbo-max-denis-villeneuve-timothee-chalamet-sandworm"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="yISkIX"&gt;It was all but guaranteed that Dune would be getting a sequel: the film literally starts with a “&lt;em&gt;Dune: Part One&lt;/em&gt;” title card and very obviously tees up a second film by abruptly ending just as Paul joins forces with the nomadic Freman warriors (coincidentally, the rough midpoint of the book version of &lt;em&gt;Dune, &lt;/em&gt;too). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CCz6UO"&gt;

We're excited to continue the journey! &lt;a href="https://t.co/mZj68Hnm0A"&gt;pic.twitter.com/mZj68Hnm0A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Legendary (@Legendary) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Legendary/status/1453058884516466691?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p id="L26Ijd"&gt;While &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; debuted concurrently on both HBO Max and in theaters, audiences shouldn’t expect the sequel to get a similar treatment: Warner Bros. has already announced that its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346613/warner-bros-theatrical-releases-2022-hbo-max"&gt;future films will be debuting in theaters&lt;/a&gt;, and a massive sci-fi blockbuster like the Dune sequel is certain to not be an exception to that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yozlo0"&gt;Warner Bros. isn’t being subtle about its franchise ambitions for Dune, either: the studio has already announced plans for an HBO Max prequel series, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/10/18660482/warnermedia-dune-series-denis-villeneuve-television-film-frank-herbert-bene-gesserit-sisterhood"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dune: The Sisterhood&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which will focus on the powerful order of women known as the Bene Gesserit who manipulate galactic politics and wield mysterious powers. There’s no word on a release date (or even basics like casting) yet, but &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/dune-tv-series-hbo-max-showrunner-diane-ademu-john-1235024854/"&gt;Diane Ademu-John was recently hired&lt;/a&gt; as writer, showrunner, and executive producer for the series earlier in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QEmNgi"&gt;Fans will have to wait a while to see the other half of the book on the big screen, though: &lt;em&gt;Dune: Part Two&lt;/em&gt; (or whatever the film ultimately ends up getting called) hasn’t started filming yet, and isn’t expected to hit theaters until October 2023 at the earliest. &lt;/p&gt;
