    <title>Facebook Messenger is getting a built-in bill splitting feature</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lhLLC8"&gt;Facebook parent company Meta is introducing a &lt;a href="https://messengernews.fb.com/2021/12/03/close-out-the-year-with-messengers-new-expression-tools/"&gt;built-in bill splitting feature&lt;/a&gt; in Facebook Messenger that it will test with users in the US beginning next week. The feature could be useful for situations like divvying up a restaurant bill with your friends or splitting a bill with roommates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gf2zN6"&gt;With the feature, you can ask for money from people right in a group chat and see who has paid their portion of the request. You can see how it all works in a series of screenshots below from Meta. The feature arrives shortly after David Marcus, Meta’s cryptocurrency chief and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/9/5794548/david-marcus-leaves-paypal-to-lead-facebook-messaging"&gt;former Messenger lead&lt;/a&gt;, announced he would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/30/22810220/facebook-crypto-david-marcus-novi-diem-meta"&gt;leaving the company&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0rpZBS"&gt;Meta has also added new Group Effects, which let people on Messenger and Instagram video calls use &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22737991/facebook-messenger-group-calls-ar-effects-augmented-reality"&gt;the same augmented reality effects together&lt;/a&gt;, it has made with popular creators. Three are available now, including one that makes it look like your connection is buffering created with Zach King, and one from Emma Chamberlain arrives on December 6th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x98iFQ"&gt;Meta recently introduced new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578633/facebook-messenger-sound-emoji-soundmojis"&gt;“soundmoji”&lt;/a&gt; as well. Two are inspired by &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; (ahead of the new season &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/6/22765226/stranger-things-4-netflix-trailer-eleven-netflix-release-date"&gt;coming out next summer&lt;/a&gt;) and one that plays a clip from Taylor Swift’s “Red.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA funds three companies to develop commercial space stations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DGb_5d8qwbn9neXjfnd4Dd0KZvM=/256x0:1635x919/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70225086/cdff_awardee_3.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Northrop Grumman space station | Image: Northrop Grumman&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tsBh4d"&gt;NASA &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-selects-companies-to-develop-commercial-destinations-in-space"&gt;announced the selection&lt;/a&gt; of three US companies that will receive government funding to further&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;develop private space stations on Thursday. From a set of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhrrzNiauZg"&gt;11 proposals&lt;/a&gt;, NASA selected Blue Origin, Nanoracks LLC, and Northrop Grumman to receive over $400 million in federal funds through three separate Space Act Agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9jQaCw"&gt;NASA &lt;a href="https://spacenews.com/nasa-seeks-proposals-for-commercial-space-station-development/"&gt;began seeking proposals&lt;/a&gt; in July for its Commercial Low Earth Orbit Development (CLD) program, which aims to support the development of commercial space stations. It is a part of a bigger plan to eventually replace the International Space Station (ISS) with commercial space stations. Through this model, NASA would be a customer of the commercial space industry, allowing it to save on costs and focus on basic research and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwdfrY"&gt;Blue Origin is set to receive $130 million to develop Orbital Reef, a free-flying space station concept the company first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744526/blue-origin-space-station-orbital-reef-announcement"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in October. Orbital Reef is being developed in partnership with Sierra Space, maker of the winged spaceplane Dream Chaser. Blue Origin says the station&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;will be operational by the second half of the decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mdTxZX"&gt;Nanoracks LLC is receiving $160 million for its Starlab station concept. Also announced in October, Starlab is a &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/voyager-nanoracks-and-lockheeds-starlab-is-the-latest-sign-that-the-low-earth-orbit-economy-is-coming/"&gt;collaboration with&lt;/a&gt; Voyager Space and Lockheed Martin. Designed to hold up to four astronauts and conduct advanced research on biology, materials science and more, Starlab is targeted for launch in 2027 on a single flight, according to the NASA press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SnsLhB"&gt;Northrop Grumman’s $125.6 million award will give it the opportunity to develop a commercial space station using existing technologies like its Cygnus spacecraft, which currently ferries cargo to the ISS. Northrop is working with Dynetics on its concept for a modular space station, with other partners to be announced in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SFxCTg"&gt;Axiom Space, a Houston company that was the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-selects-first-commercial-destination-module-for-international-space-station"&gt;first awarded&lt;/a&gt; funds in January 2020 to develop its commercial module to be added to the ISS, said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Axiom_Space/status/1466504467113816065/photo/1"&gt;in a statement &lt;/a&gt;on Twitter that it did not bid to receive one of the CLD awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9d1Q4k"&gt;According to NASA, the awards are the first part of a two-phase approach to ensure a smooth transition to commercial stations in LEO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QGghu3"&gt;The first phase, expected to continue through 2025, will allow the grant recipients to create a plan and designs that meet both private sector and government needs. During the second phase, NASA wants to certify these stations for human astronauts to use and, ultimately, start using them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook took down a fake Swiss scientist account that was part of an international misinfo campaign</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="facebook stock art" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V7uzEkVOjzTOwjK9H9FpjPV8FVw=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70224911/acastro_180928_1777_facebook_hack_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Pi9PXp"&gt;Buried deep within Facebook’s November report on &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/November-2021-CIB-Report.pdf"&gt;Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior&lt;/a&gt; is a tale of international intrigue that seems more like a Netflix drama than an attempted disinformation campaign (although the way &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22815541/netflix-thanksgiving-mom-viral-twitter-thread-feature-film"&gt;Netflix mines social media&lt;/a&gt; for ideas these days, maybe stay tuned). On July 24th, a Swiss biologist named Wilson Edwards claimed on Facebook and Twitter that the US was pressuring World Health Organization (WHO) scientists studying the origins of COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qbV7TG"&gt;His claims spread quickly on social media, as such claims are wont to do, and within a week’s time, the &lt;em&gt;Global Times&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;People’s Daily&lt;/em&gt;, two state-run Chinese media outlets, were denouncing Wilson Edwards’ claims as “intimidation” by the US. Wilson Edwards created his Facebook account two days after &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/07/22/1019244601/china-who-coronavirus-lab-leak-theory?t=1633552763404"&gt;China refused to accept a plan&lt;/a&gt; by the WHO for a second phase study into the origins of the coronavirus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="id__nda7cd9rc3b"&gt;Have you guessed the plot twist yet? Turns out, according to the Swiss Embassy in Beijing, that there is no such Swiss citizen by the name Wilson Edwards. “If you exist, we would like to meet you! But it is more likely that this is a fake news, and we call on the Chinese press and netizens to take down the posts,”&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SwissEmbChina/status/1425042973289504770"&gt; the embassy tweeted&lt;/a&gt; from its official account on August 10th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0e1mGK"&gt;Facebook investigated and removed the Wilson Edwards account the same day the Swiss embassy tweeted. Ben Nimmo, global IO threat intel lead (excellent title for our drama) at Facebook parent company Meta, writes that the Wilson Edwards account was part of a misinformation campaign that originated in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R1vtFyjn_XFgxbp6TglvnkpiTd0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23060925/wilson_edwards.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Meta&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Faked profile picture of one of the fake accounts Meta says liked the post by “Wilson Edwards”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rmGT7e"&gt;“In essence, this campaign was a hall of mirrors, endlessly reflecting a single fake persona,” Nimmo says. Meta’s investigation found that nearly the entire initial spread of the Wilson Edwards story on Facebook was inauthentic: “the work of a multi-pronged, largely unsuccessful influence operation,” which brought together hundreds of fake accounts as well as some authentic accounts that belonged to employees of “Chinese state infrastructure companies across four continents.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cqvOaw"&gt;Only a handful of real people engaged with Wilson Edwards, Meta says, despite the 524 Facebook accounts, 20 Facebook pages, four Facebook groups, and 86 Instagram accounts that the company has removed as part of its investigation. The scammers spent less than $5,000 on Facebook and Instagram ads as part of the campaign and used VPNs to conceal the accounts’ origins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ToF13y"&gt;“This is consistent with what we’ve seen in our research of covert influence operations over the past four years: we haven’t seen successful IO campaigns built on fake engagement tactics,” Nimmo says. “Unlike elaborate fictitious personas that put work into building authentic communities to influence them, the content liked by these crude fake accounts would typically be only seen by their ‘fake friends.’” (And we all know what &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_txiRmH8NDY&amp;amp;ab_channel=FallOutBoy-Topic"&gt;happens to sham friends&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wTWjyk"&gt;The cluster of fake accounts that Meta connected to the Wilson Edwards scheme, along with some people associated with information security firm Silence in China, apparently has made (unsuccessfully, Meta says) other attempts at influence operations that were “typically small-scale and of negligible impact.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LGzWbD"&gt;It’s not the most exciting end to our story, but at least Wilson Edwards won’t try to catfish any other international health organizations. Now, if we could just get someone to rein in the tenacious people who keep &lt;a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2021/05/hang-auto-warranty-robocalls"&gt;calling about the car warranty&lt;/a&gt; I didn’t know I had... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YCae1L"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Walmart’s in-store Gamer Drop might be your best shot at a PS5, Xbox, or Switch OLED</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rt0PYBOnRxkLcojJ-czXOIwglQI=/0x24:672x472/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70224897/k2__dd3aea10_166c_434f_9b7f_7b3287ed4b4e.v1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walmart’s Gamer Drop prominently features the big three new consoles that are difficult to get.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Walmart&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xEHRxJ"&gt;Walmart has announced a new &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fcp%2Fgamer-drop&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Gamer Drop event&lt;/a&gt; coming to select stores on December 11th, where the retailer is promising to have the latest gaming titles and consoles. This marks the first in-store console restock from Walmart, and it’s billing it as a holiday shopping event, complete with discounts and exclusive gear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="prXoF1"&gt;Details are a bit sparse, but &lt;a href="https://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/4ff9c6c9-4866/k2-_331621d6-7642-4095-82d1-ecac1d3f3bc9.v1.pdf"&gt;the posted circular on Walmart’s website&lt;/a&gt; prominently features the major consoles, including the Nintendo Switch OLED Model, Xbox Series X / S, and both models of the PlayStation 5 with the note of “Available in-store or online at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=http%3A%2F%2FWalmart.com%2FGamerDrop.&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart.com/GamerDrop.&lt;/a&gt;” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jolFad"&gt;This event is exclusive to select Walmart stores. You can find the closest Walmart that’s participating in the Gamer Drop event on Saturday, the 11th, by searching your address or zip code on the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fcp%2Fgamer-drop&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Gamer Drop&lt;/a&gt; page. Listed stores indicate Gamer Drop hours of 10:30AM to 7PM, which is a limited window compared to store hours of many Walmart stores. We have reached out to Walmart for further details and will keep an eye out for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>‘Face with tears of joy’ is once again the most-used emoji</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-jFvW61PaVAqelRr8LMowUZsvBg=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70224782/emoji.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;24 face with tears of joy emoji, each more terrifying than the last.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HwM6qY"&gt;Until recently, I was a firm believer in the &lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/slightly-smiling-face/"&gt;traditional smiley emoji&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s cute!” I used to think, as I happily used it to indicate my gentle amusement at everything from puns to fun weekend plans. But apparently, this was a mistake, and when I thought I was expressing sincere happiness, I was actually sending an emoji that’s “colossally insulting in every conceivable way,” &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/aug/11/dont-put-on-a-happy-face-are-you-using-the-smiley-emoji-all-wrong"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJsLOX"&gt;It seems the rest of the world agrees, and the “slightly smiling face,” to use its full name, doesn’t feature in the &lt;a href="https://home.unicode.org/emoji/emoji-frequency/"&gt;top 10 of the most used emoji in 2021&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, according to data from the Unicode Consortium, the slightly smiling face isn’t even in the top 20. It’s down at number 28, sandwiched between “clapping hands” and “flushed face.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-qZ_7v9HoVQWxM68avh_YHTrh9A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23060869/msedge_76CGmm0r7F.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Unicode Consortium&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;How the ranking of the top 10 emoji has changed, according to Unicode Consortium data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4e3AbA"&gt;Instead of embracing the subtle joys of the slightly smiling face, the world has continued its love affair with “face with tears of joy,” a crass, blunt instrument of an emoji that leaves no room for subtlety or ambiguity. It’s reportedly been on top since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/3/16602352/face-with-tears-of-joy-emoji-most-popular-apple-study"&gt;at least 2017&lt;/a&gt;, and in 2021, it accounted for over 5 percent of emoji sent online. Ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o2rNOr"&gt;Jokes aside, it’s interesting to see from this data how broadly consistent the emoji we use has been, even as the world has been turned upside down by the pandemic. In its blog, the Unicode Consortium points out that the top 10 emoji has only seen one change between the two years, and even then, it was to swap two very similar emoji (“two hearts” with “smiling face with 3 hearts”). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6kCxCP"&gt;That’s not to say there weren’t any big movers. The birthday cake emoji shot up from 113 to 25, while the balloon gently floated from 139 to 48. My personal favorite, the pleading face, also broke the top 20, rising from 97 to 14. But surprisingly, actual pandemic-related emoji haven’t seen much of a change, like the &lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/microbe/"&gt;microbe emoji&lt;/a&gt;, which barely made it into the top 500 (there are 3,663 emoji overall, in case you’re wondering). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6vobLY"&gt;Beyond this sort of data being just plain interesting, it’s useful for the Unicode Consortium to understand which emoji are most popular as it decides which characters to add next. The way emoji are created is a surprisingly interesting process, and you can read about it in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21327599/how-to-make-emoji-yawning-face-waffle-proposal-unicode"&gt;this article from my colleague Jay Peters&lt;/a&gt; (who submitted proposals for the yawning face and waffle emoji).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="byphg7"&gt;Still, at least there’s hope for us slightly smiling face fans out there. The emoji saw a pretty dramatic increase in popularity between 2019 and 2021, where it previously sat down at the 50th mark. At this rate, we might yet make it into the top 10 [fingers crossed emoji].&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s ‘Spartacus’ could be PlayStation’s answer to Xbox Game Pass</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4JHBPv"&gt;Sony is planning to create an Xbox Game Pass-like subscription service, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-03/playstation-plans-new-service-to-take-on-xbox-game-pass"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company already offers two subscription services, PlayStation Plus (which is required for the majority of online multiplayer games) and PlayStation Now (which offers a catalog of games to download or stream), and they will reportedly be merged in this new offering. Sony will likely keep the PlayStation Plus brand, reporter Jason Schreier &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1466821381568536578"&gt;said on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, but “phase out” PlayStation Now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HKFRZJ"&gt;This new service, which is codenamed Spartacus, would have three tiers. One would offer current PlayStation Plus perks, another would include a catalog of PS4 and “eventually” PS5 games, and a third would have “extended demos, game streaming and a library of classic PS1, PS2, PS3 and PSP games,” &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports, adding that it’s “likely” to be available on PlayStation 4 as well as the PS5. The company would launch the service in the spring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d9Af19"&gt;Sony didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; adds that some details of the service, including its membership tiers, may not yet be finalized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xkxAtC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sony’s service could run on Microsoft’s cloud platform&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MhxR6E"&gt;The company is also “putting resources into expanding its efforts in cloud gaming,” &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported, perhaps to keep up with efforts like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738006/nvidia-rtx-3080-geforce-now-features-price-release-date-streaming-option"&gt;Nvidia’s RTX 3080 tier of GeForce Now&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714067/xbox-cloud-gaming-custom-xbox-series-x-hardware-upgrade"&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox Series X upgrade for xCloud&lt;/a&gt;. However, it’s unclear if Spartacus would run on Microsoft Azure following the deal signed between Microsoft and Sony &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/20/18632374/microsoft-sony-cloud-gaming-partnership-amazon-google"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;; if it does, it would mean that Sony’s service runs on the same platform as its competitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DFK7Lh"&gt;This new Spartacus service sounds like it would put Sony on par with Microsoft’s Game Pass Ultimate subscription, which allows people to play online multiplayer, access a huge library of titles from Microsoft and other companies, and stream games from the cloud. Sony also appears to be emulating Microsoft’s approach to offer &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-game-pass%23join&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F3%2F22816087%2Fsony-playstation-5-game-subscription-service-xbox-games-pass-now-spartacus" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;multiple tiers&lt;/a&gt; of services — only the $15 per month Game Pass Ultimate plan offers cloud gaming, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GmqYW3"&gt;However, one of the key perks of Game Pass and Game Pass Ultimate is day-one access to Microsoft’s first-party titles, but that might not be available with Spartacus. Schreier said in a tweet that “don’t expect Sony to include its big new games day one like Game Pass does.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Once you’re done with Arcane, play this League of Legends RPG</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0cHOURATf2fIE7mbtyTwerqt9Ls=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70224455/38_Artstyle_Group.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1lpFDA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt; isn’t just one of the best new animated shows on Netflix — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22763818/netflix-league-of-legends-arcane-review"&gt;it’s also a great introduction to the vast and often inscrutable world of &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. If you’ve finished the show and have found yourself intrigued by the fantasy realm of Runeterra, you might be wondering where to go next. There are a few options, but thankfully developer Riot has just released a new role-playing game that’s a perfect next step for budding fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1D1Ybr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ruined King: A League of Legends Story&lt;/em&gt; is available now on the Switch, PC, PS4, and Xbox One, and it’s a bite-sized RPG that lets you explore a different part of &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; mythology. It stars a handful of iconic characters — including the hulking Braum and the kraken-wielding priestess Illaoi — and lets you wander through the port city of Bilgewater as you investigate a mysterious phenomenon known as the Black Myst, which eventually leads you to the unsettling Shadow Isles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qgFz3"&gt;Part of what makes &lt;em&gt;Ruined King&lt;/em&gt; such a great follow to &lt;em&gt;Arcane &lt;/em&gt;is that — unlike the multiplayer-focused &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; — it’s completely story-driven. While many of &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt;’s characters and locations have long, detailed backstories, you don’t get much of that from the main game. It’s more like background, something you can dig into if you want, but it’s not really a necessary component of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4z7e_pfuz0Y3O6vPahhJL2xEoaE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23060721/01_Battle_Hullbreaker.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KeY9Ii"&gt;But here, story is the whole point. It’s a chance to really spend some time with these characters and get to know them. There’s lots of fun banter (it’s even fully voiced) and gorgeous comic book-style cutscenes that set up important moments. The game also provides also a great chance to linger in the world; I loved wandering around the bustling districts of Bilgewater, rendered with a &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt;-style isometric look, going from seedy back alleys to opulent mansions. The places feel alive and full of detail. You can even go fishing. The main &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; game tells you these are important places and heroes, but in &lt;em&gt;Ruined King,&lt;/em&gt; you find out why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="osWKph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ruined King&lt;/em&gt; also happens to be a solid RPG. Most notably, it has a clever turn-based battle system involving lanes, which essentially means you can decide whether attacks should be quick or strong, with obvious pros and cons for each. There are also environmental hazards and bonuses that impact you depending on how you time those actions. It adds a nice layer of strategy to even standard battles, especially once you get a chance to explore all of the different characters, each of whom has very different abilities. Illaoi, with her ability to summon ghostly tentacles that serve as writhing minions, is my favorite. It’s all fairly straightforward stuff if you’ve played a lot of RPGs, but it’s polished and has just enough of a twist to feel fresh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mEAsqL"&gt;Ever since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20915506/riot-games-league-of-legends-10th-anniversary-marc-merrill-interview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; turned 10&lt;/a&gt;, Riot has been steadily expanding its fictional universe in different ways. There’s a digital card game, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772338/league-of-legends-spinoff-netflix-games-nintendo-switch-hextech-mayhem"&gt;a rhythm game&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22187980/riot-games-league-of-legends-mmo-greg-street"&gt;upcoming MMO&lt;/a&gt; and fighting game, comic books, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21408504/league-of-legends-tellstones-board-game-spinoff"&gt;even an in-universe board game&lt;/a&gt;. So far, &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ruined King&lt;/em&gt; are the best examples of how this strategy can work. While the core &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; can be as demanding as it is engrossing, these latest efforts are much more palatable. They also do a better job at showing what makes Runeterra such an interesting fantasy universe in the first place. Unfortunately, the success of these does come with a side effect: I can’t stop reading up on &lt;em&gt;LoL&lt;/em&gt; lore.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon charges sellers fees that are high enough to offset losses from Prime, a new report says</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pzzsRC0v7xmxTZx36vQNT8zOFNg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70224341/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A new report says Amazon charges small businesses fees that eat into profits | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BYd1WF"&gt;The massive reach of Amazon’s e-commerce platform is appealing for any small business that wants to sell its products online. But a new report suggests that the cost of doing business can become a Faustian bargain for a third-party seller, as the fees that Amazon charges them can quickly eat into profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WIVZjC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ilsr.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ILSR-AmazonTollRoad-KeyFindings-Final.pdf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon Toll Road,&lt;/em&gt; a report&lt;/a&gt; from the nonprofit Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR), found that Amazon charged third-party sellers a total of $121 billion in fees this year alone. According to the report, written by ILSR co-director Stacy Mitchell, those fees — for things like advertising, referrals, and shipping — usually mean that small businesses lose money to Amazon; Mitchell said that in 2014, sellers paid Amazon $19 of every $100 in sales, and today, it’s more like $34 per $100 in sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cvB9Ay"&gt;And, Amazon obscures the profit it makes from these small businesses in its financial reports, lumping it in with other less lucrative divisions “because showing that they generate these profits from small businesses is not a good look,” Mitchell said in an interview with&lt;em&gt; The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cXpZY4"&gt;But its Amazon Prime subscription service — believed to be a &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2016/07/12/158869/how-amazon-loses-on-prime-and-still-wins/"&gt;money loser&lt;/a&gt; for the e-commerce giant — provides Amazon a loyal base of shoppers who want to get their money’s worth of free shipping. The profits Amazon makes from seller fees subsidize the losses from its Prime division, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="l3BXXX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“...you’re damned if you don’t sell on Amazon and damned if you do”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jF9r3P"&gt;“If you’re a company that makes or retails consumer products, you’re damned if you don’t sell on Amazon and damned if you do,” Mitchell said. A small retailer could try to use its own website to reach customers, but Mitchell says that’s often akin to “basically hanging your shingle out on a dirt road because of the role that Prime has in making Amazon often the first and only place customers go when shopping on the internet.” Former Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in his final annual letter to investors in April that by that point, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22404044/amazon-earnings-q1-2021-performance-profit-operating-income"&gt;Amazon Prime had grown to 200 million&lt;/a&gt; subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sC4abE"&gt;There are other e-commerce platforms where a small business could sell its products online, theoretically charging customers on those sites different prices than its Amazon customers. But if the seller also wants to continue selling on Amazon, it has to keep the same prices across the board. Under Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/G5TUVJKZHUVMN77V"&gt;Fair Pricing Policy&lt;/a&gt;, a seller could be penalized if Amazon discovers the seller charging customers a different price for its products on other e-commerce platforms. Penalties can range from removing the seller’s product from the prominent “buy box” on a product listing page, all the way up to termination of selling privileges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o6DpC5"&gt;Amazon says the Fair Pricing Policy is aimed at pricing practices that “harm customer trust,” but the ILSR report concluded that it usually means customers may end up paying more overall because third-party sellers have to inflate the prices they charge customers to be able to pay Amazon’s fees and turn a profit, Mitchell explained.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y39Tm0"&gt;Brooke Oberwetter, an Amazon spokesperson, said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the ILSR report was “intentionally misleading” and that it conflated Amazon’s selling fees with the cost of “optional services” that some sellers purchase, like logistics and advertising. Those fees range from 8 to 17 percent of the selling price, Oberwetter said. “These selling fees are highly competitive when compared to other selling options such as marketplaces like Walmart, Target, eBay, Etsy, and others, or direct-to-consumer via companies like Shopify and BigCommerce.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lWIoxH"&gt;In addition, Oberwetter said, some Amazon third-party sellers buy its Fulfillment by Amazon logistics service, which she said offered fulfillment services 30 percent cheaper than other logistics providers, as well as faster shipping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XbYne1"&gt;“Some sellers also choose to purchase advertising from Amazon or use other advertising providers like Google, Facebook, and Twitter,” Oberwetter added. “Sellers are not required to use our logistics or advertising services, and only use them if they provide incremental value to their businesses.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GA1ca2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon says most of its fees are optional&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="esciaW"&gt;This assertion that the seller fees are not mandatory echoes testimony Bezos gave &lt;a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?474236-1/heads-facebook-amazon-apple-google-testify-antitrust-law"&gt;before Congress&lt;/a&gt; last year. Asked by Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon (D-PA) about what appeared to be sharp increases in the fees sellers pay to Amazon, Bezos said, “When you see these fees going up, what’s really happening is that sellers are choosing to use more of our services that we make available.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6PysCr"&gt;The ILSR report, however, posits that the fees are all but necessary if sellers want their products to be visible in places like Amazon’s “customers who also viewed this item” carousels on search results pages. And unlike other forms of advertising, where a business places ads, reaches customers, then sells to those customers directly, Amazon’s policies limit most sellers from building these kinds of direct customer relationships. But, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22399312/amazon-sellers-email-customers-directly-products-sales-brand-registry"&gt;Amazon did test a feature&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year that would let sellers contact customers directly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YwvJsB"&gt;Mitchell writes in the report that an effective policy solution would separate Amazon’s divisions — marketplace, retail, AWS, and logistics — into standalone companies. She said a breakup of Amazon seems more likely than it has in recent years; the new chair of the Federal Trade Commission, Lina Khan, “sees the dangers of big tech.” Earlier this year, Amazon actually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557456/amazon-lina-khan-recusal-petition-federal-trade-commission-antitrust"&gt;petitioned to have Khan recuse herself&lt;/a&gt; from being involved in proceedings that dealt with the company. And while there’s been an overall &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346828/lina-khan-ftc-commissioner-biden-nomination-facebook-google-doj-garland"&gt;increase in antitrust scrutiny&lt;/a&gt; by President Biden’s administration and from Congress, Mitchell notes, whether there’s enough momentum behind the renewed focus on antitrust issues remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yr2mLi"&gt;“A year ago, if you had asked me would we have&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/antitrust-tech-bills-gain-bipartisan-momentum-in-senate-11637836202"&gt; bipartisan antitrust bills in Congress &lt;/a&gt;with the kinds of co-sponsorship we’re seeing, I would have been surprised by how much progress has been made,” she said. “We’ve gotten a lot further a lot faster than expected.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s MagSafe Battery Pack is down to its lowest price yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The MagSafe Battery Pack looks a little funny on an iPhone 12 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yjh03vKfotBDZx7d25q-o9TFivQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70223961/DSC02786_dbohn_verge.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s MagSafe Battery Pack is compatible with all iPhone 12 and 13 models.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NBZiJp"&gt;Today marks one week since Black Friday (good riddance). The shopping weekend and Thanksgiving holiday may already feel as though they happened ages ago, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22796663/cyber-monday-2021-best-deals-still-available-laptops-phones-tvs-headphones-gaming"&gt;some deals have stuck around&lt;/a&gt; while new ones continue to crop up. We can’t stop time from flying by, but we can keep serving you the best tech deals possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xaw2WW"&gt;Kicking things off, the Apple MagSafe Battery Pack has reached a new all-time low price. The portable battery was released in the summer, and it didn’t take long to see some decent discounts. Now, just in time for holiday gifting, you can pick up the MagSafe Battery Pack for $75 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MJWY3AM-A-MagSafe-Battery/dp/B099BWY7WT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf740Pxygf8" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; — a whole $25 off. This battery pack may not be able to fill an iPhone 12 or 13 from empty, but it’s one of the handiest ways to keep them topped off. Also, it can play the role of a MagSafe wireless charging puck for your AirPods. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588777/apple-magsafe-battery-review-size-iphone-12-mini" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="IFo3jL"&gt;You can score a great deal on one of the best all-in-one VR headsets, the Oculus Quest 2 (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751220/facebook-portal-oculus-quest-meta-horizon-renaming" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;soon to be known as the Meta Quest 2&lt;/a&gt;). Walmart is currently offering a &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FOculus-Quest-2-Advanced-All-In-One-Virtual-Reality-Headset-64-GB-refurbished%2F612192172&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeal120321" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;refurbished Oculus Quest 2 with 64GB of storage for just $199&lt;/a&gt;. That is $100 less than you can currently get the 128GB model. While it’s a little more slim on storage, that crisp Benjamin you’ll save can go toward &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a whol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=VergeDealsRoundup12321&amp;amp;murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2F&amp;amp;LSNSUBSITE=LSNSUBSITE" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;e bunch of games or a &lt;em&gt;Super&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=VergeDealsRoundup12321&amp;amp;murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2F1830168170427369&amp;amp;LSNSUBSITE=LSNSUBSITE" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;natural &lt;/em&gt;subscription&lt;/a&gt;. We wouldn’t normally recommend this deal, but it puts us at ease knowing that this refurbished model carries a full one-year warranty through Oculus and a 30-day return policy. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="1FtLKn"&gt;Shifting from VR gaming to laptop gaming, the Microsoft Store is offering the first major discount on the Razer Blade 14. Normally selling for $2,200, you can get &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergedailydeal120321&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Frazer-blade-14-rz09-0370bea3-r3u1-gaming-laptop%2F90bjcrzcrmd1%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%253aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer’s 14-inch gaming laptop for $2,001&lt;/a&gt; ($200 off). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WawB8P"&gt;The newest Blade laptop packs a punch in the performance department, despite being smaller than the Blade 15. It features a fast Ryzen 9 processor, Nvidia’s RTX 3070 GPU, 16GB of RAM, 1TB SSD, and 165Hz QHD display. The Blade 14 takes most of the graphical chops of the Blade 15 Advanced and puts it in a more portable package.  &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22548663/razer-blade-14-review-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-9-5900hx-nvidia-rtx-3070" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="YuvUEJ"&gt;If you’re in need of a laptop more for work and productivity duties than gaming, the Acer Swift 5 has a lot to offer in a lightweight package. The 14-inch laptop weighs in at just a bit over two pounds, yet it packs adequate power and storage for the price. You can get the Swift 5 from either &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Acer-i7-1165G7-Graphics-Antimicrobial-SF514-55TA-74EC/dp/B08JQKMFFB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Facnxa6saa001.html&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeal120321" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt; for $300 off the normal cost, bringing the price down to just $1,000. This is a sizable discount for this well-rounded laptop that came out at the end of 2020. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22256779/acer-swift-5-2021-review-14-inch-laptop-specs-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Y4fH68"&gt;A recent inclusion in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22752612/smart-home-tech-holiday-gift-guide-2021-kitchen-lighting-speakers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;home tech holiday gift guide&lt;/a&gt;, the Ember Mug 2 is a smart mug that keeps your beverage hot for up to 80 minutes with its rechargeable battery. You may feel some reservations over having &lt;em&gt;one more &lt;/em&gt;smart device to worry about charging, but the Ember can provide endless heat for your drink, so long as it’s resting on its coaster. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf73MClgSYs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; has the larger, 14-ounce version in blue for $100 — a discount of $30. This brings it down to the same price as the smaller, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf75Fnkgzid" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;10-ounce Mug 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter removes thousands of accounts linked to Chinese Xinjiang propaganda</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T5l7ubHpToG8sq5gi_KMsEQk9qM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70223776/acastro_180827_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A3qGoY"&gt;Twitter has removed a total of 2,160 accounts linked to Chinese regional and state propaganda campaigns, the &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/disclosing-state-linked-information-operations-we-ve-removed"&gt;social network has announced&lt;/a&gt; as part of its latest data release on misinformation campaigns. The accounts were attempting to push back against allegations of human rights abuses by the Chinese government against the Uyghur population in Xinjiang. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ESS6oQ"&gt;Alongside it, Twitter has also detailed a campaign it discovered in Tanzania, which used copyright complaints to harass members and supporters of the FichuaTanzania human rights group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WutKoG"&gt;Twitter says 2,048 of the accounts “amplified Chinese Communist Party narratives related to the treatment of the Uyghur population,” while a further 112 were connected to a private company backed by the regional government. But according to analysis from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), one of the three research partners which Twitter shared information with, much of the propaganda was “embarrassingly” produced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="haDF7Y"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;  NEW REPORT  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ASPI_ICPC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@ASPI_ICPC&lt;/a&gt;'s report '&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StopXinjiangRumors?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#StopXinjiangRumors&lt;/a&gt;: The CCP’s decentralised disinformation campaign' the authors analyse two Chinese state-linked networks seeking to influence discourse about Xinjiang across  Twitter &amp;amp; YouTube.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Read here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/MmS3ybuj6B"&gt;https://t.co/MmS3ybuj6B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— ASPI Cyber Policy (@ASPI_ICPC) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ASPI_ICPC/status/1466361477917405184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DYqkdB"&gt;According to research from the thinktank &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/03/xinjiang-twitter-closes-thousands-of-china-state-linked-accounts-spreading-propaganda"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, each network put out over 30,000 tweets, often disputing evidence of human rights abuses, as well as attempting to push the Chinese government’s version of events. But despite the seriousness of the abuses, much of the data analyzed from the campaign was linked to pornography, Korean soap opera content, and spam accounts, likely because the network had taken over and reused existing accounts. Hundreds of the tweets were linked to an account with the handle @fuck_next, while others tried and failed to tag former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SSe95s"&gt;Most of the accounts had a small number of followers, or none at all, and the overwhelming majority of their tweets had seen zero engagement. The exception was when Chinese officials retweeted them, introducing them to a much broader audience. It’s content that’s unlikely to win over new supporters but is “propaganda appealing to the base,” ASPI researcher Albert Zhang tells &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fssO6Y"&gt;In contrast, the operation linked to Tanzania appears to have been much more sophisticated, although it involved a comparatively smaller number of 268 accounts. In a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/shelbygrossman/status/1466395071276740608"&gt;Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt;, a Stanford Internet Observatory researcher who worked on the report, Shelby Grossman, explained that the pro-government network would take anti-government content posted by activists, republish it on an external website with a date that predated the tweet, and then report the tweet to Twitter on copyright grounds to have it removed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ksabvi"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;2/ A pro-Tanzanian government network adversarially leveraged copyright reporting to harass activists. The scheme was fascinating. Stylized scheme below: &lt;a href="https://t.co/zEo5MttjQK"&gt;pic.twitter.com/zEo5MttjQK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Shelby Grossman (@shelbygrossman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/shelbygrossman/status/1466395071276740608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N0Np6v"&gt;“The tactic sometimes worked,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/shelbygrossman/status/1466395081657647106"&gt;Grossman writes&lt;/a&gt;, “Twitter suspended 2 activist accounts, though both were ultimately reinstated.” But it’s a difficult situation for the activists to end up in, since countering the copyright complaint might compromise the source of the anti-government material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FEIEoB"&gt;The treatment of Xinjiang’s Uyghur population has been referred to as a “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/19/us/politics/trump-china-xinjiang.html"&gt;genocide&lt;/a&gt;” and is said to include mass internments, reeducation, forced labor, and even sterilization. Twitter has publicly clashed with Chinese authorities about the human rights abuses before and, in January this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242086/twitter-chinese-embassy-in-us-uighur-muslim-tweet-dehumanization"&gt;locked its US embassy’s Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; for referring to Uyghur women as “baby-making machines” prior to government intervention. As of this writing, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ChineseEmbinUS"&gt;the account&lt;/a&gt; appears to still be locked and has not tweeted since January 9th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m9BhiF"&gt;As well as these China and Tanzania-linked operations, Twitter says it’s removed accounts related to misinformation campaigns from Mexico, Russia, Uganda, and Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;
