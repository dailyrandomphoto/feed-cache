    <title>Apple rubberstamped Trump’s request to secretly scoop up data on two members of Congress</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FBbcJ8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/11/technology/apple-google-leak-investigation-data-requests.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;is reporting&lt;/a&gt; on a new wrinkle in the story of how the Trump administration’s Department of Justice used Big Tech &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22528853/trump-force-apple-democrat-house-intelligence-committee-data"&gt;to spy on two members of the House Intelligence Committee&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to track down leaks to the press — namely, that Apple didn’t fight it, perhaps never had a chance to fight it, because the company rubberstamped the request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="rGvdjG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Trump administration forced Apple to secretly reveal at least two Democrats’ data","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22528853/trump-force-apple-democrat-house-intelligence-committee-data"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="13T3Uy"&gt;Apple didn’t even know it was handing over the records of Congressman Adam Schiff (D-CA), then the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, it told the publication. In a statement, Apple said it didn’t know what the investigation was about, and couldn’t have known unless it dug through user accounts itself. So it was handled like the vast majority of the 250 requests the company received from the government each week: approved. “An Apple paralegal complied and provided the information,” reports the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nWJTaa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Apple did not realize that data on two Democratic lawmakers was part of a request by the Trump Justice Department. It was handled by a paralegal like a routine request.&lt;a href="https://t.co/kS51EUmnCp"&gt;https://t.co/kS51EUmnCp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jack Nicas (@jacknicas) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jacknicas/status/1403471132435623936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="myl4ao"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;More details: The grand jury subpoena sought metadata for 109 identifiers, specifically 73 phone numbers and 36 email addresses. Apple said it assumes ISPs and other tech companies were also sent similar requests. Apple now limits identifiers to 25 or less.&lt;/p&gt;— Zack Whittaker (@zackwhittaker) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zackwhittaker/status/1403476908789178375?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9KULPB"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Times’ &lt;/em&gt;piece paints a picture of a US government whose requests have been increasing in volume, and perhaps a general willingness by Big Tech to comply (not that these companies often have a choice). Apple challenged only 4 percent of this sort of request in the first six months of 2020, according to the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;. And while Google fought a gag order when the Trump administration seized the phone records of &lt;em&gt;NYT &lt;/em&gt;reporters, the story suggests it was easier to challenge because Google counted the NYT as a corporate customer, not an individual user. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sLMN3L"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/transparency/us.html"&gt;Both Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/user-data/overview?hl=en&amp;amp;user_requests_report_period=series:requests,accounts;authority:US;time:&amp;amp;lu=user_requests_report_period"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; have transparency report pages where you can see how many government requests they received, and how often they comply. Apple didn’t reply to our request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="If2jF8"&gt;Microsoft was also swept up in Trump’s leak hunt. It told the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; that it, too, only learned that it had provided information to the government about a congressional staff member after a gag order expired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hzJtqP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RPiZb9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YkxpTv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch E3 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oa1-khhYmtqlpCAP5VnzRqPRboc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69386792/acastro_180604_1777_E3_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VC1JN5"&gt;E3 2021 is finally here. After being canceled last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, E3 is back for 2021 in an all-digital format, &lt;a href="https://e3expo.com/news/e3-news/e3-2021-schedule-and-fan-registration"&gt;kicking off on June 12th&lt;/a&gt;. Some big reveals have already hit — although technically not a part of E3, Thursday’s Summer Game Fest’s Kickoff Live event was packed with news, including a trailer and release date for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22307059/elden-ring-george-rr-martin-fromsoftware-e3-2021-trailer-gameplay"&gt;highly-anticipated &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the announcement of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22528209/death-stranding-directors-cut-ps5-hideo-kojima"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death Stranding: Director’s Cut &lt;/em&gt;for PS5&lt;/a&gt;. (You can catch &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/MqXeohrnoaY"&gt;a full replay of that show here&lt;/a&gt;.) And over the next few days there still are big conferences from Ubisoft, Microsoft and Bethesda, and Nintendo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Y8NWN"&gt;If you want to attend the virtual E3 as a fan, you can register to attend &lt;a href="https://e3expo.com/"&gt;on E3’s website&lt;/a&gt;. (I will warn you from personal experience that the E3 portal and website are pretty bad.)

    <title>Facebook just bought the Fortnite of VR</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WgFD2vAcIxiT0BA8U_uokN3WEkU=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69442042/Screen_Shot_2021_06_11_at_1.34.40_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A character in &lt;/em&gt;Population: One&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: BigBox VR&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tboSmC"&gt;Facebook has acquired yet another developer of a popular virtual reality game, announcing on Friday that BigBox VR, makers of the battle royale VR title &lt;em&gt;Population: One, &lt;/em&gt;will be joining Oculus Studios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DYHcwL"&gt;“&lt;em&gt;POP: ONE&lt;/em&gt; stormed onto the VR scene just nine months ago and has consistently ranked as one the top-performing titles on the Oculus platform, bringing together up to 24 people at a time to connect, play, and compete in a virtual world,” Mike Verdu, the VP of content at Facebook Reality Labs, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Fwelcoming-bigbox-vr-to-facebook%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wrote in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “And while social is bringing players into &lt;em&gt;POP: ONE&lt;/em&gt;, the quirky humor, continual updates, and pure fun of the environment keeps them coming back time and time again — we’ve even seen players scheduling time to meet in-game for a synchronous social experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aQt53Z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Population: One has been a big hit&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dUzI29"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Population: One&lt;/em&gt; has been a hit, earning more than $10 million on the Oculus Store “after just a few months,” &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Ffrom-bear-to-bull-how-oculus-quest-2-is-changing-the-game-for-vr%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verdu said in a February blog post&lt;/a&gt;. The game, which is available on both the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2F2564158073609422%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Oculus Store&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/691260/POPULATION_ONE/"&gt;on Steam&lt;/a&gt;, will “continue to be supported on all its current platforms,” according to Verdu. And the game will continue to receive regular updates, &lt;a href="https://www.bigboxvr.com/"&gt;BigBox VR says on its website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kv9flQ"&gt;But it’s not clear just yet what bigger changes might be in the works because of the acquisition. “BigBox VR has big plans for the future of &lt;em&gt;POP: ONE&lt;/em&gt; and for other projects, but we’re not ready to share details at this time,” Verdu says, vaguely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R0DJvw"&gt;BigBox VR joins a slew of other VR studios that Facebook has snapped up over the past couple years. The company acquired &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22412882/facebook-oculus-studios-onward-developer-downpour-interactive-acqusition"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Onward&lt;/em&gt; developer Downpour Interactive in April&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22176923%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD&amp;amp;murl=https://www.oculus.com/blog/welcoming-ready-at-dawn-to-facebook/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lone Echo&lt;/em&gt; creator Ready at Dawn last June&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22176923%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD&amp;amp;murl=https://www.oculus.com/blog/welcoming-sanzaru-games-to-facebook/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asgard’s Wrath&lt;/em&gt; maker Sanzaru Games in February 2020&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20984468/facebook-acquisition-beat-games-beat-saber-vr-studio"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/em&gt; developer Beat Games in November 2019&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Yorkers needing affordable internet will have to wait   </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2d9Q7OBqOzEFTUZ_1C5jcQeJ6Ds=/237x0:2754x1678/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69442024/1170796244.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OOODye"&gt;Internet access is, according to New York’s Eastern District Judge Dennis R. Hurley, a “modern necessity.” Unfortunately, Judge Hurley wrote those words in an injunction, filed today, to stall a piece of progressive legislation which would have mandated affordable internet availability to all living in New York State — and which would have come into effect early next week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQPq9B"&gt;The bill, known as the Affordable Broadband Act, would have required ISPs serving more than 20,000 households to offer two low-cost plans: one offering speeds of 25 Mbps down for no more than $15 per month, and another offering 200 Mbps down at no more than $20 monthly. It was passed by the state legislature and signed by Governor Cuomo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22388184/new-york-affordable-internet-cost-low-income-price-cap-bill"&gt;back in April&lt;/a&gt;, and would have gone into effect on June 16th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xD9kqk"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-16/n-y-to-require-all-internet-providers-offer-low-cost-broadband?sref=P6Q0mxvj"&gt;state Assembly member Amy Paulin&lt;/a&gt;, the average monthly cost of internet access for New Yorkers is $50; in general, Americans can pay &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc"&gt;about double&lt;/a&gt; what Europeans do for broadband access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1REfl6"&gt;Of course, no sooner was the bill signed then telecom lobbies &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/att-verizon-new-york-broadband-law-41448df8-370c-403a-8826-60159daf1877.html"&gt;sued to stop it&lt;/a&gt; from being enacted. &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/att-verizon-new-york-broadband-law-41448df8-370c-403a-8826-60159daf1877.html"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, NY Governor Cuomo was quoted as saying the lawsuit was “nothing more than a transparent attempt by billion-dollar corporations putting profit ahead of creating a more fair and just society.” And, love or hate the guy, he has a point there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0cCR4W"&gt;The ABA isn’t dead in the water, but Judge Hurley’s eleventh-hour injunction doesn’t bode well. In his determination, he found its enactment is likely to cause “irreparable harm” to telecom companies — either because they’re hit with civil penalties for failing to meet the requirements of the ABA, or loss of revenue by charging less for services — among other, base-level findings that allowed the injunction to be found valid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VngP7N"&gt;One particularly interesting arrow in Judge Hurley’s quiver, however, was to weaponize other existing programs that help make internet access affordable, specifically the FCC’s Emergency Broadband Benefit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="QDnrzU"&gt;While the stated purpose of the ABA is to expand access to broadband internet, that is not to say it is the sole legislative effort doing so. Plaintiffs discuss several federal programs allocating billions of dollars to achieve that same end [...] While Defendant argues that the New York Legislature determined these federal benefits were insufficient, that determination was made prior to the FCC’s April 29, 2021 announcement that the Emergency Broadband Benefit would become on effective May 12, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="KHWSwT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302807/fcc-internet-subsidies-authorized-low-income-broadband"&gt;The Emergency Broadband Benefit&lt;/a&gt; is critically different from the ABA in several ways. It does not cap the cost of internet access in any way, and unlike the ABA it’s means-tested: applicants need to qualify by showing they meet specific economic criteria. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22430529/emergency-broadband-benefit-program-how-to-get"&gt;Those who do can receive $50 off their monthly bill.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2BK25"&gt;So: for now, like the ABA itself, New Yorkers who were hoping for reliable broadband at a reasonable price point are stuck in limbo. While the injunction casts a large shadow over the future of the law, it is, at the end of the day, essentially just a judge saying “look, I need more time to sort all this out.” Hopefully, with some careful consideration, New York can still put a dent in the almost comically consolidated telecommunications sector. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Larry Page’s air taxi startup is buying former DJI rival 3D Robotics</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="3dr solo images" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6wsAB_lL0i4AvoeVawzSuQdGzgo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69441855/3dr-solo-_-_2.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: 3D Robotics&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6yVU9B"&gt;Kitty Hawk, the air taxi company backed by Google co-founder Larry Page, is buying what’s left of one-time DJI competitor 3D Robotics. As part of the acquisition, 3D Robotics co-founder Chris Anderson will become Kitty Hawk’s chief operating officer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dqo115"&gt;The acquisition &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeremybogaisky/2021/06/11/larry-page-kitty-hawk-air-taxi-sebastian-thrun/?sh=51b27bff738c"&gt;was first reported by &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which published a detailed look at the current state of Kitty Hawk and its new focus on developing a remote-piloted electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ctnvG9"&gt;Anderson will serve under CEO Sebastian Thrun, a former Google executive who founded the company’s self-driving car project (before it became standalone company Waymo) and launched its famous “X” moonshot division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="77X8rm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Kitty Hawk is shifting its focus after recent turmoil&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VdFdIG"&gt;3D Robotics was, for a short while, the lone American company trying to carve out space in the budding consumer drone market against early entrants like France’s Parrot and China’s DJI. But as DJI began to dominate the market, 3D Robotics abandoned its consumer product (which had autonomous capabilities and was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/13/8394359/3d-robotics-solo-drone-quadcopter-gopro"&gt;called Solo&lt;/a&gt;), laid off some employees, and spent the years since developing software for commercial drones. Late last year, though, the company asked the Federal Aviation Administration to certify a drone for government use that “may” rely heavily on automation, signaling a lingering interest in hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZQWbeU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Some personal/professional news: I'll be joining &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kittyhawkcorp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@kittyhawkcorp&lt;/a&gt; (Larry Page &amp;amp; Sebastian Thrun's eVTOL company) as COO as part of a 3DR acquisition. The path from drones to remotely-piloted passenger aircraft is becoming increasingly clear, especially from a FAA cert basis...&lt;/p&gt;— Chris Anderson (@chr1sa) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chr1sa/status/1403434049977212928?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1oT8yW"&gt;“The path from drones to remotely-piloted passenger aircraft is becoming increasingly clear, especially from a FAA [certification] basis,” Anderson &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chr1sa/status/1403434049977212928"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; Friday. “The two share many similar technologies, from power systems to autopilots, so it will be interesting to see where scaled-up drones &amp;amp; scaled-down traditional aviation meet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iS5pGW"&gt;3D Robotics is not the only drone company to work on autonomous technology. Fellow startup Skydio released two versions of its own self-flying camera drone before recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/13/21322832/skydio-x2-commercial-drone-enterprise-military-announce-100-million-funding"&gt;shifting focus&lt;/a&gt; to include enterprise and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22306876/skydio-1-billion-valuation-enterprise-military-customers-chinese-drones-grounded"&gt;military customers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ByqDpw"&gt;Page founded Kitty Hawk in 2015, though the company didn’t break cover until 2017. The startup’s initial focus was around a small personal electric aircraft called the Flyer, which Kitty Hawk said would be so simple to fly that a pilot’s license wouldn’t be required. It even said at the time that a commercial version &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/24/15406208/larry-page-flying-car-kitty-hawk-flyer-prototype"&gt;would be available in late 2017&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rHMuio"&gt;Kitty Hawk developed a working prototype of the Flyer and even showed off a much sleeker version the following year. The startup also revealed &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeFxjRMv5U8"&gt;a second aircraft called Cora&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 that it handed off to a joint venture with Boeing. But Kitty Hawk abandoned the Flyer in 2020, laid off dozens of employees, and turned its attention toward a third electric aircraft in development. That aircraft, called Heaviside, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/3/20897336/kitty-hawk-electric-aircraft-heaviside-mile-range-flight-time-google-larry-page"&gt;looks more like a traditional plane&lt;/a&gt; and more closely resembles the vehicles being built by numerous other eVTOL startups like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22529534/archer-maker-air-taxi-evtol-reveal-specs"&gt;Archer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298957/joby-aviation-public-evtol-electric-aircraft-spac-hoffman"&gt;Joby&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358027/lilium-flying-taxi-evtol-spac-electric-aviation-gm-engle"&gt;Lilium&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cwS6E6"&gt;While the plan with Heaviside was originally for it to be piloted, the company is now working toward making it fully autonomous, according to the &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; report. Thrun reportedly pushed so hard for this change in direction that Kitty Hawk fired the engineer behind the aircraft, Damon Vander Lind, in May after he fought for the original vision. The report also details a number of recent employee departures, including a few engineers who left Kitty Hawk after they believed Vander Lind retaliated against them for raising safety concerns about Heaviside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jsLG4H"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Darnella Frazier, who documented George Floyd’s murder, receives Pulitzer Prize citation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="PALESTINIAN-ISRAEL-US-RACISM-POLICE-TRIAL-FLOYD" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NbLvckNtwUW6Ch1g0WEN03ZnZdo=/0x2:8192x5463/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69441477/1232039092.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by EMMANUEL DUNAND/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JvbyYF"&gt;Darnella Frazier — the teen who used her smartphone to film the video of George Floyd’s murder in May 2020 that sparked a wave of Black Lives Matter protests worldwide, which culminated in the murder conviction of former police officer Derek Chauvin — &lt;a href="https://www.pulitzer.org/article/2021-pulitzer-prize-announcement"&gt;will receive a special citation from the Pulitzer Board&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XonCKN"&gt;Frazier was given the citation for “courageously recording the murder of George Floyd, a video that spurred protests against police brutality around the world, highlighting the crucial role of citizens in journalists’ quest for truth and justice,” the Pulitzer Board said (&lt;a href="https://www.pulitzer.org/cms/sites/default/files/content/2021longlist130611.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lHWZtG"&gt;Frazier’s video, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/20/us/darnella-frazier-video.html"&gt;which was viewed by millions&lt;/a&gt;, ignited one of the biggest protest movements in American history and demonstrated how a smartphone with a camera can be a powerful tool &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355121/new-civil-rights-movement-police-brutality-protests-film-videos-black-lives-matter"&gt;to document police brutality and racial injustices&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="21u42N"&gt;Frazier was 17 when she filmed the video and uploaded it to Facebook. She also testified at Chauvin’s trial, a trial that eventually resulted in a historic conviction: “the first time in Minnesota history that a white police officer was convicted of killing a Black civilian on the job,” &lt;a href="https://www.startribune.com/derek-chauvin-convicted-of-murdering-george-floyd-in-minneapolis-is-led-away-in-handcuffs/600048324/"&gt;according to the &lt;em&gt;Star Tribune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (The &lt;em&gt;Star Tribune&lt;/em&gt; was awarded a Pulitzer Prize on Friday for its coverage of Floyd’s death and what followed.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cU20iB"&gt;“Even though this was a traumatic life-changing experience for me, I’m proud of myself,” Frazier said &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/25/us/darnella-frazier.html"&gt;in a statement on the anniversary of Floyd’s death&lt;/a&gt;. “If it weren’t for my video, the world wouldn’t have known the truth. I own that. My video didn’t save George Floyd, but it put his murderer away and off the streets.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple added beautiful 3D details to Maps, but it still can’t get me out of this forest</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nl0o8e27XqvpcvCsZpQNU99YuG4=/156x0:1844x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69441470/image.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is impressive, but it won’t help me get around town.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wShuUH"&gt;During the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22456874/apple-ios-15-features-notifications-facetime-wwdc-2021"&gt;iOS portion of Apple’s WWDC keynote&lt;/a&gt;, it showed some amazing demos of 3D cities and AR transit directions, but amid all the beautiful features there were a few things missing from the stage and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fios%2Fios-15-preview%2Ffeatures%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F11%2F22528793%2Fapple-maps-missing-features-ios-15-aesthetics-functionality" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s iOS 15 feature list&lt;/a&gt;. Namely, some basic navigation tools that would let me get around easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ex1Ol4"&gt;Since Apple seems to be focusing a lot on Maps (it got stage time &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/GEZhD3J89ZE?t=1190"&gt;at last year’s keynote, too&lt;/a&gt;), perhaps they’re also taking requests? Here’s my wishlist. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ppj4Zoa2G1SbtyIMxLl4cY242jI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653069/IMG_1751.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don’t forget, you’re here forever.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="Sv4BJw"&gt;Offline Maps&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="CJGdyY"&gt;Without a cellular signal or Wi-Fi, Apple Maps turns into a brick — you can’t search for locations, find routes, or do anything useful. This is, to put it lightly, a bit of a problem for a navigation app that’s been around for eight years. Imagine you used Apple Maps to navigate to somewhere that doesn’t have reliable cell service (like, say, many national parks), then want to go home. Apple Maps can get you through a dead zone, but if you’ll be staying a while, you won’t be able to use Apple Maps to get back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DUwfl5"&gt;While leaving civilization and never coming back may appeal to some people (hello), it’s not the experience most are looking for. There are various ways to solve this — Apple could create a system where Maps caches the places you’ve recently traveled through, making at least basic routing available without an internet connection, or it could go full Google Maps and let you arbitrarily download massive parts of the map that will be available offline. There just needs to be some way to navigate your way out of a cellular dead zone should you find yourself in one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zddpp0"&gt;Since Apple Maps will work offline if you’ve got navigation going, maybe there’s a workaround? Could you create a route that brings you to a place, but then also takes you back home? That’s very clever, but no, because Apple Maps doesn’t have... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="zMSdQm"&gt;The ability to create multi-stop routes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="cIIMfP"&gt;The ability to create routes with more than one destination is, admittedly, more useful while you’re planning a trip than while you’re actually traveling, but it can still save you the hassle of having to choose a new destination every time you arrive somewhere. Apple Maps, however, doesn’t have this ability — you can do point-to-point travel, and that’s it. As far as I (and people on &lt;a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8502456"&gt;Apple’s forums&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/ck4wcg/why_doesnt_apple_maps_support_multiple/"&gt;and Reddit&lt;/a&gt;) can tell, you can’t even do multiple stops in the desktop Apple Maps, which would at least help with planning. Meanwhile, in Google Maps land...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E4srLdrdUKbUmWaH6pv7VEhLgIo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22652964/IMG_1746.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JkM6vN"&gt;But wait, isn’t there an Add Stop button in Apple Maps? Indeed, there is, but I regret to tell you that it’s not for creating multi-stop routes — it’s for adding a brief detour. And, to add insult to injury, it’s almost useless for what it’s actually designed to do.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-riJ2fVYEGKgJ_bzJ3eVcGpwaLk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22652951/IMG_1747.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Add Stop button brings nothing but frustration. In my two years using Apple Maps, I’ve never successfully used it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="SlimF6"&gt;The ability to actually choose a stop along your route&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="JyOBYk"&gt;The Add Stop button lets you find a temporary pit stop along your route, so you can take a break from driving to get food, gas, or whatever. The problem is that it’s extremely limited in this capability — it only lets you choose from a few predetermined categories and will only show you a few from each one. It does provide a quick and easy interface for use while driving, but if you want to do something specific, you’ll be in for a rough time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ntFXkTLnQeJ5oUz7PLoGLuXrZgk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653067/IMG_1752.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tapping on Restaurants (currently labeled “Breakfast” because it’s morning) will give you a list of 10 places that are nearby.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="c6KcFm"&gt;If you want to stop at a specific restaurant, you can’t search for it using the Add Stop menu. As an example, say I was traveling to Seattle but wanted to stop at a McDonald’s along the way. I’d have to stop my navigation to Seattle and set it to McDonald’s instead. Then, after I was done there, I’d have to set my navigation to Seattle again. With Google Maps, I’d just be able to search along my route, add McDonald’s, and be good to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B4XBxf"&gt;Google Maps’ search along route feature is great for another reason — if I want to stop in, say, 60 miles instead of right now, I could set Google Maps&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to a gas station that’s a ways up the road. Apple Maps can only show what’s around you, not further on along the route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="HI06lC"&gt;More obvious bike and footpaths&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="nCayN9"&gt;This one is small, but if you’re trying to visually plan out a route where you’ll be walking or biking, you’ll really have to hunt for paths in Apple Maps. Look at this comparison between a local paved trail in Apple Maps versus what it looks like in Google Maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ls1HNY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10602509"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yFbuKk"&gt;It’s safe to say that the one in Google Maps is just a tad easier to notice and trace. Apple did mention improving details like this in iOS 15, but those improvements seemed to be in the cities that were getting the upgraded 3D maps, not everywhere (though I’d love for that to not be the case). Either way, Apple obviously knows my trail exists, so it’d be great if it could highlight it in some way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="yq5TwW"&gt;Satellite view in CarPlay&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="GeqW0N"&gt;This is, again, a small one — Apple talked about Maps helping people navigate better while driving, but for the areas that won’t get 3D mapped anytime soon, actually being able to see a satellite view while driving could help improve their navigation experience. Satellite view may not be for everyone all the time, but if you’re navigating a tricky intersection, or a dense area where landmarks may be key, being able to see a top-down picture instead of just an abstracted map could help you avoid missing a turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ImK6nR"&gt;
&lt;p id="CxcoPJ"&gt;Of course, there are navigation apps available that have these features — I’ve directly compared Apple Maps with Google Maps several times, and Google also makes Waze. However, while Google Maps and Waze do have CarPlay integration, they’re generally not as well-integrated as Apple Maps is (for obvious reasons). There’s also the matter of privacy — some people, myself included, would rather not give Google all the location data that comes with using their mapping service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hJbSe5"&gt;Whatever reason people decide to stick with Apple Maps, they deserve to have a useful navigation experience, and it’d be nice to see Apple getting the basics done before adding an (admittedly lovely looking) moonlight aesthetic to Maps.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>House lawmakers introduce five bipartisan bills to unwind tech monopolies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qFoUOaPpANoVE-soa2qL07Bow5s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69441138/acastro_180406_1777_facebook_Congress_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NMGfr4"&gt;On Friday, House Democrats introduced five new bills meant to chip away at the power of big tech companies, targeting a variety of practices that antitrust advocates say are stifling competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LZVRWK"&gt;These measures are the House Judiciary Committee’s historic, 16-month long investigation into the business tactics of companies like Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google. With this new slate of bills, Congress is getting ready to legislate based on the concerns raised by that investigation — and the move could reshape the tech industry as we know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bYQVBr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Right now, unregulated tech monopolies have too much power over our economy”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zbQdoB"&gt;“Right now, unregulated tech monopolies have too much power over our economy. They are in a unique position to pick winners and losers, destroy small businesses, raise prices on consumers, and put folks out of work,” Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI) said in a statement Friday. “Our agenda will level the playing field and ensure the wealthiest, most powerful tech monopolies play by the same rules as the rest of us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LpFpvp"&gt;The package unveiled Friday includes five measures targeting the different ways in which tech companies maintain market dominance. One bill would empower the Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission to break up tech firms by forcing them to sell off parts of their business that could create a conflict of interest — potentially forcing Amazon to carve off house brands like Amazon Basics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tenz8K"&gt;Another bill would bar companies from giving their own services preference over their rivals, like Google boosting its own products in search results over competitors. Yet another bill would block companies like Facebook from buying up nascent competitors like in the 2012 acquisition of Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNP5ao"&gt;The last two bills are less controversial. Last week, the Senate already passed a measure put out by Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) that would boost merger filing fees for large companies, giving antitrust enforcers more money to take on cases. A bill mirroring that legislation was introduced Wednesday. The last bill would force platforms to make the data they collect interoperable in order to make it easier for users to jump from one service to another. Both Republicans and Democrats seem eager to move forward on data portability legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yNGQif"&gt;The House’s tech investigation was a bipartisan endeavor, and while both parties agree on many of the probe’s findings, they disagree on some of the solutions. The probe culminated into an over 400-page report from Democratic staff detailing its findings. Rep. Ken Buck (CO), the committee’s top Republican, issued his own report focusing on the ways large platforms allegedly censor conservative speech and encouraging other Republicans to support competition reform as a means of addressing the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XaBR2c"&gt;It’s unclear how lawmakers plan to move forward on the legislation, but the multi-pronged approach could make it easier to enact some changes over the coming Term. More measured approaches like Klobuchar’s to boost regulatory funding could find broad support in the House.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNhFrU"&gt;At least one Republican and one Democrat signed on to each of Friday’s measures. Still it’s unclear if all members support each bill. On Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/murdoch-pushes-republicans-support-antitrust-bills-471e7868-4dd3-4b3b-a8af-62cf25582fe7.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Axios &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that lobbyists for Rupert Murdoch’s media companies, like Fox Corp. and News Corp., were urging House Republicans to support the measures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hk3sNM"&gt;“These companies have maintained monopoly power in the online marketplace by using a variety of anticompetitive behaviors to stifle competition,” Buck said in a statement Friday. “Doing nothing is not an option, we must act now.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>China’s Zhurong rover sends a selfie from Mars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The rover sits in the center of the photo, which is angled upward from the red martian surface. To its right is the landing platform.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6FB5ts"&gt;China has released new images from its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436072/china-tianwen-1-mars-landing-zhurong-rover"&gt;Zhurong rover&lt;/a&gt;, which began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/22/22448781/china-drives-rover-mars-nasa-space"&gt;wheeling its way around Mars&lt;/a&gt; in late May. One of the photos is a lovely selfie of Zhurong posed next to its landing platform. The “touring group photo,” as the China National Space Administration calls it &lt;a href="http://www.cnsa.gov.cn/n6759533/c6812126/content.html"&gt;in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;, was taken with a small wireless camera that the rover placed on the surface before scooting back to line up for the shot like an excited parent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oaVjlc"&gt;Zhurong also took a photo of the landing platform by itself, showing the ramp the rover drove down, the Chinese flag, and if you look closely to the left of the flag, the mascots for the Beijing Winter Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WjZ823"&gt;There are more photos in the Twitter thread below, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AJ_FI/status/1403224177218359303"&gt;linked here&lt;/a&gt;, including a panorama that shows the Red Planet’s horizon in the distance beyond the rover, along with marks on the surface from propellant expulsion during landing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hjCeke"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Cool panorama here from Zhurong, showing the fascinating horizon but also areas affected by the passivation of the landing platform (expelling remaining propellant to prevent explosion), to the north and south (also seen in the shots from Tianwen-1 &amp;amp; MRO from orbit). &lt;a href="https://t.co/M3HbkGS6P0"&gt;pic.twitter.com/M3HbkGS6P0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Andrew Jones (@AJ_FI) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AJ_FI/status/1403228155935182848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xMNNRW"&gt;Zhurong joined &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316093/nasas-perseverance-rover-first-drive-mars"&gt;NASA’s Perseverance&lt;/a&gt; on Mars last month (though the rovers are over a thousand miles apart), making China the second country to land and operate a rover on the planet. It’s expected to keep exploring for about 90 days, and it will capture more images while it analyzes the Martian climate and geology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dPmTmp"&gt;Perseverance also sent along some &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/say-cheese-on-mars-perseverance-s-selfie-with-ingenuity"&gt;glamour shots of its own&lt;/a&gt; in April, though it used a robotic arm (a selfie stick, if you will) rather than setting a camera down and backing away from it. This one is a family photo of both the rover and its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22424821/nasa-ingenuity-mars-perseverance-video-audio-helicopter"&gt;little helicopter companion&lt;/a&gt;, Ingenuity. NASA details how the selfie was made in &lt;a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8631/nasas-curiosity-mars-rover-takes-a-new-selfie-before-record-climb/"&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; with videos.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s $100 Opus X headphones bring noise cancellation and a low-latency gaming mode</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Opus X" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pCh_cVKQSO4WeCV-xt2qW45fkBI=/0x0:5583x3722/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69440735/razer_opus_x_hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Razer’s new Opus X comes in three divisive colors&lt;/em&gt; | Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ambd1H"&gt;Razer announced the Opus X, a new set of over-ear wireless headphones that offer active noise cancellation for just $100. Based on the small amount of differences and seemingly no major compromises compared to the pricier Opus headphones it launched last year, these could be a solid option if you have a little less money to spend on wireless headphones. &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fmobile-headsets%2FRazer-Opus-X%2FRZ04-03760300-R3U1&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;It’s available to purchase now on Razer’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IFjLBG"&gt;Overall, the design appears to be similar to the Opus. It’s tough to tell from images how build quality or materials might have changed given the price reduction. This model comes in one of three new colors — green, pink, and white — which are a bit louder and more divisive than the black or midnight blue colors of the standard Opus. The button layout has been crammed onto the rim of the right ear cup instead of splitting functions across both the left and right sides. The Opus X’s power button now handles cycling through active noise cancellation and the “Quick Attention” mode that lets you hear more of your surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Opus X" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yWOo6gLcX6TxRzuu5jzyB669Acc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22652861/opusx.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The polar opposite of going stealth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sd4V9o"&gt;The Opus X have rotating ear cups so you can rest them comfortably around your neck if you need to take them off. Though, this more affordable model lacks the feature that automatically pauses or plays your content upon removing or putting them back on. That’s one of the biggest omissions. As for what else hit the cutting room floor, there’s no 3.5mm jack — just a USB-C port — so you’ll need to connect these solely over Bluetooth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gOkokg"&gt;There’s actually one feature that’s exclusive to the Opus X: Razer’s low-latency “Gaming Mode” that reduces the latency over Bluetooth to 60 milliseconds. We’ve seen this feature in other wireless headphones from Razer, like its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22272549/razer-hammerhead-true-wireless-pro-review-specs-price"&gt;Hammerhead True Wireless Pro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BmvswQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262459/razer-opus-review-wireless-noise-canceling-headphones-thx-over-ear-price-specs"&gt;I reviewed the Opus last year&lt;/a&gt; and they exceeded my expectations considering their original $200 price. They had surprisingly good sound quality, and the active noise cancellation is a perk you don’t often find at this price point (even better, they’ve fallen in price considerably since launch). They also impressed me in terms of battery life, and I was able to use them for an entire work week without recharging. The new Razer Opus X claim to have even better longevity with up to 40 hours of battery with noise cancellation off, or up to 30 hours with it on. If the Opus X sound nearly as good as the Opus, they could be a real winner.&lt;/p&gt;
