    <title>Watch the Pixel 6 Pro get put together and taken apart in leaked videos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M0wXTaRqWvq9cZdQUukvQ1RJdRk=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69971161/Screen_Shot_2021_10_08_at_12.13.38_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3zxb5Jpipk" target="_blank"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hNrvow"&gt;While Google has already shared a lot about its upcoming Pixel 6 Pro flagship, including its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;bold exterior design&lt;/a&gt;, two new videos posted to YouTube reveal what Google will probably never show us: what it looks like on the inside, how to put it together, and how to take it apart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yhnrc3"&gt;The two videos, which appear to be used for training purposes of some kind, show how to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3zxb5Jpipk"&gt;assemble&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECzp5bU2aQI"&gt;disassemble&lt;/a&gt; the Pixel 6 Pro. It seems unlikely that these were intended to be released publicly, as they are extremely focused on showing specific steps for how to put together and take apart the phone, don’t include any voiceover, and have a mishmash of low-quality graphics, text, and music. That being said, the videos are still worth checking out, as they are a fascinating step-by-step look at how a smartphone actually gets put together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qSeo9W"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ECzp5bU2aQI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dThEuc"&gt;The videos also hint at some Pixel 6 Pro features Google hasn’t confirmed publicly yet. The assembly video mentions a connector for an ultra wideband chip, and both videos show separate steps specific to an mmWave SKU and a sub-6GHz SKU, which backs up information found in &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/09/20/pixel-6-and-6-pro-hit-fcc-with-wi-fi-6e-support/"&gt;recent FCC filings&lt;/a&gt;. And multiple clear shots reveal that the phone has a beefy 19.26Wh battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WaDSVR"&gt;I have to say I have never seen a teardown this detailed hit the web ahead of the launch of a phone, perhaps making this a new high bar in the ongoing saga of Google smartphones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/23/21398008/pixel-5-google-leak-rumor-specs"&gt;leaking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21450764/google-pixel-5-design-specs-leak-hardware-software-camera"&gt;ahead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452607/pixel-4a-5g-spec-leak-similar-pixel-5"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/18/20868935/google-pixel-4-xl-rumors-leaks-specs-details-colors-cameras-soli"&gt;their&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/8/17953626/google-pixel-3-xl-leaks-last-minute-pink-sand-color-ai-camera-features"&gt;official&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/8/17953626/google-pixel-3-xl-leaks-last-minute-pink-sand-color-ai-camera-features"&gt;release&lt;/a&gt;. This week, another leak &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714141/google-pixel-6-pro-marketing-images-leak-evleaks-wireless-charger-face-unlock"&gt;revealed a second-generation Pixel Stand&lt;/a&gt; and marketing images of the Pixel 6 Pro and the smaller Pixel 6. And if you want to get an idea of what the Pixel 6 Pro might actually look like in your hand, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686534/google-pixel-6-pro-leak-display-screen-video"&gt;there’s a leak for that, too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1M7Bq5"&gt;Google is set to reveal more about the Pixel 6 lineup at an event &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22691850/google-pixel-6-event-2021-fall-announcement"&gt;on October 19th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook confirms that some of its services are having issues again</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uoblHBIDaBQyhHx9ouY4ncr03RY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69971030/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0RYsoW"&gt;Instagram has been experiencing issues for many of us here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, but it turns out that the problem might be broader than that, according to a statement from Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AoQF1G"&gt;“We’re aware that some people are having trouble accessing our apps and products,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Facebook/status/1446556732977778695"&gt;Facebook said in a tweet&lt;/a&gt;. “We’re working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible and we apologize for any inconvenience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3lIreT"&gt;The scope of the problems is unclear. Sometimes my Instagram feed has refreshed, and other times, I get an error. However, over the past few minutes, things seem to have worked okay, and I haven’t had issues with Facebook’s website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9hxDk4"&gt;The problems follow a massive outage earlier on Monday, which took down Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Oculus for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708989/instagram-facebook-outage-messenger-whatsapp-error"&gt;nearly six hours&lt;/a&gt;. In an explanation posted the day after, Facebook said the backbone connecting the company’s data centers around the world &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710963/facebook-dns-bgp-outage-backbone-maintenance"&gt;was inadvertently shut down&lt;/a&gt;. The outage was extensive enough that it even broke &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709575/facebook-outage-instagram-whatsapp"&gt;internal systems used by Facebook employees&lt;/a&gt;, forcing them to turn to company-provided Outlook accounts to communicate instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQPkAp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The six-figure Mercedes-Benz EQS gets a 350-mile range rating</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wXXHg0_bkMqzkmizQ6tWZNbuA3M=/86x0:4877x3194/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69970795/2020_11_28_Image_20C0714_021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Mercedes-Benz&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XqvnGm"&gt;The all-electric Mercedes-Benz EQS is chock full of luxury and tech features. Now we know it will be competitive with some of its six-figure rivals in regards to range, as the official estimates are &lt;a href="https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1133824_2022-mercedes-benz-eqs-tops-out-with-a-350-mile-epa-range-rating-trailing-tesla-and-lucid"&gt;finally in&lt;/a&gt; from the Environmental Protection Agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AtizIB"&gt;The agency says the rear-wheel-drive version should get around 350 miles on a full battery. Buyers of the all-wheel-drive version should expect a little less, around 340 miles. That’s roughly even with Tesla’s new triple-motor Model S Plaid, which the EPA says is good for about 348 miles &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/06/18/tesla-model-s-plaid-348-mile-epa-rated-range-21-inch-wheels/"&gt;on a full charge on 21-inch wheels&lt;/a&gt;. Tesla says the Model S Plaid on 19-inch wheels should get closer to 400 miles, but that claim hasn’t been evaluated by the EPA just yet. A dual-motor Long Range Model S is supposed to eclipse 400 miles, though that car has apparently been delayed in favor of the Plaid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="OZwNnM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Mercedes-Benz EQS will cost over $100,000 but is still cheaper than an S-Class","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686248/mercedes-benz-eqs-electric-vehicle-price-cheaper-s-class"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="GDvrEq"&gt;Audi’s E-Tron GT — which is built on the Porsche Taycan’s electric drivetrain — is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274376/audi-etron-gt-rs-electric-car-specs-price"&gt;likely to be rated for even less&lt;/a&gt;, somewhere in the mid-to-low 200-mile range. The only EV that easily eclipses the EQS’s range figures is the Lucid Air. That sedan received a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22675936/lucid-motors-air-range-epa-rating-tesla"&gt;whopping 520-mile rating from the EPA in September&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ruCIJi"&gt;A big question with the EQS when it goes on sale in the US later this year will be whether buyers cross-shop against these other EVs or if they want a Mercedes-Benz and happen to choose electric. If it’s the latter, there’s an extra incentive in that the EQS’ starting price is actually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686248/mercedes-benz-eqs-electric-vehicle-price-cheaper-s-class"&gt;less than that of the gas-powered S-Class&lt;/a&gt; it will probably one day supplant. While an extra 100-plus miles of range would always be nice, getting into the mid-300s should be plenty for most buyers’ daily and weekly needs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to preorder the Apple Watch Series 7</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OaNqWaV5j4cx0WB5BjSpqEwDxr4=/154x0:1807x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69949627/Apple_watch_series7_availability_stainless_steel_10052021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 features larger screens.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WAQ6pp"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;new Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt; Series 7 was announced alongside the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22672438/ipad-2021-new-price-specs-release-date-apple-a13-chip"&gt;iPad&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review"&gt;iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s the final device of Apple’s new fall products to launch. This newer model sits atop Apple’s current lineup of smartwatches, which still includes the SE and Series 3 rounding out the line. Featuring a slightly revamped design and larger display, the Series 7 comes in either a 41mm (up from 40mm) configuration starting at $399 or a 45mm (up from 44mm) configuration — each with optional cellular radios if you want to pay for service with your carrier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hMTfvS"&gt;After Apple’s initial announcement billed them for release “later this fall,” we now know &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708611/apple-watch-7-release-date-price-preorder"&gt;the new models are set to release on October 15th&lt;/a&gt;, and you can &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch%2Fapple-watch&amp;amp;subid1=vergeapplewatchseries7preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;preorder them now through Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfKhcuwgnDQ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-series-7-gps%2F-%2FA-84736576%3Fpreselect%3D77640209%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergeapplewatchseries7preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fbrowse%2Fapple-watch%2Fapple-watch-series-7%2F3944_1229722_1890925_1696849_6549129&amp;amp;subid1=vergeapplewatchseries7preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LuD92a"&gt;What’s new&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="roSEq8"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 prominently features that new, larger display that stretches the screen closer to the edges for a more full-bleed aesthetic and showing more actionable information at once. It has a slight curve at its farthest edges, though Apple says the watch is overall more durable thanks to a 50 percent thicker glass cover and IP6X rating for better dirt and sand resistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9RLkrZ"&gt;New watch faces exclusive to the Series 7 promise to put that extra screen real estate to work, while the watch maintains a physical footprint that is close to its predecessor. Apple has also improved charging speeds, including a new USB-C wireless magnetic fast charger with the watch that it claims will offer up to a 33 percent quicker charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lttaJ7"&gt;On the software side, the Apple Watch Series 7 runs watchOS 8, supports a full swiping keyboard for text input, is compatible with new workouts, and maintains all the health-tracking features found on prior iterations: sleep tracking, heart rate and blood oxygen monitoring, and fall detection that now registers during workouts. There is plenty to take advantage of if you’re in the market for a new Apple Watch and prefer to have Apple’s latest and greatest iteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="LxippD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Should you wait for the Apple Watch Series 7?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674258/apple-watch-series-7-upgrade-worth-waiting-for"},{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="0ZdgqF"&gt;The aluminum-encased Series 7 watches come in midnight, starlight, an updated blue, (PRODUCT) RED, and a new dark green colorway, so there is a bit to choose from whether you’re going for a discreet, bold, or rugged look. Let’s break down all that there is to offer here before we dive further into specific configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FWKvlA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10743503"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Watch Series 7 in midnight, starlight, green, blue, and PRODUCT (RED).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ixNYqI"&gt;How to preorder the Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="yBbMqA"&gt;You can preorder your preferred configuration directly from Apple or a variety of retailers right now, with the earliest orders shipping on October 15th. The main options for you to decide on, aside from your preferred color, are size and connectivity. The base Apple Watch Series 7 configuration is a 41mm, GPS-only model that retails for $399. The 41mm version with a cellular connection runs $100 more at $499. If you have a larger wrist or prefer bigger screens, the 45mm GPS-only model is $429, while its cellular-equipped counterpart climbs up to $529. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CYcjeM"&gt;Preorder all sizes, colors, and configurations at Apple&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Ybj2aF"&gt;If you want an Apple Watch with your pick of the litter for bands — standard, premium, or fixed-length — then Apple has the most on offer. It’s the only place you can order an Apple Watch with custom-sized solo loop straps, though be sure to use the size guide. Shipments are initially expected for October 15th, however, select models won’t ship until early to mid-November. If you opt for in-store pickup at an Apple Store, it might still be the 15th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Iin96H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10743802"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1oQQDo"&gt;Preorder at Best Buy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UewUYo"&gt;Best Buy’s site is indicating that the base 41mm GPS model will arrive on release day, while some other configurations with cellular connectivity are to be expected around October 25th. The retailer has all colors available for the size and connectivity of your choice, each with a matching sport band.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6zF2jz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10797140"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="r0rafV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10797237"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qmXurY"&gt;Preorder at Walmart&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5PezQJ"&gt;Walmart has a variety of anticipated shipping dates for preorders. All preorders are expected to ship by October 15th, though, some individual configurations have delivery dates ranging from the 15th to the 21st. Oddly, the red, 45mm LTE model notes a shipping date of October 11th, though we would advise not putting too much confidence in its accuracy. There can sometimes be errors in retailer listings as soon as a product is put up for sale, which is often corrected later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="h4THAO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10797290"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="5A8W7H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10797296"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="h2Dlds"&gt;Preorder at Target&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eWiJze"&gt;Target lists each and every color and configuration of the aluminum Apple Watch Series 7 as shipping by the release date of October 15th. This can always change on the fly, but it is worth considering if you want to get your new watch as quickly as possible. Target RedCard members will also receive free shipping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NR6Vib"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10797306"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="kSl7XQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10797315"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uoprLg"&gt;How to preorder the Apple Watch Series 7 from phone carriers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3dbtKG"&gt;Most major phone carriers in the US offer the cellular Apple Watch Series 7 for preorder, which can help if you prefer to purchase the smartwatch on a monthly installment plan that you might already have for your phone. For the cellular models, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-11557999?sid=VergeAppleWatchSeries7100821&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fconnected-smartwatches%2Fapple-watch-series-7%2F%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836598-13761603?sid=VergeAppleWatchSeries7100821&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fwearables%2Fapple-watch-series-7-41mm-green-aluminum-clover-sport.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsmart-watch%2Fapple-watch-series-7-41mm%3Fsku%3D194252566381&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22664661%2Fapple-watch-series-7-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt; all offer the Series 7 in each of its sizes and colors at the same starting price as Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gdxgiN"&gt;Apple has confirmed that when you &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch%2Fapple-watch%2Faluminum-case&amp;amp;subid1=vergeapplewatchseries7preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy a cellular-equipped Apple Watch Series 7 through its own store&lt;/a&gt; and activate it on &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100009682-14498937?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fshop%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22664661%2Fapple-watch-series-7-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sprint / T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, you will get $100 back.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VH7yJz"&gt;More premium case options and custom configurator&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="T46tsH"&gt;Apple has also offered the latest top-end watch in additional case materials for years. This generation is no different, with the Series 7 available in &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch%2Fapple-watch%2Fstainless-steel-case&amp;amp;subid1=vergeapplewatchseries7preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;stainless steel starting at $699&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch%2Fapple-watch%2Ftitanium-case&amp;amp;subid1=vergeapplewatchseries7preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;titanium starting at $799&lt;/a&gt;, as well as band options from luxury fashion boutique Hermès. The easiest way to preorder these is directly from Apple, as it carries the most options and not all retailers sell the more luxurious watches — though &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfKhlKGfOGa" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-stainless-steel-series-7-gps-cellular%2F-%2FA-84783483%3Fpreselect%3D77640146%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergeapplewatchseries7preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fbrowse%2Fapple-watch%2Fapple-watch-series-7%2F3944_1229722_1890925_1696849_6549129%3Fsort%3Dprice_high&amp;amp;subid1=vergeapplewatchseries7preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; do have some stainless steel models available for preorder. Most people opt for aluminum, which offers the same functionality at a lower price, but the premium models have a unique fit and finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NR4t55"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fstudio%2Fapple-watch&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22664661%2Fapple-watch-series-7-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch Studio&lt;/a&gt;, Apple’s own online boutique for creating exact custom Apple Watch configurations, makes a return for the Series 7. If you prefer an Apple Watch in a particular combination of size, finish, color, and band, you can make your selection and pay the configured price directly from Apple. This is the only way to order one of the popular solo loop straps with your Apple Watch, as those fixed-length straps are only sold through Apple.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This iPhone 13 case adds what the phone was always missing — a candy launcher</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZvQwDjQwcpWnaum9SmBD2GhMXhc=/213x0:2130x1278/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69970698/Screen_Shot_2021_10_08_at_10.34.53_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vOXkPc"&gt;No matter how much Apple hypes Ceramic Shield — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509008/apple-iphone-12-pro-max-mini-displays-ceramic-hardened"&gt;the special glass mixture introduced with the iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt; — and the build quality of the metal and glass sandwich that is the modern iPhone, expensive phones need cases. Maybe you ordered one alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;your new iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;, but if you didn’t, may I propose an exciting and undeniably useful option — &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX46nzE9wmw"&gt;a giant case that rockets hard candy&lt;/a&gt; into your mouth (&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-perfect-iphone-13-case-holds-a-bunch-of-candy-and-s-1847825950"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kTtUK1"&gt;YouTube creator and inventor Matty Benedetto is responsible for the DIY case, which he calls the Candy Catapult. It’s 3D printed from flexible TPU filament with a hard candy container back for your poison of choice, be it M&amp;amp;Ms, Skittles, or Reese Pieces (only sickos would mix all three). To actually launch the candy out of the case, Benedetto added a pinball machine-esque spring-loaded plunger. It’s hard to gauge just how hard it launches its little sugary missiles, but it definitely seems strong enough to send a piece of candy clear across the room.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nDDmDGco2eD9u6gy6eIIBJQCbAI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22910798/gif__1_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Candy Catapult works!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="g924kt"&gt;My first thought watching Benedetto’s video is not relief that I suddenly have a way to dispense with my industrial-sized bag of lozenges (no help needed there) but really excitement over the other possible things one could launch from it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6kyZmu"&gt;I’m really just wondering how quickly this becomes a weapon with metal ball bearings in it. Is it launching it hard enough to break a window if you were to swap candy with something more... damaging? Some things are perhaps best left unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch the first trailer for The Expanse season 6, arriving December 10th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/25G2lk6Rdeh02H3qcCZoLL7NGgo=/0x0:1442x961/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69970676/expanse_season_6.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zmT8sG"&gt;The beloved, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/1/14429646/expanse-season-2-syfy-relevant-science-fiction-show-television"&gt;intriguingly political&lt;/a&gt;, and mysterious sci-fi show &lt;em&gt;The Expanse&lt;/em&gt;’s final season on Amazon is nigh. Season 6 is coming December 10th, and the company just dropped the final trailer at New York Comic Con and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PJpkGPtAHE"&gt;on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; (you can watch it immediately above). It’ll run for just six episodes, airing each Friday on Amazon Prime Video and ending on January 14th, 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LBmqvm"&gt;If you’ve been devoutly following &lt;em&gt;The Expanse&lt;/em&gt;, you know things are &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; in the universe of the show. Earth’s on fire, beloved characters have died, and a mass murderer is gaining an awful lot of support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EjuCIh"&gt;Here’s how Amazon describes season 6: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="yldcWT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The sixth and final season of The Expanse picks up with the solar system at war, as Marco Inaros and his Free Navy continue to launch devastating asteroid attacks on Earth and Mars. As the tensions of war and shared loss threaten to pull the crew of the Rocinante apart, Chrisjen Avasarala makes a bold move and sends former Martian Marine Bobbie Draper on a secret mission that could turn the tide of the conflict. Meanwhile, in the Belt, Drummer and what’s left of her family are on the run after betraying Marco. And on a distant planet beyond the Rings, a new power begins to rise.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="o3MZ5V"&gt;How can Amazon possibly wind up the show in just six episodes? (A colleague points out to me that the books dedicate&lt;em&gt; three entire novels &lt;/em&gt;to exploring this current story arc in the show.) Well, my hope is that Amazon won’t exactly tie it up with a bow. While the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/26/17379736/the-expanse-amazon-prime-season-four-saved"&gt;did save the show in 2018&lt;/a&gt; after it got canceled by SyFy, showrunner Naren Shankar and actress Dominique Tipper (who plays Naomi) &lt;a href="https://ew.com/tv/the-expanse-amazon-season-6-naren-shankar/"&gt;both hinted to &lt;em&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that there could be life after Amazon, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="74Tl1L"&gt;Perhaps Netflix, Hulu, or even Apple TV Plus (remember, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690292/foundation-apple-tv-plus-review"&gt;snapped up &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a show based on seminal sci-fi work) might step in? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ru3HBy"&gt;When &lt;em&gt;Collider &lt;/em&gt;interviewed the show’s producers (who are also the books’ authors, by the way) &lt;a href="https://collider.com/the-expanse-season-6-final-season-details/"&gt;back in February&lt;/a&gt;, it sounded like they were going to leave room for more: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="yR7tdM"&gt;I think, the thing that season six does is it pays off the story that we began in episode one of season one where the Martians, the Earthers and the Belters were all in this incredibly uneasy and unstable political system with the Belters absolutely being at the foot of that table and everybody fighting for their place in the solar system. I think we pay off that story in a very satisfying way. And we keep some of the mystery intact involving the greater forces of the universe that humans are only starting to become aware. If we want to tell more stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="PRAjVy"&gt;There’s a shadow hanging over the series now, though, one that might make it less attractive to acquire: &lt;em&gt;The Expanse&lt;/em&gt;’s showrunners &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/3/22264503/the-expanse-season-5-finale-alex-kamal-cas-anvar"&gt;wrote Cas Anvar’s character (Rocinante&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;pilot Alex Kamal) off the show entirely&lt;/a&gt; after he was accused of sexual harassment and assault by &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheExpanse/comments/hi7c7q/designated_thread_for_discussing_cas_anvar/fweg1k1/"&gt;many women&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ArH5XA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s where you can buy a Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LeOAFFIkXYozdeIB8E_xA9aqhlg=/110x0:1330x813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66793958/joy_con_01.5.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nintendo Switch OLED model boasts a vibrant, 7-inch display and slate of minor upgrades.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YIrWef"&gt;The Nintendo Switch was, like most consoles during the pandemic, once in short supply. Thankfully, retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart now routinely stock the Nintendo Switch and Switch Lite in multiple color configurations and models, giving those who struck out ample opportunity to purchase Nintendo’s versatile console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DW6Flb"&gt;We’re keeping an eye across the web to find where you can buy a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/1/14772530/nintendo-switch-review-zelda-breath-of-the-wild"&gt;Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873717/nintendo-switch-lite-review-price-specs-features-games-launch-date"&gt;Nintendo Switch Lite&lt;/a&gt; (the portable-only version of the console), and the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"&gt;Nintendo Switch OLED model&lt;/a&gt;, as well as any bundles that seem like good deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lxqTuB"&gt;Where can I buy a Nintendo Switch or Switch Lite right now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="qcOiY9"&gt;Over at Amazon, you can buy an updated Nintendo Switch model with gray Joy-Cons, plus a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/dp/B07YMM3RHZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;64GB SanDisk MicroSD card for $314&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re looking to upgrade, Amazon is offering two additional bundles, one with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/dp/B07YBVJRD7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB SanDisk MicroSD card for $322&lt;/a&gt; and one with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/dp/B07YMJ4XBP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB SanDisk MicroSD card for $344&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

Another good place to look is &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-switch/systems.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nintendo’s online store, where you can often find refurbished Switch consoles&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, Nintendo is offering the &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-switch-gray-gray-joy-con-refurbished-2.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;second-gen Nintendo Switch with gray Joy-Cons&lt;/a&gt; for $260, in addition to most color configurations of the Switch Lite for $170.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tL1zU6"&gt;Where can I buy a Nintendo Switch OLED right now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FefR8R"&gt;The Nintendo Switch OLED &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22456337/nintendo-switch-oled-model-specs-date-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;officially went on sale on sale today, October 8th&lt;/a&gt;, for $350 and offers a slew of improvements, most notably a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22566479/oled-nintendo-switch-vs-lite-screen-size" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;vibrant 7-inch OLED display&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564942/nintendo-switch-oled-screen-new-kickstand" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;improved kickstand&lt;/a&gt; that offers far greater stability. The speakers get a bit louder and offer a touch more clarity, too, and there’s a wired ethernet port built directly into the dock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxXvjE"&gt;At the time of this writing, the Nintendo Switch OLED is only available at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfKju4VpwZ5#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, however, both &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-oled-console-white-joy-con%2F11149258.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Gamestop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B098RKWHHZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/switch/buy-now/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nintendo&lt;/a&gt; had the hybrid console available at launch. If you go the Best Buy route, just make sure to log in to your store account before trying to add one to your cart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="iPj5B1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nintendo Switch OLED review: screentime","url":"https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="olD4z0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10738833"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="HHzLVA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10640111"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8hV7z9"&gt;What accessories do I need to buy for the Nintendo Switch?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hgAR00"&gt;Frankly, the Switch comes with everything that you need to get started and have fun. However, a few extra purchases can help you get a little more out of your console, and in some cases, help it weather the wear and tear that it’ll undoubtedly endure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jnXhNd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556339"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9sHCpf"&gt;First off, a MicroSD card will help you extend your Switch’s default 32GB of storage. Amazon, Best Buy, and other retailers regularly sell cards with up to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-512GB-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B08GXXKY6P/ref=asc_df_B08GXXKY6P/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB of storage for around $70&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-512GB-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B08GYG5SVQ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;400GB microSD card will cost you around $49&lt;/a&gt;, though, and with each game ranging in download size from 1GB to tens of gigabytes, the card has enough space to store several of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Agp45r"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10397609"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QGdvLy"&gt;Let’s talk quickly about controllers. The Switch Joy-Cons have a somewhat unconventional look. Nevertheless, the Pro Controller is a great alternative to play most Switch games, though some Super Mario Party titles require the Joy-Cons to play. If you are looking for a Switch Pro controller, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller-Black%2F55485228&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, has the Switch Pro controller for $59, knocking $11 off its normal retail price. While both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller/dp/B01NAWKYZ0/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Faccessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-black-wireless-pro-controller%2F141756.html%3Fgclid%3DCj0KCQjw0emHBhC1ARIsAL1QGNchiWTVbB56sBuEbLjc76K169WZpHUSFCnyWf2W_sbAwyKf3XbqzX0aAiS9EALw_wcB%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt; currently have the controller available for full MSRP.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2BZPIqmUqpLcZoV5GVxdxMULT3I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9537475/akrales_171025_2091_0010.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Switch doesn’t include a screen protector, so make that one of the first things you buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UODwlY"&gt;Next up, get a tempered glass screen cover. The display on the Switch and Switch Lite is covered in plastic, and it’s just asking to get scratched as soon as you take it out of the box. Save the heartbreak by getting an affordable, easy-to-apply glass cover at Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ulULMw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N3ASPNV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A two-pack of amFilm tempered glass protectors for the Nintendo Switch is $5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="cx5X9k"&gt;If you want to play online with friends, ensure that your saves are backed up in the cloud, and get access to a slate of on-demand games from the original Nintendo console and SNES console era, you’ll want to get a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FV64QLX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It’s $20 per year for a single user&lt;/a&gt; on a console or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KY69YFM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$35 a year for up to eight users on different consoles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qlFlVd"&gt;Right now, Eneba offers a discounted &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeGameSubscriptionDeals2021&amp;amp;clickref2=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fnintendo-nintendo-switch-online-membership-12-months-eshop-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one-year, individual membership for around $21&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Nintendo Switch OLED model is now available online</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Iex0ZHIg9K53WflfIyepHkmR4Lw=/110x0:1330x813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69969602/joy_con_01.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nintendo’s newest hybrid console packs in a seven-inch OLED display and a few subtle enhancements.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zjeasP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 8th, 3:16PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Best Buy has sold out of both the white and neon Nintendo Switch OLED models. Amazon has also run out of stock, though, both models did become available again for just a moment. We’ll update this post when we see more stock become available.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KhRB6a"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 8th, 1:21PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Best Buy is the latest retailer to launch Switch OLED consoles. You can find the selection, including bundles, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfKlMGufcO5" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;right here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. If you’re lucky, you might still be able to find one at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B098RKWHHZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. We’re still waiting on Walmart, which may be gearing up to release some. We’ll update this post as the situation develops.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3iwlA8"&gt;The newest version of the immensely popular Nintendo Switch, the Nintendo Switch OLED model, is now available online. Check out &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfKlMGufcO5" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy’s selection of consoles&lt;/a&gt;, which includes several bundles. Otherwise, you may still have luck purchasing one through &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B098RKWHHZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jTTD6e"&gt;So far today, they’ve popped up at &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-oled-console-white-joy-con%2F11149258.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, but they quickly went out of stock. It’s the same story &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-switch/systems.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;through Nintendo’s online shop&lt;/a&gt;. But now Amazon has unleashed some stock of consoles. You can find the model with the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B098RKWHHZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;white Joy-Con here&lt;/a&gt;, or the model that includes the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B098RL6SBJ?&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;neon red and blue Joy-Con here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MSwcWy"&gt;We’ll add more retailers throughout the day as they appear online. We’re still waiting for Walmart to join in the fun, where there are currently landing pages that are listing both the &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-OLED-Model-w-White-Joy-Con%2F910582148" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;white model&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-OLED-Model-w-Neon-Red-Neon-Blue-Joy-Con%2F787152679" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;red and blue variant&lt;/a&gt; as being out of stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CH79pi"&gt;The Switch OLED model is the top end of Nintendo’s current console lineup, coming in at $350, while the standard Switch and portable-only Switch Lite each sit below it at $300 and $200, respectively. The new model sports a sizable screen upgrade to a larger seven-inch OLED panel that provides much better color quality and brightness. It also brings some other niceties to the Switch, such as a sturdier kickstand with improved articulation, better audio in handheld mode, and an ethernet port built into the included dock. Its internal storage got a bump from 32GB to 64GB, too, but it’s still not a bad idea to get a microSD card, like this &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GYG5SVQ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;400GB SanDisk model for $49 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yHDJzw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Based on our review&lt;/a&gt;, the Switch OLED may not provide enough reasons for some to upgrade from their previous Switch, since it isn’t any faster or more capable when docked. That said, first-time Switch owners or those who want the best handheld experience when they step away from the TV should consider making the jump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="T8iYcY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10640111"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="LBaIGt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10738833"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="59I8EI"&gt;Essential accessories, games, and subscriptions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="izJ3Se"&gt;If you do manage to snag Nintendo’s latest console, there are plenty of games and optional accessories we recommend picking up, including the excellent Nintendo Switch Pro Controller and recent hits like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22710468/metroid-dread-review-nintendo-switch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Below are a few of our favorites.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PC Building Simulator is free on the Epic Games Store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XYcRUdXUYwuXZLBjOrpbD-uPQ_k=/0x400:1200x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69970162/EGS_PCBuildingSimulator_TheIrregularCorporation_S2_1200x1600_43bc7f071217ef26e11f47d86093df10.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your key to the PC of your dreams&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NSB4Rz"&gt;Depending on who you ask, &lt;em&gt;PC Building Simulator&lt;/em&gt; is either utterly ridiculous or incredibly satisfying. You can decide for yourself by downloading this niche simulator for &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/pc-building-simulator"&gt;free from the Epic Games Store before October 17th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DxpFUf"&gt;Like the majority of sim games, &lt;em&gt;PCBS&lt;/em&gt; speaks to a very specific type of fantasy. If your idea of a good time is overclocking your computer while managing a small business, this is a game that does exactly that. My favorite feature has to be making your work computer in-game look exactly like your computer IRL. The game will even adjust the RGB lighting and wallpaper of your machine to match.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s just like my desk... except cleaner.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8hkw0f"&gt;However, depending on your level of experience, the game can actually serve as a worthwhile educational tool for anyone who wants to learn more about... well, building PCs. As someone who had never built a PC prior to playing this game, I actually leaned on the knowledge I got from this game when I started building my own rigs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DgHigC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC Building Simulator&lt;/em&gt; has received its fair share of DLC, mostly in the form of different workshop environments that are entirely cosmetic. However, it did get an esports expansion that's a little more narrative-focused and plays more like a timed puzzle game rather than a business simulation. It's also worth noting that the game regularly receives free updates that add new hardware to the already massive roster of cases, CPUs, GPUs, and other bits and bobs.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’ve spent entirely too much time in this game.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NjmT4D"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC Building Simulator&lt;/em&gt; keeps most of the fun parts of this hobby front and center, while cleverly avoiding some of the frustrations and occasional tedium. There are really only two things this game doesn’t simulate: misplacing that last thumbscrew and getting thermal paste on absolutely everything.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dtqCI4"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 is finally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22664661/apple-watch-series-7-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date"&gt;available to preorder&lt;/a&gt;, nearly a month after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;Apple announced the new smartwatch&lt;/a&gt;. But the launch of the Series 7 also brings the removal of the Series 6 from the company’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fwatch%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F8%2F22716438%2Fapple-watch-series-6-removes-lineup" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;official Apple Watch lineup&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jHP2Nv"&gt;If you want to buy a brand new Apple Watch from Apple, you now only have three options: the Series 7, which starts at $399; the still-very-good SE, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;introduced last year&lt;/a&gt; and starts at $279; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;years-old Series 3&lt;/a&gt;, which starts at $199. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JFwQ27"&gt;There are still a few ways to get a Series 6, though, and given how many features are shared &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-6-vs-apple-watch-series-7/"&gt;between the Series 7 and the Series 6&lt;/a&gt;, the previous generation model could be a good option to consider if you want to save some money. Apple’s refurbished store has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fwatch%2Fapple-watch-series-6&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F8%2F22716438%2Fapple-watch-series-6-removes-lineup" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three different Series 6 models for sale right now&lt;/a&gt;, for example, and Amazon is currently offering many &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=apple+watch+series+6&amp;amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_1"&gt;refurbished Series 6 watches at a discount&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
