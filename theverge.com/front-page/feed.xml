    <title>White House says 400 million free N95 masks will be available at US pharmacies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="First Responders Prepare Coronavirus Safety Kits For Field Officers" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5VYPCvmg_w8LSAKK1w1UV4EFk4k=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70408165/1206664154.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;N95 face masks offer better protection against COVID than cloth ones, the CDC says | Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9utJ5v"&gt;The US government will make 400 million N95 face masks available for free at pharmacies and health centers, sourcing them from the Strategic National Stockpile, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1483831305448173578?s=20"&gt;White House tweeted&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b3z5O8"&gt;The announcement comes not long after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/types-of-masks.html"&gt;acknowledged&lt;/a&gt; that the cloth masks worn by most people don’t provide as much prevention of coronavirus transmission as N95 masks or KN95 masks, the international equivalent. Some health experts have argued that the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/24/health/cloth-mask-omicron-variant-wellness/index.html"&gt;cloth masks are particularly ineffective&lt;/a&gt; against the highly contagious omicron variant of COVID-19 that has pushed infection rates higher in recent weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WV1jVQ"&gt;N95 masks are made with several layers of material that have better filtration than cloth masks and fit more snugly than other nonsurgical masks or face coverings, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="H6WDda"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Our Administration is making 400 million N95 masks from the Strategic National Stockpile available for free to Americans.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;N95 masks will be available for the public to pick up at tens of thousands of local pharmacies and health centers.&lt;/p&gt;— The White House (@WhiteHouse) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1483831305448173578?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 19, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZIbq6N"&gt;The messaging from US health officials around N95 masks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206728/cloth-face-masks-white-house-coronavirus-covid-cdc-messaging"&gt;has been confusing&lt;/a&gt;, to say the least. When the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206044/masks-cloth-coronavirus-cdc-recommendation-guidelines-wear-spread-prevent-covid-19"&gt;released guidelines in April 2020&lt;/a&gt; recommending people in the US wear “simple cloth coverings” on their faces to prevent transmission of the coronavirus, it was a reversal from its earlier stance that masks weren’t necessary at all, except for healthcare providers and people who were acutely ill. As part of that April 2020 guidance, the CDC stressed that the general public shouldn’t use surgical and N95 masks in order to reserve them for healthcare workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3ZuL6"&gt;The White House didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Wednesday, but the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/free-n95-masks-to-be-made-available-at-pharmacies-white-house-says-11642586403"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; the free masks will be available at pharmacies and community health centers beginning next week, and the program should be in full swing by early February, with three masks available per person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aPYpur"&gt;And the website that the Biden administration promised would be available for Americans to order free coronavirus tests to be delivered by mail is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889571/free-covid-19-tests-usps-website"&gt;now up and running&lt;/a&gt;, although some users &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22890031/white-house-rapid-covid-tests-apartment-bug-usps"&gt;reported problems trying to order tests&lt;/a&gt; to be delivered to apartment buildings or multiple-family residences. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Horizon Forbidden West’s new story trailer brings back Aloy’s old friends</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/APyLNayutg2BbS_2YTA6yeFwfaw=/188x0:2213x1350/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70408107/horizon_forbidden_west_screenshot_12_disclaimer_en_27may21.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aOcH2I"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/11/21285673/horizon-forbidden-west-2-ps5-trailer-teaser-zero-dawn-sequel"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is almost here, and to celebrate, PlayStation released a new trailer. In the new story trailer, we get a better idea of the threats Aloy will face going into the west. The land is dying, affected by some kind of ruinous blight that only Aloy armed with her Focus has the power to stop. To do so, she’ll mount her trusty strider and head west, exploring the beautiful ruins of famous landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mi65FV"&gt;Aloy won’t be alone on her trip. Her old friends Erend and Varl will accompany her on her journey. Another old “friend,” Sylens, has also reappeared in the west and seems to be working for the Regalla, a tribe dedicated to war and conquest, giving them the means to command and control the machines.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VY6o6y"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt;, Aloy will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22455008/horizon-forbidden-west-gameplay-ps5-sony-state-of-play"&gt;ride, hang glide, and scuba dive&lt;/a&gt; through gorgeous new locales, searching for the secrets of the new plague and the means to destroy it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aYLUTK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt; launches on PlayStation on February 18th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>COVID-19: variants, vaccines, news and updates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3_O0Xw9ORPyNDU3kx6P9o1_6hns=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66164655/acastro_200428_1777_coronavirus_0001.0.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The virus isn’t going to go away&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="4xmWh3"&gt;The earliest reports of a novel virus causing an unusual pneumonia emerged in December 2019. In the weeks that followed, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/22/21077214/coronavirus-rapid-global-response-progress-sars-unknown-virus-china-public-health"&gt;global scientific community&lt;/a&gt; identified the virus — a coronavirus, like the viruses that caused SARS and MERS — and named the disease it causes: COVID-19. It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21156325/coronavirus-pandemic-who-declares-covid-19-outbreak-global-h1n1"&gt;spread quickly&lt;/a&gt; around the world, upending the rhythms of day-to-day life, changing the patterns of human behavior, stressing health care systems, and killing millions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p2pvYd"&gt;An unprecedented effort to quickly develop vaccines paid off in late 2020, when pharmaceutical companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573072/pfizer-vaccine-effective-authorization-fda-safe"&gt;Pfizer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21569345/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-coronavirus-efficacy-announcement"&gt;Moderna&lt;/a&gt; released data showing that their shots were highly effective. A vaccination campaign quickly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358085/covid-vaccines-effective-real-world-infection-protection-cdc"&gt;helped protect people&lt;/a&gt; in higher-income countries like the United States and the United Kingdom, preventing hundreds of thousands of deaths. But vaccinations lagged in lower-income countries, and vaccine equity continues to be a major issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jt9PsB"&gt;New highly contagious and immune-evading variants, like delta and omicron, drove resurgences of the virus around the world through 2021 and 2022. Broad exposure to the virus and vaccine coverage helped limit the damage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XKDbpB"&gt;Experts say that the coronavirus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/7/21128218/coronavirus-epidemic-endemic-risk-fear-cure-treatment"&gt;isn’t going to go away&lt;/a&gt;. Population-level immunity and broader access to vaccines will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22445906/social-end-pandemic-covid-adjustment-death-vibes"&gt;defang its threat&lt;/a&gt;, and COVID-19 won’t always be an active public health emergency. But it’s another addition to the list of respiratory viruses we contend with each year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>With Activision, Microsoft is one gigantic step closer to game subscription dominance</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u1pZuIKOLkcsEHiiKiQyxpIS1WQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70408065/vpavic_201103_4275_0163.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DbOfga"&gt;This weekend, I noticed that my PS5 and Switch were literally collecting dust — and realized that’s because I’ve been playing my games almost exclusively on Xbox Game Pass instead. The service has an incredible wealth of titles; in just the past couple weeks, I’ve finished &lt;em&gt;Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice&lt;/em&gt;, unpacked boxes in &lt;em&gt;Unpacking&lt;/em&gt;, tried and failed to get invested in &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt;, watched my wife deliver mail in &lt;em&gt;Lake&lt;/em&gt;, and am currently living out my Jedi dreams in &lt;em&gt;Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order&lt;/em&gt;. I can check out new games almost as easy as hitting play on a Netflix show, too, thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787396/xbox-cloud-gaming-consoles-series-x-s-one"&gt;the recently added ability&lt;/a&gt; to stream titles from the cloud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GL9oyS"&gt;But now that Microsoft is paying &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889258/microsoft-activision-blizzard-xbox-acquisition-call-of-duty-overwatch"&gt;$68.7 billion to acquire Activision Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; — the company’s biggest buy in history — it’s going to be even harder for other gaming companies to pull me away from Game Pass as its power and influence grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gzNprt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft has been leading the charge on a Netflix-esque gaming service&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mfX14c"&gt;Microsoft has been leading the charge on a Netflix-esque gaming service for years. The company first launched Xbox Game Pass &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/24/15684972/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-subscription-launch-date"&gt;in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, and it feels like it’s been on a shopping spree ever since. It acquired &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22319124/microsoft-bethesda-acquisition-complete-finalized"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skyrim&lt;/em&gt;-maker Bethesda Softworks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/9/18658920/microsoft-acquires-double-fine-psychonauts-e3-2019"&gt;Tim Schafer’s Double Fine&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/10/17446914/microsoft-studios-the-initiative-undead-labs-playground-games-ninja-theory-compulsion-games-xbox-e3"&gt;the studio behind the &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon&lt;/em&gt; series&lt;/a&gt; to bolster its roster of developers and, importantly, the number of games it can exclusively offer on Game Pass. With its priciest $15-a-month plan, Microsoft lets you play many Game Pass games on many non-Xbox devices via the cloud, too — a useful option at a time when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22701878/xbox-phil-spencer-supply-constraints-2022"&gt;new Xbox consoles are hard to come by&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ed4V3n"&gt;With Activision, Microsoft would get a huge stable of hit games that could make the already-great Game Pass nearly unbeatable, particularly if Microsoft were to withhold them from other platforms like Sony’s PlayStation. Perhaps the most obvious potential addition is the hugely popular &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; series — Activision CEO Bobby Kotick has &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2022/01/18/bobby-kotick-interview-why-activision-blizzard-did-the-deal-with-microsoft/"&gt;already indicated&lt;/a&gt; that a streaming &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; could be in the cards. But it doesn’t stop there: Blizzard’s &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt; could become an Xbox console exclusive on Game Pass. Microsoft could decide to bring back &lt;em&gt;Guitar Hero&lt;/em&gt;. And, of course, Blizzard can easily bring early hit PC games like &lt;em&gt;Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Starcraft&lt;/em&gt; to the PC side of Game Pass, too. These are only a few of the possibilities on the table, and I’m sure Microsoft is thinking about many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2NAZ9V"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"A guide to Microsoft’s Xbox game studios empire","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22890225/microsoft-xbox-activision-blizzard-aqcuisition-game-studios"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ZUVH9G"&gt;Game Pass is such a big part of Microsoft’s gaming strategy that my colleague Tom Warren argued in July 2020 that Game Pass is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/24/21336892/microsoft-xbox-series-x-game-pass-event-showcase-future"&gt;company’s true next-gen Xbox&lt;/a&gt;. And that was &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; Microsoft’s big deals for Bethesda and Activision. The company’s huge investments and focus have put Microsoft leagues ahead of any competition, and it’s looking increasingly tough for anyone to catch up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f3SurN"&gt;Sony’s subscription efforts for PlayStation, for example, don’t offer day-and-date access to the company’s biggest exclusive games, which is arguably Microsoft’s biggest advantage with Game Pass. Even though Sony is reportedly planning to merge its PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Now services into a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22816087/sony-playstation-5-game-subscription-service-xbox-games-pass-now-spartacus"&gt;Game Pass competitor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s&lt;/em&gt; Jason Schreier, who scooped the existence of Sony’s plans, says you &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1466821381568536578"&gt;still shouldn’t expect it&lt;/a&gt; to have Sony’s biggest games the day they’re out. That means you might have to pay full price to play &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665085/sony-god-of-war-ragnarok-playstation-ps5-showcase"&gt;&lt;em&gt;God of War: Ragnarok&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when it releases, while Game Pass subscribers won’t have to drop a dime extra to play &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22531868/starfield-bethesda-game-xbox-pc-november-11-2022-release"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Starfield&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iCwFlj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This new service, expected in the spring, will likely retain the "PlayStation Plus" branding. Don't expect Sony to include its big new games day one like Game Pass does, but the expectation is a stronger offering than PlayStation Now&lt;/p&gt;— Jason Schreier (@jasonschreier) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1466821381568536578?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WsYUdr"&gt;Sony also has ground to make up in cloud gaming. The company had a major head start, buying cloud gaming startup Gaikai in 2012 and launching cloud gaming with PlayStation Now in 2015, but Sony has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20993828/sony-playstation-now-cloud-gaming-gaikai-onlive-google-stadia-25th-anniversary"&gt;largely squandered its lead&lt;/a&gt;. Sure, PlayStation Now lets you stream back-catalog PS4, PS3, and PS2 games, but with Game Pass, you can stream new Microsoft games like &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt;. And in a weird twist of corporate cooperation, Sony is relying &lt;em&gt;on Microsoft&lt;/em&gt; for the future of its cloud gaming after the two tech giants &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/20/18632374/microsoft-sony-cloud-gaming-partnership-amazon-google"&gt;announced a partnership in 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TA9ANm"&gt;Nintendo is even further behind. Nintendo Switch Online (NSO) does let you play some of the company’s very best older games, but only on a Nintendo Switch system — unlike Game Pass, you can’t play those games on your PC or your phone. To relive the glory days of Nintendo 64 games, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728113/nintendo-switch-online-plus-expansion-pack-price-n64-genesis-animal-crossing"&gt;you have to pay $30 extra annually for the premium tier&lt;/a&gt;. NSO doesn’t offer cloud gaming at all, though Nintendo does sell cloud versions of some third-party games, such as the three &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710665/kingdom-hearts-remix-hd-nintendo-switch-cloud-versions"&gt;mainline &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts&lt;/em&gt; titles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538173/control-cloud-version-nintendo-switch-release-remedy-entertainment"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And while possible, it seems extremely unlikely that Nintendo will offer day-and-date releases for its upcoming titles in the near future on NSO; you will almost certainly have to buy the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22533513/nintendo-switch-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-sequel-trailer-e3-2021-release-date-trailer"&gt;sequel to &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on its own when it comes out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qc5wJV"&gt;Other gaming subscription services also don’t pose much competition to Microsoft. One of the best is perhaps EA Play, but that’s already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21428764/xbox-game-pass-ea-play-subscription"&gt;included with an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription&lt;/a&gt;. Ubisoft has its own take, Ubisoft Plus, and while it isn’t bundled with Game Pass, Ubisoft is planning to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22868704/ubisoft-plus-xbox-launch-rainbow-six-extraction-xbox-game-pass"&gt;bring the service to Xbox in the future&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22370217/apple-arcade-fantasian-nba2k-wonderbox-classics-netflix"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21324285/google-play-pass-new-countries-annual-subscription"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; also offer gaming subscriptions, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22770244/netflix-gaming-app-launch-android-ios-future"&gt;even Netflix is getting into games&lt;/a&gt;, but all have a limited selection right now, and all are focused on gaming on phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="642iOW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft arguably leads in cloud gaming, too&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vlneIG"&gt;At one point, cloud gaming seemed like a way other companies might offer potentially great Netflix-like subscriptions, but that just hasn’t come to pass. Google had promising plans with Stadia, but it decided that investing in original content wasn’t worth it and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260803/google-stadia-game-development-studio-shut-down-jade-raymond"&gt;shut down its in-house game development studios&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon’s Luna — which is still in early access more than a year after its initial launch — relies on other publishers for content, and the only publisher contributing major games is Ubisoft (which runs its own Ubisoft Plus channel that costs a separate subscription fee). Nvidia’s GeForce Now is technically impressive, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750246/nvidia-geforce-now-rtx-3080-google-stadia-cloud-gaming"&gt;especially its new RTX 3080 tier&lt;/a&gt;, but the company has struggled with publishers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161469/nvidia-geforce-now-cloud-gaming-service-developers-controversy-licensing"&gt;over rights to content&lt;/a&gt;. Cloud gaming services from companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22418882/walmart-cloud-gaming-service-epic-games-trial-emails"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/11/18179048/verizon-gaming-video-game-streaming-service-vzg-nvidia-shield-android"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20857805/ea-cloud-gaming-service-surprise-closed-beta-project-atlas"&gt;EA&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/14/8958289/comcast-ea-xfinity-games"&gt;Comcast&lt;/a&gt; have fallen by the wayside. Microsoft, on the other hand, has found success offering cloud gaming as a perk instead of relying on the technology as the core of its subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="WBScHb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"To succeed, cloud gaming needs to disappear","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547334/cloud-gaming-xbox-xcloud-microsoft-streaming-google-stadia-amazon"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="jCZBq0"&gt;Microsoft’s huge investment in Game Pass and studios like Activision could help it upend the traditional console business that’s been largely dominated by Sony and Nintendo. All three companies have fought for players’ attention for years with exclusive games from first-party studios that are available only on their respective consoles. You have to buy the right hardware to be able to experience the exciting new games everyone is talking about. But with Game Pass, you could play &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;, one of Microsoft’s biggest games of 2021, on day one with just your laptop, an Xbox controller, and a good internet connection — no expensive console required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rSFLwB"&gt;That scenario is in line with things Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has said before. “I don’t need to sell any specific version of the console in order for us to reach our business goals,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/11/18661247/phil-spencer-interview-xbox-project-scarlett-xcloud-e3-2019"&gt;he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, when the Xbox Series X was codenamed Project Scarlett and Xbox’s cloud gaming wasn’t out yet. “In the end, how many subscribers you have to something like Game Pass, how many games people are buying, those are much better metrics on the health of the business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="36ZCGT"&gt;Right now, Microsoft is competing for more exclusive games for Xbox at an unheard-of scale — the nearly $69 billion Activision deal is set to be more than double Microsoft’s previous largest — and making those games easier to play than ever by adding them to that widely-accessible Game Pass subscription. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7NJYgX"&gt;Microsoft is making the gamble that Game Pass is the future of the gaming industry. Even if it’s wrong, the company will have an impressive roster of new Xbox games. But if it’s right, the Activision deal could give it a huge lead. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Lord of the Rings series finally has a name</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IzJITKQOFa3-DRvYtXlVN7Rd-oE=/93x0:1271x785/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70407991/lotr_rings_of_power.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Prime Video&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mCIC5M"&gt;Amazon’s upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22606267/lord-of-the-rings-amazon-series-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;series finally has a name, and it’s a damned good one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qYrOwK"&gt;Set during Second Age, thousands of years before the events of &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power &lt;/em&gt;will tell the story of how the titular rings of power were first forged and divvied up amongst Middle-earth’s races. The new series’ title — along with a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhqGCPMfkNM"&gt;forging-focused teaser video&lt;/a&gt; — allude to how the rings’ creation were both tied to the reemergence of a long-dormant evil in the world and to the subsequent hardships that the world’s men, elves, and dwarves would end up facing in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y89D07"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://press.amazonstudios.com/us/en/press-release/prime-videos-most-anticipated-new-series-of-2022-r"&gt;a press statement&lt;/a&gt; about the series and its title, co-showrunners J.D. Payne and Patrick McKay said that their desire was to come up with a title that “could live on in the spine of a book next to J.R.R. Tolkien’s other classics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UkJJbL"&gt;“&lt;em&gt;The Rings of Power&lt;/em&gt; unites all the major stories of Middle-earth’s Second Age: the forging of the rings, the rise of the Dark Lord Sauron, the epic tale of Númenor, and the Last Alliances of Elves and Men,” the pair explained. “Until now, audiences have only seen on-screen the story of the One Ring — but before there was one, there were many... and we’re excited to share the epic story of them all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tcXdmo"&gt;While &lt;em&gt;The Rings of Power &lt;/em&gt;certainly has all the makings of being the sort of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22388035/amazon-lord-of-the-rings-lotr-tv-series-production-cost-season-1"&gt;big-budget prestige fantasy&lt;/a&gt; that fans of the genre might want to tune into weekly, this series in particular is likely going to live and die by its ability to actually expand upon &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings &lt;/em&gt;lore in ways that feel essential and complementary to the canon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PWyail"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power &lt;/em&gt;season one hits Prime Video on September 2nd, with new episodes dropping every Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s colorful DualSense controllers harmonize with my color palette</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Sony DualSense controller" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ISDsJQuarwGBOdx4W2M9VDb0DW0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70407887/cfaulkner_141231_4974_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Also (unofficially) known as “the Cameron Faulkner collection”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XM4h5V"&gt;I’m not usually the kind of person who’s easily persuaded by new colorways of controllers that I already own. But Sony’s new DualSense colors are a little different — or, they’re not, actually. I just found a reason to care about them. The three vibrant, wintery-hued controllers are &lt;em&gt;my &lt;/em&gt;colors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dEiyDL"&gt;As a holiday gift, I got my “colors done” alongside my wife. I didn’t ask for this gift, but it has yielded a couple of benefits already. I strive to wear winter colors that bring out my eyes, hide my blemishes, and generally make me look ready to take on the world (look out, world!). And now, I’m surrounded by these three DualSense controllers that make me feel like I’m getting the most out of my pricey color analysis and also make gaming on the PS5 feel a little more lively.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sony DualSense controller" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nUcfVDxg8O5kOlAret53tLsPjiQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23177984/cfaulkner_141231_4974_0003.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jXWrPz"&gt;These three new colors (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-DualSense-Wireless-Controller-Starlight-Blue/dp/B09NLJGTHL?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starlight blue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-DualSense-Wireless-Controller-Starlight-Blue/dp/B09NJNR716?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;nova pink&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/accessories/accessory/dualsense-wireless-controller-galactic-purple.3006396"&gt;galactic purple&lt;/a&gt;, as Sony calls them) might seem too intense for some tastes. Your hunch may be spot-on, but they’re a very welcome dose of excitement that the PS5 has needed since launch. While Microsoft led with bold blue, yellow, red, and other color patterns (even a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714394/microsoft-xbox-20th-anniversary-controller-headset-design-preorder-date"&gt;gorgeous, translucent model&lt;/a&gt;, for crying out loud) closer to the launch of the Xbox Series X and S, Sony’s been dragging its feet, to the dismay of color enthusiasts everywhere, until now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="3Q8GK2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Where to order Sony’s new PS5 console covers and DualSense controllers","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22865349/ps5-playstation-5-console-covers-where-buy-dualsense-controllers-colors-price-preorder"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sony DualSense controller" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZBBoeE5V3O0J0uSTqkLD633fsDk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23177983/cfaulkner_141231_4974_0002.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wPVdFq"&gt;Even though each of the three colors falls neatly within my color palette, I gravitated toward two of them: the pink and the purple. The purple used on the DualSense is a luscious, deep hue that I enjoy looking at, and sometimes I’ll just pick it up to be closer to the color. It has become my night-time controller, when I’m trying to take it easy and have a relaxing session. But when I’m feeling in need of a burst of energy with a short gaming break, or it’s a bright weekend morning filled with possibilities (and lots of time to chip away at &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade&lt;/em&gt;), the nova pink controller radiates the color to match that mood.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sony DualSense controller" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d_KW4w5Oyh-tanPRtLHQefEE0sI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23177982/cfaulkner_141231_4974_0001.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;aside id="54Sh8F"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Scuf’s Reflex is another colorful option coming for PS5","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22814531/scuf-reflex-pro-fps-dualsense-ps5-pc-sony-wireless-controller-price-release-date-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="7iMtIU"&gt;Each of these controllers is now available through Sony’s PlayStation Direct site for $74.99 and will release through other retailers in the coming days (or weeks, depending on the color you want). As for the console covers, Sony plans to release them in all three of these new, stunning colors, so you can mix or match them with your controller. But until those release, Sony’s PlayStation Direct store will offer console covers in &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/accessories/accessory/ps5-console-covers-midnight-black.1000029754"&gt;midnight black&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/accessories/accessory/ps5-console-covers-cosmic-red.1000029750"&gt;cosmic red&lt;/a&gt; starting on January 21st (with more retailers to follow on February 18th).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHWmF9"&gt;I guess, then, I have some time to think about whether I’ll combine a purple console cover with a pink controller or go with a black console cover like I originally intended to do. Having options can be paralyzing, but for the PS5, more customization options are overdue. And if these particular colors resonate with you, you’ll probably enjoy owning one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat to limit friend suggestions for teenagers to prevent contact with strangers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Snapchat white ghost logo on a bright yellow background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ViSbuQKrMmJ0mBy6SYeYvpeYw_E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70407860/snapChatPattern_BW.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DbWRNY"&gt;&lt;a href="https://snap.com/en-US/safety-and-impact"&gt;Snapchat is implementing a new safety feature&lt;/a&gt; that limits the friend suggestions teenagers see in the app (via &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/18/snapchat-announces-new-parental-controls-to-limit-friend-suggestions-for-teenagers/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Kids aged 13 to 17 years old will now only receive suggestions that have “a certain number of friends in common with that person” through Snapchat’s friend suggestion feature, called Quick Add.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wacMUG"&gt;It’s unclear just how many mutual friends a user will need to have in common with a teen in order to appear on their Quick Add list, but Snapchat says it will help ensure users actually know each other in real life. The platform also plans on adding new parental control tools, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738258/snap-privacy-parental-controls-social-media-hygiene-teens-kids-evan-spiegel-instagram-safety"&gt;it hinted at last year&lt;/a&gt;, offering “parents more insight into who their teens are talking to” while still letting teens have a sense of privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vMgbLJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An NBC report first shed light on teens using the platform to buy drugs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MULCEa"&gt;These changes come as Snapchat works towards preventing users from exploiting the platform for drug dealing &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/12/30/1069062738/more-than-a-million-americans-have-died-from-overdoses-during-the-opioid-epidemi"&gt;in the wake of a fentanyl epidemic&lt;/a&gt; that’s affecting both adults and young people. Snapchat reports it’s getting better at tracking down drug-related content and has increased its proactive detection rate by 50 percent since October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3WDpU"&gt;Last year, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/1/22704501/go-read-nbc-story-snapchat-drug-dealers-fentanyl-parents-teens"&gt;report from NBC first shed light on young adults&lt;/a&gt; using the platform for buying prescription and recreational drugs and receiving fentanyl instead. Since then, Snapchat has added safety measures, such as its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714100/snapchat-fentanyl-epidemic-drug-dealer-crackdown"&gt;Heads Up education portal that warns users&lt;/a&gt; about the risks of fentanyl, as well as reporting tools to combat drug-related activity.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Yellowjackets’ first season is a collective fever dream</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="yellowjackets" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PaXMtrjX5t4GQb0F22qpsALh6ho=/0x0:4096x2731/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70407754/FEAkzkcUUAISeH5.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Showtime&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="porp4X"&gt;At the very start of &lt;em&gt;Yellowjackets&lt;/em&gt;, we meet Allie, a freshman who was meant to be on the plane when it crashed. “I’ll never forget the day I heard their plane had gone missing. I mean, that could have been me,” she says dramatically in a thick Jersey accent, cigarette and wine in hand. And yet, it wasn’t. This one throwaway line has stuck with me since the beginning of the show; the larger &lt;em&gt;Yellowjackets&lt;/em&gt; discussion isn’t just about the parasocial adoption of others’ trauma, but the way we talk about the girls and the show and regress into a deliriously unhinged version of the ’90s that I didn’t even know I wanted, and it rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YmqQMZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This essay contains spoilers for the first season of Yellowjackets.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K99dKc"&gt;When it comes to &lt;em&gt;Yellowjackets&lt;/em&gt; theories, there isn’t much to add that hasn’t already been said; I was, in the beginning, an Adam-is-Javi believer and was, until the finale, convinced that Jackie somehow made it out on her own. But, on the heels of last Sunday’s season finale, what I keep coming back to is &lt;em&gt;how &lt;/em&gt;we talk about &lt;em&gt;Yellowjackets&lt;/em&gt; and the way we project ourselves onto the imperiled teens: quietly resilient Shauna, impulsive Nat, needy Jackie, ambitious Taissa, and everyone’s favorite sociopath Misty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="d5apHS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Yellowjackets has reawakened my inner Lost fan","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/15/22884153/yellowjackets-theories-season-finale-showtime"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rQK5sP"&gt;Unfettered nostalgia for the ’90s — especially among elder millennials and Gen-X folks — has been a part of our cultural consciousness for decades, and the &lt;em&gt;Yellowjackets&lt;/em&gt; team knows it. On the surface, the ’90s setting is its most effective weapon. It was a “simpler time” full of iconic albums and movies and catchphrases and band T-shirts that remain living parts of our memories. But it was also a time when being openly queer / gay wasn’t accepted, when cloying stereotypes had a much stronger hand in shaping teen social dynamics, when things were awkward and grungy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aTisTV"&gt;All of this ‘90s catnip is a rose-colored yearning for how we communicated before smartphones and TikTok, and for high school girls, a huge part of this is a violent opera of hormones and a lot of spontaneous psychic damage to the people around them. The show’s creators, Amy Lyle and Bart Nickerson, are really, really good at wielding this brand of emotional nostalgia, and as a result, the way we talk about &lt;em&gt;Yellowjackets&lt;/em&gt; is ultimately, for me, a delightful regression back to my high-school self. It really is like riding a fucked-up bike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="FZH8Y4"&gt;A few critics have pointed out, rightly so, that all the speculating and all the theories ultimately don’t mean anything. The real beating heart of &lt;em&gt;Yellowjackets&lt;/em&gt; isn’t really about picking apart Jackie’s temporally questionable diary entries or the casual Hole song designed to send me straight back to puberty. That’s all set dressing and theatre. And as fun as it is pointing out when Shauna rocks a Yo La Tengo shirt, my takeaway from this whole experience is far more masochistic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="evmrgk"&gt;After the finale, while waiting for a friend to respond to my wall of “lottie wtf” texts, I almost fell over shambling from the bathroom with my pants around my ankles to snatch my phone. Sure, we can blame a bit of that on pandemic life, but the mad hormonal urgency with which we need to discuss and dissect each episode every Sunday night is a time machine straight back to the delirium of high school phone sessions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="m7mT3x"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Yellowjackets is a collective fever dream&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MonCdS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yellowjackets&lt;/em&gt; is a collective fever dream, a streamed microdose to bring out the best and worst of our past selves. It’s a meticulously-designed mirror that reproduces the neuroses of high-school teenhood: the small, fierce insecurities; the volcanic outbursts; the shifting alliances. When we see Jackie staring daggers at Shauna getting close to other girls, I can remember just how that white-hot paranoia and jealousy feels in my bones. Shauna and Jackie’s big finale showdown is built on the social rituals and power dynamics of every archetypal popular-girl story ever told — the kind of stuff that fueled the all-girls boarding school I went to and the kind of stuff you outgrow (hopefully) and shed like a skin. In harnessing this power, &lt;em&gt;Yellowjackets&lt;/em&gt; does something sacred and brings back all of that angst and energy to channel into its viewers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMNVi4"&gt;It’s not just a show about the visceral pains of teenhood (nor the limbo of adulthood) but the paper-thin membranes between trauma and PTSD and hysteria and reality. On a very basic level, the show is an exploration of figurative and literal interiors and exteriors, peppered with the sort of dark humor that shares a satirical heritage with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathers"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heathers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a simple formula: mix one part horror / suspense with gnarly gore, a sprinkling of dark jokes, and one part drama with a particularly alluring flavor of retrospection that sucks the viewer in like a force of nature. At the same time, it doesn’t take itself too seriously, which is its saving grace. It’s messy and melodramatic as hell, and if you think you were any better than this in high school, you’re a liar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5sYZsY"&gt;In the finale, we come back to Allie at the Yellowjackets’ 25th high school reunion, still trying to insert herself into the narrative, riding high on her position as class chair. It’s full circle — the Yellowjackets’ story as a form of parasocial community lore, the surviving group objectified as a kind of aspirational trauma porn. It comes back to the way people talk about it all, which we replicate beautifully, almost gleefully as spectators. From a theatrical standpoint, it’s one of the most effective pseudo-participatory shows I’ve committed to in a long time, and it’s wild to think it was made in part as proof that girls can be as brutal as boys &lt;em&gt;a la&lt;/em&gt; Lord of the Flies — gender essentialism aside, high school girls are powerful cacodemons, and you can bet in 2022, they absolutely know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oVHb0K"&gt;This wouldn’t be a real &lt;em&gt;Yellowjackets&lt;/em&gt; post if I didn’t cave and name a theory to end this all on and that it’s that our human sacrifice victim was possibly Lottie (tall-ish, long dark hair, last bearer of Jackie’s necklace). We’re supposed to think Lottie is still alive at the end of the season, thanks to her name being dropped in the last 30 seconds of the finale — but &lt;em&gt;Yellowjackets&lt;/em&gt; clearly still has surprises up its sleeve. The fact that it was initially sold as a five-season show is a little concerning; this isn’t the sort of story that benefits from being drawn out too long. Still, when it comes to the way it speaks to its audience and prompts us to dissect its bones among ourselves, &lt;em&gt;Yellowjackets&lt;/em&gt; is doing something really special right now that I haven’t seen or felt in years.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A guide to Microsoft’s Xbox game studios empire</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k0311CcOIEAopbqx5YDEg188gdk=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70407674/Microsoft_Activision_Blizzard.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Microsoft Corp.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tchbfi"&gt;With the impending purchase of Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion dollars, Microsoft is now the third-largest video game publisher in the world by revenue. It owns several of the biggest gaming franchises of all time, including &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Elder Scrolls&lt;/em&gt;, and now &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt;. Since the early 2000s, Microsoft has slowly but steadily expanded its holdings, adding to its stable of first-party developers. An explosion of acquisitions in the late teens combined with the purchase of Bethesda last year made Microsoft a many-armed behemoth in the gaming industry, surpassed only by Sony and Tencent. Here’s a breakdown of the studios and games Microsoft could own if the deal goes through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DCmML2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/zldVsmhJ5M"&gt;pic.twitter.com/zldVsmhJ5M&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Klobrille (@klobrille) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/klobrille/status/1483453730058125321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 18, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OO83X3"&gt;Though formally established as Xbox Game Studios Publishing in 2000, Microsoft has published a wealth of games dating back to the ’70s, including PC standards like &lt;em&gt;Solitaire&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Minesweeper&lt;/em&gt;. Throughout the aughts, Microsoft created several first-party studios to handle the development of its flagship series. In 2001, Microsoft founded Turn 10 studios for &lt;em&gt;Forza Motorsport&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; developer 343 Industries was created in 2007. The Coalition was born in 2010 after Microsoft bought the &lt;em&gt;Gears of War&lt;/em&gt; series from Epic Games. In 2018, The Initiative became Microsoft’s first Santa Monica-based developer that is working on a new&lt;em&gt; Perfect Dark &lt;/em&gt;game, and in 2019, World’s Edge was established to oversee the &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires&lt;/em&gt; franchise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gUkBj7"&gt;Microsoft’s first big acquisition was when it bought British-based developer Rare in 2002. Throughout the ’90s and into the early aughts, Rare became emblematic of the mascot platformer genre with the release of &lt;em&gt;Battletoads&lt;/em&gt; in 1991, continuing with the &lt;em&gt;Donkey Kong Country &lt;/em&gt;series, &lt;em&gt;Banjo-Kazooie&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Conker’s Bad Fur Day&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Donkey Kong 64&lt;/em&gt;. Rare’s first Xbox exclusive was the mediocre action-adventure game &lt;em&gt;Grabbed by the Ghoulies&lt;/em&gt;. Its second, V&lt;em&gt;iva Piñata&lt;/em&gt;, enjoyed a much warmer reception. Rare developed several games for Xbox’s now-defunct Kinect peripheral and currently maintains the popular pirate co-op game &lt;em&gt;Sea of Thieves&lt;/em&gt;. In 2019, Rare announced it was working on a new action-adventure game titled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/14/20965203/rare-everwild-xbox-windows-10-new-game-watch-trailer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everwild&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yBTbBG"&gt;In 2014, Mojang became Microsoft’s largest acquisition to date, adding the wildly successful sandbox game &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; to the Xbox family for $2.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5UJBvy"&gt;2018 was a major year for Xbox, acquiring six studios:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="CQqvRY"&gt;Compulsion Games, creator of &lt;em&gt;We Happy Few&lt;/em&gt; and currently working on an unannounced third-person narrative game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kx9DrS"&gt;Ninja Theory, creator of the critically acclaimed &lt;em&gt;Hellblade&lt;/em&gt; series&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vaaUgx"&gt;RPG-centric inXile Entertainment, developer of &lt;em&gt;Wasteland 3&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2tpE0V"&gt;Obsidian Entertainment, maker of&lt;em&gt; The Outer Worlds&lt;/em&gt; and the forthcoming first-person RPG &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21333050/obsidian-avowed-xbox-series-x-game-trailer-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avowed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Lnpn9C"&gt;Playground Games, developer of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22769985/forza-horizon-5-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; series&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4igzej"&gt;Undead Labs, developer of the &lt;em&gt;State of Decay&lt;/em&gt; series&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="lqpWIX"&gt;The buying spree continued in 2019 with the purchase of&lt;em&gt; Psychonauts 2&lt;/em&gt; developer Double Fine Productions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9iTpwB"&gt;In 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22319124/microsoft-bethesda-acquisition-complete-finalized"&gt;Microsoft acquired ZeniMax Media / Bethesda Softworks&lt;/a&gt;, seemingly dispensing with the strategy of buying single companies in favor of absorbing one giant publisher and all its studios at once. Microsoft bought Bethesda for $7.5 billion, acquiring its eight subsidiaries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="zdE9u2"&gt;Mobile developer Alpha Dog Games&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mOuNj0"&gt;French-based &lt;em&gt;Dishonored&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671207/deathloop-review-ps5-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; developer Arkane Studios&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UP0Uj3"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22531868/starfield-bethesda-game-xbox-pc-november-11-2022-release"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Starfield&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Fallout&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Elder Scrolls&lt;/em&gt; developer Bethesda Game Studios&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="P5uHdR"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Wolfenstein&lt;/em&gt; series developer MachineGames&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qTFXvy"&gt;Id Software, the celebrated creators of &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Quake&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZwhPi8"&gt;Tango Gameworks, the Japanese developer of horror series &lt;em&gt;The Evil Within&lt;/em&gt; and the forthcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575328/ghostwire-tokyo-tango-microsoft-ps5-exclusive-delayed-2022"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghostwire: Tokyo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bzrgej"&gt;Roundhouse Studios, formerly known as Human Head Studios, developer of 2006’s &lt;em&gt;Prey&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KP8wLe"&gt;ZeniMax Online Studios, which oversees MMO &lt;em&gt;The Elder Scrolls Online&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="VNTwlH"&gt;Provided the deal goes through, Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard King will add nine new studios, bringing the total number of developers owned to 32. The biggest studios in the deal are &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; developer Treyarch Games and Infinity Ward, as well as &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; developer Blizzard Entertainment. Activision’s previous purchases and mergers will grant Microsoft ownership of former PlayStation exclusives &lt;em&gt;Spyro the Dragon&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Crash Bandicoot,&lt;/em&gt; as well as the &lt;em&gt;Tony Hawk&lt;/em&gt; series. The deal also incorporates a number of smaller studios that work as co-developers or support for Activision Blizzard’s bigger games, including Beenox, Toys for Bob, High Moon Studios, Sledgehammer Games, and the embattled Raven Software, whose employees are entering their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820549/activision-blizzard-raven-software-layoffs-walkout-call-of-duty"&gt;fifth week of striking&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft will also gain a major player in the mobile gaming scene with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/2/9662214/actvision-blizzard-buys-candy-crush-king-5-9-billion"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; creator King. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1a0foy"&gt;Microsoft’s purchase of Activision Blizzard presents an immense opportunity to grow Xbox’s Game Pass library, and the titles mentioned here are by no means a comprehensive list of all the games it will soon have access to. Microsoft will also have to reckon with Activision Blizzard’s history of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597113/activision-blizzard-california-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-discrimination-employee-action"&gt;permitting abuse and discrimination in its workplace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785457/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-ceo-wall-street-journal-wsj-report-allegations"&gt;the CEO who allegedly enabled and buried those practices&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828146/activision-blizzard-exec-brain-bulatao-anti-unionization-letter"&gt;burgeoning efforts to unionize&lt;/a&gt; the various studios under ABK’s ownership. The acquisition is still subject to an approval process and isn’t expected to close until 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S0fIu1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DYzXiD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AMD hides its claim that 4GB of VRAM is ‘not enough’ just as it launches a 4GB GPU</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CmObtW8HrpAm-rZVynFdGYp24-Q=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70407618/amd4gbofvramoops.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0qPZ1h"&gt;AMD claimed back in 2020 that 4GB of VRAM was “insufficient” for modern PC games and could result in error messages, warning limits, lower framerates, and even gameplay stutter or pop-in issues. Today, AMD is launching the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865817/amd-radeon-rx-6500-xt-rdna-2-price-release-date"&gt;$199 RX 6500 XT&lt;/a&gt; with... 4GB of VRAM, and the blog post featuring AMD’s original claims has mysteriously disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4tNhpf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/dominic-moass/amd-hides-2020-blogpost-claiming-4gb-vram-is-not-enough-for-todays-games/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KitGuru &lt;/em&gt;reports that&lt;/a&gt; AMD has hidden the blog post today, as it was previously accessible yesterday, and a &lt;a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:SFDks_9NnscJ:https://community.amd.com/t5/gaming/game-beyond-4gb/ba-p/414776"&gt;Google cached view version&lt;/a&gt; from January 16th has the post in full. “AMD is leading the industry at providing gamers with high VRAM graphics solutions across the entire product offering,” said Adit Bhutani, a Radeon marketing specialist for AMD, in the blog post from 2020. “Competitive products at a similar entry level price-point are offering up to a maximum of 4GB of VRAM, which is evidently not enough for todays games.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G3ZyT5"&gt;At the time, AMD was promoting its own GPUs for 1080p gaming that included 6GB or 8GB of VRAM. The company performed a series of tests showing how much better an 8GB model of its RX 5500 XT was compared to a measly 4GB model. It looks like this blog post magically disappeared just as AMD is about to launch a new 4GB GPU today. &lt;em&gt;Mysterious&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xWbvQ9tNarmmy_ZEhVAVkx36HdM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23178953/amdoops.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: AMD&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AMD’s 2020 blog post included performance graphs highlighting 4GB GPUs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="35S32j"&gt;The new entry-level RX 6500 XT is supposedly priced at $199 and is available to purchase today (if you’re lucky). AMD’s marketing for this new GPU included a media roundtable earlier this month, where &lt;a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/563016/why-less-could-mean-more-in-amd-and-nvidias-new-budget-gpu-battle.html"&gt;Radeon vice president Laura Smith claimed&lt;/a&gt; “even with the four gigs of frame buffer, that’s a really nice frame buffer size for the majority of triple-A games.” &lt;em&gt;Awkward&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E3cKf9"&gt;Now, this could all be a totally innocent mistake or the most coincidental technical glitch we’ve ever seen, so we’ve reached out to AMD to comment on whether it has a search party looking for the missing blog post. We’ll update you once the blog post has mysteriously returned safe and sound.&lt;/p&gt;
