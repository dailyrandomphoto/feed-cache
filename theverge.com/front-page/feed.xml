    <title>The unsettling uncertainty of a breakthrough case  </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fve79z"&gt;Last weekend, a close friend texted me with the jarring news that her COVID-19 test had come back positive. She was vaccinated and had been since April. She got her first shot just a few days before I got mine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0IVhnl"&gt;Before I got that text, I’d been reminding my friends and family that some people who get vaccinated are going to get COVID-19 anyway. Vaccines aren’t perfect. I cautioned that when cases are surging, like they are right now in New York City, the raw number of vaccinated people who get sick is going to go up. Unvaccinated people still face even higher risks of catching the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B4G9J2"&gt;I know all of that. I think about those facts and statistics every day when I’m reading studies and checking transmission levels around the country. But even armed with that knowledge, I still spent a solid day and a half suddenly convinced that I was no better off than I was before getting vaccinated. I’m still struggling to work my way out of that spiral. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KjVS50"&gt;It’s unsettling to be mired in uncertainty again after over a year adjusting to a relationship with the coronavirus. After spending the month of June reveling in vaccinated freedom, the whiplash back to fear is jarring. Eve Sneider &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-delta-variant-has-warped-our-risk-perception/"&gt;wrote in &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;this week that the delta variant, which is driving the United State’s fourth wave, has upended our risk perception. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xVlpH5"&gt;“Choices that had become refreshingly simple and thoughtless early this summer, like entering a grocery store or a bar without a mask, are again more like skydives—relacquered with a layer of viral risk,” she wrote. “Once again I was asking: How much freedom is too much?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Zwc4Zr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;My friend’s COVID-19 case was a sudden reminder of how much delta changed the game&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fTsaFa"&gt;My friend’s COVID-19 case was a sudden reminder of how much delta changed the game. The fast-spreading variant is driving surges around the US, turning back the clock to mirror the worst outbreaks in the early days of the pandemic in Louisiana and Florida. Places with high vaccination rates are struggling, too, as the virus finds the remaining pockets of the unimmunized in those areas. Everywhere, uncertainty about the safety of daily activities is piling back up. The vaccines are holding fast against hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19, but they may not be quite as good at staving off symptomatic disease or infection with the virus. Breakthrough infections are still probably uncommon, but they may be less rare than they would have been under previous variants — there isn’t good data yet to say for sure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h96p1Q"&gt;When vaccine development started in spring of 2020, experts aimed their expectations low. Something that was 50 percent effective would have been good enough for the Food and Drug Administration. Instead, we ended up with vaccines that clinical trials said were 95 percent effective against symptomatic COVID-19 — a dream outcome people hardly even knew to hope for. The giddy promise of that high, high number buoyed my hopes through June. Delta knocked them back to Earth. Now, I’m confronted with that yawning gap between 95 and 100, which delta stretched even wider. Emotionally, even if not statistically, it feels big enough to steer a cruise ship through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VEUVD5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;my fall plans                  the delta variant &lt;a href="https://t.co/gEB8z892gq"&gt;pic.twitter.com/gEB8z892gq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— kari   (@kvrivnne) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kvrivnne/status/1425877238315163651?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iRJQUH"&gt;After a few days of what felt like a bad cold, my friend was physically fine. Mentally, she had a harder time, and so did I. It’s hard to reconcile the discord between public health trends and individual health. Despite the breakthroughs, despite delta, the vaccines are working, even if they’re not a solution &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/08/delta-has-changed-pandemic-endgame/619726/"&gt;on their own&lt;/a&gt;. Rates of COVID-19 are &lt;a href="https://www.sandiegocounty.gov/content/dam/sdc/hhsa/programs/phs/Epidemiology/COVID-19%20Watch.pdf"&gt;far lower&lt;/a&gt; among vaccinated people than they are for unvaccinated people in cities reporting that data. States with higher vaccination rates &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/highly-vaccinated-states-keep-worst-covid-19-outcomes-in-check-as-delta-spreads-wsj-analysis-shows-11628328602"&gt;aren’t seeing&lt;/a&gt; as much of a surge in hospitalization. They’re working for most of the vaccinated people who get COVID-19, too — it just doesn’t always feel that way. It’s hard to process the big-picture safety when you or someone you know is curled up in bed, sick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VuM9SL"&gt;Slipping back into caution after a brief spell of optimism and hope is hard. I’ve spent the week dragging myself back from the edge, again and again, reminding myself that the shots are still working. Public Health England &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sajidjavid/status/1425826341056925696"&gt;said this week&lt;/a&gt; that, so far, vaccines prevented 23 million COVID-19 infections and 84,600 deaths in England. I’m holding fast to the reminders like that one: even though delta makes the virus more frightening, the vaccines are still here, and they’re still keeping people alive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGjF2X"&gt;Here’s what else happened this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="u3vy4u"&gt;Research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eGaynO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/11/health/vaccine-pregnant-cdc.html"&gt;The C.D.C. endorses Covid vaccinations during pregnancy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Safety data shows there is no increased risk of miscarriage for pregnant people who receive a COVID-19 vaccine. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says they should get the vaccine. (Roni Caryn Rabin / &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

Kids are at a lower risk for severe outcomes, but when more kids get sick, more get seriously ill. (Katherine Wu / &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8vLD2N"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/dissecting-the-unusual-biology-of-the-sars-cov-2-delta-variant-69068"&gt;Dissecting the Unusual Biology of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Delta is the fastest-spreading version of the coronavirus. Scientists are trying to understand why. It might be able to replicate more quickly, or fuse more easily with cells, but there aren’t conclusive answers yet. (Katarina Zimmer / &lt;em&gt;The Scientist&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cTTWAK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22619963/third-dose-covid-vaccine-transplant-nih-study"&gt;Kidney transplant patients will test a COVID-19 booster shot in new trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;The National Institutes of Health is checking to see if a third dose of a COVID-19 vaccine helps kidney transplant patients mount a more effective immune response. (Nicole Wetsman / &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="odMcn4"&gt;Development &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="buNfY8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-vaccine-us-military-requirement-pentagon-3975940c732352f72e41f6e34a3a2669?utm_medium=AP&amp;amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow"&gt;Pentagon to require COVID vaccine for all troops by Sept. 15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Members of the military will have to get a COVID-19 vaccine.

&lt;p id="PCIBRb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/08/10/covid-intranasal-vaccines/"&gt;A snort or a jab? Scientists debate potential benefits of intranasal Covid-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vaccines sprayed into the nose might be able to protect the nasal passages more effectively than shots in arms. But it’s unclear if gene-based vaccines could be reformulated to be administered through that route. (Helen Branswell / &lt;em&gt;Stat News&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OQAK6q"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nationalgeographic.com%2Fscience%2Farticle%2Fthe-world-needs-more-vaccines-faster-a-tiny-tube-could-make-all-the-difference&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22622344%2Fbreakthrough-covid-delta-uncertainty-vaccines" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The world needs more vaccines, faster. A tiny tube could make all the difference.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Right now, vaccines are made in large vats, which can be inefficient. A team of scientists thinks making them in a continuously running tube might be a better solution. (Roxanne Khamsi / &lt;em&gt;National Geographic&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="grbPRu"&gt;Perspectives &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="zfi8dV"&gt;My deescalation research was all for naught. Nineteen of the 20 people who shuffled up the stairs at the dive bar had their vaccine proof ready for inspection during the first hour I observed Adams and Powers. No one made a fuss, not even the one patron who fumbled for documentation for 10 minutes before giving up and leaving. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="JnA8gE"&gt;— &lt;em&gt;Washington City Paper&lt;/em&gt;’s Laura Hayes was expecting the worst on the first night a bar was requiring &lt;a href="https://washingtoncitypaper.com/article/527554/i-watched-the-door-at-a-d-c-bar-the-first-night-it-required-proof-of-vaccination/"&gt;proof of COVID-19 vaccination&lt;/a&gt;. But it went off without a hitch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IOqaIp"&gt;More than numbers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4tzoD2"&gt;To the people who have received the 4.5 billion vaccine doses distributed so far — thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vdsoGE"&gt;To the more than 205,202,233 people worldwide who have tested positive, may your road to recovery be smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SbHqHe"&gt;To the families and friends of the more than 4,330,899 people who have died worldwide — 618,840 of those in the US — your loved ones are not forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pYEI4E"&gt;Stay safe, everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZuaey"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rockstar is reportedly remastering its PS2-era Grand Theft Auto trilogy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Grand Theft Auto III: 10 Year Anniversary Edition" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EOSp2ZjK_OWYENox728QSvfmPqI=/76x0:640x376/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69720181/gta3_android002.1323195668.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Screenshot: GTA3&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nvhVCa"&gt;Rockstar Games’ Dundee studio is working on remastered versions of three classic PS2-era &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/em&gt; titles: &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto 3&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/the-gta-remastered-trilogy-appears-to-be-real-and-comi-1847474620"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. A late October or early November release is said to be tentatively planned for the titles, which could eventually be released for PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and S, Switch, PC, Stadia, and mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pnDzpP"&gt;Rumors of the remastered titles have been floating around for some time, but this month Rockstar Games’ parent company Take-Two Interactive confirmed it has plans to release “&lt;a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/8d225019-d1db-4e8e-8f81-24a9271af962"&gt;three unannounced&lt;/a&gt;” iterations of old games, alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441925/grand-theft-auto-5-gta-online-ps5-xbox-series-x-release-date"&gt;current-gen ports of &lt;em&gt;GTAV&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;GTA Online&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Kerbal Space Program.&lt;/em&gt; However, considering Take-Two’s library of games, these three unannounced remasters could include anything from &lt;em&gt;Bioshock &lt;/em&gt;to &lt;em&gt;Max Payne,&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Bully&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7LESzf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The trilogy defined a generation of open-world games&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KQjU4k"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;, the three &lt;em&gt;GTA &lt;/em&gt;games are being remastered in Unreal Engine, with one source commenting that they look like heavily-modified versions of the existing titles. Gameplay is said to be staying true to the originals, while their UI should also retain their classic style. The games’ release has reportedly shifted a lot as a result of the pandemic, but the current plan is said to be a simultaneous digital release for the three titles across most platforms this year, with PC and mobile following in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P7xZsf"&gt;A spokesperson from Rockstar Games did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The publisher is also said to be planning a remaster of the original &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption &lt;/em&gt;if the remastered trilogy sells well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i0pDk4"&gt;Rockstar’s PS2-era trilogy defined a generation of open-world games, and were three of the biggest games on the console. Although the three feature independent worlds and storylines, they’re part of the same shared universe, with certain characters appearing across the three games. In addition to the trilogy, Rockstar also released two PSP games set in the same cities (one in &lt;em&gt;GTA3&lt;/em&gt;’s Liberty City and one in Vice City), which were later ported to traditional consoles.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon moves Lord of the Rings production from New Zealand to UK</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_e5wH4q-rAacHmZ4H3hoQEDZiyQ=/160x0:1888x1152/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69719401/1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FkkSYF"&gt;Amazon has decided to produce its upcoming &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; TV series in the UK from the second season on. Although the first season was filmed in New Zealand, as with Peter Jackson’s movies, Amazon now says pre-production on season two will begin early next year in the UK while season one post-production continues in New Zealand through June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tMyMf0"&gt;It’s not clear exactly where the series will be shot. Amazon is shipping the complex sets it built for the first season over to the UK and is currently booking stages for them, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/08/the-lord-of-the-rings-season-2-move-production-uk-new-zealand-1234813857/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company films several Prime Video series in the UK already, including Neil Gaiman adaptations &lt;em&gt;Good Omens &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Anansi Boys.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n2CW97"&gt;The move to the UK won’t be without controversy. Author J.R.R. Tolkien based Middle-earth’s Shire on his experiences living in rural England, but Jackson’s vivid depictions in the movies has made New Zealand’s landscapes just as closely associated with the franchise, and drove significant tourism to the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="lNABHG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"One show to rule them all: everything we know about Amazon’s Middle-earth series","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/5/17203132/amazon-middle-earth-lord-of-the-rings-the-hobbit-tv-series"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wwuxzX"&gt;“We want to thank the people and the government of New Zealand for their hospitality and dedication and for providing &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings &lt;/em&gt;series with an incredible place to begin this epic journey,” Amazon Studios VP Vernon Sanders says in a &lt;a href="https://press.amazonstudios.com/us/en/press-release/amazon-studios-ithe-lord-of-the-ringsi-origin-1"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “We are grateful to the New Zealand Film Commission, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, Tourism New Zealand, Auckland Unlimited, and others for their tremendous collaboration that supported the New Zealand film sector and the local economy during the production of Season One.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vhnf4C"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; reports that New Zealand’s strict handling of the COVID-19 pandemic was a factor in Amazon’s decision. More than half of the cast is British and has reportedly had to stay in New Zealand for around two years because of border restrictions and quarantine rules. With a base in the UK, the cast will be much closer to home, and the producers may also be able to make use of other locations around Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2mSxIc"&gt;The first season of the &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; show, which is set thousands of years before the original books and still doesn’t have a formal title, is set to come to Prime Video on September 2nd next year. This season alone is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22388035/amazon-lord-of-the-rings-lotr-tv-series-production-cost-season-1"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; to have cost the e-commerce giant $465 million to produce, with Amazon receiving a 20 percent tax credit from the New Zealand government.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Immunocompromised people can get third COVID-19 vaccine shot, FDA says</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oLfgR2eSfJfYzX0ZOLM8DgMcN1c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69719260/acastro_210309_1777_vaccine_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fZnPpd"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration will allow people with compromised immune systems to get a third dose of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the Pfizer / BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. The agency &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-additional-vaccine-dose-certain-immunocompromised"&gt;amended the emergency use authorizations&lt;/a&gt; for each vaccine to allow this specific group of people to get an extra shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M7LCSf"&gt;Usually, the standard two doses are enough for a person to generate plenty of antibodies to fight off the coronavirus. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22619963/third-dose-covid-vaccine-transplant-nih-study"&gt;research done&lt;/a&gt; over the past few months shows that many immunocompromised people make too few antibodies or none at all. A third dose might give some of those patients the boost they need to produce antibodies. French officials have been recommending those patients get a third shot since April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hhjrhb"&gt;The Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is expected to vote on Friday on whether that agency should recommend a third shot for this group. The committee discussed the possibility of boosters at its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22549336/covid-vaccine-booster-immunocompromised-antivirus"&gt;June&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/564421-cdc-panel-weighs-whether-to-recommend-boosters-for-immunocompromised"&gt;July&lt;/a&gt; meetings, and during those conversations, many members seemed to support the change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iNvXii"&gt;The change only clears booster doses for people who have received solid organ transplants or with conditions that impair the immune system to a similar degree. The agency did not give additional details about which conditions might qualify. The change doesn’t open up third shots to otherwise healthy adults, and it’s still not clear if and when those may be necessary. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jake Paul will not face federal charges after FBI raid</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6nhD7h"&gt;The US Attorney won’t be filing any charges against Jake Paul, according &lt;a href="https://www.tmz.com/2021/08/12/jake-paul-no-federal-charges-arizona-mall-incident-george-floyd-protest-scottsdale-looting/"&gt;to &lt;em&gt;TMZ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and a statement sent to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; by Paul’s lawyers. Paul &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366407/jake-paul-fbi-raid-comment-arizona-looting-absurd-rumors"&gt;was being investigated by the FBI&lt;/a&gt;, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21356047/jake-paul-fbi-federal-search-warrant-house-raided-guns"&gt;raided his house&lt;/a&gt;, for his involvement in an incident that took place at an Arizona mall in May 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3tuxpr"&gt;These particular legal troubles began when Paul was filmed in and around a mall in Scottsdale, AZ, which was being looted in the wake of police brutality protests sparked by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22529934/darnella-frazier-filmed-george-floyd-murder-phone-pulitzer-prize-citation"&gt;the murder of George Floyd&lt;/a&gt;. Paul denied participating in the looting (and wasn’t seen doing so in the videos that circulated on social media), but was still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21280476/jake-paul-arizona-protests-riots-youtube-filming-scottsdale"&gt;charged with criminal trespassing and unlawful assembly&lt;/a&gt; by the Scottsdale Police Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nDScL8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21356047/jake-paul-fbi-federal-search-warrant-house-raided-guns"&gt;According to police&lt;/a&gt;, the charges against Paul were then dropped to allow the FBI to carry out a federal criminal investigation. In a now-deleted video, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366407/jake-paul-fbi-raid-comment-arizona-looting-absurd-rumors"&gt;Paul said that investigation was why the FBI raided his home&lt;/a&gt; in California, in August 2020. At the time, the FBI confirmed that it did carry out “federal search warrants” in California related to the investigation, but would not comment on what they were looking for or what was found. Now, it seems, that investigation is over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zLBpFO"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;same &lt;a href="https://t.co/hIo8Zk9X6C"&gt;https://t.co/hIo8Zk9X6C&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jake Paul (@jakepaul) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jakepaul/status/1424189582036373510?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nvxOmq"&gt;So far, Jake Paul himself seemingly hasn’t commented on the US Attorney’s decision. Last week, though, he made a reference on Twitter to running away from the FBI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aAUZ7J"&gt;Paul’s counsel told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that they “are pleased that the United States Attorney reached the conclusion that no criminal charges should be filed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NIuQKo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amid Black Widow lawsuit, Disney boss defends its pandemic release strategy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AKO4Mc4mS-_UFEuGDEKIABO0kbw=/210x0:1230x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69718474/cc34ecb078c29957ad70d987b6b38121.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Marvel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nvwgHB"&gt;Following a high-stakes lawsuit over Disney’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22600396/scarlett-johansson-suing-disney-black-widow-release"&gt;day-and-date release&lt;/a&gt; of Marvel’s &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; on its Premier Access streaming platform and the company’s compensation of the film’s star Scarlett Johansson, the head of Disney today defended both the company’s payouts to talent as well as its decisions around various pandemic movie releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VFRDSq"&gt;During the company’s third-quarter earnings call, Disney boss Bob Chapek explained the company’s multi-pronged approach to releasing its films throughout the pandemic, which included theatrical exclusives, straight-to-digital releases on Disney Plus, and a hybrid of both that saw films debut on Disney’s paid Premier Access platform the same day they premiered in theaters. Premier Access was chosen as the release model for several of its highly anticipated releases in the last year, including &lt;em&gt;Mulan&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KmUXIT"&gt;“Bob Iger and I, along with the leaders of our creative and distribution teams, determined this was the right strategy because it would enable us to reach the broadest possible audience,” Chapek said during the call. “And just to reiterate, distribution decisions are made on a film-by-film basis based on global marketplace conditions and consumer behavior. We will continue to utilize all available options going forward, learn from insights gained with each release, and innovate accordingly while always doing what we believe is in the best interest of the film and the best interest of our constituents.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ye2TcM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Distribution decisions are made on a film-by-film basis.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vkiZ38"&gt;Chapek was asked by one shareholder on the call how the company thinks about the success of a film in the current pandemic environment as well as how the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611516/scarlett-johansson-disney-lawsuit-streaming-services-transparency"&gt;compensates its talent&lt;/a&gt;. (The &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; suit argued the film’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572613/black-widow-disney-plus-premier-access-theaters"&gt;box office performance&lt;/a&gt; was severely impacted by the hybrid release.) Chapek offered that the company is “reacting to a very fluid situation in terms of the marketplace,” but added that some of these films were “conceived under a time when we did not know what was going to be happening with consumer behavior three, four years later and certainly didn’t know about covid at the time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YcSDOk"&gt;“We’re dealing under a different set of conditions than we thought,” Chapek said. “What I will say is that just like we’ve done many times before as the business has evolved and transformed, we’ve figured out ways to fairly compensate our talent so that no matter what the business model is that we have to go to market with, everybody feels satisfied.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3uONhJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’ve figured out ways to fairly compensate our talent.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ptNB4H"&gt;While neither &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; nor Johansson were explicitly mentioned in Chapek’s responses, they appear to double down on statements previously made in response to Johansson’s suit, which the company said last month had “no merit.” As part of her complaint, Johansson argued that she lost out on substantial bonuses that were tied to the film’s performance at the box office and that Disney’s decision to release it on Premier Access cut into her earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jdt210"&gt;Disney said that the time that it “fully complied with Ms. Johansson’s contract and furthermore, the release of Black Widow on Disney Plus with Premier Access has significantly enhanced her ability to earn additional compensation on top of the $20M she has received to date.” Based on the fact that she’s suing the company, Johansson seems to disagree.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s $1.5 billion Air Hub opens in Kentucky to speed up deliveries</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qWmkExyBy-2qNBFE1A6c6dTcqpw=/51x0:609x372/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69717817/90.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YNFI2Y"&gt;Your Amazon packages may be getting an express ticket — &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/welcome-to-the-amazon-air-hub"&gt;Amazon has finished building&lt;/a&gt; its $1.5 billion air hub, located at the Cincinnati / Northern Kentucky International Airport, and has started operations there. Amazon started building the 800,000-square-foot facility in 2019, and it now boasts robots, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-air-hub-kentucky-photos-2021-8#amazon-air-hub-is-situated-on-600-acres-at-the-cincinnatinorthern-kentucky-international-airport-1"&gt;miles of conveyor belts&lt;/a&gt;, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZPRh7"&gt;A big benefit of having a centrally located place to process packages and get them on planes is speed — that’s why UPS has a hub in Louisville, Kentucky; FedEx ships many packages through Memphis, Tenessee; and DHL has a hub in the same airport as Amazon. Amazon’s press release says that the cargo hub will help with the “rapid transport of customer packages throughout the U.S.” Jeff Bezos also made that argument, tweeting that the hub would help customers get packages faster when the company broke ground on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="x1BSZD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’re investing $1.5 billion in our new air hub to get you your packages faster. Three million square feet, and it’s going to create 2,000 jobs. And if you’re guessing that driving a front loader was fun, you’re right! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/amazon?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#amazon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/prime?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#prime&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Cud4orKrC4"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Cud4orKrC4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/1128409227481964544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 14, 2019&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V2IPcR"&gt;Amazon has been working on expanding its air capabilities since it &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/04/amazon-to-launch-prime-air-its-own-dedicated-cargo-planes-to-speed-delivery/"&gt;started on its fleet in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. The company even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215279/amazon-buys-boeing-jets-planes-delta-westjet"&gt;purchased 11 planes for itself&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. In April 2021, Amazon had over 70 planes working as part of its transportation and logistics network, according to &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/transportation/amazon-air-launches-new-hub-in-southern-california"&gt;a press release put out by the company&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XAvs2b"&gt;Amazon’s estimates of processing “millions of packages every week” at its air hub once it becomes fully operational shows that it’s become a massive shipper in its own right, one that’s interested in keeping the packages within its control at every step. In 2019, Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/7/20758346/fedex-amazon-ground-shipping-ending-contract"&gt;stopped working with FedEx&lt;/a&gt; for air and ground transportation of its packages, and its massive investment into the facility indicates that the company is looking to take even more control over the air portion of its logistics chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tj254W"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/r-amazon-to-spend-149-bln-on-air-cargo-hub-fans-talk-of-bigger-ambitions-2017-2"&gt;Some analysts have speculated&lt;/a&gt; that Amazon could be looking to use its logistics prowess to deliver other company’s packages, not just its own. At the moment, Amazon’s messaging is focused mainly on how its air hub will impact consumers and the local Northern Kentucky area, but the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215279/amazon-buys-boeing-jets-planes-delta-westjet"&gt;has recently been investing in&lt;/a&gt; personal transportation companies like Zoox and Rivian. If Amazon is looking to become a transportation company for you and your packages, a centrally located logistics hub would certainly be an important investment. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook shouldn't be allowed to buy Giphy, says UK regulator</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wbYiiZsjKgUw1Xi8NwG98B8EGHQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69717805/acastro_180806_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3bzKu1"&gt;15 months ago, Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/15/21259965/facebook-giphy-gif-acquisition-buy-instagram-integration-cost"&gt;said it was buying&lt;/a&gt; the popular GIF search engine Giphy for about $400 million. Now the acquisition may be a bust, thanks to an antitrust probe by the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xT3GUM"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/facebook-s-takeover-of-giphy-raises-competition-concerns"&gt;preliminary findings report&lt;/a&gt; published Thursday, the CMA said the deal should be unwound because it will “negatively impact competition between social media platforms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5qRjSJ"&gt;The CMA’s reasoning for wanting to block the Giphy deal is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="VedAea"&gt;“Millions of posts every day on social media sites now include a GIF. Any reduction in the choice or quality of these GIFs could significantly affect how people use these sites and whether or not they switch to a different platform, such as Facebook. As most major social media sites that compete with Facebook use Giphy GIFs, and there is only one other large provider of GIFs – Google’s Tenor – these platforms have very little choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="69YocV"&gt;The CMA provisionally found that Facebook’s ownership of Giphy could lead it to deny other platforms access to its GIFs. Alternatively, it could change the terms of this access – for example, Facebook could require Giphy customers, such as TikTok, Twitter and Snapchat, to provide more user data in order to access Giphy GIFs. Such actions could increase Facebook’s market power, which is already significant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="6MwhHO"&gt;Putting aside the logic that someone would switch to using Facebook because of GIFs (I love GIFs as much as the next person, but come on), the CMA argues that Giphy was in the process of building up an ads business that would have competed with Facebook. It claims that Facebook made Giphy end those plans after it announced the deal, thereby reducing competition in the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8fyMfg"&gt;Facebook has refuted this idea in past submissions to the CMA, citing internal documents it and Giphy both submitted to the agency for the probe. In May, Facebook wrote in &lt;a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/60c34db5d3bf7f4bcee709a0/_Non-Confidential_-_Facebook_GIPHY_Main_Parties_Initial_Submission_19_May_2021_.pdf"&gt;a filing to the watchdog&lt;/a&gt; that Giphy had “no meaningful audience of its own” and was already “reliant on Facebook for a significant proportion of its user traffic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ULA0vx"&gt;Giphy raised $150 million in funding over its 8-year-history but had yet to turn a profit and was running out of money at the time it agreed to the deal with Facebook, according to people familiar the matter. After failing to raise a round of funding several months prior, it agreed to be sold for less than the prior valuation it had been given by investors—a sign that its viability as an independent business was in trouble&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7lgskX"&gt;“We disagree with the CMA’s preliminary findings, which we do not believe to be supported by the evidence,” a Facebook spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;adding that the company “will continue to work with the CMA to address the misconception that the deal harms competition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iLghe2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Giphy’s employees have been stuck in a holding pattern&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9yCJKI"&gt;Meanwhile, Giphy’s more than 100 employees have been stuck in a holding pattern since the deal with Facebook was announced. They haven’t been allowed to become Facebook employees, though Facebook has been paying Giphy’s bills to keep the company running, according to a person familiar with the arrangement. Facebook has already paid for most of Giphy’s stock as part of the deal terms, but a percentage that was withheld for employee retention remains in limbo. (A Facebook spokesperson declined to comment on any financial-related matters with Giphy.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9iawPW"&gt;Whether Facebook is allowed to buy Giphy or not, the scrutiny on this deal shows how Facebook’s era of social media-related acquisitions may be over. Its more recent &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-nears-purchase-of-startup-in-deal-that-values-it-at-1-billion-11606750196"&gt;$1 billion acquisition attempt for Kustomer&lt;/a&gt;, a customer service platform for businesses,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is under antitrust review in multiple countries and could also be blocked. The only types of acquisitions that Facebook has been able to get away with in the last few years are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22537795/is-facebook-cornering-the-vr-market"&gt;related to its augmented and virtual reality efforts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5wdgTN"&gt;The CMA’s final report on the Giphy deal is due in early October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="s1V8Z7"&gt;&lt;div style="max-width: 87vh;"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 114.4828%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/9M5jK4GXmD5o1irGrF" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Apple updates Eddy Cue’s title to better reflect its turn to services</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jgwTry"&gt;Apple rolled out &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fleadership%2Feddy-cue%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F12%2F22622178%2Fapple-eddy-cue-job-title-update-senior-vp-services" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a small but meaningful update&lt;/a&gt; to senior executive Eddy Cue’s job title on Thursday that features an area of interest the company has long been focused on: services (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/12/eddy-cue-title-change-services-apple/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Eddy Cue is a longstanding veteran at Apple who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/26/4265172/itunes-store-at-10-how-apple-built-a-digital-media-juggernaut"&gt;helped build iTunes&lt;/a&gt; and the App Store, but his new title of “Senior Vice President, Services” reflects the company’s increasingly important side hustle, if not outright transformation into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18273179/apple-icloud-itunes-app-store-music-services-businesses"&gt;a media business and subscription peddler&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w3iqBM"&gt;Prior to Thursday, Eddy Cue was senior vice president of internet software and services, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210303073700/https://www.apple.com/leadership/eddy-cue/"&gt;with responsibilities&lt;/a&gt; that included overseeing the iTunes Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, Maps, Search Ads, iCloud, and iWork. His new job description emphasizes Apple’s subscription darlings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="6r296t"&gt;Eddy oversees the full range of Apple’s services, including Apple Music, Apple News, Apple Podcasts, the Apple TV app, and Apple TV Plus, as well as Apple Pay, Apple Card, Maps, Search Ads, Apple’s iCloud services, and Apple’s productivity and creativity apps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ApPa26"&gt;Apple still makes a ton of money selling hardware and software — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596120/apple-q3-2021-earnings-iphone-ipad-mac"&gt;earning a total of $81.43 billion during the third quarter of 2021&lt;/a&gt; — but its services business has specifically been growing as of late, earning an all-time revenue high of $17.5 billion during the same quarter. Apple’s found major success &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394062/apple-tv-ted-lasso-season-2-trailer-premiere-date"&gt;in streaming hits like &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that may have helped, and seems primed to take even bigger, more &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;-sized swings &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547252/foundation-release-date-apple-tv-plus-september"&gt;with shows like &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; later this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mETswq"&gt;Cue’s had a hand in many pies over his time at Apple, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/1/16240584/apple-eddy-cue-siri-craig-federighi"&gt;managing Siri for a period&lt;/a&gt; before Apple began to actively compete with Google Assistant. He’s also now infamously known as one of the few executives &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406303/imessage-android-eddy-cue-emails-apple-epic-deposition"&gt;who pushed for Apple to bring iMessage to Android&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to an email exchange between Cue and senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi that was dug up as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; antitrust lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hlhLGX"&gt;A title change might not mean that much in terms of what Cue does day to day, but it is yet more evidence that Apple’s services business is here to stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RotckP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sl1ehU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3lvlgv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook office return delayed until 2022 in the US</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VZyTmX"&gt;Specifically citing concerns about a rise in cases of the delta variant of COVID-19, Facebook confirmed a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-12/facebook-delays-return-to-offices-until-2022-for-u-s-employees?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; report that it has pushed back plans for US workers to return to the office until next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="kKTbOX"&gt;Data, not dates, is what drives our approach for returning to the office. Given the recent health data showing rising Covid cases based on the Delta variant, our teams in the US will not be required to go back to the office until January 2022. We expect this to be the case for some countries outside of the US, as well. We continue to monitor the situation and work with experts to ensure our return to office plans prioritize everyone’s safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="lcjC0S"&gt;Just a few weeks ago, Facebook was still planning to have fully reopened offices by October with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598818/facebook-vaccine-requirement-us-office-employees"&gt;requirements for vaccination and masking&lt;/a&gt;. Now, with an eye toward local data on infections, the 50 percent return in September and ramp up to full capacity are months further away. Offices outside the US may reopen later this year, depending on the situation locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6949Rs"&gt;In the spring we noted that, like Microsoft and Uber, Facebook was scheduling its office reopenings. Now, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611439/amazon-office-employees-postpone-back-to-work-january-2022"&gt;like Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, it’s responding to a new wave of infections by delaying pandemic reopenings until January 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
