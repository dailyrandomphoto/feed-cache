    <title>Google exec says Apple is ‘holding back’ customers who text</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ubml4b"&gt;On Saturday, Android boss Hiroshi Lockheimer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22876067/google-apple-ios-android-imessages-bullying-lockheimer"&gt;accused Apple of “using peer pressure and bullying as a way to sell products&lt;/a&gt;,” after &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-apples-imessage-is-winning-teens-dread-the-green-text-bubble-11641618009"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; revealed how US teens have turned Apple’s iMessage into a social status symbol that locks Android users out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mC6YMP"&gt;Now, Lockheimer is taking a slightly less abrasive stance: the Google executive &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lockheimer/status/1480663650775883777"&gt;said Monday&lt;/a&gt; that “we’re not asking Apple to make iMessage available on Android. We’re asking Apple to support the industry standard for modern messaging (RCS) in iMessage, just as they support the older SMS / MMS standards.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hhiPL1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’re not asking Apple to make iMessage available on Android. We’re asking Apple to support the industry standard for modern messaging (RCS) in iMessage, just as they support the older SMS / MMS standards.&lt;/p&gt;— Hiroshi Lockheimer (@lockheimer) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lockheimer/status/1480663650775883777?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 10, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="alkhQP"&gt;“By not incorporating RCS, Apple is holding back the industry and holding back the user experience for not only Android users but also their own customers,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lockheimer/status/1480663659135176705"&gt;adds Lockheimer&lt;/a&gt;, later in the Twitter thread. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qgvZlc"&gt;That’s still a big accusation, but one that pulls the conversation back into familiar territory: will Apple &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lockheimer/status/1446193676883922953?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1446193676883922953%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F7%2F22715696%2Fsvp-android-invitation-apple-rcs-texting-iphone"&gt;accept Google’s olive branch&lt;/a&gt; to make iMessage more compatible with Android, or will it continue to use lock-in to sell more iPhones? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HOt9Oq"&gt;On the lock-in front, there’s little question about Apple’s motivation. Thanks to the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;the world has now seen confidential emails&lt;/a&gt; between Apple executives that show  the company is intentionally withholding iMessage in favor of lock-in. “I am concerned the iMessage on Android would simply serve to remove an obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones,” &lt;a href="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/21043920-2013-april-federighi-and-schiller-tell-cue-not-to-bring-imessage-to-android-lockin/#document/p2"&gt;wrote Apple exec Craig Federighi in April 2013&lt;/a&gt;, adding “I think we need to get Android customers using and dependent on Apple products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AWOCzA"&gt;“Joz and I think moving iMessage to Android will hurt us more than help us, this email illustrates why,” &lt;a href="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/21043935-2016-march-phil-schiller-why-imessage-lockin-is-important/#document/p1"&gt;wrote Apple’s Phil Schiller in March 2016&lt;/a&gt;, forwarding an email from Beats Music co-founder Ian Rogers about how he “missed a ton of messages from friends and family” after switching to an Android phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qCGNOG"&gt;What’s less clear is whether RCS, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22783220/vergecast-podcast-rcs-explainer-google"&gt;the next-gen replacement for SMS that’s championed by Google&lt;/a&gt; and incorporates popular features common to iMessage, has any convincing reason for Apple to sign on. That’s likely why Google is creating a little peer pressure of its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6U1Fmm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Let’s chat about RCS","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22783220/vergecast-podcast-rcs-explainer-google"},{"title":"The moral case for iMessage on Android","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/6/18171021/moral-case-imessage-android"},{"title":"Why I turned on iMessage","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/13/18677644/imessage-iphone-apple-secure-encrypted-chat-moral-imperative-signal-rcs-hangouts"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="nMgnBN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22715696/svp-android-invitation-apple-rcs-texting-iphone"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has asked Apple if it intends to support RCS &lt;em&gt;literally years &lt;/em&gt;with no response&lt;/a&gt;, so we’re not holding our breath. We’ve also made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/6/18171021/moral-case-imessage-android"&gt;the moral case&lt;/a&gt; that a company that claims privacy is a human right has a duty to bring encrypted messaging to the world, not just its own customers, and we’ve written about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/13/18677644/imessage-iphone-apple-secure-encrypted-chat-moral-imperative-signal-rcs-hangouts"&gt;the personal plight of dealing with Apple’s inaction&lt;/a&gt;. (And when I say “we”, I mean Dieter, because RCS is his jam, I’m writing this post because he’s on vacation, and Dieter srsly why are you reading these words, aren’t you supposed to be on a socially distanced beach somewhere?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cvKptQ"&gt;But maybe now that Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22828277/apple-3-trillion-market-cap-company-earnings"&gt;is basically a three-trillion dollar company&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s under loads of regulatory scrutiny, and its dirty laundry (in the form of emails) has been aired in front of the world, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/22807871/apple-frontline-employees-retail-customer-service-pandemic"&gt;its employees are speaking out&lt;/a&gt;, and pieces like the &lt;em&gt;WSJ’s&lt;/em&gt; are coming out, and its CEO Tim Cook is likely looking for a legacy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22639629/tim-cook-apple-ten-years-decade-steve-jobs-legacy"&gt;larger than simply scaling up the company&lt;/a&gt; to become the most valuable in the world with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/6/22871202/tim-cook-2021-pay-package-compensation-proxy"&gt;a fat pay package&lt;/a&gt; as the reward... perhaps bringing iMessage to Android or RCS to iMessage is the kind of small concession that Apple might actually make. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IrmWgg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Associated Press is starting its own NFT marketplace for photojournalism</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HKxls6x43ADMtaVsgwa9QHS38zI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70372369/acastro_210329_1777_nft_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resellers will also be to get in on the action.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Lb3R8D"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ap.org/press-releases/2022/ap-to-launch-nft-marketplace-built-by-xooa"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt;, has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s starting &lt;a href="https://apmarket.xooa.com/p/join-waiting-list"&gt;a marketplace&lt;/a&gt; to sell NFTs of its photojournalists’ work in collaboration with a company called Xooa. It’s billing its foray into NFTs as a way for collectors to “purchase the news agency’s award-winning contemporary and historic photojournalism” and says that the virtual tokens will be released at “broad and inclusive price points” (though it’s hard to tell what types of prices resellers will want on the &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; marketplace).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yU7r2Y"&gt;The news outlet says its system will be built on the “environmentally friendly” Polygon blockchain and that the NFTs will “include a rich set of original metadata” to tell buyers when, where, and how the photos were taken. It says its first collection, launching January 31st, will include NFTs featuring photos of “space, climate, war and other images to spotlights on the work of specific &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; photographers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rtdZob"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Other journalistic enterprises have experimented with NFTs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q52GQ2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; isn’t the first journalistic enterprise to use or express interest in NFTs. &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1984094/quartz-is-selling-the-first-ever-nft-news-article/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quartz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350663/new-york-times-nft-auction-half-million-dollar-article-charity"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have sold copies of their articles as NFTs, and Getty Images’ CEO Craig Peters &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-12-10/getty-images-ceo-talks-nft-aspirations-after-4-8-billion-deal-with-blank-check-company"&gt;said in December&lt;/a&gt; that there’s “a real opportunity” for the company when it comes to NFTs. We probably won’t see people debating whether to get a Getty or an &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; NFT anytime soon, though, as the former seems to be taking a more wait-and-see approach, with Peters saying that he didn’t feel the need to race into the space. So far, though, this does seem like one of the largest NFT-related efforts from a major news source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VDCRHT"&gt;It doesn’t seem like &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; is trying to sell its NFTs as a metaverse tie-in (either as part of a virtual museum or as decorations in &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/accounting-firms-scoop-up-virtual-land-in-the-metaverse-11641599590"&gt;an online accounting office&lt;/a&gt;), like other media executives &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/plugged-in-executives-metaverse/"&gt;in the music industry may be interested in doing&lt;/a&gt;. Its announcement and &lt;a href="https://apmarket.xooa.com/p/faq"&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt; make no mention of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701104/metaverse-explained-fortnite-roblox-facebook-horizon"&gt;the metaverse&lt;/a&gt; (outside of mentioning that Xooa also works with brands on “metaverse strategies” in the “About Xooa” section), and the project seems entirely aimed at collectors who want to, as the press release puts it, “seamlessly buy, sell and trade official &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; digital collectibles through the marketplace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="zw4RP2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Pulitzer Drops” will “have increased scarcity to preserve their status”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7K4Mrn"&gt;Buyers will be able to pay for NFTs from the market using either credit cards or Ethereum — &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; says the MetaMask will be the first wallet supported but that there are plans to add support for others. There will be virtual queues to buy NFTs as they’re released by &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt;, with “Pulitzer Drops” containing more limited-edition NFTs happening every two weeks — the FAQ says these particular images will “have increased scarcity to preserve their status.” Buyers will be able to resell those NFTs on the site’s secondary market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NlCVP3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; says that the proceeds from the NFTs’ sale will be used to fund its journalistic endeavors. It’ll also get revenue whenever they’re resold on its marketplace — the FAQ says there’s a 10 percent fee associated with reselling, and Xooa spokesperson Lauren Easton told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email that the two companies would share that fee. (The transaction fees, or “gas” fees, that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/24/22800995/constitutiondao-refund-progress-steep-gas-fees-cryptocurrency"&gt;Ethereum is infamous for&lt;/a&gt; shouldn’t add too much to the price of sales, as they’re significantly lower on Polygon.) Easton also told us that the “photographers will share in all revenue collected,” but didn't specify what their cut would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="LpjPKh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The marketplace has an early access waitlist scheme&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GGIuPM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; says its marketplace is set to open on January 31st, but it does seem to be offering a sort of early access scheme; the landing page for the marketplace says you can get on a waitlist and that you can get “priority access” and a higher waitlist ranking if you refer others to sign up. If you’re the type of collector &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; is targeting with these offerings (or you’re someone interested in how this type of marketplace will work), it’s worth doing a thorough read of &lt;a href="https://apmarket.xooa.com/p/faq"&gt;the FAQ&lt;/a&gt; — it gets into how Xooa is planning on adding support for moving the NFTs to other marketplaces, talks about how the drops will work, and has tons of detail about the marketplace, account system, and the seller verification processes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LAPD officers fired for catching a Snorlax instead of a burglar denied appeal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rer0PyatBZDHTwHsSZHjCujTaaQ=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70372301/pokemoncop.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SDv3HK"&gt;Two LAPD officers who were fired from their jobs in 2017 for playing Pokémon Go while on duty have had their appeal for reinstatement denied by a California judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QL48om"&gt;The officers’ squad car video camera showed the two officers, Louis Lozano and Eric Mitchell, ignored a request for backup to play the game, according to court documents. The pair were stationed near a robbery in progress, and after the responding officers put out a call for backup, Lozano and Mitchell seemingly ignored the call and left the area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VBxO2u"&gt;When asked later why they hadn’t responded to the call, the two officers said they were in a loud area and couldn’t hear their radio. Lozano and Mitchell’s supervisor was skeptical of their explanation and checked the in-car recording system (commonly known as a dashcam), which revealed the two had heard the call and chose to go elsewhere as they didn’t want to help. The supervisor reported the incident, which opened a formal investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fAhf2Q"&gt;According to court filings, an extensive review of the in-car video system revealed that shortly after leaving the scene of the robbery, the two officers could be heard discussing Pokémon Go, including a Snorlax that had appeared and the best route to intercept and catch it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="y4Q0BC"&gt;For approximately the next 20 minutes, the [in-car video system] captured petitioners discussing Pokémon as they drove to different locations where the virtual creatures apparently appeared on their mobile phones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="slfX0b"&gt;When confronted, the officers denied they were playing Pokémon Go and said they were just having a conversation. They tried to appeal on the grounds that the in-vehicle recordings were not meant to be used to monitor officers’ “private conversations,” but a judge ruled that that premise was ”flawed” and denied the appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aOXESz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile appears to be blocking some iPhone users from turning on Private Relay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a679SQQpMlD7hp-oo9jH_r4cJPA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70372164/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4lX89e"&gt;T-Mobile appears to be blocking some iPhone users from enabling iCloud Private Relay, a feature that lets you hide the websites you visit from third parties, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/10/t-mobile-block-icloud-private-relay/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5ygsEB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TMobileHelp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TMobileHelp&lt;/a&gt; What the hey?  Why are you keeping us from using &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Apple&lt;/a&gt; ‘s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/icloud?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#icloud&lt;/a&gt; private relay? &lt;a href="https://t.co/EtdxkVSpWh"&gt;pic.twitter.com/EtdxkVSpWh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jon Guidry (@guidryjd) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/guidryjd/status/1480599787577696260?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 10, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O7jGLS"&gt;Private Relay is still in beta in iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, and it isn’t turned on by default. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22573519/apple-private-relay-icloud-plus-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey-how-to"&gt;You have to go into your iPhone’s settings to switch it on&lt;/a&gt;, which is where some T-Mobile customers have noticed a strange message popping up. As shown in the above tweet, the user is presented with the message, “Your cellular plan doesn’t support iCloud Private Relay. With Private Relay turned off, this network can monitor your internet activity, and your IP address is not hidden from known trackers or websites.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z095du"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/guidryjd/status/1480631410239094797?s=20"&gt;a reply to that tweet&lt;/a&gt;, the user shows what happens when you click the “Learn More” button below the initial message — there, Apple explains why T-Mobile might be blocking the feature. “Networks that require the ability to audit traffic or perform network-based filtering will block access to Private Relay,” it reads. “Your cellular provider may be providing network-based services, such as Parental Controls, requiring them to view the traffic on your network.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P6uDEp"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22573519/apple-private-relay-icloud-plus-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey-how-to"&gt;VPN-like Private Relay&lt;/a&gt; hides your web activity from any outside sources — including Apple and your carrier — and prevents anyone from identifying you or the sites you access. It’s currently available &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522998/apple-icloud-plus-subscription-vpn-scurity-wwdc"&gt;via a subscription to iCloud Plus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j4ZROa"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/10/european-carriers-seek-to-block-iphone-private-relay-feature/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;iPhone users in Europe were the first to notice that access to the Private Relay feature had been blocked. T-Mobile, Vodafone, and Telefonica added their names to an open letter published in &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.telegraph.co.uk%2Fbusiness%2F2022%2F01%2F09%2Fapple-fire-iphone-encryption-tech%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F10%2F22877211%2Ft-mobile-iphone-private-relay-block" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that criticizes the feature. Carriers argue that Private Relay “will impair others to innovate and compete in downstream digital markets and may negatively impact operators’ ability to efficiently manage telecommunication networks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s7LADr"&gt;If you’re a T-Mobile customer, you might not see the block on Private Relay just yet (it was still available on the T-Mobile iPhones we tested). It’s currently unclear if this is intentional, if this will affect all T-Mobile customers, or if it is limited to certain plans. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to T-Mobile and Apple with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why Take-Two wants to pay nearly $13 billion for the maker of FarmVille</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KyRclHyYMWHQQaizHomgF6xvPP4=/73x0:3300x2151/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70371692/654_3840.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Take-Two wants to bring its franchises to mobile, and Zynga can help.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Rockstar Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="apVcTs"&gt;Take-Two Interactive just announced its intent to buy &lt;em&gt;FarmVille&lt;/em&gt; developer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22876184/take-two-interactive-zynga-acquisition-deal"&gt;Zynga for $12.7 billion&lt;/a&gt; in what could be the biggest acquisition in video game history. It’s an absolutely massive deal; to put it in perspective, the acquisition would be $5 billion &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22319124/microsoft-bethesda-acquisition-complete-finalized"&gt;Microsoft’s $7.5 billion purchase&lt;/a&gt; of the parent company of &lt;em&gt;Skyrim &lt;/em&gt;maker Bethesda Softworks. You could throw in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/30/3577656/disney-buys-lucasfilm-plans-to-release-star-wars-episode-7-in-2015"&gt;the money Disney paid for Lucasfilm&lt;/a&gt; and still have cash left over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvwnMe"&gt;So what is Take-Two getting for its money? Yes, big Zynga games like &lt;em&gt;FarmVille&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Words With Friends&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440209/tiktok-baddie-games-high-heels-nail-woman"&gt;&lt;em&gt;High Heels!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will join Take-Two’s own roster of franchises that includes &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;NBA 2K&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt;. But perhaps more importantly, Take-Two will now be able to use Zynga’s expertise building hugely popular free-to-play mobile titles so it can make new hit games based on its own properties. In fact, Zynga will be the new brand for Take Two’s mobile efforts, and current Zynga CEO Frank Gibeau will lead that organization, indicating the potential direction of Take Two’s mobile future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Cxa7vh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Developers across the industry have been bringing big franchises to mobile&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OaGLwg"&gt;Developers across the industry have been bringing big franchises to mobile and earning a lot of money doing so. &lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt; was the top-grossing mobile game worldwide in November 2021, earning “close to” $254 million, &lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/top-mobile-games-by-worldwide-revenue-november-2021"&gt;according to Sensor Tower&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;League of Legends: Wild Rift&lt;/em&gt;, the mobile-optimized version of the hit PC MOBA, was in the top ten for App Store revenue that same month. &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; brought in more than $5 billion in revenue &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565654/pokemon-go-5-billion-fifth-anniversary-revenue-analytics"&gt;as of its five-year birthday in July&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/pokemon-go-five-billion-revenue"&gt;Sensor Tower reported&lt;/a&gt;. The Tencent-owned studio that makes &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Mobile&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22367089/tencent-timi-studios-call-of-duty-mobile-10-billion-2020"&gt;reportedly earned $10 billion in 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OuNetj"&gt;And some of the biggest publishers have been buying their way into the space for years, with Activision Blizzard buying &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt; maker King for $5.9 billion &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/2/9662214/actvision-blizzard-buys-candy-crush-king-5-9-billion"&gt;in 2015&lt;/a&gt; and EA buying &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22273187/ea-glu-mobile-acquisition-kim-kardashian-hollywood"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kim Kardashian: Hollywood&lt;/em&gt; developer Glu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547324/ea-golf-clash-playdemic-acquisition-warner-brothers-games-mobile"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Golf Clash&lt;/em&gt; maker Playdemic&lt;/a&gt; in 2021. Mobile games are big business, and it’s not hard to see Take-Two releasing free-to-play mobile versions of its biggest franchises with the help of Zynga. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IHIa8P"&gt;Take-Two was fairly explicit Monday on its intention to take this path. “We see tremendous untapped potential to bring Take-Two’s renowned console and PC properties to mobile, a high-priority initiative that will be energized by the addition of Zynga’s leading development, publishing, and live operations teams,” Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said in an investor call Monday. Take-Two also noted that the acquisition offered a “clear path to bring Take-Two’s console/PC games to mobile” in an investor presentation (&lt;a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/23d9f00c-d7e7-4992-b16d-84e67dc58622"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;). (The deal is expected to close in Take-Two’s first fiscal quarter of 2023, which ends on June 30th, 2022.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rW2iy4"&gt;The Zynga acquisition doesn’t mean that Take-Two will be bringing its franchises to mobile for the first time. Right now, you can download and play &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Vice City&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;San Andreas&lt;/em&gt; on your phone, for example. But those are &lt;em&gt;paid&lt;/em&gt; titles on the iOS App Store and likely aren’t nearly as lucrative as some of the huge free-to-play hits on the market right now. (Take-Two already has some experience in that space, with its microtransaction-laden version of &lt;em&gt;NBA 2K&lt;/em&gt; for mobile.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="D99u4V"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s not hard to imagine Take-Two wanting to translate the massive success of ‘GTA Online’ to mobile&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0lCCL0"&gt;And speaking of &lt;em&gt;GTA&lt;/em&gt;, it’s not hard to imagine Take-Two wanting to translate the massive success of &lt;em&gt;GTA Online&lt;/em&gt; onto mobile platforms with Zynga’s expertise. Despite being released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/1/4790206/grand-theft-auto-online-early-server-issues"&gt;in 2013&lt;/a&gt; — and requiring that you own &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/em&gt; to play it (&lt;a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/3938k3oo9883o8/gtav-and-gta-online-coming-to-playstation-5-and-xbox-series-x-s-march"&gt;well, for now&lt;/a&gt;) — &lt;em&gt;GTA Online&lt;/em&gt; has remained hugely popular. In February 2021, Take-Two said the game “had more players in every month and for the entirety of calendar 2020 than in any other year since its launch,” &lt;a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-has-sold-more-than-140-million-copies/1100-6487267/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;GameSpot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It also offers in-game currency for real-world money that has proven to be lucrative; Take-Two cited the game as one of its largest contributors to its revenue as recently as its November earnings release (&lt;a href="https://ir.take2games.com/node/28206/pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="djQnwr"&gt;In addition to the very obvious business opportunity there — it’s hard not to see some sort of free-to-play&lt;em&gt; GTA&lt;/em&gt; being an absolutely massive hit — Zynga also brings expertise in supporting games for years at a time. Zynga still offers multiple free-to-play versions of &lt;em&gt;Words With Friends&lt;/em&gt;, including both a “classic” version and a sequel, &lt;em&gt;Words With Friends 2&lt;/em&gt;, which seems like a better way to generate long-term revenue from a franchise than one-offs like 2K Games’ expensive and &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-09-24-2k-games-bioshock-ios-bye-bye.html"&gt;short-lived iOS port of &lt;em&gt;BioShock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Imagine Take-Two and Zynga replicating the long-term model for &lt;em&gt;GTA&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Borderlands&lt;/em&gt;, and the rest of its titles, and you can start to see why Take-Two decided to pay as much as it did for the &lt;em&gt;FarmVille&lt;/em&gt;-maker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jcrh07"&gt;The deal isn’t &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; about turning Take-Two games into mobile hits. Take-Two highlighted how its “expertise in console/PC can be applied to Zynga’s cross-play ambitions;” Zynga is set to put its toe into console gaming with &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Hunters, &lt;/em&gt;which is coming to Nintendo Switch, iOS, and Android &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22674204/star-wars-hunters-trailer-nintendo-switch-mobile-zynga"&gt;sometime this year&lt;/a&gt;. Take-Two plans to use Zynga’s Chartboost ad platform to “acquire new users more efficiently and optimize mobile ad inventory.” And yes, there may be something with NFTs in the future — Gibeau said during Monday’s investor call that “the idea that players will play-to-earn or play-to-own is a very compelling idea that we think will have legs as the industry develops,” &lt;a href="https://decrypt.co/90103/grand-theft-auto-maker-take-two-zynga-web3-nfts"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Decrypt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qx1dai"&gt;But it seems likely that the biggest shift following the acquisition is that Take-Two will start expanding its most important franchises into the lucrative world of free mobile games. While we don’t know exactly when the first games from the Take-Two / Zynga tie-up might be released, the acquisition could mean the next &lt;em&gt;GTA&lt;/em&gt; might not be as far off as fans have worried — it just might be on your phone instead.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber is the latest popular app to bail on the Apple Watch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8tO0RhQCW8p8IiZWXBtxzHJEPm4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70371662/DSCF7013.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XGd3fO"&gt;Uber has quietly shut down its Apple Watch app, with the software now showing a message that instructs people to “please switch to the Uber mobile app.” The company is “no longer supporting the Apple Watch app,” according to the text, which ends with Uber apologizing for any inconvenience caused by the app’s discontinuation. There’s also a sad face emoji to drive that sentiment home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yJRJLv"&gt;As noted by &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/10/uber-apple-watch-app-discontinued/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Uber hasn’t yet removed the Apple Watch app from its &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/uber-request-a-ride/id368677368"&gt;App Store listing&lt;/a&gt;, where it still gets its own tab and screenshots. Presumably, that will all be history once the company releases its next update to the iOS app. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has reached out to Uber for more details, and if I had to guess, the company is likely to cite low usage as the main reason for its Apple Watch exit. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HdCfqjmn-JlpSN4rJ-ePN6taq4M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23159195/Screen_Shot_2022_01_10_at_3.42.24_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Uber&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uber’s Apple Watch app offered basic ride-hailing functionality.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="scOYWz"&gt;On the one hand, this is another example of smartwatches continuing to shed apps — even those that are massively popular and borderline essential on a phone — that aren’t core to their purpose(s) of fitness tracking, notifications, music playback, and so on. I’ve long had Uber installed on my Apple Watch, and I don’t think there was a single occasion where I hailed a ride from my wrist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ys7XYG"&gt;Uber ended support for its WearOS app more than two years ago, so it’s not like Google’s platform fared much better with user engagement. Lyft has been out of this game since 2018. Perhaps it’s a case where the form factor just isn’t the right match for the service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="48SE9i"&gt;The Apple Watch app provided barebones ride-hailing functionality, with more advanced options like splitting fares and sharing an ETA reserved for the full mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jT3X_bQX7t5a0-1eIimEZhvSoS8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23159213/Screen_Shot_2022_01_10_at_3.47.20_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple has previously highlighted Uber for the Apple Watch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gcFfKc"&gt;But it also goes to show that, in some ways, smartwatches are only moving further away from being able to serve as a standalone smartphone fill-in — even temporarily. Maybe barely anyone took advantage of Uber on the Apple Watch, but the fact that it no longer exists on the platform at all feels notable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HfDX8y"&gt;Want to leave your phone at home for the day and rely on your cellular Apple Watch? You can’t hail an Uber in that scenario anymore. And it’s a use case that Apple itself once highlighted, as you can see above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tIWlc8"&gt;Uber continues to offer its primary app for iPhone and a larger version for the iPad. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SEC charges ‘decentralized’ Amazon Web Services competitor with scamming investors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/49S4Um5V-5vgiffkDm-5ZfCT5FE=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70371608/blockchain.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T3BkhT"&gt;The US Securities and Exchange Commission has &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-3?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery"&gt;charged the would-be creator&lt;/a&gt; of a “decentralized” Amazon Web Services alternative with scamming investors out of millions. The SEC announced a complaint on Friday against Australian citizen Craig Sproule, the CEO of cryptocurrency startup Crowd Machine, which promised a global cloud computing network built on users’ computers. In reality, Sproule allegedly sent $5.8 million to South African gold mines as investors’ cryptocurrency tokens became worthless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aa7JpR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.390193/gov.uscourts.cand.390193.1.0.pdf"&gt;An SEC complaint&lt;/a&gt; says that Sproule collected at least $33 million through an initial coin offering (or ICO) to build a decentralized “Crowd Computer” platform, which he claimed was “battle-tested” by Fortune 500 companies. He compared the service to AWS and Microsoft’s Azure and said that Crowd Machine Compute Tokens (CMCTs) could be worth between $10 and $600 apiece. But the complaint says he made false and misleading statements, and this platform was never built as advertised. Instead, Crowd Machine hosted its system on centralized servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Hs1hDm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The decentralized network allegedly ran on a centralized computer system&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lqp99e"&gt;The ICO itself allegedly wasn’t registered with the SEC and Crowd Machine didn’t verify whether investors were accredited as required by law. And as Sproule attempted to raise money, Crowd Machine allegedly sent $5.8 million of the funds to gold mines in South Africa without informing investors. It described the transfers as loans or purchases of equity interest — but the gold mining operations, the complaint reports, “returned no revenue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GP5Fm4"&gt;Crowd Machine ran into trouble several months after it began raising money. In mid-2018, it reported that &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2018/09/26/the-crowd-machine-crypto-token-theft-what-we-know-so-far/"&gt;hackers had stolen a large number&lt;/a&gt; of CMCTs — halting trading and sending the price of the coins tumbling. Two men were &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/two-sim-swappers-arrested-for-cmct-hack/"&gt;later arrested&lt;/a&gt; for the hack. Ultimately, “the secondary market for CMCTs all but disappeared, along with any value that CMCTs might once have held for token holders,” the complaint notes. The tokens were sold for between $0.03 and $0.22 per token and never traded for higher than $0.18 on a secondary market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hYgXkc"&gt;Following the complaint, Sproule &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.390193/gov.uscourts.cand.390193.5.0.pdf"&gt;agreed to terms&lt;/a&gt; set by the SEC. The agreement doesn’t require him to admit wrongdoing, but it permanently bars him from offering securities, including cryptocurrency assets. He must also pay a civil penalty of $195,000 and agree to permanently disable any CMCTs that he owns.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Europol ordered to delete petabytes of data not clearly linked to crime</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NQHIbaXRhkyYsqV7CCtD78El1ug=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70371556/acastro_1800724_1777_EU_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="J4wYqS"&gt;Europol, the law enforcement agency of the European Union, has been ordered to delete a huge store of personal data gleaned from police agencies in EU member states over the past six years. The deletion order comes from the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS), a watchdog body overseeing EU institutions’ compliance with privacy and data protection legislation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1W3KZm"&gt;EDPS has given Europol a year to review its databases and then remove any data that cannot be linked to a criminal investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tMMB9P"&gt;The total volume of data stored in Europol’s systems amounts to around 4 petabytes according to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/10/a-data-black-hole-europol-ordered-to-delete-vast-store-of-personal-data"&gt;reporting in &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — equivalent to hundreds of billions of pages of printed text — and includes data on at least a quarter of a million current or former terror and serious crime suspects, along with other people in its contact networks. The data has been drawn from criminal investigations conducted by national police authorities in EU countries, which were then shared with Europol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bK3k5Z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Europol has not complied with the EDPS’ requests to define an appropriate data retention period”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xVuIwj"&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://edps.europa.eu/system/files/2022-01/22-01-10-edps-decision-europol_en.pdf"&gt;text of the decision&lt;/a&gt;, the EDPS cites an initial investigation into Europol’s handling of sensitive data in 2019, which concluded that Europol was storing personal data on crime and terrorism suspects without adequate checks on whether monitoring of flagged individuals was justified. A year later EDPS sent a &lt;a href="https://edps.europa.eu/data-protection/our-work/publications/investigations/edps-decision-own-initiative-inquiry-europols_en"&gt;notice of admonishment&lt;/a&gt; to Europol for failing to comply with data regulations and putting EU residents at risk of being wrongfully linked to criminal activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MxMyBT"&gt;“While some measures have been put in place by Europol since then, Europol has not complied with the EDPS’ requests to define an appropriate data retention period to filter and to extract the personal data permitted for analysis under the Europol Regulation,” the EDPS wrote in a &lt;a href="https://edps.europa.eu/press-publications/press-news/press-releases/2022/edps-orders-europol-erase-data-concerning_en"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; accompanying the decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OgYL91"&gt;In the absence of a clear course of action, EDPS has now stepped in more forcefully, giving Europol a year to sort through existing data to find out what can be lawfully kept, and ordering it to delete any newly collected data that is not categorized within six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="llfN2i"&gt;“It’s unclear the precise types of data Europol want to hold onto so keenly, but we do know they are large datasets consisting at least in part of data about people who Europol do not currently feel they can categorise within ‘suspects’, ‘potential future criminals’, ‘contacts and associates’, ‘victims’, ‘witnesses’ and ‘informants’,” said Michael Veale, associate professor in digital rights and regulation at the University College London Faculty of Laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mNJvBY"&gt;That array of categories was already extremely broad, Veale said, so storing data that falls outside of these categories raised concerns that Europol was conducting unjustified surveillance on groups stereotyped as being “suspicious” or “dangerous.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vX1kOV"&gt;What seems clear is that the decision from EDPS will provoke fierce debate over where the EU should draw the line between privacy and security. Some senior European officials were quick to respond: one, EU Home Affairs Comissioner Ylva Johansson, expressed her displeasure shortly after the decision was announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g09b2E"&gt;“Law enforcement authorities need the tools, resources and the time to analyse data that is lawfully transmitted to them,” Johansson told &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;. “In Europe, Europol is the platform that supports national police authorities with this herculean task.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O11iRX"&gt;Johansson clarified her concerns &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vmanancourt/status/1480562529206210560"&gt;to &lt;em&gt;PoliticoEU&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that smaller national police departments would be unable to make sense of big data without drawing on Europol’s expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Vr95CY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Policing that does not respect fundamental rights cannot ultimately be effective”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pNuVxJ"&gt;But other privacy campaigners have welcomed the ruling, which has been celebrated as an upholding of EU citizens’ digital rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3bB6hR"&gt;“This decision ... shows once again that in the EU the rights to privacy and to data protection are fundamental rights and are protected as such, even when the pressure on these rights comes from policing,” said Gabriela Zanfir-Fortuna, vice president for global privacy at the Future of Privacy Forum think tank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aSm17C"&gt;“In a rule of law, policing activities need to follow the legal framework. Policing that does not respect fundamental rights cannot ultimately be effective,” Zanfir-Fortuna said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today I learned about the (no longer available) Shazam Chrome extension</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PqXZuwGh_djnMXZ6GVk4YQewQe8=/20x0:620x400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70370901/unnamed.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shazam is available in yet another place.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Shazam&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kQ9wq6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 10th, 3:44PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt; Shortly after this article was published, the extension was made unavailable from the Chrome Web Store. At the moment, the &lt;a href="https://www.shazam.com/apps"&gt;apps page on Shazam’s website&lt;/a&gt; still advertises the extension, but the link to it leads to a 404 error. We’ve reached out to Apple (which owns Shazam) to ask what happened, and will update this story again if we hear back, or if the extension is re-listed on the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0ywqr"&gt;The original article continues below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="qn0iDa"&gt;
&lt;p id="ymqO6O"&gt;Today I learned about &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shazam/mmioliijnhnoblpgimnlajmefafdfilb/"&gt;Shazam’s Chrome extension&lt;/a&gt;, which seems to have been out for about a month and can help you identify music playing on the webpage you’re viewing. Having the app directly in Chrome could help you figure out what song is playing in an ad, trailer, or livestream without having to mess around with your phone. (Thanks to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/01/10/shazam-chrome-extension/"&gt;finding and pointing out&lt;/a&gt; this nifty tool.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4avPNB"&gt;The extension does everything I’d expect it to — you go to the tab where music is playing, press the Shazam button, and it’ll try to identify the song. If it succeeds, it’ll give you a link to the song in Apple Music (serving as your &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21444506/apple-ios-14-2-beta-shazam-identify-music-phone-apps-headphones"&gt;occasional reminder&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/24/17896350/apple-shazam-app-acquisition-complete-free"&gt;Apple owns Shazam&lt;/a&gt;). It’ll also keep track of the songs you’ve identified in a running list and let you link your Apple Music account. Doing so will let you listen to the entire song in the extension instead of just a preview.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E7ApkZRVK2gvI6yNVYB6ZRk3enI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23158838/Screen_Shot_2022_01_10_at_10.51.51.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can see the songs you’ve Shazamed, and listen to them if you’ve connected your Apple Music account.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0ZbU8i"&gt;I had decent luck testing it out — it worked on YouTube, Twitch, SoundCloud, and even Wikipedia. Most of the time, it even got the song right, though that more so speaks to Shazam’s engine than the extension itself. I did occasionally notice that the actual audio coming out of my speakers would get a bit staticky or skip slightly while Shazam was doing its thing, but it didn’t happen every time and wasn’t unbearable when it did. It’s also worth noting that your mileage may vary here — &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/01/10/shazam-chrome-extension/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and several reviews on the &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shazam/mmioliijnhnoblpgimnlajmefafdfilb"&gt;Chrome Web Store&lt;/a&gt; report that they weren’t able to get the app working.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LEUrCCP_ervdCRcSHUHdqHG0cZk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23158659/Screen_Shot_2022_01_10_at_09.55.32.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I also learned today that Wikipedia captions songs, to incredible effect.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kNBMPU"&gt;I’ll probably keep this extension installed because it’s easy to imagine times when it’d be useful — some tech companies play pretty great music before their livestreams, and I’ve wasted more time than I’d care to admit in the comment sections of movie trailers trying to sus out the song playing in the background. Of course, most of the time, I could just ask Siri what song’s playing (or use Snapchat, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/13/13936586/shazam-now-inside-snapchat-update"&gt;which has Shazam built into it&lt;/a&gt;), but when my phone’s in another room or I’m using headphones, having an extension to do the same thing could come in handy.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How not to tweet out Golden Globe Awards</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-ENTERTAINMENT-FILM-TELEVISION-GLOBES" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CrbJPEw3a4pwz0m9hiR1kKCT7tk=/0x0:5798x3865/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70371278/1237634390.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Golden Globes continued its tradition of cringe, this time on Twitter | Photo by CHRIS DELMAS/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="suKv36"&gt;If the controversy surrounding the Golden Globe Awards didn’t already push the show into irrelevancy, announcing this year’s winners via bizarre, out-of-touch tweets sure did (via &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/netflix-gets-its-first-golden-globe-for-best-motion-picture-drama-in-a-bizarre-live-tweeted-event/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). As a refresher, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/10/media/golden-globes-nbc-diversity/index.html"&gt;the Golden Globes was barred from airing on NBC&lt;/a&gt; following a &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2021-02-21/hfpa-golden-globes-2021"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; investigation that uncovered possible racism and bribery within the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), the organization that doles out the awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vvYH6M"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Nowhere in these deeply chaotic Golden Globe tweets do they even mention the projects people are winning for &lt;a href="https://t.co/4Tt5CHaojE"&gt;pic.twitter.com/4Tt5CHaojE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kyle Buchanan (@kylebuchanan) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kylebuchanan/status/1480370936469544964?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 10, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="76FjRN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://variety.com/2022/film/news/golden-globes-2022-untelevised-ceremony-strangest-ever-1235149984/"&gt;A physical event&lt;/a&gt;, consisting only of a small number of HFPA members, still took place behind closed doors without all the usual glitz and glamour. But to keep the rest of us in the loop, the Golden Globes sent out a rapid-fire succession of tweets to reveal its winners, and, as &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;’ Kyle Buchanan noted, that live Twitter show was purely “chaotic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QBE4e9"&gt;For one, it failed to mention the films that awardees got a Globe for in several of its tweets, leaving users to rely on Google search to find that very vital piece of information. The Globes &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/goldenglobes/status/1480365844408549384?s=20"&gt;tweeted out Kenneth Branagh&lt;/a&gt; “has the write stuff” when granting him the award for best screenplay, but didn’t add the film he actually wrote the screenplay for, which was &lt;em&gt;Belfast&lt;/em&gt;. The Globes repeated its mistake when announcing Andrew Garfield’s Golden Globe for best actor in a musical or comedy, leaving out that the award was for his appearance in &lt;em&gt;Tick Tick... Boom!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kKZosm"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The internet remembers &lt;a href="https://t.co/XMPvZaklcG"&gt;pic.twitter.com/XMPvZaklcG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Brendel (@Brendelbored) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Brendelbored/status/1480386441712701441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 10, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YLzXjo"&gt;In perhaps its biggest blunder of the night, it tweeted out, “If laughter is the best medicine @WestSideMovie is the cure for what ails you” when giving &lt;em&gt;West Side Story &lt;/em&gt;the award for the best musical. It's a film modeled after &lt;em&gt;Romeo and Juliet&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Someone on the Golden Globe’s social media team eventually noticed as the tweet was deleted and replaced with one that reads “music” instead of “laughter.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lq2B1B"&gt;Sure seems like the Golden Globes social media team doesn’t have a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/14/22778827/twitter-blue-undo-button-paywall-features-paid-free"&gt;Twitter Blue subscription&lt;/a&gt; — an investment the HFPA should’ve made &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; hosting their entire event on Twitter. The premium plan lets you edit and undo tweets, something that the Golden Globes could’ve really used last night. But hey, if &lt;em&gt;West Side Story&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t give us the laughter that ails us, at least the Golden Globes does.&lt;/p&gt;
