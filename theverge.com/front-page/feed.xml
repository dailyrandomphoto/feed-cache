    <title>Jabra’s Elite 75t wireless earbuds are back down to their lowest price yet</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CGKRmp"&gt;If you’re after a great bargain on truly wireless earbuds that we really like, check out Best Buy’s deal on the Jabra Elite 75t. These usually cost $150, but &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf0rD3hAvWz" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the black-colored model is back down to just $80&lt;/a&gt; — matching the lowest price yet. Best Buy says that this is its best deal of the season, and it’ll price match retailers if you find a better price. Consider this a great &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;early Black Friday deal&lt;/a&gt; that you can take advantage of to get ahead with your holiday shopping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x6PsXu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Chris Welch enjoyed the several improvements that the Elite 75t made to the already-winning Elite 65t formula. They’re smaller, with a more comfortable design. And the sound quality should please those who are looking for thumping bass. The Elite 75t can connect to two Bluetooth devices simultaneously, which is often something you can’t count on finding in a new set of wireless earbuds. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21066947/jabra-elite-75t-review-wireless-earbuds-airpods-alternative" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="fsgcLC"&gt;The Razer Barracuda X wireless gaming headset in the black colorway is $20 off its already-reasonable $100 price at both &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf0rNiJSUMf" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Barracuda-Wireless-Multi-Platform-Headset/dp/B096N6Q51N?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. This is the first price drop that I’ve seen, and this model is easy to recommend for PC and console players. It’s a lightweight model that supports a wireless 2.4GHz connection to its USB-C audio transmitter, which can plug directly into the PS5, a Nintendo Switch, or a recent MacBook, to name a few devices. It comes with a USB-A adapter and extender for other gadgets that don’t have one of those plugs. It has USB-C charging, and its array of buttons are simple to learn. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22566803/razer-barracuda-x-wireless-headset-ps5-nintendo-switch-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more coverage here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The Xbox copy will work for Xbox One consoles, as well as the newer Xbox Series X. The PS4 version includes a free upgrade to the PS5 version. Though, the PS5 version is the same cost, so get that one if you have Sony’s latest console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="lg1uHh"&gt;Razer’s Kishi controller grip is seeing steep discounts at Amazon. The Android version is always the least pricey version, and it has the lowest price today. Originally $90, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Kishi-Controller-Android-Passthrough-Thumbsticks/dp/B086X8DHN2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can snag it for $55&lt;/a&gt;, and it’ll fit most phones except for the most massive ones on the market. This controller is great if you want to play mobile games with a controller or have a more elegant way to play cloud games via xCloud or Stadia from your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8fpzv"&gt;The version of the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Mobile-Controller-Gamepad-iPhone/dp/B09886XVFR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kishi made for iPhones costs $80&lt;/a&gt;, down from its original $100 price. It’s the same as the Android version, except for its Lightning port passthrough (as opposed to USB-C) and menu buttons.&lt;/p&gt;

It includes a boom mic and a desktop module that lets you mute and control the volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XhmSjp"&gt;If you considered getting an Oculus Quest 2 soon, perhaps hold off a couple more days. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf0suks6GBv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Starting November 21st&lt;/a&gt;, Best Buy will include a $50 gift card with purchase.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>After all those podcast ads, Casper sells to a private equity firm</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Casper Celebrates In LA" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EePzXKuo-tmVeolcvQIy8zVjA0U=/0x1:3000x2001/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70144334/480182226.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Rachel Murray/Getty Images for Casper Sleep Inc.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vdk3mH"&gt;Casper Sleep is being acquired by private equity firm Durational Capital Management, which will take the boxed mattress company private, the companies &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211115005534/en/Casper-Sleep-Inc.-to-Be-Acquired-by-Durational-Capital-Management"&gt;announced Monday&lt;/a&gt;. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dF0PGy"&gt;Founded in 2014, Casper was one of a handful of companies whose ads were ubiquitous on podcasts and that sold its products directly to consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wm3I1U"&gt;The company went public in February 2020, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/10/21060460/casper-tech-ipo-mattresses"&gt;plans to expand from its primary business&lt;/a&gt; of direct-to-consumer (D2C) sales of boxed mattresses into products that “promote the ideal ambience for sleep,” according to its &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1598674/000104746920000166/a2240404zs-1.htm"&gt;S-1 prospectus&lt;/a&gt;. That list of products included sleep tracking devices, bedside clocks, sleep services like digital apps and counseling, and even sleep supplements. But besides mattresses and things that go on mattresses — like sheets and pillows — the most notable product Casper has produced to date is its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/1/29/18201229/casper-mattress-glow-bedside-light-pricing-features-release-date"&gt;Glow bedside lamp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ygZkao"&gt;Casper began &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/casper-a-web-pioneer-to-open-200-stores-1533729600"&gt;adding retail locations in 2018&lt;/a&gt; and sold its products at retailers like Target and Mattress Warehouse, but struggled to turn a profit in the increasingly crowded direct-to-consumer (D2C) mattress market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SzC0w2"&gt;On Monday, &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/casper-reports-third-quarter-results-131600769.html?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAII7sQV44U5e2qgIQZ9qsnsLZgYTFATCjQ97phKdwtZuExt9WpdKR9HRdhOA49EhWnL0vUKxPnhIrhjWgfA6PqoTMX9qRhWBezYi6RtFyvqNR4kCMbDXfDnCHe04GfVHWRQxv9lPQrrvwaSK6_vESCZlHHhth-59ZVhK2V_EAsbS"&gt;Casper reported that it lost $25.3 million&lt;/a&gt; in its third quarter, compared to a loss of $15.9 million in the year-ago quarter. The company also announced that its president and chief commercial officer Emilie Arel has been appointed CEO, taking over from Casper co-founder Philip Krim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="whARUy"&gt;Casper’s board of directors unanimously approved the acquisition, which awaits approval by Casper stockholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fSLsz4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The console includes a digital copy of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;, which will be playable on December 8th — or possibly sooner, if you believe internet rumors about a countdown ending today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GY4eu8"&gt;You can check for participating stores near you on Best Buy’s &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fclp-video-games%2Fnext-gen-consoles-event%2Fpcmcat1632156747229.c&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox in-store event page&lt;/a&gt;. It looks like the page was just posted around 6AM ET today, in line with a tweet from restocking tipster &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LordOfRestocks"&gt;Lord Restock&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LordOfRestocks/status/1459284690771320835"&gt;same account&lt;/a&gt;, as well as other console trackers, indicates the consoles will be available today from &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=http%3A%2F%2FBestBuy.com&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BestBuy.com&lt;/a&gt;. They expect to see the &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; Xbox Series X restocked along with a number of PS5s and Nintendo Switch OLEDs, however, those sales may only be available to people who are a part of Best Buy’s $200 Totaltech support membership program.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Under-display cameras are slowly getting better</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0KzxHaot5gReB6iNuMOFEtYRBUI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70144165/UDC_v02.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VoB38H"&gt;As is often the case with new technology, under-display cameras didn’t make a great first impression. It’s a nice idea in theory, of course — you don’t need a notch or a hole-punch if you can put a selfie camera under the display — but the earliest efforts had some issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YGn1Zb"&gt;ZTE’s Axon 20 last year was the first phone to ship with one, and it was bad. The camera quality was incredibly poor, and the area of the screen looked more distracting than a notch. Samsung followed up this year with the Galaxy Z Fold 3, which had similar issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Zlghiy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The world’s first under-display selfie camera isn’t very good","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22191459/zte-axon-20-5g-under-display-camera-hands-on"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="n8DWBZ"&gt;But things are actually getting better. Two newer phones on the market, Xiaomi’s Mix 4 and ZTE’s Axon 30, use a different approach to the technology, and it’s an improvement on the previous generation. Instead of having a lower resolution area of the screen that allows light through to the camera, they shrink the size of the pixels without reducing the number. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PUPvyE"&gt;This means that the part of the screen that covers the camera is really difficult to see in normal use. Look at how the Axon 30 compares to the Axon 20 on a white background, which was the most challenging situation for the older phone to disguise the camera in. It’s also much harder to make out than the camera on Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 3:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PtU8R9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10865855"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hDMSTZ"&gt;Image quality from the camera is improved, too. Look at these selfies:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g0SGA5EZ5oacEfndGn3D1Kscres=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23015429/ztecomp.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;A selfie from ZTE’s Axon 20 on the left, and from the Axon 30 on the right.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YH093A"&gt;Now, the camera is clearly still compromised compared to one that doesn’t have to gather light from behind a screen. ZTE and Xiaomi lean hard on algorithms for post-processing — you can tell because the live image preview looks much worse than the final picture. The results still look over-processed and unnatural, even if they’re more usable than their predecessors’. Video quality is also bad, because it’s probably too much to ask for these phones to do the processing in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gQ10Pg"&gt;Still, the pictures you get are definitely usable most of the time. If you’re not a big selfie person, or if you don’t use your phone for Zoom calls, I think you could get away with it. If those use cases are important to you, though, you should probably stick with a hole punch or a notch. Especially if you just don’t care about hole punches or notches, as I believe is the case for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VBjkrc"&gt;There’s more to the idea than just reducing the size of your phone bezels, though. We spoke to Steven Bathiche from Microsoft’s Applied Sciences group on how the company is working on under-display cameras for an entirely different reason — so you can maintain eye contact while looking at your screen on video calls.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A collection of our favorite games and gadgets&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="hEtH8u"&gt;For better or worse, all of our recent time indoors has turned many of us into gamers and entertainment connoisseurs, whether that means tucking into a crossword puzzle on a regular basis or putting a high-end gaming desktop through its paces. Thankfully, if you’re looking to gift something great this holiday season or treat yourself, we have a few suggestions that should appease that special nerd in your life.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge’s 2021 home tech holiday gift guide</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p&gt;Spruce up your digs with some clever gadgets&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="nmh7YT"&gt;Home is what you make it, so why not make it as awesome as possible? Sometimes, that can be done by just hanging up a sentimental photo in a frame or spritzing things up occasionally with some flowers or a new piece of furniture. Every now and again, however, you just need to gift yourself some crafty home tech goodies or buy them for someone you care about. Not every item in the list below has a circuit board built into it — though many of them do; instead, what ties them all together is that, in small ways, they’ll make your home look better and operate more smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uPlj3d"&gt;We’ve consulted the minds at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; for their ideas, and what follows are a couple dozen gift ideas for anyone who’s looking to liven up their abode with some clever home tech. From an affordable robot vacuum and smart lighting to a 4K TV that moonlights as a Monet when not in use, there’s something for everyone on our list.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge’s 2021 holiday gift guide for moms</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Gift ideas that go beyond the flower bouquet&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="5etm1R"&gt;If you were to ask your mom what she wants for the holidays, she’ll likely tell you “nothing” — followed by something equally unhelpful like “your happiness.” That’s because moms can be loving, selfless superheroes who often prioritize the needs of their loved ones over their own. While admirable, that also means you’re not going to get much help from them when it comes to buying the perfect gift. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dZ0tVR"&gt;Thankfully, we’ve gathered plenty of great presents you can surprise your mom with. We've included a monthly candle subscription for those in need of some relaxation ($10), as well as an annual pass that allows for unfettered access to our national parks ($80). And for the fitness enthusiast, we recommend the Apple Watch SE ($270), a smartwatch that is — lucky for you — more affordable than other Apple wearables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LrhYJI"&gt;Below, you’ll find other gifts that cater to all kinds of budgets and passions, ranging from books and instant cameras to Apple’s latest desktop. Peruse the list and see if there’s anything on here that might resonate with your mom this holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Midnight Protocol is a cyberpunk hacking RPG that cuts out all the filler</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A hacking grid in Midnight Protocol" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TXeX7D8dKgJ3CeztU6Qsxo3lwRk=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70144102/ss_73966f432c7a96ff9362717c4493e60a8fc0ca8b.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Iceberg Interactive&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OkmQXx"&gt;Video games have taught me that hacking mainly involves two things: capturing little computer-shaped nodes and typing in a command line. &lt;em&gt;Midnight Protocol&lt;/em&gt; is no exception. Released last month by Iceberg Interactive, it joins a glut of cyberpunk games from the past couple of years, and it doesn’t add any single standout innovation to a pretty familiar formula. But it’s one of the best iterations of that formula I’ve seen: mechanically elegant, narratively economical, and crafted with care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mwrggp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Midnight Protocol&lt;/em&gt; is noir cyber-crime by way of turn-based roleplaying games and spatial puzzles. When you log into its slightly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/3/12325104/airbnb-aesthetic-global-minimalism-startup-gentrification"&gt;airspace-looking&lt;/a&gt; simulated computer desktop, you’ll learn that your pseudonym is Data, and you’re a master hacker who just narrowly avoided imprisonment. At first you’re simply trying to get back on your feet, taking small jobs from your veteran fixer Snail with some help from a young, morally conflicted partner named Clover. But you’re also hunting down the person who leaked information about you online, and as you uncover their identity, you realize there’s something troubling afoot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QBxqjt"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wEDUfoQIHBk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PkFjlC"&gt;Developer LuGus Studios draws on the cyberpunk genre’s hardboiled roots rather than reaching for elaborate worldbuilding, heavy-handed commentary, or retro-futuristic nostalgia. Your protagonist is fundamentally a futuristic version of the private investigator who’s stumbled on a dangerous secret that could get them killed. The longer you play, the more the game delves into its sci-fi premise and even the conceit of its fake desktop interface. But the writing stays admirably restrained, surgically paring down stock genre plots and using passing references and terse messages to build its characters’ histories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Txghjh"&gt;Much of &lt;em&gt;Midnight Protocol&lt;/em&gt;’s story plays out over simulated emails, chat sessions, and a small searchable data bank. The meat of the game, however, lies behind a list of network addresses sent by other characters. Addresses lead to levels composed of interconnected nodes with different functions. Your goal is to complete a task — like acquiring a file or installing a virus — using a keyboard-only interface for jumping across nodes, deploying hacking tools, and allocating power between different programs. In its default mode, each turn gives you two actions before the network responds to your moves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UJgr7G"&gt;Between network heists, players have access to a black market of hacking programs and hardware upgrades, which can be purchased with credits siphoned from computer networks. The key to progression is completing jobs that unlock new programs through a reputation system, looking at reports about what’s on a given network, and picking a loadout of software that will let you tackle it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bEapr0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Networks are fine-tuned for different styles of challenge&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I1okOC"&gt;I dropped a link to &lt;em&gt;Midnight Protocol&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Slack gaming channel soon after I started playing, and it drew immediate comparisons to the hacking sections from &lt;em&gt;Deus Ex: Human Revolution&lt;/em&gt;. That’s fair, and there are plenty of other potential comparisons as well. The node system is reminiscent of &lt;em&gt;Uplink&lt;/em&gt;, while the faux command line conceit was used in &lt;em&gt;Hacknet&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/9/3622854/quadrilateral-cowboy-cyberpunk-hacking-game"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quadrilateral Cowboy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/25/4555842/shadowrun-returns-hands-on-report"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shadowrun Returns&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;features turn-based RPG virtual combat. Moving between the nodes even feels a bit like the puzzles of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/17/5623940/hitman-go-ios-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hitman Go&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;as you’re trying to reach the right targets in the right order while a network trace bar gradually fills up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lr0UVn"&gt;But &lt;em&gt;Midnight Protocol&lt;/em&gt; synthesizes these elements into something that’s minimalist yet incredibly polished — imagine the story of your favorite sci-fi RPG was set inside its hacking mini-game. It’s an experience with absolutely zero filler. Every network is fine-tuned to offer a specific flavor of challenge or an intriguing bit of world detail, including small choices that the game keeps track of, sometimes by increasing your “white hat” (idealistic) or “black hat” (selfishly criminal) reputation, and sometimes through emails from your clients or conversations with Snail and Clover.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A chess minigame inside the computer desktop of Midnight Protocol" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q0k8Uj3ju40e2zNP3dRRxLPv5oo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23015582/ss_fc8f3e4590e192b216195dddffdd559a9d9064b8.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KM948B"&gt;This can be frustrating at the beginning when you’ve got a bare-bones deck and desperately need money, because there’s no easy way to grind for the credits you’ll need to buy hacking programs. It’s also not immediately obvious that you can restart missions and make tweaks to your loadout before you jump back into the network, something that made the game instantly more rewarding for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r8VgAl"&gt;Once you’ve got a well-stocked software library and a good grip on the formula, though, &lt;em&gt;Midnight Protocol&lt;/em&gt; is a perfect mix of short puzzles that require darting through with laser-focused precision, big messy node grids to methodically dismantle, boss battles full of on-the-fly strategizing, and the occasional cathartic smash-and-grab level you can utterly dominate — plus a couple of secrets that require poking around Data’s desktop. While I found myself leaning a lot on a few core programs, the design encouraged me to mix up my strategy to suit the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IhepA"&gt;I haven’t explored every corner of the story or gameplay, particularly an alternate mode that lets you play in real time against network protocols. But a reasonably full playthrough can completely consume a long weekend (or a more restrained series of weeknights) without losing momentum or becoming repetitive. There are lots of games sort of like &lt;em&gt;Midnight Protocol&lt;/em&gt;, but few deliver so many strong variations on a simple theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zCPu3h"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Midnight Protocol &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;was released on October 13th and is available on Steam and GOG for Windows, macOS, and Linux.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best phone to buy right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The best phone of 2021: iPhone 13, Pixel 6, iPhone 13 Pro, Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3, iPhone 13 Mini, Pixel 5A, and Samsusng Galaxy Z Fold 3." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QthQgLW_qoVuV8_gEhvnwYZf3x4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68490961/Best_Phone_Grid_Fall_2021.12.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Buying a new phone can be a chore, but we’ve done the work for you&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="k1bPmC"&gt;Due to a confluence of factors in 2021 — from production delays thanks to the ongoing pandemic, rising costs of labor and components, to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22777216/global-chip-supply-chain-shortage-holidays-christmas-shopping"&gt;global chip shortage&lt;/a&gt; — prices for flagship phones have been higher than ever. The absolutely premium phones, like the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max and Samsung Galaxy Z Fold3 5G, now cost well over $1,000, or about the price of a good laptop. Even if you’re willing to shell out top dollar for the best smartphone of 2021, it’ll take lots of luck and patience to get one into your hands this holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sxr7Qk"&gt;Thankfully, you no longer have to spend a huge amount to get something amazing, as a bunch of great smartphones are available for around $600 to 800 this year. In fact, if you like Android, the best phone for your buck this holiday season is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;$599 Google Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt;. For everyone else, our pick for the best overall phone is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;$829 Apple iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ugNMR"&gt;And if you want to get the best smartphone on a budget, you can find something really good for under $500 or even less. For those recommendations, you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2018/7/27/17619088/best-cheap-phone-budget-iphone-android"&gt;check out our guide to budget smartphones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6I7S1w"&gt;A great smartphone should last you for several years (at least), have a great camera, a nice screen, long battery life, and be fast enough to do all the work, social networking, and gaming you want to pack into a day. After all, upgrade cycles are slowing down: people are holding onto their phones for longer, so they’re looking for features that will last a few years. Believe it or not, most top phones are pretty neck and neck in terms of their user experience and features these days — so picking the best one is often a matter of degrees or preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="88R0ky"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10861652"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="OqZ4kl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10815891"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="B7RXQo"&gt;The best phones 2021&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="XfQkHu"&gt;

        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13, in pink." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_1xWz-QZRgEvQvbddJAlZgt-Pxw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863269/vpavic_210916_4760_0069.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 can do it all: it hits the sweet spot between price, pocketability, and features.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="63WdF8"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="meCBEI"&gt;Best iPhone to buy in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="2xAh9b"&gt;Out of the four iPhone 13 variants that Apple launched in 2021, the $829 iPhone 13 (unlocked) hits the sweet spot between price, pocketability, and features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mWggHi"&gt;It has a new processor, a bigger battery, 128GB of internal storage, and uses the same large camera sensor as the acclaimed iPhone 12 Pro Max, but you wouldn’t know it from its compact size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WtOjH2"&gt;In fact, the 13 looks almost identical to the 12 but is just a bit thicker and heavier, with substantially bigger camera bumps and lenses that swapped places. (No, you won’t be able to reuse your iPhone 12 case for the 13.) Otherwise, it has the same overall design, a brighter 6.1-inch OLED display, the same 12-megapixel selfie camera, the same MagSafe wireless charging, the same water and dust resistance (IP68), and the same support for both sub-6GHz and mmWave 5G networks. On top of all that, it comes in five colors (including pink), one more than you can choose from in the Pro models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SfcR8W"&gt;What’s different with the iPhone 13’s new A15 Bionic chip is that it should still feel fast in years to come, but it’s difficult to measure significant speed improvements with iPhones. The new chip helps the iPhone 13 run more efficiently, which lasts well into the evening without needing a top up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZlh8X"&gt;Using the same camera sensor that made the iPhone 12 Pro Max the best smartphone camera for photos and videos in 2020, the iPhone 13’s main wide-angle camera has &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jyZ2NJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt; For most people, the iPhone 13 is an easy choice&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BzMqAW"&gt;significantly improved. Photo details are sharp and accurate, colors are rich without being oversaturated, focusing is fast and reliable, portrait mode is good enough to use day to day, and low light and night sight are both exceptional. Its ultrawide camera, on the other hand, has only been minorly updated for better low-light performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wwNczv"&gt;Video quality is also great. The main camera has sensor stabilization, which helps when you’re walking around. It can do all the modes that matter in terms of 4K and slow-mo and handles them all super well. It even lets you record videos in Cinematic mode, which helps you smoothly switch focus between subjects by changing the depth of field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ymvwy3"&gt;The iPhone 13 starts with 128GB of storage. Because its storage is not expandable, and depending on how you’ll be using the phone, you might want to bite the bullet and upgrade to the next tier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qsBso"&gt;For most people, the iPhone 13 is an easy choice: it offers similar performance, design, camera features, and (sometimes) better battery life than other iPhone 13 models, for less money.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6 (right) is Google’s first flagship phone, and it’s already right up there with the best from Apple and Samsung.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Z1IUao"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;Google Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5xQzeU"&gt;Best Android phone to buy in 2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="HijJkz"&gt;The Pixel 6 is a lot of phone for $599. As Google’s first true flagship phone since 2019, the Pixel 6 gets many things right and is right up there with the iPhone 13 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra in camera quality, overall performance, and battery life. When you consider the fact the Pixel 6 is a good $200 less than its rivals, it’s simply the most value-packed flagship phone for Android fans this year. Sorry, OnePlus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YKm2Sq"&gt;You can tell the Pixel 6 from the Pixel 6 Pro by its slightly smaller 6.4-inch, 1080p OLED flat display and bolder color choices like two-tone red or green (black is also an option). For a relatively big phone, the Pixel 6 is not too thick yet feels substantial. That said, its glossy body is super slippery, so you’ll need to budget for a third-party case (forget the Google ones, they aren’t worth the money).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0j9tZm"&gt;At the heart of the Pixel 6 is Tensor, Google’s first proprietary mobile processor that is on par with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chip inside other Android flagships. Tensor allows the new Pixel to lean into Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to learn some new tricks. You can use the Magic Eraser to remove photo-bombers from your photos, take &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="fUDR1d"&gt;&lt;q&gt;it’s simply the most value packed flagship phone for Android fans this year.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a2QbW6"&gt;photos that better reflect real skin tones, as well as use Google Assistant to handle automated calls for you. The Pixel 6 has 8GB of RAM, 128GB or 256GB of internal storage, and runs the latest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"&gt;Android 12 software&lt;/a&gt; with Google’s new Material You theming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QmSNYb"&gt;Inside its sizable rear camera bar are dual cameras, 50-megapixel wide and 12-megapixel ultrawide cameras, along with a laser detection autofocus sensor for low-light and depth. Unlike the Pixel 6 Pro, the 6 doesn’t have a telephoto camera. Still, its images are very good in both normal and low light and very competitive with the best from Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b68lAw"&gt;The Pixel 6 has a 4,614mAh battery (should last two days for light users), supports Qi wireless charging, and has some protection from rain storms (IP68). Its main weakness is a slow under-screen fingerprint scanner, and the phone lacks a face unlock option. While not perfect, the Pixel 6 is an all-around good phone for $599 and is our pick for the best Android phone to buy right now. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max share the same camera system, so either Pro models will be good for content creation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ovaxxT"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="dctrOj"&gt;Best phone for photography and video in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="BudYKV"&gt;Both the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max share the same top-of-the-line camera system this year, and they are our pick as &lt;em&gt;the &lt;/em&gt;iPhone for photos and videos. This time around, you don’t have to buy the biggest and most expensive model to get the best camera system — you get the same experience with either of the Pro models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CewoNz"&gt;The three rear cameras — standard wide, ultrawide, and telephoto — combine with Apple’s image processing to produce stunning images, particularly in low light. If photo and video quality is your most important factor when buying a phone, the 13 Pro is where you should be spending your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYma8C"&gt;The 13 Pro has a physically larger camera sensor compared to prior models that allows its main 12-megapixel camera to gather more light and produce better-quality images, especially in dark or challenging lighting conditions. Its ultrawide camera is able to take stunning macro photos, thanks to its new close focus capability. In addition, the 3x optical &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="fKFScJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This time around, you don’t have to buy the biggest and most expensive model to get the best camera system&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jxI2pw"&gt;zoom on the telephoto lens makes for great portrait photography. That larger sensor and the fact that it’s using sensor-based stabilization make for stable and beautiful videos, even in low light. You can even shoot and edit videos directly in &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212832"&gt;ProRes&lt;/a&gt; on the iPhone 13 Pro (as long as you have a 256GB or higher storage model).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHvvhF"&gt;For those looking for the best Android camera system available, we recommend getting the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;$899 Google Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, especially if a telephoto lens is a must. We pitted the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22769156/iphone-13-pro-vs-pixel-6-pro-camera-comparison-photos"&gt;Pixel 6 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro cameras in a comparison video&lt;/a&gt;, and the results are pretty evenly split. While the Pixel 6 Pro’s video capabilities are still behind the iPhone, it can more than hold its own on stills, and its telephoto camera is even better than the iPhone 13 Pro’s. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 Mini has all the same cameras and features as its siblings but packs a smaller battery for light users.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fRQPIp"&gt;Best small smartphone in 2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="yu67SC"&gt;There’s really only one reason to buy an iPhone 13 Mini, but it’s an important one: if you want a phone that’s easier to use in one hand or put into a small pocket. The iPhone 13 Mini is one of very few small phones on the market with top-tier features and specs; you don’t have to compromise in performance, build quality, or cameras with this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ALR5kS"&gt;Though it’s much smaller in size than the other iPhones released this year, the Mini’s 5.4-inch screen is still big enough for text messaging, email, web browsing, apps, video, and games, and if you’re coming from an iPhone 6 / 7 / 8, it will feel quite spacious. But it’s also small enough that most adults, even those with small hands, will be able to comfortably reach all of the screen with their thumb. You won’t need a PopSocket on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="OR8NaU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One important downside to a smaller phone: the iPhone 13 Mini has a smaller battery&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rLWG16"&gt;One important downside to a smaller phone: the iPhone 13 Mini has a smaller battery that probably won’t last a power user through a whole day without a charge. It’s really designed for a lighter user who isn’t glued to the phone all day. Otherwise, the Mini is the same phone as the iPhone 13: it has the same design, processor, cameras, 5G support, and build quality as the larger model. It’s just smaller and has a smaller price tag, at about $100 less. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3IjBeK"&gt;If you prefer Android, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22431051/asus-zenfone-8-review"&gt;Asus Zenfone 8&lt;/a&gt; is a good alternative. It’s a little bigger than the 13 Mini with a 5.9-inch screen, and it doesn’t work on Verizon, but it’s otherwise a very similar proposition: great build quality, top-notch processor, and high-end features like a 120Hz screen all tucked into a pocket-friendly device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cGzRrM"&gt;If you want a stylus built into your phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="osyeHY"&gt;If you’re looking for a premium phone with a stylus and amazing battery life, the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is still the one for you. Because this device originally launched in 2020, and there are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22627058/samsung-galaxy-note-stylus-z-fold-3-a-series"&gt;rumors that Samsung will be discontinuing the series in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, you might be able to score some deals for this device — if you can find one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iczza1"&gt;The Note 20 Ultra is a high-end phone in every other respect. Its giant 6.9-inch OLED display is 4K in resolution and supports a 120Hz refresh rate for smooth interactions. It is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Plus processor and 12GB of RAM, so it can perform without a hiccup. Together, these elements make the S Pen sing by cutting down &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="G41prk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;you might be able to score some deals for this device — if you can find one&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BOPhPE"&gt;the latency between inking and what you see on-screen. While its triple rear camera system is not as good as the iPhone 13 Pro’s, it’s still one of the most advanced you can get. With its 4,500mAh battery, you can expect about two days of use before you’ll need a recharge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7KsgWM"&gt;Although you can technically use the S Pen with the Galaxy Z Fold 3, it isn’t built into the phone like it is here on the Note 20 Ultra. If you want your S Pen and phone in one clean color-coordinated package, you’ll need to get the Note 20 Ultra while it’s still available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="kSVtiN"&gt;Best flip phone of 2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PDkqPQ"&gt;Sick of smartphones that only get bigger and heavier when all you want is for some new ways to use your phone? Samsung’s third go at a flip phone seems to strike the right balance of whimsy, technical prowess and price that make the Galaxy Z Flip 3 appealing to mainstream users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OdAmnF"&gt;For $999.99, this 4.2-inch pocketable device can transform into a 6.7-inch 1080p OLED display that is bright and has a fast 120Hz refresh rate. The screen can also be used as a split screen for multitasking. When closed, you can use the 1.9-inch outer second screen, which displays handy widgets like app notifications and audio player controls without making you open the phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="77t8Vy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Flip 3 hits at just the right price and style point for it to mainstream the idea of a flip phone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WxcXpK"&gt;The Galaxy Flip 3 has the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor and 8GB of RAM as any other flagship phone released in 2021. Battery life is also just fine, providing between four and five hours of screen time between charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VLTJff"&gt;It’s too bad its dual cameras did not get an upgrade from the previous iteration. Both the 12-megapixel standard wide and ultrawide rear cameras, as well as the 10-megapixel front-facing selfie camera, take good but not great photos. Due to the Z Flip 3’s form factor, it can double as a mobile tripod for the cameras, which makes for some fun new ways to take photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S6gOEi"&gt;Unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21135809/motorola-razr-review-foldable-flip-phone-verizon-price-camera-display-battery"&gt;$1,400 Motorola Razr (2020&lt;/a&gt;), the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 hits at just the right price and style point for it to mainstream the idea of a flip phone. It’s hard to say &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum"&gt;how durable this foldable screen&lt;/a&gt; will be, but at least you can be among the first to find out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="ZtA5cf"&gt;Best phone under $300 in 2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="o8vynA"&gt;Not everyone needs a premium flagship phone, and even a budget phone can be a delight to use these days. If your budget is sub-$300, and you are on the hunt for the best bang for your buck, the $250 TCL 20S will defy your expectations for what a budget should look and feel like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jI5uYL"&gt;You might recognize the TCL brand from its popular budget smart TVs, where its screen expertise is what makes the TCL 20S’s vibrant, 6.67-inch 1080p screen a standout. The 20S has a layer of fingerprint-resistant, “micron-sized prismatic crystals’’ on its back that gives it a subtle shimmer. It has a quick fingerprint sensor that is built into its power button, as well as face unlock as an additional security option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="WI8Y8C"&gt;While the 20S’s camera system is nothing to write home about, its 64-megapixel main camera and 15-megapixel front camera are both more than capable of taking detailed photos in good lighting conditions — just don’t use them for night or macro photography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S1ZKhC"&gt;For a budget phone, the 20S has no noticeable lag in performance, thanks to its Qualcomm Snapdragon 665 processor and 4GB of RAM. By default, it comes with 128GB of internal storage, a microSD card slot, a 3.5mm audio jack, and a 5,000mAh battery that lasts for around two days without a recharge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxzBBh"&gt;The TCL 20S is proof that even a $250 can buy a good phone without many compromises. It just nails all the basics that anyone would want from a phone: good performance, a good screen, good battery life, for a good price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="9xRhhw"&gt;Like its predecessors, the Pixel 5A’s main claim to fame is its camera, which can go head-to-head with flagships that cost $1,000 or more. That’s because Google does so much of the image processing in software — the sensor itself is actually a few years old now. It means the Pixel 5A can take night photos, do astrophotography, and has a passable portrait mode. It can’t hang with the iPhone SE for video but beats it for photos every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcPo00"&gt;One of the benefits of getting a Pixel is that it’ll be first in line for the latest Android updates. Google has committed to providing three years of OS and security updates to the 5A. Android 12 is already available for it, and it will be one of the first models to get the next version after that.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Third time’s the charm for the $1,800 Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3, but it’s still too expensive for most.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xBwOAb"&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PiiTyN"&gt;Best folding phone of 2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="fWZzLE"&gt;If you’ve been waiting patiently for the foldable phone to mature before dropping some serious coin for one, this might be the year to get the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22738082/microsoft-surface-duo-2-review-folding-phone-dual-screen-multitasking"&gt;Microsoft’s dual-screen Surface Duo 2&lt;/a&gt; is a distant second to the Fold 3, in this early two-device race.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ADSUM"&gt;The Fold 3 is Samsung’s third-generation folding phone. Its main premise is this: it is sized like a skinny smartphone that fits in your pocket, but it unfolds to reveal a tablet-sized 7.6-inch display on the inside. That inside screen makes everything from reading books to &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WScnfM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;That flexibility is unmatched by any other phone you can buy right now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8cJXDD"&gt;browsing the web to watching video to playing games more enjoyable and immersive. When you’re done using it, just fold it back up and stick it in your pocket just like any other phone. It also has an extra 6.2-inch screen on the cover with 2268 x 832 resolution, so you can use it for quick tasks when you don’t have enough time or space to unfold the main screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2WmHwM"&gt;That flexibility is unmatched by any other phone you can buy right now, but it doesn’t come without a significant list of compromises. The Fold 3 is twice as thick when closed compared to normal phones, all its cameras are sub-par, and its 4,400mAh battery is a bit small to power so many screens. While the Fold 3 is water resistant (IPX8), the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum"&gt;durability of its foldable screen and hinge&lt;/a&gt; remains an open question. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKplTb"&gt;But the biggest compromise is its cost: the Fold 3 is roughly twice as expensive as other high-end phones. At $1,800, you’re still paying a lot for the ability to fold a tablet screen in half. If you’re willing to put up with those compromises for an experience that’s unlike anything else, though, the Fold 3 delivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rsSZIW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10820291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fO6Eoz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
