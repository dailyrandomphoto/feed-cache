    <title>Reddit’s top three posts of 2021 were all from WallStreetBets</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IZJKIp"&gt;Reddit is taking a look back at some of the site’s biggest moments and trends from 2021, and perhaps unsurprisingly, posts from r/wallstreetbets were the most upvoted posts of the year. r/wallstreetbets became hugely popular after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;GameStop’s stock price skyrocketed in January&lt;/a&gt; and as people followed updates from Keith Gill&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(aka DeepFuckingValue / Roaring Kitty),&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the trader who invested &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256582/roaringkitty-deepfuckingvalue-keith-gill-profile-gamestop-wallstreetbets-wsj"&gt;heavily in GameStop ahead of the stock’s surge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zaWDyW"&gt;Here are the top five most upvoted posts, according to Reddit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="6ZD8IL"&gt;On r/wallstreetbets, a user bought a billboard in Times Square reading &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8rf4k/times_square_right_now/?context=3"&gt;“$GME GO BRRR”&lt;/a&gt; and got more than 433K upvotes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eJrFj6"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6wu59/upvote_so_everyone_sees_we_got_support/"&gt;A screenshotted tweet&lt;/a&gt; on r/wallstreetbets alleging Robinhood hid popular meme stocks and encouraging users to “take all the cash you can afford to lose and buy buy buy” had more than 323K upvotes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rhugl5"&gt;One r/wallstreetbets &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l78uct/gme_yolo_update_jan_28_2021/"&gt;update from Gill&lt;/a&gt; showing his GameStop shares losing more $14 million in one day earned more than 287K upvotes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SzNuXM"&gt;A post on r/antiwork where a user posted a screenshot &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/q82vqk/quit_my_job_last_night_it_was_nice_to_be_home_to/"&gt;telling their boss they were quitting&lt;/a&gt; got more than 273K upvotes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GkVmHi"&gt;A video on r/nextfuckinglevel of a man &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nextfuckinglevel/comments/n1s9ub/dodging_a_cashintransit_robbery_the_man_has_balls/?context=3"&gt;dodging a cash-in-transit robbery&lt;/a&gt; had more than 259K upvotes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="moeC1Y"&gt;Posts overall on Reddit were up, according to the company. There were more than 366 million posts (up 19 percent year over year), 2.3 billion comments (up 12 percent year over year), and “nearly” 46 billion upvotes (up 1 percent year over year).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xSLBzc"&gt;Reddit isn’t just sharing some of its own biggest trends, though: the company is also launching Spotify Wrapped-style personalized recaps showing things like a summary of how much time you’ve spent on the platform. These will be available starting Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nHcJSnl6bOeL12PHD2nbnOTJqOI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23071368/Recap_Media_Graphic_2x.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Reddit&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s an example of what the personalized Reddit Recaps look like.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VYEIdm"&gt;Part of the fun of Spotify Wrapped is sharing your &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22811900/spotify-wrapped-2021-music-recap-iphone-android"&gt;embarrassing music habits on social media&lt;/a&gt;, and it seems like Reddit is hoping for a similar reaction with personalized Reddit Recaps. Reddit will also let you hide your username and avatar in your recap if you want to share your insights but don’t want others to know anything else about your account. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Crossing the border, refugees scramble for a working SIM card</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jd-InAOTfJ8uUvgSEpXPE6z0RgM=/0x51:3000x2051/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70243665/laptent.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Ori Toor&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;‘When there was no internet, I was left with nothing’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="w2J9Kz"&gt;Ana* and her three-year-old son arrived at the shelter for migrant and refugee women in the northern Mexican city of Monterrey in early October. Every morning, the 14 women at the shelter — mainly from El Salvador and Honduras — share the house chores: sweeping, cooking, and babysitting the children of their compañeras working informal jobs to save enough money to cross into the United States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="umbU4a"&gt;The majority of them, traveling alone with as many as three children, spent days unable to communicate with their families after crossing Mexico’s southern border. Not having a local SIM card, they said, made the uncertainty and anxiety of their journey that much worse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ujacJk"&gt;For a family crossing the border, a working phone is critical. It lets asylum-seekers stay connected to family, receive money, and access critical information for their journey. But refugees and asylum-seekers face enormous challenges keeping those phones working, as the logistics of cellular networks work against them. The result is a constant scramble, as refugees swap SIM cards and wrestle with telecoms in an effort to create a safer migration journey for themselves and their families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="DVuoPr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“My family hadn’t heard from me.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IkAHsf"&gt;Ana lost contact with her family after crossing the Guatemala-Mexico border. She didn’t know how to change a SIM card and couldn’t find a place to charge her phone, which ran out of battery in Guatemala.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="osED5c"&gt;“My family hadn’t heard from me. Once at the shelter, I went out and found a little shop where I had to pay 15 pesos per hour to charge it and bought a chip for 80 pesos. Then, I called my family,” explains Ana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uOIlhJ"&gt;Losing mobile coverage when entering Mexico deprives people in transit from being monitored and accompanied by their support network. While telecommunication infrastructure has expanded across borders with expensive international roaming plans, people trying to move freely across those same borders are being left with limited access to mobile services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZMvRv"&gt;Vladimir Cortés is the digital rights program officer in the Mexico and Central America office of Article 19, a nonprofit focused on freedom of expression. Cortés explains that governments, multinational telecommunication corporations, regulatory bodies, and international organizations could establish continuity of access to mobile services for people in migration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="uWu8ks"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“When there was no internet, I was left with nothing.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7bGMTu"&gt;“International organizations can articulate these different actors to guarantee mobile network coverage,” says Cortés. “There is an important opportunity to recognize the phenomenon that currently exists and the level of protection that states can guarantee.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qRpQUy"&gt;Six months ago, Ana and her son left their home in Choluteca, Honduras, after receiving threats from the people who kidnapped and killed her 14-year-old daughter Gabriela*. Throughout the journey, Ana, who aspires to build a safe life with her son in Los Angeles, relied on Google Maps to check her location, and WhatsApp or Facebook to communicate with her family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MEnffF"&gt;“In some parts there was a signal and in others not. When there was no internet, I was left with nothing,” says 37-year-old Ana, while her son watches &lt;em&gt;SpongeBob&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;SquarePants&lt;/em&gt; on her Samsung Galaxy S6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j9vUF1"&gt;The use of GPS applications and instant messaging apps — mostly Facebook and WhatsApp — allows refugees to orient themselves and participate in online migrant networks that can give them a greater sense of community and security. Some of the women at the shelter said it’s hard to trust information available online, since they are aware of online scams that falsely promise visa facilitation and transportation assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="xPoEJM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I just want to know how my father and brothers are”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e5kGeU"&gt;Some of these online scams have been linked to serious criminal activities such as kidnapping and human trafficking. Diana González and Juan Manuel Casanueva, researchers at &lt;a href="https://socialtic.org/"&gt;SocialTIC&lt;/a&gt;, a Mexican digital security nonprofit, identified various &lt;a href="https://socialtic.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Etnografia_digital_migracion_covid19.pdf"&gt;connectivity risks&lt;/a&gt; at Mexico’s southern border such as identity theft and extortion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="upJmb2"&gt;“The dangers are basically associated with two: identity theft for extortion issues, meaning some type of information can be used to contact their families and ask for money,” explains Casanueva. “And the other is not entirely digital … it’s the lack of communication. If they are victims of other types of danger, they cannot communicate with a support network.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hIJ1m3"&gt;The women at the shelter often verify online information with their compañeras or other offline sources, such as staff at the shelter or migrant rights groups, since they know Facebook is used to spread misinformation and fake news.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Fd8K2"&gt;“Saying Facebook is bad or WhatsApp is bad does not apply. It is the only thing there is,” says Casanueva. “The question that should be asked in these spaces is how these people can have the appropriate information, and also how to prevent risks that occur on these platforms, such as identity theft for issues of extortion and scams, criminal networks, and possibly even risk of kidnapping, and lots of fake news.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="To4d6h"&gt;Ana limits her mobile use to messaging her family, seeking information about border crossings, and watching cartoons with her son. &lt;em&gt;Masha and the Bear&lt;/em&gt; is her favorite since, she says, “it helps to distract” her mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="waocjE"&gt;Mary left El Salvador with her three children, ages two, five, and eight, after being extorted at the pizza place she owned, and like Ana, she doesn’t like to use her Huawei Y7P unless out of necessity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HPjsYR"&gt;“The truth is, I don’t use the phone much more than the girls use it to watch videos to entertain themselves. I just want to know how my father and brothers are, and if my brother who is in the United States is going to send me money,” says Mary, who withheld her full name for her own protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QGIwiG"&gt;For the women in the shelter, the priority is to earn more money so they can find safer ways to cross. When they were able, many took buses instead of walking, or stayed in hotels instead of shelters, to protect their children throughout their journey toward the US-Mexico border.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="vgB4sh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“She had her father’s number memorized in case her cell phone was taken away.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RBTRTG"&gt;Esther Nohemí Álvarez lent her Huawei phone to her 15-year-old daughter, who was starting to show symptoms of depression. It was 2019, and the Migration Protection Protocol, a Trump era policy also called “Remain in Mexico,” was forcing &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/12/20/20997299/asylum-border-mexico-us-iom-unhcr-usaid-migration-international-humanitarian-aid-matamoros-juarez"&gt;thousands of asylum seekers&lt;/a&gt; arriving at the US’s southern border to remain in Mexico to await their US hearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8OSX5Z"&gt;Álvarez’s daughter grabbed her mom’s phone and did TikTok dance challenges with other girls at the shelter.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;That same phone allowed her to stay in contact with her mother in Monterrey and with her father in Virginia, while she crossed the US-Mexico border with the assistance of a smuggler in April of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1DvEP"&gt;“As an unaccompanied minor, immigration detained her and they contacted her father. She had her father’s number memorized in case her cell phone was taken away,” says Álvarez. “She was there for about 25 days, and they allowed her like three calls to contact her dad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VQYHlo"&gt;Of all the risks that crossed Álvarez’s mind when she decided to send her daughter alone after her asylum claim was denied, digital risks were the least of her concern, let alone government surveillance.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BLTcSH"&gt;But earlier this year, Mexico’s Senate passed a law that would require mobile users to register their biometric data in a government database in order to obtain a SIM card. The law will allegedly fight organized crime and reduce extortions and kidnappings, even though a similar project implemented between 2008 and 2011 only saw an increase in extortions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qNmA8E"&gt;Digital rights groups challenging the law affirm that users’ sensitive personal information will be at risk. Although the law is currently suspended indefinitely by the Supreme Court, Cortés explains that its implementation would generate a greater violation of the rights of migrants, who already face persecution by the Mexican National Institute of Migration and other state actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WnFTHP"&gt;“The registration of the card is not the only problem. The other problem is the delivery of biometrics data. Authoritarian countries can use this as a way to control and undermine the privacy of people,” adds Cortés. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUsq01"&gt;The first time Álvarez and her daughter tried to cross through Ciudad Miguel Alemán, across the border from Roma, Texas, they were held for a week in the&lt;em&gt; hieleras&lt;/em&gt;, Customs and Border Protection’s notoriously cold detention cells. They were deported through Nuevo Laredo — a border city that has seen a surge in &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/caribbean-mexico-business-c0d3079172498f625e5e041bb3e8a714"&gt;drug cartel-related violence&lt;/a&gt; — more than 150 kilometers away from their original point of entry. It was her mobile phone that allowed Álvarez to locate herself on a map and seek assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bg2QsI"&gt;As the US government deploys new technologies to surveil and track migrants, asylum-seeking women are not deterred by them. Even if they have to wait longer in Monterrey until they consider it safe to cross, returning home is no longer an option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="2xVQjh"&gt;“We are going to cross the border. That’s why I’m working here [in Monterrey] to save money,” says Mary, while two of her kids run around the table. “If we don’t make it, then we are going to stay here because I cannot return to my country.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ksTQJj"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Some names in this story have been changed to protect sources from possible reprisals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft updates OneDrive for faster syncing on Apple M1 Macs and Windows on Arm</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/afZG7_FHdvEnPwBlzqnA8H1W3IA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70243443/acastro_180507_1777_microsoft_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HrbOf0"&gt;Microsoft has released a OneDrive sync app for Windows on Arm and Apple’s M1 Macs for its cloud-based storage service. The public preview of the updated OneDrive app is &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-onedrive-blog/onedrive-sync-for-native-arm-devices-now-in-public-preview/ba-p/3031668"&gt;available as an opt-in download&lt;/a&gt; for both Windows on Arm and macOS, and allows the app to run natively on these devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zoUH4v"&gt;This should improve the performance of the OneDrive sync app, as the OneDrive process will no longer run emulated on Windows on Arm. The jump to 64-bit is also useful for OneDrive users with lots of files or large files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fe7McB"&gt;Microsoft’s OneDrive support for Apple’s M1 Macs and Windows on Arm comes after Dropbox revealed it’s testing its own native app. Dropbox is currently supported on Apple’s M1 Macs through Rosetta, but an updated app is arriving next year. “We have an internal build for native Apple M1 support, which we’re currently testing and we’re committed to releasing in the first half of 2022,” says a Dropbox spokesperson in a &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/10/28/dropbox-m1-support/"&gt;statement to &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qRRPoQ"&gt;Microsoft has not committed to a full release date for its OneDrive Arm preview, but anyone can enable it from the “get OneDrive Insider preview updates before release” option in the OneDrive settings &amp;gt; about section.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Snap is sidestepping the metaverse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sNBejYuq4_yfMsvSq5s0OVgwlLM=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70243378/https___bucketeer_e05bbc84_baa3_437e_9518_adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com_public_images_169a836c_b9ff_4146_bdcb_63815b48f97a_1920x1080.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AR creator Andre Elijah in Spectacles. &lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Snap&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tYBmyA"&gt;More than other recent years, in 2021 the tech industry focused a great deal of its energy on a single question: who will build and own the next generation of the internet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KfNBPq"&gt;In one corner you have the scrappy upstarts eager to topple the existing world order and rebuild it from scratch on the blockchain. These companies give their effort the aspirational name “Web3.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bsMEjY"&gt;In the other corner you have the existing tech platforms, who envision the next generation of the internet as a slightly more interoperable version of the existing web. What will set it apart is new hardware: augmented reality glasses and virtual reality helmets that will bring us together in a series of linked experiences that occupy an ever-increasing share of our waking hours. Platforms have taken to calling this “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701104/metaverse-explained-fortnite-roblox-facebook-horizon"&gt;the metaverse&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7MkQ1U"&gt;Web3 and the metaverse will surely intersect along the way — Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said he imagines people bringing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;non-fungible tokens&lt;/a&gt; along with them as they traverse the company’s virtual worlds. But while crypto-based platforms are still mostly in their earliest stages, the battle for the metaverse already has at least a half-dozen established companies investing billions of dollars in realizing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yLZyOY"&gt;Today, let’s talk about one that strangely flies a little under the radar — and is taking a more straightforward path. While other companies are painting grand visions of the metaverse via press interviews and op-eds, Snap has been quietly focused on two of the ideas that can actually bring it into existence: steadily improving its hardware every year or so, and attracting developers by giving away that hardware and offering them ways to profit from it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s_2mqPHUP-X3S85ET9YSQ68uVp4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23060781/alopez_211129_4909_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amanda Lopez for The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="iDmqUv"&gt;The core function of AR glasses is to project images in front of your face, turning your field of vision into a virtual computer screen on which you can receive messages, play games, and interact with digital or real-world objects for educational or commercial purposes. Most platform executives agree that this would be a good and useful thing, and that lots of people would buy the hardware that makes it possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z4sv3z"&gt;The problem is that the tech isn’t ready: creating high-resolution projections using a device that fits on your face, has good battery life, and costs a reasonable price, is far beyond the ability of today’s platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Plhsgb"&gt;Surveying the AR landscape this week, &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-iphone-successor-comes-into-focus-11638594004"&gt; predicted that someday high-tech glasses will become Apple’s successor to the iPhone&lt;/a&gt;. It looked at similar efforts from Facebook, Microsoft, and the lesser-known Vuzix, among others. And to Snap, which made the first major set of high-tech glasses when it released Spectacles in 2016, the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; devoted just a single sentence: “Snapchat parent Snap earlier this year added AR functions to the latest version of its Spectacles smart-glasses, which are so far available only for developers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ekHrFP"&gt;Indeed, &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/snap-hits-its-stride"&gt;when they were announced in May&lt;/a&gt;, Spectacles became the first pair of the company’s glasses I didn’t get to try myself. Instead, the company seeded them with a handful of developers who create AR effects, games, and utilities and gave them a few months to build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GMG2bw"&gt;And then, one day last week, the company invited me to a rented backyard in San Francisco’s Castro District to see the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Eg1cFr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Only the most hardcore futurists would want these today&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Gt29pb"&gt;Within a few minutes of wearing the glasses, two things became clear to me. One is that these are very much a product for developers rather than consumers. The chonky frames, 30-minute battery, and presumably high price would limit their appeal to all but the most hardcore futurists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AYt7IO"&gt;At the same time, my morning with Spectacles was enough to convince me that AR glasses have a promising future, and are likely to print money for the companies that manage to perfect them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ku2QsJ"&gt;It started with a donut. Sitting around a table with some Snap executives, I was introduced to &lt;a href="http://www.tacolamp.com/"&gt;Brielle Garcia&lt;/a&gt;, a full-time AR creator who is part of the company’s &lt;a href="https://ar.snap.com/ghost"&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt; program for up-and-coming developers. Garcia has made dozens of AR effects for Snapchat — the company calls them “lenses” — and one such idea came to her while eating at a restaurant during COVID. Like many eateries, this one had begun telling customers to scan codes with their phones to access the menu. Garcia thought it would look better in AR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6BuasF"&gt;Using Snap’s &lt;a href="https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/"&gt;Lens Studio software&lt;/a&gt;, she mocked up a menu that displays items in three dimensions sitting virtually on your table. When I opened it up using Spectacles, I waved my hands to advance through the virtual goods: a burger, a sushi roll, a piece of pie. The donut looked realistic enough that I developed slight hunger pangs looking at it. Compared to a QR code menu on my phone, Garcia’s AR project was meaningfully better. And I felt that way despite the relatively low resolution of the text, at least compared to what you might see on a current-generation smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qUzF3o"&gt;The Snap team had other tricks to show off. In one game, a zombie chased me around the yard. (Alex Heath, who got a similar demo at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22819963/snap-ar-spectacles-glasses-hands-on-pictures-design-features"&gt;posted a video of his zombie chase that gives you the idea&lt;/a&gt;.) In another, I hung virtual Christmas lights on the trees.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge reporter Alex Heath wears the new Spectacles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fKzFE9"&gt;The flaws are all readily apparent. The biggest among them is the relatively small field of view that Spectacles can produce using its current technology. When you don the glasses, you might assume that you’ll be able to see a digital overlay that covers everything you see. Instead, it’s a relatively small box at the center of your vision. As a result, I was constantly moving my ahead to attempt to “place” the digital effect back in the box where I could see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Kcy7o"&gt;In some cases, as with Garcia’s menu, objects were relatively small and slow-moving, and this was fine. In others, particularly the zombie chase, the field of view was so small that I found the game all but unplayable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6D5IGM"&gt;That said, the state of the art is still further along than I expected when I first sat down with the glasses. For my final demo of the day, I used Spectacles to project a toy dinosaur on the table we were all sitting at. It appeared as a perfect hologram, contained neatly within the glasses’ field of view — the sort of thing that would delight any child to whom you showed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtuC6R"&gt;A small thing today, but one that points to a big future.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mEnf5reRxNrtBc5ODWV-bLrCTFI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23060793/alopez_211129_4909_0022.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="iXM5gh"&gt;Snap faces a lot of competition as it works to turn today’s Spectacles into the iPhone of the future. Apple is at work on its own headset, which will combine AR and VR, and will &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-10-31/why-are-apple-aapl-iphone-13-watch-series-7-ipads-taking-so-long-to-arrive-kvfjgjkx?sref=CrGXSfHu"&gt;reportedly debut it next year&lt;/a&gt;. Meta is &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/facebook-says-its-developing-fully-ar-glasses/#:~:text=A%20Facebook%20employee%20demonstrates%20a%20prototype%20of%20true%20AR%20glasses.&amp;amp;text=The%20social%20network%20announced%20the,an%20AR%20family%20game%20night."&gt;working to launch AR glasses&lt;/a&gt; next year as well. And &lt;a href="http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=3653"&gt;Microsoft just signed a deal with Samsung&lt;/a&gt; to collaborate on a future generation of its HoloLens headset that will presumably be aimed at consumers. (It’s not expected until 2024.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JrwviH"&gt;Meanwhile, more software-oriented efforts from Roblox, Epic Games, and Niantic are all afoot — and will likely lead to hardware projects of their own down the road. (Niantic&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/niantic-ceo-shares-teaser-image-of-ar-glasses-device/"&gt; has already commissioned a reference design&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l7wfNn"&gt;But one thing about Snap, as co-founder Bobby Murphy told me this week, is that the company has been working on this initiative for many years — predating much of its current competitive set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M9rx2V"&gt;“We’ve been incredibly invested and interested in an AR future for for many, many years now,” Murphy told me ahead of &lt;a href="https://lensfest.live/"&gt;its LensFest developer event&lt;/a&gt;, which runs through Thursday. “The ability to perceive and render digital experiences directly into the world really aligns to how we as humans naturally operate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AfVnMG"&gt;To date, Snap has signed up 250,000 people to create more than 2.5 million AR effects. More than 300 of those people have gotten 1 billion or more views on their Snapchat lenses, the company says. Snapchat lenses are viewed 6 billion times per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wfTKH7"&gt;Of course, the majority of those are purely for entertainment: making your face look younger, or prettier, or otherwise distorted to send snaps to your friends, or to place a digital dancing hot dog in the environment around you. But Snap has started to layer in other sorts of experiences, like a “scan” feature that lets you use the Snapchat camera to identify trees — or, more importantly, from a revenue perspective — shopping opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ARBh2X"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Does money grow on AR trees?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JQ3l9i"&gt;It turns out that all those funny-face lenses trained a generation of users that a screen can itself be a window into real-world experiences, whether on a smartphone or a pair of glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6VpngF"&gt;“That’s actually been a very helpful starting point for us to start to push into kind of a much wider variety of use cases,” Murphy told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qIP0ml"&gt;One thing you won’t catch Murphy doing much is talking about the metaverse. While Snap’s ambitions arguably fit under that umbrella, the company seems confident enough in its existing vision not to adopt the buzzwords of the moment. At the same time, Murphy says the recent acceleration in development around AR is real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UEBcxW"&gt;“It’s not that there’s been a leap in technology, but I think we &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; starting to see a broader emergence of use cases for which AR is maybe escaping the novelty sphere, and actually driving real value for for companies and for creators,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yL3H0X"&gt;There’s no reliable timeline for when that next leap will occur — and when hundreds of millions of people will begin wearing their AR glasses in the way many assume they someday will. But using the latest version of Spectacles, I find myself having trouble believing that &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; won’t get there eventually — and maybe sooner than a lot of people think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gCs8Ps"&gt;“The way that we’re looking at our opportunity in the future, it’s really around developing this kind of singular, holistic platform,” Murphy said. “In which you as an AR creator can make something really compelling, and get that in front of people — through Snapchat, through &lt;a href="https://kit.snapchat.com/camera-kit"&gt;CameraKit&lt;/a&gt;, through Spectacles — and then build a career or build a business through that kind of path.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="R75S9e"&gt;Winning over developers doesn’t guarantee that any particular company will win the mixed-reality future. But no one can win without them, either. For the moment, Snap has more than its share of enthusiastic creators. And together, they just might make the metaverse an actual reality — even if the company never calls it that.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bowser agrees to $10 million fine for selling Nintendo Switch hacks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jhk2CRuoLLkKTCMEjB1KKRJqK2E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70243370/jbareham_180301_2346_nintendo_switch_0065_mario.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cLYlLT"&gt;Canadian hacker Gary Bowser has &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-12-07-nintendo-hacker-gary-bowser-agrees-to-pay-usd10m-fine"&gt;agreed to pay $10 million&lt;/a&gt; to settle a Nintendo lawsuit against him over piracy charges. Bowser is a member of the Team Xecuter group that have created mod chips or jailbroken the Nintendo Switch, 3DS, NES Classic Edition, and other consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4MlCn2"&gt;Team Xecuter’s most well-known product is a USB device called the SX Pro that allows the Nintendo Switch to run pirated games. Nintendo has been &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/5/18/21262121/nintendo-switch-hacking-lawsuit-pirated-games"&gt;chasing Switch hackers&lt;/a&gt; for years, and Bowser was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21499297/team-xecuter-selling-nintendo-hacks-arrested-charged-fraud"&gt;arrested and indicted&lt;/a&gt; last year in a separate federal case. He was ordered to pay $4.5 million for charges related to Nintendo Switch hacks. In total, Bowser is paying Nintendo at least $14.5 million in restitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bhD37c"&gt;Bowser made a business out of selling console mods, a controversial decision in a modding and emulation community that typically focuses on open-source efforts that usually avoid federal authorities. Nintendo has a history of aggressively pursuing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/28/18117172/nintendo-youtube-monetization-partner-program-super-smash-bros-ultimate-lets-play-livestream"&gt;unauthorized use&lt;/a&gt; of its intellectual property, and the company has regularly gone after ROM sites that host game files.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oppo teases retractable rear camera for phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LTrYZpknmIRBlb2ESvWB1D_RGaE=/0x0:1119x746/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70243251/Screenshot_2021_12_08_at_16.19.32.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XjsbeB"&gt;Oppo has released a brief video hinting at a new type of camera design for smartphones. The company’s “self-developed retractable camera” is shown extending from the phone’s body before retracting back inside. The video suggests that the mechanism is waterproof and that it’ll automatically retract the camera if the phone is dropped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v6UIgo"&gt;Unlike pop-up selfie cameras that hide themselves inside a phone until needed, moving the camera back and forth on the Z-axis could have implications for image quality, though Oppo hasn’t yet claimed anything about any optical advantages of this design. It doesn’t appear to be a zoom lens, given it’s marked simply as 50mm, but it could theoretically help improve telephoto performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="B6GnXn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Most pop-ups are annoying... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But not our self-developed retractable camera!   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Explore more in INNO WORLD on 14/12.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OPPOINNODAY2021?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#OPPOINNODAY2021&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/33hgJSw8If"&gt;pic.twitter.com/33hgJSw8If&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— OPPO (@oppo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oppo/status/1468143243183468556?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vlj0TN"&gt;The markings on the camera module show that the sensor is 1/1.56 inches and the lens is 50mm-equivalent with an f/2.4 aperture, meaning it should be around 2x longer than the phone’s main lens. That’s a much bigger sensor than you tend to find behind telephoto lenses, so maybe the extra height allowed by the retracting mechanism is what makes this possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9TwZRR"&gt;Oppo is releasing this video ahead of next week’s annual Inno Day event, where the company often shows off various concepts and technologies before they’re commercially deployed. Last year’s event featured &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571056/oppo-x-2021-rolling-phone-ar-glass-concept-inno-day-2020"&gt;a rollable phone and AR glasses&lt;/a&gt;. This year, Oppo is holding Inno Day across two days, December 14th and 15th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elizabeth Holmes smiles on the stand as her trial nears an end</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xOpegldUNRMhHH5Oix3jblD2fw8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70242786/vpavic_20211207_4918_0010.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A scattershot day in court&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="O6wWoR"&gt;I expected more fireworks from a cross-examination of former Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes. Instead, today was a disjointed day of questions without a clear narrative throughline. I don’t know why the government chose to send an assassin who didn’t know when to twist the knife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ufB5Jl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Today was scattered&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KB9t2Q"&gt;The defense presented a strong narrative on its direct examination. Holmes was a young CEO who believed in Theranos’ technology and had some very credentialed advisors who led her to believe it was real. There was real intellectual property. Holmes never sold her shares. And while she hadn’t done anything wrong, she was also being abused by her boyfriend, Theranos’ president Sunny Balwani, and maybe that clouded her judgment. (Balwani is Holmes’ co-defendant, but he is being tried separately.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eiG1Dt"&gt;To counter that, the prosecution needed to show Holmes fully in control. She’s facing 11 counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud — central to proving that charge is showing that she knowingly lied. On the first day of direct testimony, prosecutor Robert Leach drove her control home: Holmes owned most of the company. She could have fired anyone there, including both Balwani and her entire board of directors. Balwani had not kept secrets from her about what was going on in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ufAfhV"&gt;Today was more scattered. Leach did score some points, but he didn’t carry through the narrative thread about Holmes’ control. Here’s a brief overview of the cross-examination:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="MskG2p"&gt;Holmes admitted that Theranos devices weren’t on medevac helicopters, as several investors claimed Holmes told them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ukN8zG"&gt;Holmes knew it would be wrong to tell an investor Theranos didn’t use third-party machines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uwLNWB"&gt;Holmes acknowledged that different financial projections were given to investors and the people calculating Theranos’ stock option values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pK5kXI"&gt;Holmes knew there were a bunch of things wrong in a big &lt;em&gt;Fortune &lt;/em&gt;article, but promoted it anyway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dpX6Bw"&gt;Emails showed Theranos did special preparation for demo tests, and didn’t report results they were having trouble with &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="loRlp4"&gt;A 2010 slideshow from a Theranos scientist, which Holmes cited as part of her belief in the technology, was forward-looking and contained more aspirations than facts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="528Hqm"&gt;Patents are not the same thing as working devices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="W9GgiR"&gt;The published journal articles, which Holmes also cited as part of her belief in Theranos technology, were after the period in which the alleged fraud took place&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qFj5HX"&gt;Holmes knew the 2015 CMS inspection was going badly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="SYFh3b"&gt;If there was a theme, it was that Holmes didn’t recall a lot of events. But given how the defense &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/1/22705156/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-aging-the-case-rosendorff"&gt;delayed the trial&lt;/a&gt;, that seems possible — after all, a lot of this was more than five years ago, and some of the testimony concerned things from 10 years ago. It’s easier to say “I don’t recall” about events that happened 10 years ago than it is to say it about something that happened yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qUwJRu"&gt;Personally, I was miffed because a promised discussion of “trade secrets,” which Holmes had offered as a reason she didn’t tell people about Theranos’ use of modified third-party machines, hardly came up. (Leach said we’d get to trade secrets last week, when Holmes used the phrase liberally in her answers.) Some corporations &lt;a href="http://tsi.brooklaw.edu/commentary/trade-secrets-trolls-0"&gt;abuse trade secrets&lt;/a&gt; to protect information that has no competitive use — mainly to keep consumers in the dark. Arguably, Theranos’ use of trade secrets could fall into this category! But I guess we won’t find out, because Leach didn’t make this argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QnMYYw"&gt;Helicopters and other military toys&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Sj0Pju"&gt;Several investors — Lisa Peterson, Brian Grossman, and Bryan Tolbert — told the court that Holmes said the Theranos devices were used by the military, either on medevacs or in theater in places such as Afghanistan. Their testimony was echoed by Steven Burd, CEO of Safeway, which was one of Theranos’ business partners, and by Roger Parloff, the journalist who wrote a &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt; article that’s been heavily cited in the trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="EDtam3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I don’t think I said that.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iTRJaj"&gt;Holmes testified that Theranos devices weren’t being used by the military, aside from in one small burn study. She agreed it would have been wrong to tell people otherwise. And she said she never told anyone that Theranos’ devices were used on military helicopters. “I don’t think I said that,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nUiGiB"&gt;She also testified that it would be wrong to tell a potential investor that Theranos didn’t buy any devices from third parties. But we didn’t delve into why Holmes conveniently left out that Theranos &lt;em&gt;was &lt;/em&gt;using third-party devices; Holmes’ excuse was trade secrets, and the prosecution didn’t convincingly respond to that. It might have been helpful to suggest there was a &lt;a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11251b.htm"&gt;sin of omission&lt;/a&gt; here — that by withholding information, Holmes had functionally lied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nWaNG7"&gt;The prosecution didn’t do that, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eeSkam"&gt;Weird revenue projections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OELqps"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674657/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-trial-wire-fraud-financial-witness"&gt;The first witness&lt;/a&gt; in the trial, Danise Yam, had testified that she &lt;a href="https://files.cand.uscourts.gov/files/18-CR-258%20USA%20v.%20Holmes/Trial%20Exh.%202623/Trial%20Exh.%202623%20Email%20From%20D.Y.%20To%20Elizabeth%20Holmes;%207.16.2015.pdf"&gt;got revenue projections&lt;/a&gt; from Holmes to send to an analytics firm that was &lt;a href="https://files.cand.uscourts.gov/files/18-CR-258%20USA%20v.%20Holmes/Trial%20Exh.%205190/Trial%20Exh.%205190%20Email%20Attachment.pdf"&gt;pricing Theranos’ stock options&lt;/a&gt;. These numbers were notably smaller than what Holmes was showing investors: showing a projection of about $53 million in revenue in 2015 and $153 million in 2016. In documents investors received, 2015 revenue was projected at $140 million and 2016 revenue was expected to be $990 million. These are extremely different numbers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="RF0uUa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It doesn’t look good that the people pricing the options got lower estimates than potential investors&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wRbmpV"&gt;Holmes didn’t have a good explanation for why those numbers were so radically different, suggesting maybe there was something to do with a pharmaceutical contract. Leach knocked that down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GG9qiu"&gt;It doesn’t look good that the people pricing the options got lower estimates than potential investors — either the options were being under-priced or the investors were being misled. This was where I’d expected Leach to ask more questions: &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; were the models different? If it was because of different methodologies, why were they chosen? Who chose them? Why did Holmes allow this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9lvgX"&gt;Instead, he moved on to his next topic without probing further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Lw6i3p"&gt;Out for Blood?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7B3Hqb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2014/06/12/theranos-blood-holmes/"&gt;Roger Parloff’s article for &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; had put Theranos on the map for a lot of people. Holmes claimed she didn’t send it to shareholders — right before we saw an email from Theranos to its shareholders, linking the article. She also used it in investor presentations, even though she knew there were things wrong in the article. Holmes made no effort to correct those things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uVQovR"&gt;We went through the article. There was no mention of modified third-party devices; instead, the article claimed Theranos &lt;em&gt;did not buy third-party analyzers&lt;/em&gt;. That was wrong, Holmes admitted. Theranos did not offer more than 200 tests, as the article claimed, Holmes said. And it wasn’t true that Theranos’ labs took up a fraction of the space of conventional labs, Holmes said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cmi8wi"&gt;Leach could have lingered on Holmes’ lack of corrections to the article, the way her defense team had lingered on how Holmes didn’t receive negative feedback directly from pharma companies. He didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ps9uqT"&gt;Demo derby&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JaW6pB"&gt;Leach then attempted to show that Holmes had misled investors by controlling their experiences in product demonstrations. In order to do that, some test results were suppressed. In other cases, Theranos employees made plans to make &lt;em&gt;certain&lt;/em&gt; would-be investors received finger sticks — which Theranos touted as its revolutionary technology — instead of conventional venous draws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Fxw0G1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We cannot tell them their order prompts venous if it does.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xPyjkc"&gt;In an email thread from October 2014, Theranos employees were preparing for a visit from potential investors. People from BDT Capital Partners were going to get their blood drawn. “Assumptions here from EAH [Elizabeth A Holmes] that we must not do venous draws, and we cannot tell them their order prompts venous if it does,” wrote Christian Holmes in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="70r1SK"&gt;He then laid out scenarios for what to do if venous draws were required. One possibility was to tell members of the group that certain tests couldn’t be done. Was this to conceal from BDT Capital Partners that Theranos relied on venous draws? No, Holmes said. Ultimately, BDT Capital Partners didn’t invest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QEUEcw"&gt;For a Walgreens demo in 2013, Theranos upper management meddled again. Several results were struck because “these are all running low, possibly abnormally,” wrote Theranos VP Daniel Young in an email. Theranos didn’t tell Walgreens they struck these tests or why, even though Walgreens was a business partner. Leach pointed out that Holmes could have chosen, instead, to have a frank discussion about some of Theranos’ struggles with its tests. She chose not to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nkPXeP"&gt;The believer?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="77mRoj"&gt;During Holmes’ direct exam, her defense team &lt;a href="https://files.cand.uscourts.gov/files/18-CR-258%20USA%20v.%20Holmes/Trial%20Exh.%207098/Trial%20Exh.%207098%20Email.pdf"&gt;trotted out a slideshow from 2010&lt;/a&gt; as proof that Theranos’ tech was real. Leach pointed out that in slide after slide, the scientist author wrote in the future tense. It was about the tech’s &lt;em&gt;potential.&lt;/em&gt; In the slideshow, there was discussion of “candidate technologies,” with lots of “TBDs.” That meant “to be determined,” Holmes confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="4veDvg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The device it described does not exist&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dK3sQP"&gt;“There was still work to be done,” Holmes conceded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IKVPTk"&gt;Similarly, Theranos’ patents were the subject of much discussion by Holmes’ defense. But patents are not the same thing as working devices, Leach pointed out. He then pulled up Holmes’ very first patent. The device it described does not exist. “Not yet,” Holmes said, laughing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NnhFSy"&gt;The defense had also pointed out that Theranos &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; published peer-reviewed work about its systems. Leach responded by asking Holmes to read the dates on the papers. All of them had been submitted in 2017 — and therefore couldn’t have influenced her state of mind during the period the government says that fraud was committed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="S1GDUQ"&gt;Exit interview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="sIPeTi"&gt;Leach pointed out that Holmes had been kept in the loop about how badly the regulators’  inspection of Theranos’ lab was going by Balwani over text. He also showed an email that gave a schedule for Holmes, who had taken a flight to Florida to receive an award on the first day of the inspection. (The schedule noted that Holmes had to be physically present at a lunch to get the award.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="0PJrz7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Holmes seemed amused on the stand&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Gzdz6u"&gt;The inspectors did an exit interview with Theranos before they left. Holmes was there. Leach asked if Holmes was told that the lab would be found to be putting patients’ health in immediate jeopardy, which Holmes staunchly denied. She was shown a document the rest of the court didn’t see — and said it didn’t refresh her memory. Holmes said she thought she was talking with inspectors about what Theranos had done properly. It wasn’t entirely clear what the point of this line of questioning was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g7tpWO"&gt;And with that, the cross-examination sputtered to a halt. Holmes seemed amused on the stand, often smiling or laughing at Leach. Maybe she sensed she had the upper hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ryeDMf"&gt;Here’s the thing about stories: people remember them. They form an organizing backbone for facts, making the facts more memorable. Holmes’ defense made an emotional case with a narrative throughline — easy to remember. But Leach’s inept response didn’t give the jury another narrative to counter that, and it certainly didn’t pack the emotional punch of Holmes’ direct testimony. Leaving the court, I had the distinct sense that the prosecution had botched a prime opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="xWG24y"&gt;Holmes’ attorneys will have a chance to ask her more questions tomorrow, potentially poking more holes in the government’s case and reinforcing their own narrative. After she leaves the stand, there’s very little left to hear — Holmes’ defense has been coy about whether they will call another witness. They may not have to.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter’s new CEO wants the company to move a lot faster</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_MrWBQLA85uTU0O8Xdpii5WUg54=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70242324/acastro_211129_4896_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Parag Agrawal | Photo Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7xZAaG"&gt;The new CEO of Twitter, Parag Agrawal, has a clear message: expect the social network to move a lot faster than it has in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zhvRgB"&gt;In his first public appearance since taking the reins of Twitter from co-founder Jack Dorsey, Agrawal says his top priority is “improving our execution” and streamlining how Twitter operates. His comments, made at the Barclays technology conference, come after activist investor Elliott Management shook up Twitter’s board of directors last year and pressured Dorsey to step down from his part-time CEO role. Dorsey remains the CEO of Block (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22812752/square-changing-name-block-jack-dorsey-cash-app-tidal-crypto-spiral"&gt;formally called Square&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UoBMEO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I believe we have set them up so they can really move fast”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FAHZHd"&gt;Despite being Twitter’s CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807651/jack-dorsey-steps-down-twitter-ceo-parag-agrawal-replacement"&gt;for only nine days&lt;/a&gt;, Agrawal has already made big changes to its upper ranks. He &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22816362/twitter-reoganization-consumer-revenue-tech-dantley-davis-parag-agrawal"&gt;reorganized the company last Friday&lt;/a&gt; under the key pillars of Consumer, Revenue, and Core Tech, with a general manager running each division. “I believe we have set them up so they can really move fast,” he now says. As part of the change, two executives who previously reported to Dorsey — engineering lead Michael Montano and Dantley Davis, the head of design and research — plan to leave at the end of December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ijs59d"&gt;“We were operating previously in a functional structure where we had a single engineering organization, a single design research organization, and product teams that were matrixed into them,” Agrawal says, implying that the setup slowed the company down. Along with the three new general managers — who are Kayvon Beykpour, Bruce Falck, and Nick Caldwell — Lindsey Iannucci was named VP of Operations. “She’s going to help us improve our operational rigor in this new structure to really get us to faster decision making, clearer ownership, increased accountability, improved operations, which will result in faster execution overall and better results,” according to Agrawal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FYMPms"&gt;His focus on speed was a reoccurring theme throughout the roughly 30-minute interview. He explained how, in his &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22808756/twitter-ceo-parag-agrawal-jack-dorsey-bluesky-moderation"&gt;previous role as chief technology officer&lt;/a&gt;, he focused on rebuilding the company’s aged technical stack so that products could be shipped faster. He admitted there has been “slow decision making because of so much coordination that needed to happen” between teams to get changes out the door. His comments amounted to a direct acknowledgment that Twitter hasn’t met expectations from investors since it went public, and that the company has been slow to address shifts in user behavior over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Mf5jfb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The opportunity around DMs is really key”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J60DUZ"&gt;When asked about Twitter’s just-announced acquisition &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822184/twitter-quill-messaging-platform-dms-slack"&gt;of the messaging app Quill&lt;/a&gt;, Agrawal called direct messages “a key product bet” — a refreshing sentiment given that DMs have been woefully underdeveloped for a long time. “The opportunity around DMs is really key,” he said, adding that “it’s a way you can connect with anyone in the world and expect to hear back from them.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An Amazon server outage caused problems for Alexa, Ring, Disney Plus, and deliveries</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration an Amazon Web Services logo seen..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EVu4i0c_YWVLUdA-WvFOOWrbvps=/0x209:5000x3542/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70240006/1230840274.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HsxliB"&gt;Problems with some Amazon Web Services cloud servers are causing slow loading or failures for significant chunks of the internet. Amazon’s widespread network of data centers powers many of the things you interact with online, including this website, so as we’ve seen in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/25/21719396/amazon-web-services-aws-outage-down-internet"&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; AWS &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/28/14765042/amazon-s3-outage-causing-trouble"&gt;outage incidents&lt;/a&gt;, any problem has massive rippling effects. People started noticing problems at around 10:45AM ET, and just after 6PM ET the AWS Status showed “Many services have already recovered, however we are working towards full recovery across services.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="lI8pyl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon’s internal apps went down, too, cutting off some delivery drivers and stalling warehouse robots&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yicS6U"&gt;While some affected services that rely on AWS have been restored, the internet is still a bit slower and more unsteady than usual. The most important app impacted by the outage might be the ones that Amazon employees use. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/07/amazon-web-services-outage-causes-issues-at-disney-netflix-coinbase.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt; points out Reddit posts from Amazon Flex, warehouse, and delivery workers who say &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822736/amazon-delivery-van-atoz-app-warehouse-outage-aws"&gt;the apps that keep track of packages, tell them where to go, and generally keep your items on time went down, too&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yLyUbN"&gt;There have been reports of outages for Disney Plus and Netflix streaming, as well as games like &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Valorant.&lt;/em&gt; We also noticed some problems accessing &lt;a href="http://Amazon.com"&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt; and other Amazon products like the Alexa AI assistant, Kindle ebooks, Amazon Music, and security cameras from Ring or Wyze. The &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/"&gt;DownDetector&lt;/a&gt; list of services with simultaneous spikes in their outage reports runs off nearly any recognizable name: Tinder, Roku, Coinbase, both Cash App and Venmo, and the list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hERNiN"&gt;There were &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29473630"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/rb226w/aws_outage/"&gt;network admins&lt;/a&gt; everywhere about errors connecting to Amazon’s instances and the AWS Management Console that controls their access to the servers. After about an hour of problems, Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://status.aws.amazon.com/"&gt;official status page&lt;/a&gt; added an update with messages confirming the outage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="KjgLO8"&gt;[11:26 AM PST] We are seeing impact to multiple AWS APIs in the US-EAST-1 Region. This issue is also affecting some of our monitoring and incident response tooling, which is delaying our ability to provide updates. Services impacted include: EC2, Connect, DynamoDB, Glue, Athena, Timestream, and Chime and other AWS Services in US-EAST-1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYGg42"&gt;The root cause of this issue is an impairment of several network devices in the US-EAST-1 Region. We are pursuing multiple mitigation paths in parallel, and have seen some signs of recovery, but we do not have an ETA for full recovery at this time. Root logins for consoles in all AWS regions are affected by this issue, however customers can login to consoles other than US-EAST-1 by using an IAM role for authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xyKq2j"&gt;With the problems coming from the US-EAST-1 AWS region in Virginia, users elsewhere may not have seen as many issues, and even if you were affected, it could manifest as slightly slower loading while the network rerouted your requests somewhere else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vlT80z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 7th, 3:41PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information about impacts for warehouse and delivery workers, and most recent status message.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A6l0P7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 7th, 7:20PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information about impacts for warehouse and delivery workers, and most recent status message.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft rolls out Notepad with dark mode for Windows 11 Insiders</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3Y9IMJA21J8zOF92R5iRMZ9dNps=/0x0:1419x946/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70242234/NotepadDarkFindReplace.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LDDPta"&gt;Microsoft is testing &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/12/07/redesigned-notepad-for-windows-11-begins-rolling-out-to-windows-insiders/"&gt;a redesign of its venerable Notepad app&lt;/a&gt;, adding some welcomed modern features like a dark mode, a better search / find and replace interface, better undoing, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KO7btm"&gt;While the visual updates like the addition of dark mode, updated right-click menu, and Windows’ &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/style/mica"&gt;new theme-adopting material&lt;/a&gt; are nice, the functional updates will probably be the biggest upgrade to anyone who actually writes in Notepad. In the current version of the app that ships with Windows 11, the text search tool and the find and replace tool are two different pop-up windows, accessed by two different keyboard shortcuts. The redesign combines them into one floating bar instead of something that looks like it’s from the XP era. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BdlH6lCr_XVOR8G-ZezEfL-WBP0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23071497/Find_replace.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Find and Replace still has some quirks in the preview (like not automatically wrapping), but it’s definitely a more modern experience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CzaOyx"&gt;Microsoft also says it’s adding multi-step undo, which replaces the old version’s undo system that only lets you go back one step. It still doesn’t work like you might expect a modern app to, letting you hit Ctrl-Z to delete one word at a time, but it clearly has more memory than the old version of Notepad.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RIK8daT8NqQRC0Oy5gJwH7mqUKM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23071477/Untitled_Project.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notepad’s new undo system is an improvement, but it’d be hard to call it modern.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mglB2w"&gt;Another unfortunate thing about the preview is that Word Wrap is still off by default. It’s got a new home in the View menu, though — and with the Font button going to the Edit dropdown, the old Notepad’s “Format” menu is no more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yV94Sq"&gt;It seems like Microsoft is focused on smaller updates to make Notepad feel less like a relic, rather than stuffing it full of new features and turning it into an entirely different app. That seems like the right move to me, given the existence of Notepads’ perhaps &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPad"&gt;lesser-known sibling WordPad&lt;/a&gt;, which is closer to Microsoft Word than a plaintext editor. (WordPad also lets you view and edit .docx files, unlike even the new version of NotePad.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4EjpyF"&gt;The Notepad redesign should be available for Windows 11 Insiders using the Dev channel. If you’re running the test version of the OS and don’t see it, you may want to check for an update in the Microsoft Store. Everyone else will likely have to wait a little bit to get it, but it’s nice to see Microsoft continue the trend of updating some of its built-in apps like Notepad, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679132/microsoft-windows-11-new-photos-app-design-features"&gt;Photos&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22631442/microsoft-windows-11-paint-redesign-update-app"&gt;Paint&lt;/a&gt; alongside its bigger products like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22814069/microsoft-new-office-ui-rounded-available-now"&gt;Office&lt;/a&gt; and, of course, Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
