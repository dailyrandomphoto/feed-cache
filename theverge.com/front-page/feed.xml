    <title>This picture of cheese helped send a man to prison for 13 years</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bZO26ruaI5PLi7l1j-2CQrhVoqc=/0x333:1080x1053/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69334374/stewart1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Police analyzed the palm and fingerprints in the photo to identify the suspect.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Merseyside Police&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t3TwWH"&gt;It’s generally a good idea to be careful about the photos you share online. Share a photo of your vaccination card, for example, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/6/22270400/coronavirus-vaccine-card-selfie-social-media"&gt;you risk revealing your full name and date of birth&lt;/a&gt;, which opens you up to the possibility of identity theft. But you might want to be &lt;em&gt;even more&lt;/em&gt; careful if you’re a drug dealer involved in selling heroin and cocaine. Even an innocent picture of a block of cheese can contain enough personal information to help convict you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q0wULb"&gt;We’ve got the &lt;a href="https://www.merseyside.police.uk/news/merseyside/news/2021/may/liverpool-man-latest-to-be-jailed-as-part-of-national-operation-venetic/"&gt;UK’s Merseyside Police&lt;/a&gt; to thank for the worrying revelation, the &lt;a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/block-stilton-cheese-downfall-encrochat-20654184"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Liverpool Echo &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, after they successfully identified drug dealer Carl Stewart (39, of Gem Street, Liverpool) and convicted him of conspiracy to supply cocaine, heroin, MDMA, and ketamine with the help of a simple photo of a wedge of stilton. It’s not clear why he posted the pic of blue cheese, but Stewart has now been sentenced to 13 years and six months in prison after pleading guilty to the charges, which also included transferring criminal property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="K6R88g"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;JAILED |  A man identified through a picture of a block of cheese is the latest to be jailed as part of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OpVenetic?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#OpVenetic&lt;/a&gt;. Carl Stewart, 39, was sentenced to 13 &amp;amp; a half yrs in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply class A and B drugs.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="myagds"&gt;Stewart seems to have made two errors in sharing his cheesy photo. The first is that the photo contained a clear image of his fingerprints and palm, which Merseyside Police were able to analyze and use to identify him. Stewart isn’t &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/16/17242204/whatsapp-drug-dealer-caught-fingerprints-photo-message-wales-police"&gt;the first criminal&lt;/a&gt; to have been convicted thanks to fingerprints identified from a photo, but it’s yet another reminder that your fingerprints &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/2/11540962/iphone-samsung-fingerprint-duplicate-hack-security"&gt;are far from the top-secret identifiers&lt;/a&gt; we often consider them to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ocSb7"&gt;Second is that he shared the photo on EncroChat, the supposedly encrypted phone system that was compromised by authorities &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/2/21311306/encrochat-arrests-criminals-police-hacking-uk-europe-encrypted-chat"&gt;last March&lt;/a&gt;, leaving its security with more holes than swiss cheese. Since then, Merseyside Police says authorities have identified around 10,000 of its users in the UK, who are “all involved in coordinating and planning the supply and distribution of drugs and weapons, money laundering and other criminal activity.” A total of 60,000 of its users have been identified worldwide, the police said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Anker’s second-generation Nano II GaN chargers are even smaller than before</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/im0rGwrwFlLJg7SHlAFeIvAveHI=/105x0:1773x1112/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69334328/Untitled.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Anker&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vU5ZqN"&gt;Anker’s GaN (gallium nitride) chargers are some of the best around, offering tiny sizes but powerful charging capabilities. Now, the company is introducing its second-generation GaN-based chargers: the Anker Nano II lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d4r5Lw"&gt;The new Nano II chargers use what Anker calls its “GaN II” technology, the company’s second-generation version of the gallium nitride-based components, which Anker says offer a 20 percent increase in working efficiency,” which translates to less heat and even smaller chargers than before. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xL_y_FspSZMPZXESa4bdPx_Z8dY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22536114/Untitled.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Anker&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SMbWf2"&gt;Gallium nitride is an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/1/18051974/gallium-nitride-anker-material-silicon-semiconductor-energy"&gt;increasingly popular replacement&lt;/a&gt; for silicon components in electrical devices, thanks to a wider band gap than silicon. That means it can sustain higher voltages at higher temperatures with faster electrical current than the traditional material. Those properties make it perfect for things like ultra-small chargers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="pTpVra"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Gallium nitride is the silicon of the future","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/1/18051974/gallium-nitride-anker-material-silicon-semiconductor-energy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="B8mUUg"&gt;The original Anker PowerPort Atom PD 1 helped usher in the first wave of GaN chargers when it was first released in 2019, packing enough power to charge a small laptop in a brick the size of Apple’s now-defunct (but laughably underpowered) 5W iPhone bricks. Since then, we’ve seen ultra-small GaN chargers offer even more powerful wattage specs: it’s easy and affordable to get a 65W brick that can power a decent-sized computer that fits in your pocket now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DMrzXH"&gt;The new Nano II chargers will come in three models: a 30W model for $29.99, a 45W charger for $35.99, and a 65W for $39.99. All three chargers feature a single USB-C port (with the larger 45W and 65W models also featuring flip-down plugs) and come with Anker’s PowerIQ 3.0 technology for managing charging wattages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vGHb1c"&gt;The 30W is the smallest of the bunch, measuring in at 1.24 x 1.20 x 1.49 inches — making it marginally smaller than the original 30W PowerPort Atom PD 1, which is 1.6 x 1.4 x 1.5 inches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PanZaO"&gt;The three chargers are available to preorder from both Amazon and Anker’s website, and they will ship in June.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to remove your account from someone else’s Twitter list</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Twitter" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U9AbA_-dJBSbg29m08gKeb6OE9Q=/137x0:763x417/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69334265/Twitter-block.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8pabmq"&gt;Twitter lists can be a wonderful resource: they can help you categorize different companies, track what’s happening with your friends or family, follow accounts that you enjoy, or keep up with news sources you like to follow. And being on others’ Twitter lists can help amplify your own tweets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pCfj7W"&gt;However, occasionally, you could find yourself on a Twitter list that you’d rather not be associated with. Perhaps somebody misread one of your tweets and thought that you agreed with a certain point of view — and you don’t. Or it could happen that somebody who disagrees with you puts you on a list in order to target you for harassment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mWGRwF"&gt;Journalist &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/twcarey"&gt;Theresa W. Carey&lt;/a&gt; has suggested that it’s a good idea to check your Twitter account regularly to make sure you’re not on any lists that you’d rather not appear on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fcfd5i"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;They don’t make it easy to check which lists you’re on. On the “Lists” page, there are 3 little dots in the top right corner. Click/tap on those and you’ll see “Lists I’m On.” Tap that and see if you’re on any lists that you would rather NOT be on. I do that at least weekly. &lt;a href="https://t.co/dE0F4xcZEe"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dE0F4xcZEe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Theresa W. Carey (@twcarey) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/twcarey/status/1396225791357161474?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DON9It"&gt;As Carey explains, this is how it’s possible to check which lists you’re on. (These instructions are for the web version of Twitter.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="mZcUfV"&gt;Click on the “Lists” icon to the left of your feed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="x7W92J"&gt;You’re now on the Lists page, where you’ll find all of your lists. Click on the three dots in the upper-right corner, and click on “Lists you’re on.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="bx9mS4"&gt;Now you can see which lists you are on; the most recent should be on top.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can see which Twitter lists you’re on" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y4H1iPQO_1TTMWo1mUH5_Ia_9a8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22535915/Screen_Shot_2021_05_24_at_9.48.13_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can see which Twitter lists you’re on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="itG3GM"&gt;If you find that you are on a list you’d rather not be on, you can get off that list by blocking (temporarily or permanently) the person who created the list. Here’s how to do that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="32Gjb5"&gt;Use the method above to find the list you don’t want to be on. Select the account name of the list creator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eEUhcQ"&gt;You’ll now be on that person’s profile page. Click on the three dots to the right of their image, select “Block &amp;lt;person’s account&amp;gt;” and confirm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="If you block an account (temporarily or permanently), you’ll be removed from its lists" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x_ySXPjoMwud8MrjLlfEj4sIow8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22535905/Screen_Shot_2021_05_24_at_9.48.38_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you block an account (temporarily or permanently), you’ll be removed from its lists.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="clrt3M"&gt;You’ll now be blocking that account and will have removed your name from any lists created using that account &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="i9yYtp"&gt;If you don’t want to actually block that person permanently, you can then immediately click “Unblock” (which you’ll see if you hover your cursor over the button that says “Blocked”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can unblock the account by hovering over the “Blocked” button (which will then say “Unblock”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bD1aYhrHtO46dh9WEH2-Z0LZ_Ps=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22535971/Screen_Shot_2021_05_24_at_9.49.25_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can unblock the account by hovering over the “Blocked” button (which will then say “Unblock”).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FcpZLJ"&gt;Of course, if you haven’t permanently blocked that account, they could always put you back on their list — or you may show up on somebody else’s. So it’s a good idea to check every once in a while and see which lists your Twitter account is on.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo’s Tab P11 Pro is great for watching movies, not doing work</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;OLED screen movie machine&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="HvAhNa"&gt;Lenovo’s Tab P11 Pro is the company’s top-tier Android tablet. With an 11-inch OLED screen, quad speakers, and snap-on keyboard, it’s meant to go head to head with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21444688/samsung-galaxy-tab-s7-plus-review"&gt;Samsung’s Tab S7&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"&gt;Apple’s iPad Air&lt;/a&gt;. But while the Tab P11 Pro is excellent for watching movies — that OLED screen and the Dolby Atmos speakers are quite nice — it’s considerably less impressive when you attempt to use it for productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y7iyuL"&gt;Pricing for the Tab P11 Pro is aggressive, particularly when you add up everything you get. The list price for a base model with 128GB of storage and 4GB of RAM is $499.99, but thanks to Lenovo’s frequent discounts, you can buy one for $375 right now. The model I’ve been testing has 6GB of RAM and comes with a detachable keyboard and active stylus pen in the box. That one’s list price is $599.99, but it’s currently discounted to $460 on Lenovo’s site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="P9iQIA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10515973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9lUNUh"&gt;Considering the similarly sized &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"&gt;iPad Air &lt;em&gt;starts&lt;/em&gt; at $599&lt;/a&gt; before you add a pen or keyboard to it, the Lenovo has a lot of value on its side. No matter which model you opt for, you get the same 11-inch 2560 x 1600 OLED screen; Qualcomm Snapdragon 730G processor; quad JBL speakers with Dolby Atmos tuning; 128GB of storage with the ability to expand it with a microSD card; and premium aluminum unibody design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uv8Eic"&gt;The screen and speakers are really the stars of the show here. The OLED panel is not as bright as you can get on an iPad, so it isn’t as good in direct sunlight. But in almost every other scenario, including outdoors in the shade, it looks fantastic. Colors are rich, blacks are deep and inky, and the resolution is sharp. It provides a great experience for watching movies or any video, really.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2Aioz_bSovLL0TfYRwE5zJgjUTQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22397573/dseifert_20210321_4484_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The P11 Pro’s OLED screen looks great, and the quad speakers sound fantastic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tAmFEG"&gt;Similarly, the quad speakers are loud, punchy, and immersive. The Tab P11 Pro’s speakers outclass the iPad Air’s dual speakers and easily hang with the excellent sound system on Apple’s higher-end iPad Pro. Unfortunately, Lenovo is taking the same route as Apple and omitting a headphone jack, so you have the option of using a USB-C dongle (not included) or wireless headphones for personal audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q3905F"&gt;Combined, the OLED screen and quad speakers provide the best movie-watching experience on a tablet anywhere near this price. To get something better, you’re going to have to pay a lot more money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1oRcq2"&gt;But Lenovo isn’t pitching this as just a couch potato tablet — it’s following Apple and Samsung’s lead in presenting the P11 Pro as a tablet that you can also get work done on. And that’s where the P11 Pro falls on its face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TkxgQl"&gt;Starting with the keyboard and pen accessories that are included with the top-end bundle, there’s as much to dislike as there is to like. The snap-on keyboard has a nice fabric cover and comes in two pieces: a back cover with a built-in kickstand that attaches via magnets and the keyboard itself that communicates with the tablet through pogo pins on the bottom edge of the P11 Pro. It’s a similar design to what Samsung uses on the Tab S7 line, and I like the flexibility it affords. I can use just the back cover to prop the tablet up for movie watching without having to have the keyboard in the way all the time. It’s great to have this flexibility when you’re using the tablet on a cramped airplane tray table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3tw_gxrxMwQAuqjiXp4AxDzMKCo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22397574/dseifert_20210321_4484_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The detachable keyboard has a cramped layout and no backlighting, but it works in a pinch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gwsc22oHhqLP7T8TC-X5y2nThOY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22397577/dseifert_20210321_4484_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The included stylus has many levels of pressure sensitivity, but it doesn’t attach to or charge from the tablet like Apple or Samsung’s pens.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OaOATF"&gt;Unfortunately, the typing experience on the keyboard itself leaves a bit to be desired. The layout is as cramped as expected with an 11-inch tablet, and there’s no backlighting available. The trackpad is small and has palm rejection issues — even just using the keyboard to write this relatively short draft was an exercise in patience, as my cursor would randomly jump around any time my left hand brushed against the trackpad as I typed. There’s also very little software support; I can’t adjust the scrolling direction on the trackpad as I can do with a laptop or other tablets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QlyK2d"&gt;The bundled stylus is nice to have, but it, too, falls behind the competition. It has many levels of pressure sensitivity, and it writes smoothly enough for my basic note-taking needs. But it doesn’t charge on the back or side of the tablet like Apple or Samsung’s pens (you instead need to plug it in via a USB-C port on its end), and there’s nowhere to safely store it on the tablet. Lenovo includes a rubbery holster for the pen that you’re supposed to stick to the back of the P11’s case with adhesive. But the adhesive is weak, and the pen holder falls off very easily. It all just feels like an afterthought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6MiS92"&gt;Similarly, the software support for the pen is weak. Lenovo includes the Squid notes app (the basic free version, not the full version) for jotting down notes, and you can download many other options from the Play Store. But the pen doesn’t integrate into the system like it does on Apple or Samsung tablets. You can’t use the pen to take quick notes from the lock screen or easily capture screenshots and mark them up like you can on the iPad Air or Tab S7.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vFY3reW2VhxfCiFzT3aOUy4hqko=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22397575/dseifert_20210321_4484_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The P11 Pro’s “productivity mode” leaves a lot to be desired.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SMoUZy"&gt;When you attach the keyboard to the tablet, Lenovo’s custom productivity mode launches. This is designed to provide a desktop-like interface, similar to Samsung’s DeX feature. But it’s a mess: few apps can be launched full-screen with it, and every app opens in a tiny, windowed box that you have to resize each time. I was able to successfully create a split-screen between a Google Doc and another window, such as Slack or the browser. But in general, the productivity mode feels like a tacked-on afterthought, just like the pen, and really isn’t a great experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VqACP0"&gt;Elsewhere, the software is standard Android (version 10; there’s no update to Android 11 as of the date of this review, though the P11 Pro does have the latest security patch available), which works best when you’re watching a full-screen video or playing a game, and doesn’t have as many tablet-oriented apps as iPadOS. The Snapdragon 730 processor isn’t as powerful as you get in Apple or Samsung’s tablets, but it’s not really a bottleneck here. You’ll be limited by the lack of tablet-optimized apps way before you hit the performance ceiling of the chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hxoL7j"&gt;In all, the Tab P11 Pro is the tablet to get if you are looking for an excellent movie watching experience and don’t want to spend more than $400. You won’t find a better display or speakers for this price. I’d personally skip the pen and keyboard bundle entirely (even though that does mean you give up the handy back cover and its kickstand) and just use this tablet for what it does best: entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft has turned the Surface Duo into a handheld Xbox</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JQIzbDJ2HmBCYeUkutdAjfrjR-s=/9x0:2631x1748/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69334072/xboxsurfaceduo_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xbox games on the Surface Duo.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZE94wk"&gt;Microsoft teased the potential for an Xbox handheld-like experience with the Surface Duo during its unveiling nearly two years ago, and it’s finally appearing today. Microsoft is updating its Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud) app for Android, and it includes dual-screen support for the Surface Duo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vuYkeD"&gt;The app update allows Surface Duo owners to use a virtual gamepad on one screen of their device and games on the other. It makes the Surface Duo look more like a Nintendo 3DS than a mobile phone, with touch controls for a variety of games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SF2VPu"&gt;Microsoft has been steadily adding Xbox Touch Controls to more than 50 games in recent months, including titles like &lt;em&gt;Sea of Thieves&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Gears 5&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Minecraft Dungeons&lt;/em&gt;. The full list of touch-compatible games is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-game-pass%2Fgames%3Focid%3DXGP_soc_omc_xbo_tw_Photo_lrn_5.18.2%23&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F24%2F22450941%2Fmicrosoft-surface-duo-xbox-mobile-xcloud-cloud-gaming-dual-screen" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available here&lt;/a&gt;, and you can of course just use a regular Bluetooth or Xbox controller to stream games to the Surface Duo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GRolEx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Microsoft is turning its Surface Duo into a handheld Xbox today. The latest app update for Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud) let’s you use one screen for touch controls and the other for the game. It’s like a Nintendo 3DS with Xbox games. Details here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/ubbsEAW3r8"&gt;https://t.co/ubbsEAW3r8&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/aP94t9xgzC"&gt;pic.twitter.com/aP94t9xgzC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1396844670077054979?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZDLIQ6"&gt;The benefits of a dual-screen device for this type of mobile experience are obvious. You no longer have touch controls over the top of the game, and your thumbs don’t get in the way of seeing important action on-screen. If dual-screen or foldable devices ever catch on, this is a far superior way to play Xbox games without a dedicated controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0oA2Us"&gt;Microsoft has also tweaked the rest of the Xbox Cloud Gaming to work better on the Surface Duo. Improvements include making it easier to view content, move through menus, and the addition of columned layouts. The updated app is available now in &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamepass"&gt;Google Play Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best gaming laptops in 2021: seven laptops to get your game on</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Gaming Laptops 2021: Asus ROG Zephyrus G15" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dFgjUrUVReawUz4BcRUID8XTWDI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68856650/akrales_210226_4440_0019.9.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our top picks from Asus, MSI, Razer, and more.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales/ The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best gaming laptop at every size and price&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ow4mCb"&gt;The best gaming laptops are changing every year. The early days of mobile gaming were largely desktop replacements — clunky chassis, multiple power bricks, and RGB lighting galore. But the top gaming laptops now are different. Manufacturers are finally putting powerful specs in sleeker, more portable, and more professional builds. They have excellent, fast refreshing screens that are necessary for a great gaming experience. These laptops aren’t just great for gaming, but for everyday work as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qiHviH"&gt;Our pick for the best gaming laptop of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt;. It can handle the most demanding games on the market today and also makes a great daily driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VRi2QJ"&gt;We’ll be updating this page regularly as new best gaming laptops hit shelves throughout this year. Some exciting updates are on the way. AMD and Nvidia have announced their next-gen series of mobile processors and mobile graphics cards — the Ryzen 5000 series and the GeForce RTX 3000 series, respectively — and we’re already seeing them in premium gaming laptops across manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGRnFN"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22217171/gaming-laptops-qhd-screens-display-fast-refresh-rate"&gt;QHD screen&lt;/a&gt; is another feature to watch for in the best gaming laptops. A growing number of manufacturers are releasing configurations with 1440p displays, even in gaming laptops under $2,000. These options can hit a sweet spot for many gamers: a better experience than 1080p without the price premium or raw horsepower required for a 4K display. You can expect decently high refresh rates from these panels as well, depending on the model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5KtNO"&gt;One more thing to keep in mind with the best gaming laptops is the power you can expect. Not all chips with the same name are created equal — the RTX 3070 in one laptop may not deliver the same frame rates as the RTX 3070 in another laptop due to its wattage (as well as other factors like the processor and cooling). Nvidia now requires companies to disclose clock speeds and graphics power on each model’s product page, but plenty of manufacturers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266921/nvidia-requiring-companies-share-clock-speed-power-gaming-laptop-rtx-30-series-gpu-specs"&gt;haven’t done that yet&lt;/a&gt;. Your best bet, if you can’t find those numbers on a company’s website, is to read some reviews and make sure the model you’re considering will deliver the frame rates you’re looking for. We will note the wattage used in any laptops we review with the new RTX graphics cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1WSZi"&gt;If you’re looking for a more multipurpose device, check out our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptop&lt;/a&gt; page. If you’re an Android gamer, we’ve also got a list of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"&gt;best Chromebooks&lt;/a&gt; you can buy.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus ROG Zephyrus G15 is the best gaming laptop of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oTToOm"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best gaming laptop of 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="dqOSgQ"&gt;Asus’s ROG Zephyrus G14 was our top gaming laptop pick for quite a while. It did just about everything right, and we weren’t sure whether Asus could ever replicate its resounding success. But somehow, the company managed to make the G14 just a bit bigger, and a heck of a lot better. In doing so, it’s created the ROG Zephyrus G15, the best 15-inch rig you can buy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsXGzm"&gt;At just over four pounds, the Zephyrus G15 is one of the lightest 15-inch gaming laptops you can buy. But you’re not making any compromises on performance for that portability: it’s powered by the top mobile chips that AMD and Nvidia have to offer, and includes a fast 165Hz QHD (1440p) display. Together, those components can handle even the toughest AAA titles at QHD resolution. The panel has excellent color reproduction as well, so your games will look great. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HMlhzT"&gt;But it’s not just the gaming; almost everything else about the G15 is great, too. The audio (pumped from a six-speaker array) has strong percussion and bass, the keyboard and touchpad have a satisfying click, the port selection leaves little to be desired, and the battery can last for a whopping eight and a half hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MktsFD"&gt;The G15 won’t be the laptop for everyone. There’s no webcam, which is a significant oversight, and some may prefer something more affordable, or with a flashier aesthetic. But as a package, the G15 is the one to beat. Not only is it the best gaming laptop you can buy, but it’s also one of the best laptops you can buy, period. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 is the best gaming laptop of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gXl1tL"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ibDYbq"&gt;The best gaming laptop in a 14-inch chassis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PjVXGI"&gt;The ROG Zephyrus G14 is the best 14-inch gaming laptop you can buy. We most recently reviewed last year’s model, which includes AMD’s Ryzen 4000 series up to the eight-core Ryzen 9 4900HS and an Nvidia RTX 2060 GPU. There’s a brand-new model out featuring the Ryzen 5000 series and Nvidia’s RTX 30-series graphics, which we’re looking forward to getting our hands on ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZvmPMM"&gt;For well under $2,000, the Zephyrus crams one of the most powerful mobile processors on the market into a super portable 14-inch chassis. With capable cooling to boot, the laptop delivers frame rates we’ve never seen in a laptop of this size before. It handled every game we threw at it without breaking a sweat.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LRoiIm"&gt;But aside from its excellent gaming performance, the G14 makes a great daily driver. The keyboard, touchpad, display, and port selection are all excellent. Even the battery life is good — something we almost never get to say about gaming laptops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0yypId"&gt;There are a few downsides to the G14, but they’re fairly small and user-dependent. The most significant note is that it lacks a webcam; you’ll need an external one if you plan on taking video calls. There’s also some bleed in the backlighting, there’s no Thunderbolt connectivity (since it’s an AMD system, and that’s an Intel standard), and the fans can get louder than most under load. But these are very much nitpicks that won’t have a large impact on plenty of people’s gaming experience. Overall, we have very few complaints. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yzdsDK"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21405760/razer-blade-pro-17-2020-review"&gt;Razer Blade Pro 17&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="jT5h16"&gt;The best big-screen gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E8Fdz3"&gt;The Blade Pro 17 delivers some of the best gaming performance you can find in a laptop — but that’s not even its superpower. What makes Razer’s 17-inch flagship so impressive is it packs that unbelievable power into a thin and attractive chassis. It’s just 0.8 inches thick and only requires one charging brick — so you can carry it around in a backpack or briefcase without compromising on power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jaBYbX"&gt;Gaming enthusiasts can opt for a model with a 300Hz screen — the highest refresh rate you can get on a laptop — while folks who want to combine gaming with some creative work can opt for a 120Hz touchscreen configuration. Both models come with a customizable per-key RGB keyboard, which adds a touch of color to the Pro’s design without being too obnoxious for the office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsGaDN"&gt;The Blade Pro 17 certainly isn’t cheap, but it’s the laptop to buy if you want the best of the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DMtcRV"&gt;The best budget gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="hCCjrZ"&gt;The Dell G5 15 SE offers a great gaming experience at a price range far below that of many competitors. It’s the best gaming laptop you can buy under $1,000, and it doesn’t ask too many compromises for that price. While it only comes with a 60Hz screen, the hardware inside (especially AMD’s Ryzen 7 processor) is capable of maxing that out on all kinds of demanding games at native 1080p resolution, so you can reliably expect a playable experience from your favorite titles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q6ozmE"&gt;We’re also impressed by the G5’s connectivity. It includes a Mini DisplayPort, an HDMI, and an Ethernet jack — all ports you don’t see every day on laptops at this price point. Overall, if you’re looking for great value for your money, the G5 is your best bet. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer Blade 15 is the 15-inch gaming laptop to beat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="wzRw2D"&gt;A great thin and light gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="EcPuJg"&gt;The Blade 15 isn’t as powerful as its 17-inch sibling, but it may be a more pragmatic purchase for many people. If you’re looking for a balanced combination of performance and portability, the Blade 15 may hit that sweet spot. It still packs the top chips on the market and can come with a 300Hz display, but at just 4.7 pounds and 0.7 inches thick, it’s comparable in size to a number of 15-inch productivity machines like the Dell XPS 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w8vpQe"&gt;In addition to its reliable gaming performance, the Blade 15 works well as a productivity machine. We’re big fans of its keyboard, which is quite comfortable to use and has per-key RGB lighting, and the touchpad, which is roomy with a satisfying click. Our primary complaint is that this Blade got quite hot during our game testing — not only did the processor reach 99 degrees, but the hinge and palm rests were uncomfortable to touch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="7lPrCK"&gt;The best laptop with flashy RGB&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="SK7elL"&gt;If you’re looking for a “traditional” premium gaming laptop with colorful, flashy panache, the ROG Strix Scar 15 is for you. The Strix’s keyboard isn’t just one of the most comfortable that we’ve ever tested on a gaming laptop; it also has some of the coolest per-key RGB lighting we’ve ever seen with all kinds of effects. There’s also a colorful light strip wrapped around the front of the deck (customizable as well) and a colorful glowing logo on the lid. In short: if you use this in public, people will notice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZuwqX"&gt;Of course, the Strix is great on the inside as well, delivering some of the best frame rates you’ll find from a 15-inch laptop with Intel’s and Nvidia’s top chips. You’ll get the full benefit of their power with a 300Hz screen option as well. And the Strix comes preloaded with various programs to help customize your gaming experience. You can personalize color profiles, bandwidth allocation, and more based on the type of game you’re playing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="SH9RLt"&gt;If money and desk space are no objects for you, you might be interested in the Alienware Area-51m. This hefty rig is essentially a desktop in laptop form. It pairs a desktop-class processor and a full-power mobile GPU with a 17-inch display and a full-size keyboard, delivering true desktop performance in a chassis that’s still (technically) portable. PC enthusiasts will also appreciate that you can update many of the components yourself, including the processor, RAM, and storage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="YDSZZF"&gt;A sturdy 13-inch gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="8Da3D3"&gt;The Blade Stealth 13 is far from the most powerful gaming rig out there, but it is one of very few gaming systems that come in a 13-inch chassis. The Stealth can run AAA titles at native resolution and comes with a 120Hz screen, but it’s comparable in size and weight to a MacBook Pro. Use it in a meeting or a classroom, and passing observers may have no idea it’s a gaming laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xdg8S1"&gt;In addition to its powerful chips, the Stealth comes with a colorful keyboard, a sturdy build, and a decent webcam. Even the battery life is pretty good. If you’re looking for a laptop that’s small but mighty, the Stealth will get the job done as a gaming rig and productivity machine in one. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T CEO John Stankey says it was ‘time to unleash’ WarnerMedia assets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/keerova78wvOEK4_45X2nqNjxwU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69333921/acastro_180322_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ng1etn"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T CEO John Stankey said Monday that the company’s focus on its connectivity business in the US meant it didn’t have the global reach to grow a global streaming business with WarnerMedia, and the company decided it was “time to unleash the media assets” of WarnerMedia to Discovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BnvHOq"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439964/at-t-warnermedia-discovery-merger-spin-off"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T announced on May 17th&lt;/a&gt; that it would spin off its WarnerMedia business to merge it with TV company Discovery. The resulting entity, which has yet to be named and is still awaiting regulatory approval, will be a competitor in the cable space and for streaming content giants like Netflix and Disney; WarnerMedia owns HBO, CNN, Cartoon Network, TBS, TNT, and the Warner Bros. movie studio, while Discovery has a number of channels that focus more on reality TV, including HGTV, Animal Planet, Food Network, and TLC. Each also has its own streaming platform in HBO Max and Discovery Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QNqL7r"&gt;“What’s become clear is that the opportunity for direct relationships with customers is truly going to be a global opportunity,” Stankey said of the streaming sector. “As a result of that, when you look at the opportunity to grow a fantastic subscriber base we kind of looked at this and said, ‘it’s time to unleash the media assets to go and seize a multi-hundred-billion-dollar opportunity.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3T019"&gt;Streaming is “a little bit of a different shareholder base and management base than what we’d typically have” as part of AT&amp;amp;T’s more traditional lines of business, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="osveBA"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/23/business/dealbook/att-agrees-to-buy-time-warner-for-more-than-80-billion.html"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T acquired WarnerMedia&lt;/a&gt; (which was known as TimeWarner at the time) in 2016 for $85.4 billion. The deal was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/14/17466518/att-time-warner-acquisition-closes"&gt;approved in 2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WJeOzq"&gt;Stankey made the comments during the JP Morgan Global Technology, Media and Communications Conference. He bristled slightly when interviewer John Cusick, a JP Morgan analyst, asked him about his vision for the future of AT&amp;amp;T, noting “you’ve reversed nearly six years of strategic change at AT&amp;amp;T in three months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P5sgVR"&gt;Stankey said he would “contest the characterization that we did it in three months,” adding, “We don’t wake up one day and say ‘hey today’s the day I think we ought to go find a transaction.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jkxV5p"&gt;But with less than three years from when the WarnerMedia deal was approved to the time AT&amp;amp;T decided to spin it off, the change in direction struck many as sudden, but it also seemed to make sense. Telecom companies have tried to run media businesses with limited success; earlier this month, for instance, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22416854/aol-yahoo-sale-apollo-venetian-hotel-verizon"&gt;Verizon sold AOL and Yahoo&lt;/a&gt; for less than half of what it paid a few years prior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="shdcxS"&gt;And as &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post’&lt;/em&gt;s Steven Zeitchik noted in &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/05/22/discovery-warner-media-att-spinoff/"&gt;his analysis of the deal&lt;/a&gt;, AT&amp;amp;T did little to court business in Hollywood during the time it owned WarnerMedia. The surprise announcement in December that WarnerMedia would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;release all of its 2021 theatrical movies on HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; drew widespread &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22162918/christopher-nolan-tenet-hbo-max-warner-bros-streaming-service-cinematic-releases"&gt;criticism&lt;/a&gt; from the entertainment industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GSpVQS"&gt;Still, Stankey claimed Monday that AT&amp;amp;T’s ownership of WarnerMedia helped to grow HBO Max and HBO’s linear channel to a combined &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/hbo-max-hbo-reaches-44-2-million-subscribers-4165569/"&gt;44 million US subscribers&lt;/a&gt; in the year since HBO Max launched. “I think realistically, HBO Max would not be where it is today if not for the strength of the two combined companies,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla faces a huge fine in Norway for throttling battery charging speeds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="NORWAY-AUTOMOBILE-ENVIRONMENT-TRANSPORT" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CCtiiD_k2j1CRfQsTSRuPAjFY7M=/0x0:4575x3050/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69333848/1154659512.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by JONATHAN NACKSTRAND/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3ooMkf"&gt;Tesla has been ordered to pay 136,000 kroner ($16,000) each to thousands of customers in Norway for slowing down charging speeds, &lt;a href="https://www.nettavisen.no/okonomi/tesla-domt-i-retten-risikerer-milliardutbetaling-til-norske-elbil-eiere/s/12-95-3424130203"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Nettavisen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/05/24/tesla-found-guilty-throttling-charging-speed-asked-pay-16000-thousands-owners/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C0NJsV"&gt;A 2019 software update was found to have affected the battery life in Tesla Model S vehicles manufactured between 2013 and 2015, sparking a complaint by dozens of Norwegian Tesla owners to the country’s conciliation council, according to &lt;em&gt;Nettavisen. &lt;/em&gt;As a result, customers were reporting diminished range and slower charging speeds at the company’s Supercharger network. Tesla did not file a response, and the case was decided in the plaintiffs’ favor on April 29th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BQYLnF"&gt;Tesla is ordered to pay each customer roughly $16,000 to settle the complaint. &lt;em&gt;Nettavisen&lt;/em&gt; notes that this particular Model S has been sold around 10,000 times during the period in question, making it a potentially very expensive judgment for Tesla. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tcNkuV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s unclear how the company will respond&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFXnsV"&gt;It’s unclear how the company will respond. (A spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment; Tesla dissolved its PR department last year.) The order, which was announced on May 17th, gives Tesla until May 30th to pay the fine. Otherwise, the company can file an appeal with the Oslo council. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oX6KG6"&gt;Tesla is facing similar complaints in the US, where &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-battery/tesla-owner-lawsuit-claims-software-update-fraudulently-cut-battery-capacity-idUSKCN1UY2TW"&gt;customers have filed a class action lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against the company alleging slower charging speeds in older model vehicles. The lawsuit, which was filed in Northern California federal court, alleges fraud and seeks class action status for the owners of older-generation vehicles whose range has been curtailed, some by as much as 40 miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0hlMiz"&gt;Norway is one of the largest EV markets in the world, with battery electric vehicles accounting for more than half of all cars sold in the country last year. Tesla was the top seller in the country for many years but recently was overtaken by Volkswagen. Norway uses huge tax incentives to help achieve its goal of ensuring that all new vehicles sold are zero emission by 2025. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hGpYImLxn1mkjeCF2-4_liHXrrc=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69333784/4542_Social_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sc4GAE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hNlV9E"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fPK9y3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert McDaniel’s troubles&lt;/strong&gt; began with a knock on the door. It was a weekday in mid-2013, as he made lunch in the crowded three-bedroom house where he lives with his grandmother and several of his adult siblings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V3ITVI"&gt;When he went to answer the door, McDaniel discovered not one person, but a cohort of visitors: two police officers in uniform, a neighbor working with the police, and a muscular guy in shorts and a T-shirt sporting short, graying hair. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kURm2M"&gt;Police officers weren’t a new sight for McDaniel. They often drove down his tree-lined street in the Austin neighborhood of Chicago making stops and arrests. Out of the &lt;a href="https://graphics.suntimes.com/homicides/"&gt;775 homicides tracked by the &lt;em&gt;Chicago Sun-Times&lt;/em&gt; in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, 72 of them happened in Austin. That’s almost 10 percent of the city’s murder rate, in a region that takes up just 3 percent of its total area. The City of Chicago puts out &lt;a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Gun-Crimes-Heat-Map/iinq-m3rg"&gt;a “heat map” of where gun crimes occur&lt;/a&gt;, with areas of moderate shooting numbers shaded in blue or green. Red splotches represent large numbers — and hottest concentrations — of shootings. On the map, Austin is the color of a fire engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ttRbex"&gt;Still, this visit from authorities caught McDaniel off guard: at that point in time, he had nothing remotely violent on his criminal record — just arrests for marijuana-related offenses and street gambling. And despite two officers showing up at his front door with the cohort, neither of them, nor anyone else in the cohort, accused McDaniel of breaking the law. They were not there to arrest him. No one was there to investigate a crime. They just wanted to talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRgvug"&gt;“I had no idea why these cops were here,” McDaniel says, recounting it to me years later. “I didn’t do shit to bring them here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="42naHq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;He could be the shooter, he might get shot. They didn’t know. But the data said he was at risk either way&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wISlh5"&gt;He invited them into this home. And when he did, they told McDaniel something he could hardly believe: an algorithm built by the Chicago Police Department predicted — based on his proximity to and relationships with known shooters and shooting casualties — that McDaniel would be involved in a shooting. That he would be a “party to violence,” but it wasn’t clear what side of the barrel he might be on. He could be the shooter, he might get shot. They didn’t know. But the data said he was at risk either way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3sdAEQ"&gt;McDaniel was both a potential victim and a potential perpetrator, and the visitors on his porch treated him as such. A social worker told him that he could help him if he was interested in finding assistance to secure a job, for example, or mental health services. And police were there, too, with a warning: from here on out, the Chicago Police Department would be watching him. The algorithm indicated Robert McDaniel was more likely than 99.9 percent of Chicago’s population to either be shot or to have a shooting connected to him. That made him dangerous, and top brass at the Chicago PD knew it. So McDaniel had better be on his best behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAdpEi"&gt;The idea that a series of calculations could predict that he would soon shoot someone, or be shot, seemed outlandish. At the time, McDaniel didn’t know how to take the news. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aqWmw2"&gt;But the visit set a series of gears in motion. This Kafka-esque policing nightmare — a circumstance in which police identified a man to be surveilled based on a purely theoretical danger — would seem to cause the thing it predicted, in a deranged feat of self-fulfilling prophecy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hngugH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Workers dismantle a roof in Chicago’s westside Austin neighborhood.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="90rlGL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developed in the Civil War era&lt;/strong&gt; by developer Henry Austin, “Austinville,” as it was then called, quickly grew into one of Chicago’s most prominent suburbs. With easy access to the city’s newly developing suburban rail service, thousands of immigrants — Germans and Scandinavians and then Irish and Italian families — flocked to the neighborhood. By the early 1920s, Austin was a residential haven for upwardly mobile families, with structures designed by architects such as Frederick Schock and Frank Lloyd Wright. The densely populated suburb was defined by an easily navigable grid, tree-lined streets, parks, and narrow lots for single-family homes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mtIJhV"&gt;Like many neighborhoods in the expanding Chicago metro area, however, the city’s postwar redlining policies, combined with expressway construction in the 1960s, forced a dramatic shift: white immigrant families fled for better-connected neighborhoods, and &lt;a href="https://www.chicagomag.com/city-life/august-2017/how-redlining-segregated-chicago-and-america/"&gt;institutional segregation policies&lt;/a&gt; served to push African American families into Austin. By the 1990s, the neighborhood’s residents were more than 90 percent Black, and many of its blocks were stunted by abandonment and blight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jNiQnw"&gt;McDaniel’s block represents much of that history. The lots are narrow, and the population is almost exclusively Black and Hispanic; there are no obvious abandoned properties on North Mason, the street where McDaniel lives, but there’s abandonment littered throughout the streets running parallel to it. Just about every house on McDaniel’s block features a front porch where residents spend much of their time, particularly in the warm summer months. These give the neighborhood a sense of cohesion and lively social dynamic, but it helps to complicate matters when police make arrests or show up at someone’s home. It’s easy to keep an eye on neighbors, and according to McDaniel, people are often in each others’ businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kQ8ri1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It was “predictive policing” in its purest form&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="n1y32R"&gt;All of which is to say that McDaniel’s neighbors saw the cohort of officials arrive. They saw police walk to his porch, and they noticed that, when they departed, McDaniel didn’t leave along with them in handcuffs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h0xeZ5"&gt;His family members and people in the neighborhood asked about the visit. Had McDaniel come to some sort of agreement with the police? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GRnr6W"&gt;“They wanna know why all these muthafuckin’ cops are here talkin’ with me,” McDaniel says. “And you know what? So do I.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="buzL4K"&gt;A reporter for the &lt;em&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/em&gt; later contacted McDaniel regarding a story about the “heat list” — an unofficial moniker that cops gave to the register of individuals like McDaniel who had been identified by the police algorithm as potential shooters or shooting victims. McDaniel saw it as an opportunity to clear his name, to tell the world that he wasn’t working with the police, and, further, that he wasn’t doing anything that should attract police attention — except for being Black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="drrR4w"&gt;McDaniel had no violent history — no reason, as far as he was concerned, that any police officer should randomly show up to his house and declare him a threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="b96MeN"&gt;&lt;section class="ad"&gt;
  &lt;div class="ad__inner"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena-mobile"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LgKPLj"&gt;Born in 1991, McDaniel is one of 12 siblings. Most of them — and a slew of aunts and uncles and cousins — live nearby. Growing up, McDaniel says, he wasn’t much of a student and was kicked out of multiple public high schools for everything from fighting with other classmates to disagreeing with authority figures. He never formally graduated from high school but has since earned his GED. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="btWG13"&gt;He’s lived in his grandmother’s Austin home since he was six, and while he’s said he has the ambition to move, he’s never had the wherewithal to do so. By his own admission, he’s only held a couple of jobs, working at a bodega for a friend for a few years and then at a candy factory. Otherwise, he’s scraped by however he can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RhnhhN"&gt;Though he’s never been sentenced to jail time, McDaniel has previously been arrested for dealing weed and shooting dice on the street. He says he stays out of violent gang activity that might get him killed because he has a nine-year-old daughter with his ex-wife, with whom he’s had an on-and-off relationship since they met in high school. With that kind of background, why, he asks, would the police put him on a list of the city’s most potentially dangerous citizens?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3VqrAS"&gt;“I have no background, so what would even give you probable cause to watch me?” McDaniel &lt;a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2013-08-21-ct-met-heat-list-20130821-story.html"&gt;told the &lt;em&gt;Tribune&lt;/em&gt; in the summer of 2013&lt;/a&gt;. “And if you’re watching me, then you can obviously see I’m not doing anything.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U9nCQ6LpOx_bN1dEcxaJE-bndRA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22535373/4542_LB_03.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="ZzUcMi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chicago’s heat list&lt;/strong&gt; is an inflection point in more than three decades of increased reliance on data in policing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qByU85"&gt;In the early 1990s, Bill Bratton and Jack Maple — chief of the New York City Transit Police and his lieutenant, respectively — &lt;a href="https://www.govtech.com/magazines/gt/Jack-Maple-Betting-on-Intelligence.html"&gt;began experimenting&lt;/a&gt; with early iterations of a data-based policing program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S0AuzU"&gt;The system they used wasn’t so much a “technology” as it was a tidier way to look at crime reports. Innovation by way of organization, bureaucracy. Bratton and Maple would take a horde of crime statistics and plot the locations of each incident with dots — with colored pencils and crayons — on a big paper map they’d affix to a precinct wall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q8CKC0"&gt;Then, they’d strategize about how to reduce crimes in those specific areas: send more patrol units, maybe, or undercover cops to bait muggers. This new way of organizing crime data helped to increase arrests in their jurisdictions. Bratton, who had earned the nickname “&lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=rBOGDwAAQBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA72&amp;amp;lpg=PA72&amp;amp;dq=%22bratton%22+AND+%22lord+dots%22&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=f23zoG_7js&amp;amp;sig=ACfU3U3V1NIgaaQQ-UnDyqEPR9A3kzFaqQ&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwjztYCC147sAhUQl3IEHffNCZUQ6AEwAHoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=%22bratton%22%20AND%20%22lord%20dots%22&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;Lord Dots&lt;/a&gt;” for his similar efforts in the Boston Police Department, eventually became New York City Police Department’s commissioner. Maple became New York City’s deputy police commissioner for crime control strategies and would eventually be known as “the architect” of the program that resulted from this new way of organizing crime data: CompStat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cCt70l"&gt;&lt;section class="ad"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ad__inner"&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena-mobile"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3FFDDY"&gt;In the 30 years since then, computers have taken over much of the work of gathering and plotting datasets. They’ve also allowed police data analysts to attempt to not just identify where crime already&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;happened, but, using artificial intelligence and pattern modeling, to identify where crimes are &lt;em&gt;likely&lt;/em&gt; to happen in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BVcGYE"&gt;By the time McDaniel received his visit from the cohort, CompStat-style programs had been rolled out in police departments all over the country, and companies like PredPol had entered the game, helping officers use data to design patrolling strategies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h5gQ7a"&gt;The emphasis of all these programs was geography: if police saw a spate of muggings in and around Chicago’s picturesque Humboldt Park recreation area one day, for example, the data might show that the residential Fifth City district, southeast of the park, might be next. So commanders might send patrol units there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OQj0P5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r1MumQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="V6Ee28"&gt;Policing leaders around the world have heralded place-based forecasting as essential to more efficient patrols. But there are all sorts of terrifying implications in this kind of geographic forecasting for police. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fASvIm"&gt;Forecasting isn’t magic; it’s an educated guess about what might happen based on things that have already occurred. The data feeding forecasting software for police are typically built around police stops and arrests. That might sound straightforward and unbiased, but consider that US Department of Justice &lt;a href="https://www.ojjdp.gov/ojstatbb/crime/ucr.asp?table_in=2"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; show that African Americans are more than twice as likely to be arrested than white people. And if you’re Black, your likelihood of being stopped by a police officer can be nearly &lt;a href="https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/findings/"&gt;four times higher&lt;/a&gt; than if you’re white, depending on which city you live in, according to the Stanford Open Policing Project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wkRF13"&gt;Building a forecasting model around data like these can run the risk of stigmatizing entire populations based on discriminatory data; a 2017 &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/2330443X.2018.1438940"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from the Journal of &lt;em&gt;Statistics and Public Policy&lt;/em&gt; found that arrests doubled in a quadrant of Los Angeles where its police department tested forecasting software. Another problem — exacerbated when forecasting programs do not disclose their sources of data — is that of “dirty data” being mixed with more straightforward crime reports: a 2019 &lt;a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=882123066117004081064027005022006104017037064079033004076088084068091124087005125000036041017035040124044001123066004069004073038045044040053071027006102122118112102002081037125069127025112097084085013098118004093126098107103019097017106088097096025067&amp;amp;EXT=pdf&amp;amp;INDEX=TRUE"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; out of New York University’s AI Now Institute identified jurisdictions where inaccurate or falsified records were directly fed into the data. Chicago’s one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KMCYkL"&gt;Which is all to say that forecasting can put entire populations at risk of over-policing — which has led to countless unnecessary police killings for relatively insignificant infractions. (Think George Floyd. And Michael Brown. Twelve-year-old Tamir Rice. Sandra Bland, Philando Castile, Walter Scott. Thirteen-year-old Adam Toledo, this year, in Chicago. Alton Sterling, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery. The list goes on.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="106zu2"&gt;After years of shocking homicide numbers in the ’90s, CPD began its first CompStat program in 2003. The following year, Chicago had fewer than 500 homicides for the first time in nearly four decades. Whether or not that decrease had anything to do with CompStat, CPD received attention as a police force that saw real results after instituting a data program to focus patrols on crime hotspots. In 2006, CPD began enlisting community members to assist at-risk youth. So there was momentum within the city to experiment with data and community programs to fight crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="RM89ZP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What if the data is wrong?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="6geW35"&gt;In the late 2000s, Chicago initiated a program that would take a step beyond geographic forecasting. The emphasis of this new program, which got its start in 2009, was people. Specific people. It wasn’t a neighborhood crime forecast. It was “predictive policing” in its purest form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SvIQtD"&gt;At the time, only one other police department in the country had attempted to use people-based predictive technology — the Los Angeles Police Department, which went with a more straightforward “chronic offenders” list — part of a broader data-based LAPD program called “Operation LASER.” It would identify people with seemingly habitual contacts with the LAPD, with the goal of finding “a list of offenders,” according to a &lt;a href="https://bja.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh186/files/media/document/losangelesspi.pdf"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of the program sponsored by the Bureau of Justice Assistance, for LAPD officers “to proactively seek out.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9b9u4"&gt;The phrase “predictive policing” gets thrown around a lot, but its original concept wasn’t about putting dots on maps or trying to forecast where to send patrol cars. It was about figuring out who would commit a crime before they actually did. It was “pre-crime,” envisioned by Philip K. Dick in his 1956 science fiction novella &lt;em&gt;The Minority Report&lt;/em&gt;. It focused on individuals, not places. And it was science fiction. Not to mention that the entire premise of &lt;a href="https://cwanderson.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Philip-K-Dick-The-Minority-Report.pdf"&gt;the story&lt;/a&gt; is that such a predictive system would result in “a vast, impersonal engine of destruction grinding men and women to their doom.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3n3GLX"&gt;Regardless, people on the forefront of law enforcement technology eventually began to see pre-crime, person-based predictive policing as a real-world possibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TfDUuD"&gt;There are horrifying implications here: identifying and arresting specific people who might commit crimes goes against the very principle upon which the US criminal justice system is based. If individuals are arrested under suspicion of potentially committing a crime, there is no “innocent until proven guilty”; there’s a supposition of guilt. Plus, there’s just so much uncertainty in the technology: What if the data is wrong? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z8ExHU"&gt;Unbeknownst to McDaniel, he was a sort of guinea pig, one of the first individuals to be put on Chicago’s “heat list.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Dz4BvJ"&gt;&lt;section class="ad"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ad__inner"&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena-mobile"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aR64QM"&gt;The&lt;em&gt; Chicago Tribune&lt;/em&gt; published its &lt;a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2013-08-21-ct-met-heat-list-20130821-story.html"&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; on August 21st, 2013, and it gave a broad picture of the heat list and its goal to use the city’s extensive data collection to intervene in the lives of people like McDaniel. It’s not clear if anyone in his neighborhood read the article, which explained his confusion about why he’d been placed on the list. But it raised more questions than it answered about the heat list and how individuals like McDaniel found their way onto it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lxz1RM"&gt;The article described a list created “with the help of mathematical analysis,” but it didn’t go into detail about how that analysis was done. The fact that McDaniel, a Black man with no significant criminal history to speak of (certainly no felonies), was one of the principal targets of the analysis raised even more questions. Who else was on the list? What factors was CPD using to create its analysis? And what was CPD doing to ensure that the list wasn’t merely targeting people because of the color of their skin or where they happened to live? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nD88Fv"&gt;In 2014, I spoke with CPD officials about the program for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/19/5419854/the-minority-report-this-computer-predicts-crime-but-is-it-racist"&gt;an article for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. What exactly did it mean to have cops watching individuals who may or may not pose a threat? Which cops were doing the watching? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ju3otS"&gt;A commander in the police force eventually told me, “If you end up on that list, there’s a reason you’re there,” implying that people on the list are criminals rather than “parties to violence.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="msjEB3"&gt;The program was a black box. Mocking the opaqueness of the operation and its seeming ineffectiveness, Second City Cop, a local blog written by anonymous Chicago police officers, began referring to the heat list and its team as the “crystal ball unit.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BnaK2tVMEu73vStqjBd_2Z6hnhU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22531032/Robert_TheVerge_Sebastian0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Robert McDaniel standing in front of his home in Austin, Chicago.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="P4OBF5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;McDaniel says that&lt;/strong&gt; as soon as he was placed on the list, he became a target of constant surveillance by CPD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZQ4Zd6"&gt;Officers did exactly what they promised, he says, and more. Police started hanging around the bodega where he worked, looking for opportunities to go after him, often questioning his managers about his activities and whereabouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rQXvhQ"&gt;Everywhere he looked, it seemed, there was a police officer waiting for him, ready to search, to seize. One day, CPD officers stopped by the bodega — without a warrant, McDaniel says, and CPD declined to comment on his specific case. According to McDaniel, police demanded that he open a safe behind the counter. McDaniel didn’t have the combination to the safe, but when the proprietor arrived, he agreed to open it. Inside, the officers found a small amount of marijuana and rolling papers. They &lt;a href="http://publicsearch1.chicagopolice.org/Arrests/Details/16951438"&gt;charged&lt;/a&gt; McDaniel with possession. McDaniel declined to fight it, he says, because he didn’t have the money to do so. Through a spokesperson, CPD declined to comment on McDaniel’s case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ejn3xt"&gt;“They lookin’ for shooters and instead all they find is a little bit of weed,” he recalls to me, still incredulous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGOIy6"&gt;The CPD attention didn’t only serve to unnerve McDaniel and cost him fines related to the marijuana charge. Suddenly, a lot of his friends and neighbors didn’t trust him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kIE8ae"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A lotta muthafuckas don’t believe your story.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="gFfGIo"&gt;It’s no secret that “snitching” is condemned in communities with significant portions of their populations behind bars. But McDaniel wasn’t snitching. He wasn’t even being asked to do so in the first place; if the cohort who showed up on his front door was to be believed, they were merely asking him to accept help and keep out of trouble. That’s not what it looked like to anyone in the neighborhood, McDaniel says, as cops seemed to follow him wherever he went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izqzyn"&gt;McDaniel found himself in a kind of worst-case scenario: police were distrustful of him because of the heat list, while his neighbors and friends were distrustful of him because they assumed he was cooperating with law enforcement — no amount of assurances would convince them he wasn’t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jv3p3n"&gt;McDaniel became isolated. Friends stopped talking to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EQeDeo"&gt;Meanwhile, interest in the heat list continued outside Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c5FIjl"&gt;When the filmmakers behind the 2017 German documentary &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6998222/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pre-Crime&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; contacted him about being in their film, he agreed, thinking it might help him to clear his name within his own community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhuCO6"&gt;The filmmakers recorded in front of and inside McDaniel’s home as well as in the bodega where he worked at the time. The sight of cameras and filming equipment on location in Austin was unusual, to say the least. Rather than help clear his name, the cameras only served to rekindle concern in the neighborhood about whether he maintained a relationship with the Chicago Police Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qf94nw"&gt;Sometime after filming — McDaniel doesn’t remember the date or have documentation to prove it — he remembers being approached by a group of men from his neighborhood, people he knew. They asked, point-blank, whether he was a snitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QwuD2C"&gt;&lt;section class="ad"&gt;
  &lt;div class="ad__inner"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena-mobile"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mTkLPI"&gt;McDaniel wasn’t shy about telling people he’d appeared on a list of likely violent offenders. But he insisted that being on the list didn’t mean he had any involvement with the Chicago Police Department. “I tell them the truth,” he recounts. “&lt;em&gt;I’m just trying to get my name off this heat list shit, I don’t even know how I got on there.&lt;/em&gt;” After that, McDaniel says, he and the group parted ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e6hvh2"&gt;Take a step back and try to imagine the complexity of what McDaniel was trying to explain in that moment: the reason for cops showing up at his door was a stuff-of-science-fiction computer algorithm that had identified McDaniel, based on a collection of data sources that no civilian could gain access to, as a shooter or a victim of a shooting in some future circumstance that might or might not play out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b29VlX"&gt;One could imagine that some audiences hearing this explanation might think McDaniel was out of his mind — a conspiracy theorist raving about the vast surveillance state. But in a historically overpoliced neighborhood in Chicago, the implications could be much more dire. How, then, did he know so much about what the police were doing? The more McDaniel explained, the more it sounded like he was an informant. But that’s all he could do to plead with his community: keep explaining.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vnvmvR"&gt;A day or two later, while hanging out at a neighbor’s house a block away from his home, McDaniel says, he got a call from someone who, he says, “was supposed to’ve been a friend.” The friend said they were outside McDaniel’s house and wanted him to come outside and explain it again — what the story was, how he’d gotten on the heat list, why people from CPD had visited his home, why he was now being documented by filmmakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="YJHuel"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It wasn’t high-tech — cops would just use the list as a way to target people&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="EwfL28"&gt;McDaniel agreed — but as he headed back to his house, a car pulled up. A man fired multiple shots from inside the car. One hit McDaniel in the knee, and his leg gave out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ro5RaW"&gt;The car pulled away. Hearing the shots, the neighbor whose house McDaniel had just left called an ambulance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BAZVw2"&gt;The Chicago Police Department only releases shooting reports if the requester can identify a specific location and date where the shooting occurred. McDaniel says he doesn’t remember the exact date of his shooting, and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has not been able to substantiate the details of his shooting with police documentation. Through a spokesperson, CPD declined to comment on McDaniel’s case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p0SciU"&gt;McDaniel points to the wounds on his body as testimony of the event. His uncle, Lonnie Newman, indicates that McDaniel is a reliable narrator. “This is a good man,” he tells me. “You can trust what he says.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BswaHu"&gt;At the hospital after he was shot, McDaniel recalls speaking with someone connected to the shooter. Incredulous, he asks, “What the fuck y’all just shoot me for?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FWDN2q"&gt;The response, according to McDaniel: “A lotta muthafuckas don’t believe your story.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IdC2HZ"&gt;Later, McDaniel tells me it represented the kind of situation that he felt he couldn’t escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9v44nw"&gt;“I’ve lived here 25 years. I know people, their families, their friends,” he says. “One year, I’m at your house, your momma’s cooking for me, we’re on the couch chilling, playing games, smoking weed. The next, you’ve got a gun pointed at me.” &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An American flag waves in Midway Park Ave. in Chicago’s westside neighborhood of Austin.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="z5CiPl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In McDaniel’s view,&lt;/strong&gt; the heat list caused the harm its creators hoped to avoid: it predicted a shooting that wouldn’t have happened if it hadn’t predicted the shooting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="75wyyS"&gt;As the heat list continued to operate, researchers tore it to shreds. A 2016 &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11292-016-9272-0"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Experimental Criminology&lt;/em&gt; came to some troubling conclusions about the list that had, by then, been rebranded as the “Strategic Subject List,” or SSL. Among them: “The individuals on the SSL were considered to be ‘persons of interest’ to the CPD,” meaning that McDaniel’s description of being routinely targeted for surveillance and searches matched what researchers discovered. “Overall,” the report goes on, “there was no practical direction about what to do with individuals on the SSL, little executive or administrative attention paid to the pilot, and little to no follow-up with district commanders.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M1FySD"&gt;The heat list wasn’t particularly predictive, it turned out. It wasn’t high-tech. Cops would just use the list as a way to target people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SiV8fr"&gt;There was another problem, too. Not long after RAND researchers performed their heat list analysis, Chicago was in an uproar. The October 2014 shooting of Laquan McDonald by CPD officer Jason Van Dyke enraged huge swaths of the city’s population. When the CPD released a video of the shooting — after more than a year of delays by public officials — all bets were off: months of protests followed. Shootings spiked in Chicago by 46 percent from 2015 to 2016, and a remarkable 85 percent from 2013 to 3,512.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="t2dFva"&gt;&lt;q&gt;McDaniel refuses to report the shooting to police because he says he’s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a snitch — and never would be&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="dx2Dkw"&gt;Anthony Guglielmi, who served as the department’s public information officer at the time, says the McDonald shooting distracted the CPD from the heat list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EX2Xco"&gt;“Laquan McDonald happened and the city just turned into a warzone,” Guglielmi tells me. “And so the focus of the department was less on, &lt;em&gt;Let’s see what this experimental program can do&lt;/em&gt;, and more on, just like, &lt;em&gt;Jesus Christ, how do we get people to stop shooting each other?&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Bj6yy"&gt;That practical consideration only added to the deep condemnation that the heat list attracted from all over the country. Reporters and community organizations criticized the lack of transparency about which factors placed an individual on the list. Researchers &lt;a href="https://www.nyulawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NYULawReview-94-Richardson-Schultz-Crawford.pdf"&gt;questioned its efficacy&lt;/a&gt;. And civil rights groups wondered how damaging someone’s inclusion on the list might be to their record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JlHFef"&gt;&lt;section class="ad"&gt;
  &lt;div class="ad__inner"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena-mobile"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g7MnAz"&gt;In a 2018 testimony to the Illinois Senate Committee on Public Health, Rachel Murphy, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois, &lt;a href="https://www.aclu-il.org/en/press-releases/aclu-il-warns-illinois-senate-against-flawed-cpd-gang-database-archive"&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt; that someone’s designation on the heat list was not limited to CPD officers and officials. “It is also used by immigration officials in considering whether to grant a person’s application for legal status and by prosecutors in considering whether to enhance charges.” A spot on the heat list could potentially get people deported — or sent to prison for inappropriately long sentences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rQDLzX"&gt;For the CPD, the heat list simply wasn’t worth all the negative attention it attracted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izbx2e"&gt;Los Angeles officials came to a similar conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7KM5BS"&gt;A report from the Police Commission in Los Angeles — a civilian panel charged with overseeing the LAPD — criticized the department’s person-based predictive policing program, saying that officers used inconsistent data to label people as “chronic offenders.” That only added to the &lt;a href="https://capublicrecordslaw.com/blog/2018/2/20/the-stop-lapd-spying-coalition-files-a-california-public-records-act-lawsuit-against-the-lapd-and-city-of-los-angeles"&gt;scrutiny&lt;/a&gt; that LAPD’s Operation LASER attracted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cbm0mL"&gt;LAPD brass ended its person-based predictive policing program in April 2020. Though the CPD still uses place-based predictive policing algorithms, Chicago’s heat list program &lt;a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/criminal-justice/ct-chicago-police-strategic-subject-list-ended-20200125-spn4kjmrxrh4tmktdjckhtox4i-story.html"&gt;ended in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n5Ojjj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="el5NPW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U9nCQ6LpOx_bN1dEcxaJE-bndRA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22535373/4542_LB_03.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="73oazW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In August 2020,&lt;/strong&gt; McDaniel found himself on the wrong side of a gun again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zF3SP8"&gt;Near midnight on August 13th last year, he walked into an alleyway a few hundred feet from where shooters nearly killed him years before. It was quiet, a half-block from his home. Checking text messages on his phone, he looked up to see himself ambushed. Two shooters in black, an attempted hit. A surveillance video from that night shows darkened figures walking through an alley, bursts of gunfire. A figure — McDaniel — falls into a brick wall, then slides down to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p4VsIr"&gt;“They did it again,” McDaniel tells me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b0bGAC"&gt;McDaniel says he knows who did it, but he won’t go to the police. He says he’s the target of violence because people in his neighborhood believe he’s a snitch. But McDaniel refuses to report the shooting to police because he says he’s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a snitch — and never would be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iwNlIR"&gt;The irony here is breathtaking and entirely foreseeable. The heat list may have been designed to reduce violence, but for McDaniel, he says it brought violence directly to him. It got him all the negative ramifications of being an informant — a snitch — with none of the benefits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eAig2f"&gt;He can’t trust anyone. Nowhere’s safe. Everyone’s a potential threat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R1ccI1"&gt;“I got this target on my back,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="StEBcs"&gt;And there’s no way to remove it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Robert McDaniel posing for a portrait at his home in Chicago’s Austin neighborhood." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ElTLgqDKXNiNfebwg3Q74N2CmtA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22531035/Robert_TheVerge_Sebastian0003.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="mY4Axh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last summer,&lt;/strong&gt; on a searingly hot, humid afternoon, I visited McDaniel at his home in Chicago’s Austin neighborhood. As part of my reporting, I also got in touch with a member of the cohort that had visited McDaniel in 2013 — the officials who, in McDaniel’s eyes, precipitated everything that followed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="agY6bR"&gt;Charles Perry, who stood on McDaniel’s porch all those years ago as a former prisoner who’d reemerged successfully into the general public, now devotes a significant chunk of his time — often without pay — to meeting up with violent and formerly violent offenders to discuss options for getting off the street, getting mental health and drug abuse help, and securing more standard forms of employment. Perry knows the peril these individuals face: when he was 23 years old, he was arrested and sentenced to 25 years in a federal penitentiary for conspiracy to distribute cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7MZbEG"&gt;Perry is now the &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/charles-perry-76046b19/"&gt;director of community organizing at Westside Health Authority&lt;/a&gt;, which specializes in getting people out of violent circumstances. The 55-year-old is also an assistant football coach at a local high school. When I asked if he wanted to meet McDaniel again, he gladly agreed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGbInh"&gt;The meeting between McDaniel and Perry was, in other words, a kind of reunion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YzXaTN"&gt;When they saw each other again, McDaniel didn’t recognize Perry. So Perry reintroduced himself, described his decades behind bars, and suggested that McDaniel might do well to let Perry help him find work or some kind of training in the trades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2CAXjh"&gt;But McDaniel was having none of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AA9h2x"&gt;To McDaniel, the heat list and everything associated with it, including the offers of help, represent the system that’s placed him in danger. And more broadly, it’s done nothing to lift him out of his circumstances, only worsen them. Perry presented McDaniel with a partial hypothetical about the risk and reward of working within the system, rather than abstaining from it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gYx3Tp"&gt;“Let’s say you have $50,000 sitting there that, if you go for it, you might lose your life or end up behind bars,” he said. “Or I come to you with an opportunity to get a job to make $12 per hour.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0NRTpA"&gt;“I don’t want it,” McDaniel said — he’d take the chance to make $50,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lMuo6I"&gt;“Okay, that’s your choice,” Perry said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="alTSvU"&gt;“No, it’s not my choice,” McDaniel said. “Look at the reality of it: I got all these problems now. If I’m gonna be evicted from my home, if I got kids that don’t eat, if I got a mother that’s in here starvin’, if I got a daddy that’s in jail, your $12 don’t fix that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="edR8Zm"&gt;Perry circled back. “But if you miss that $50,000 sting, your problems still exist and you either dead or in jail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ycp74x"&gt;It’s worth the gamble, McDaniel said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UISbKO"&gt;McDaniel was unmoved, and Perry was late for practice. After Perry left, I sat with McDaniel to hear him out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eNpNEx"&gt;“At his age, I agree with him,” McDaniel said. “At my age? I can’t.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v12DHl"&gt;“Why not?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aPFcrP"&gt;“He done lived a majority of his life. He had his ups, he went to jail, he had his downs. So now you come home from jail and you just mellow out. That’s cool, that’s understandable. But do you hear what he’s saying? He’s building his systems through their system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EMNFez"&gt;To McDaniel, “the system” represents the circumstances and people and technology that landed him on the heat list in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZdMv8b"&gt;“I just can’t do that,” McDaniel went on. “I can’t trust them.” &lt;/p&gt;
