    <title>Analogue’s Pocket is the latest gadget delayed due to the ongoing global electronic components shortage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XHMvq2AZJa-M5r17zVTYjB058iA=/577x0:6721x4096/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69057411/3_Analogue_Pocket_All_Angles.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pDTROE"&gt;Analogue’s Pocket is the latest gadget to be negatively impacted by the global shortage of chips and electronic components. The sleek and modern device that allows you to play Game Boy cartridges will now launch in October, an additional five-month delay, the company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/analogue/status/1377375231296200704?s=20"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7tjTqy"&gt;“The current global state of affairs continues to create supply chain challenges outside of our control,” Analogue said in a &lt;a href="https://support.analogue.co/hc/en-us/articles/360058718452"&gt;blog post today&lt;/a&gt;. “There have been sudden and severe electrical component shortages as well as logistical issues leading to a domino effect of challenges for nearly everyone in the industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wTqdik"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Super Nt will be restocked in April. Mega Sg and DAC shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;— Analogue (@analogue) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/analogue/status/1377375464042323971?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ePA5LY"&gt;This is not the first time Analogue had to delay the Pocket. last July, the company announced it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/27/21337403/analogue-pocket-release-date-delay-pre-order"&gt;would not hit its 2020 release window&lt;/a&gt; and pushed back the release date to May 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H6rKxd"&gt;Analgoue is among many companies affected by the component shortages, which have slowed down the production of many electronics, ranging from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358256/apple-supplier-foxconn-parts-shortages-chips-2022"&gt;smartphones&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-09/toyota-says-chip-shortage-impacting-output-of-texas-made-trucks"&gt;cars&lt;/a&gt;, while also making it near-impossible to buy next-gen gaming hardware, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;including desktop graphics cards&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297039/playstation-ceo-ps5-supply-2021-stock-consoles-jim-ryan"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260564/microsoft-xbox-series-x-stock-june-supply-constraints"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Errors ruin 15 million doses of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="SFChronicleVirusVaccine" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SrGWGKOzLaORmM32yFP12wSMx-s=/0x0:3500x2333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69057352/1309676838.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S6yXTn"&gt;An ingredient mix-up at a Baltimore manufacturing plant ruined 15 million doses of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/world/johnson-and-johnson-vaccine-mixup.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. That could delay future shipments of this vaccine in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HgaOnS"&gt;There are not any problems with the doses of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine that have already been delivered — those were produced in the Netherlands, the &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;reported. But the tens of millions of the shots set to ship in April were supposed to come from this Baltimore plant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jb6zZD"&gt;The manufacturing plant, run by Emergent BioSolutions, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/03/02/merck-johnson-and-johnson-covid-vaccine-partnership/"&gt;received $628 million from the Trump administration&lt;/a&gt; last year to expand its vaccine manufacturing capacity. The plant was still awaiting Food and Drug Administration authorization of its Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine production lines, and this enormous mistake — which &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;sources attributed to human error — will likely delay that further. It’s not clear how this setback will affect the availability of this vaccine over the next few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FqR4re"&gt;Moderna and Pfizer / BioNTech are still on track to meet their vaccine commitments in the United States, which should give the country enough doses to meet the Biden administration’s target of having shots available for every adult &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/02/us/politics/merck-johnson-johnson-vaccine.html"&gt;by the end of May.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="394Sxc"&gt;But limited availability of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine could still hurt US efforts to vaccinate enough people for herd immunity. People who are reluctant to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DrewAltman/status/1376921970072154112"&gt;say they’ll “wait and see”&lt;/a&gt; are more likely to agree to take the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine than the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna shots. The Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine only takes one dose, and is made using a more familiar technique. Only having the Pfizer / BioNTech and Moderna shots on offer could make it harder to convince some people to get vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJCWRT"&gt;Around 30 percent of the US population has received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine so far. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Malware hidden in Call of Duty cheat software proves that cheaters never prosper  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2ZZVrHVEgEZQe9NlNBMKBus4ymU=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69057233/AGB_WZ_0309_Vehicles.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m5tKRx"&gt;Hackers have been hiding malware in cheating software for &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt; and have been trying to spread it to “cheating cheaters,” as a report from Activision calls them (&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvxwva/activision-reveals-malware-disguised-as-call-of-duty-warzone-cheats"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OwEGGB"&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://research.activision.com/publications/2021/03/cheating-cheaters-malware-delivered-as-call-of-duty-cheats"&gt;read the full report here&lt;/a&gt;, but it explains that there’s been a campaign by hackers to try to get &lt;em&gt;Warzone &lt;/em&gt;players to download a fake cheating engine. After players run it, the malware can then go on to infect the computer with whatever payload is chosen by the hacker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1F6sOo"&gt;In short: cheaters never prosper. If the malware doesn’t get you, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7k9m5a/call-of-duty-warzone-bans-more-than-60000-cheaters"&gt;you’ll likely just get banned from the game instead&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FDfRw3"&gt;Players downloading cheats to help them pwn and then getting pwned themselves is nothing new. I’ll admit it: I wasted my childhood by being a serial cheater, sneaking peeks at my sister’s &lt;em&gt;Battleship&lt;/em&gt; board or slipping myself a couple extra $100s when acting as the banker in Monopoly. And when playing video games, I cheated, too. Never online (I had dial-up in the age of &lt;em&gt;Modern Warfare 2&lt;/em&gt;), but I certainly downloaded my fair share of patches and mods to try to make games easier or to get better loot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QSkQKS"&gt;There were absolutely times I paid for it, knocking the family computer out of commission with a nasty virus and having to spend the rest of the day fixing the computer before my mom came home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HJqPh3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; isn’t alone in having hack-infested hacks: players downloading cheats for &lt;a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/valorant-fake-beta-keys-riot-games/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/cybercrime/2018/10/fortnite-gamers-targeted-by-data-theft-malware/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/minecraft-mods-adware-kaspersky/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.pcrisk.com/removal-guides/13291-roblox-virus#:~:text=The%20Roblox%20virus%20is%20trojan,end%20up%20infecting%20their%20computers"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have all gotten nasty surprises. It seems today’s gamers are learning the same lesson I did: if you’re cheating at the game, you’re really only cheating yourself. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NBCUniversal might save its movies for Peacock instead of Netflix or HBO</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k62B4KgcY0QA5VR4utqgt_trUeg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69057151/acastro_200714_1777_peacock_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bxt7ez"&gt;NBCUniversal is mulling whether to remove its films from HBO Max and Netflix and put new movies on its own streaming service, Peacock, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-31/comcast-weighs-pulling-universal-s-movies-from-hbo-max-netflix"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YukpxO"&gt;Right now, HBO Max has a deal to show Universal Pictures movies about nine months after their theatrical run, and Netflix has a similar one to let it show movies from Illumination Entertainment, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. Both of those deals will currently expire at the end of the year, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83hzWL"&gt;However, Comcast-owned NBCUniversal reportedly hasn’t made a decision about if it should pull the movies just yet. Execs are also “open” to making new licensing deals with companies, which could mean the films stay where they are or end up somewhere else that’s not Peacock, HBO Max, or Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h.p_3foLUVsbzFq7"&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, is also an investor in Vox Media, &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt;’s parent company.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vGpDPg"&gt;The fact that NBCUniversal is even considering the move adds to an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/10/21429223/fx-john-landgraf-hulu-disney-plus-hbo-max-peacock-streaming-window-brands"&gt;already extremely confusing streaming landscape&lt;/a&gt;, where it’s often a crapshoot if you’ll find a movie on the streaming service you’d expect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WhY352"&gt;On the one hand, NBCUniversal bringing its own movies (which include huge franchises like &lt;em&gt;Fast &amp;amp; Furious&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;How to Train Your Dragon&lt;/em&gt;) to its streaming service would lead to a certain amount of corporate synergy and would boost the value of Peacock to retain or attract new subscribers. On the other, licensing deals are lucrative, and the company has to weigh that revenue against what it might make from Peacock in the long term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OzKrXj"&gt;NBCUniversal has shown some willingness to silo popular content to Peacock. It moved &lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt;, one of the most-watched shows on any streaming service, from Netflix to Peacock &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22216867/peacock-office-subscription-streaming-ad-free-premium-plus-netflix"&gt;at the beginning of this year&lt;/a&gt;. It’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297077/the-office-friends-peacock-hbo-max-streaming-wars-disney-plus-star"&gt;not clear how successful that strategy has been&lt;/a&gt;, however, and based on today’s &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report, we still don’t know if NBCUniversal is willing to make a similar move for some of its biggest film franchises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VFmwW0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix is buying two Knives Out sequels to make its next big franchise</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/faA1ulwCmS8azbY1QhFSz2PzuWw=/0x0:1600x1067/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69057149/woods.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Lionsgate&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m0UbhW"&gt;Netflix has acquired the rights to two &lt;em&gt;Knives Out&lt;/em&gt; sequels, with Rian Johnson returning to direct the next whodunits and Daniel Craig reprising his starring role as Detective Benoit Blanc, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/netflix-buys-knives-out-sequels-450-million-1234941995/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt; says the deal is worth $450 million, and &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/03/knives-out-two-sequels-netflix-400-million-plus-deal-daniel-craig-rian-johnson-ram-bergman-1234724575/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that the deal would be “worth north of $400 million.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MgUOJ1"&gt;The original &lt;em&gt;Knives Out&lt;/em&gt; was a huge hit, earning $311.4 million at the box office on its $40 million budget. As Netflix looks to compete with other streaming services like Disney Plus, Amazon’s Prime Video, WarnerMedia’s HBO Max, and others, adding another franchise to its roster of IP could help Netflix keep subscribers over the long term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLnwRM"&gt;Plot details about the &lt;em&gt;Knives Out&lt;/em&gt; sequels haven’t been revealed, and we don’t know if other actors from the first movie will be returning for the follow-ups. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood is removing its confetti celebrations ahead of its IPO</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gNX-z15w76hcbOw1IrmFs34ZKRk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69057053/acastro_210129_1777_robinhood_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustrations by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HSEB4h"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/3/31/a-new-way-to-celebrate-with-robinhood"&gt;Robinhood is cutting out the confetti&lt;/a&gt; from its stock trading app, following accusations that the animation helped to “gamify” investing. Instead, the company is adding new animations that will celebrate trading milestones for users in a more somber manner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pf00Aw"&gt;The celebratory digital confetti showers have been a controversial part of Robinhood’s app since 2016. In the past, Robinhood has argued that the friendly features “help investing fit easily into people’s lives.” But others — &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/massachusetts-regulators-to-file-complaint-against-robinhood-11608120003?mod=article_inline"&gt;including the Massachusetts Securities Division&lt;/a&gt; — have argued that the confetti (along with other features, like free stock promotions) help to “gamify” stock trading for amateur investors who may not understand what they’re getting into. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gplb596RVrzSv5gKKrl7D4DDKdc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22411259/im_318241.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Robinhood&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The less confetti-filled milestone animation in Robinhood’s app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QejhyJ"&gt;“The confetti is getting really misconstrued, and I think it’s actually doing the opposite of what we want,” Madhu Muthukumar, senior director of product management at Robinhood, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/robinhood-to-remove-controversial-digital-confetti-from-trading-app-11617195612?mod=djemalertNEWS"&gt;commented to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It “seems to have distracted from the goal of the app, which is to make regular people, everyday folks who have been kept out of the market, feel like they can participate and feel like they are being positively reinforced for taking steps in their financial life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6bvkOi"&gt;Of course, Robinhood is still recovering from its involvement in the recent wave of “meme stocks,” which saw the company come under fire from users who were frustrated when it started restricting trades of popular stocks like GameStop and AMC when Reddit users from the r/WallStreetBets subreddit were frantically trading them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OmgXGS"&gt;But Robinhood is planning to go public, with the &lt;a href="https://www.investopedia.com/robinhood-reportedly-filed-confidentially-for-ipo-5118086"&gt;company already confidentially filing for a forthcoming IPO&lt;/a&gt;. Cleaning out any controversial aspects of the app — even ones as seemingly innocuous as confetti celebrations — is a logical move to appease future investors.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The DualSense’s adaptive triggers show how to make a button feel next-gen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q-oPNYHPE_NBvlT1Rb62g6I7uTM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69056870/vpavic_4479_20210318_0049.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CmOFlI"&gt;The PlayStation 5’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21562206/ps5-dualsense-controller-review-games-features-vibrations"&gt;DualSense controller is an incredible input device&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps the most tangible example of “next-gen” gaming the new wave of consoles has offered to date. But you won’t necessarily see the upgrades just from looking at Sony’s controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OlgEXq"&gt;At first glance, there are few differences between the PS4’s DualShock 4 and the PS5’s DualSense, which share nearly identical button layouts. But the DualSense changes the game (literally) nonetheless, thanks to the near-magic of its adaptive trigger system, which can adjust the tension of the rear buttons to make it easier (or harder) to press them down in response to gameplay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yy2wMm"&gt;It turns out that the answer to revolutionizing the controller isn’t to add more buttons but to make the ones we already have offer a deeper, better experience. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q4NheuFKcyiTY4Auihkk5NiEXfA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22380654/vpavic_4479_20210318_0044.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oWnhWs"&gt;You only need to pick up a DualSense and launch into a game to see that it’s nothing like its predecessor. The first PS5 game I played was &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Miles Morales&lt;/em&gt;, and I still remember feeling the rumble of a train or the crackle of electricity through the controller’s haptic feedback — another new addition to this generation — for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j2RmtZ"&gt;But even more critical is how the adaptive triggers change the web-swinging. Each *thwip* of a web as Miles soars through Manhattan now has a slight resistance to it, adding a sense of life and momentum to the traversal. From a gameplay perspective, the controls are virtually the same as PS4’s &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt;. But the new technology helps bring the game to life in a new dimension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kBTRfL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Revolutionizing the controller doesn’t mean more buttons — just better ones&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="90AUqf"&gt;From a technical perspective, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/3/21547303/sony-ps5-dualsense-adaptive-triggers-haptics-teardown-features"&gt;it’s an incredibly impressive system&lt;/a&gt;: each trigger actually has a separate geared motor that allows the controller to adjust the tension and resistance on the fly. Depending on how the motor is engaged, it can feel like anything from a smooth, effortless glide to an almost physical fight to depress the trigger. And while I’m still a little wary about the long-term durability here (more moving parts generally mean more points of failure), it’s one of the most cleverly engineered buttons in tech today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YIEJ8X"&gt;And the DualSense’s benefits are clear across multiple PS5 games. In &lt;em&gt;Astro’s Playroom&lt;/em&gt; (which is designed as a showcase for the new controller) you can feel the fiery rush of a jetpack and the twang of each bowstring. In &lt;em&gt;Destruction AllStars&lt;/em&gt;, the triggers help subtly tell you when you’re picking up acceleration or braking as they increase or decrease the pressure it takes to push them, and warn you of your vehicle’s imminent destruction with a buckling sensation as you push your battered car to the limit. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s guns each feel unique with the DualSense, with a shotgun blast, a pistol shot, and a heavy rifle all firing differently on the new console.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jqtAEd_yIvDiRsGQeYY2GDIbLqo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22380655/vpavic_4479_20210318_0045.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7GRjPw"&gt;Seeing how games take advantage of the new triggers has already become one of my favorite things to do whenever I boot up a new PS5 game, and Sony has done a remarkable job of making each press of those buttons feel more significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FRaPwY"&gt;Oftentimes, when discussing next-generation consoles, a big emphasis is put on the idea of immersion — ramping up the graphics to make games look even more like real life. But by focusing on improving not just on how games look, but how games feel, the DualSense arguably does more for immersion than any graphical upgrade (especially since, unlike faster frame rates or higher resolutions, it doesn’t require a fancy new TV to benefit from). It opens up a whole new avenue for developers to inform you about what’s going on on-screen and bring you even further in the world of the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="n8M2UJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A different way forward for controllers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zqII7z"&gt;There’s an alternate universe where Sony’s PlayStation 5 controller took the cues from its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21571413/sony-dualshock-4-back-button-attachment-ps4-ps5-controller-playstation"&gt;DualShock Back Button attachment&lt;/a&gt; and just added more paddles and inputs for players — an approach taken by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20926499/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Xbox Elite Series 2 controller&lt;/a&gt;, for example. It’s not a bad approach, especially for more advanced players that want that flexibility and customization, but it doesn’t make games more immersive or open up new ways to engage with what you’re playing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5XyluT"&gt;The DualSense is a different approach, one that recognizes that the way forward for controllers isn’t to just add more buttons; it’s to make the ones that we already have more informative, more engaging, and more fun to interact with. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>Google plans to open its US offices to some employees in April</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vETGnFRgO65WZZ8ETkXK7HVKGIM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69056759/acastro_170808_1777_google_logo_04.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZK7yk7"&gt;Google plans to open its US offices in a limited capacity in April for employees who want to work in person, the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The announcement follows &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22352742/facebook-uber-microsoft-twitter-apple-covid-19-offices-reopening"&gt;Microsoft, Facebook, and Uber’s plans&lt;/a&gt; to return to offices in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MEJOPk"&gt;Offices will likely open in April, “based on specific criteria that include increases in vaccine availability and downward trends in COVID-19 cases,” Google says&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;All employees who prefer to work remotely will also be able to do so until September 2021, which is in line with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22175150/google-return-office-september-flexible-work-week-coronavirus-pandemic-sundar-pichai"&gt;Google’s previous announcement&lt;/a&gt;. Anyone who decides to work in person will be required to follow safety guidelines like wearing a mask, practicing social distancing, and passing a health survey, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/business/google-return-to-office.html"&gt;an email &lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;read&lt;/a&gt; announcing the plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W9BzB8"&gt;Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazons-covid-19-blog-updates-on-how-were-responding-to-the-crisis#covid-latest"&gt;has also shared an update&lt;/a&gt; on when it expects most of its employees to return to working in person. The company never closed its offices, but Amazon says only 10 percent of its corporate employees still head in for work. Given the improved availability of vaccines, Amazon expects “more people will start coming into the office through the summer, with most back in the office by early fall,” it says. The company still views returning “to an office-centric culture as [its] baseline.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zsUv30"&gt;In contrast, when Google extended its remote work plan to September, CEO Sundar Pichai said the company would explore flexible work weeks, where employees would spend three days at the office and the remainder of their time at home.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>With legalization of marijuana, New York will expunge prior convictions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g2O66u"&gt;New York has passed the &lt;a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/legislation-allow-adult-use-cultivation-recreational-marijuana-advances&amp;amp;utm_term=&amp;amp;utm_content="&gt;Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act&lt;/a&gt;, legalizing the recreational use of marijuana in the state. The new legislation also expunges the records of people who were convicted on marijuana-related charges that are no longer criminalized. People with past convictions will be among those prioritized for licenses to cultivate, process, and sell marijuana products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eabVcJ"&gt;New Yorkers can now carry up to three ounces of cannabis or 24 grams of concentrates like oils and store up to five pounds at home. There are expansions to the state’s medical cannabis program, including the addition of more eligible conditions and a higher possession limit. The bill also prohibits using the smell of marijuana as justification for searching someone’s car, though it can still be used as a reason to suspect the driver is intoxicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RU9yMt"&gt;Advocates have long been calling for reforms that address the disproportionate effects of drug criminalization on people of color. New Yorkers of color made up 94 percent of marijuana-related arrests and summonses in 2020, &lt;a href="https://legalaidnyc.org/news/nypd-data-people-of-color-94-percent-marijuana-arrests/"&gt;according to an analysis of NYPD data&lt;/a&gt; by The Legal Aid Society. “Because of the sheer extent of harm that had been inflicted on Black and Brown communities over the years, any marijuana reform that was brought forth had to be equally comprehensive to begin repairing the damage,” &lt;a href="https://drugpolicy.org/press-release/2021/03/victory-dpa-hails-historic-passage-marijuana-legalization-new-york"&gt;said Kassandra Frederique&lt;/a&gt;, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="v5vIau"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“End the racially disparate enforcement of marijuana prohibition”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yyHMJL"&gt;Tax revenue from marijuana sales will be directed toward education, job training, drug treatment programs, and other community initiatives. “My goal in carrying this legislation has always been to end the racially disparate enforcement of marijuana prohibition that has taken such a toll on communities of color across our state, and to use the economic windfall of legalization to help heal and repair those same communities,” said state Sen. Liz Krueger, who sponsored the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eHmVfz"&gt;The law establishes “one of the most ambitious marijuana legalization programs in the nation,” said Melissa Moore, New York State director of the Drug Policy Alliance. “New York has taken bold action to put a nail in the coffin of the war on drugs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wLDOB8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
