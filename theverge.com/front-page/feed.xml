    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C4Cp2D"&gt;In a surprise decision Tuesday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22527709/lina-khan-ftc-commissioner-competition-facebook-amazon-google-apple"&gt;President Joe Biden tapped Lina Khan&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most prominent critics of Big Tech, to lead the Federal Trade Commission. In that role, Khan will have the authority to guide the FTC’s agenda — and it’s fair to assume she’ll be taking a hawkish stance toward Big Tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kKWWMy"&gt;The move is already spooking industry groups, with the conservative Open Competition Center warning Khan would use “antitrust law as a Trojan horse to advance woke goals and policy priorities” — and the tech-backed ITIF saying her agenda would cause “lasting self-inflicted damage” to the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mL1bbA"&gt;But it isn’t just Khan who has the tech industry raising the alarm. Khan’s position at the FTC is just one part of a multipronged antitrust effort from the US government — an effort that’s proceeding along largely bipartisan lines. After years of posturing and confusion, a bipartisan consensus on tech antitrust is finally taking shape across Congress, the Department of Justice, and the FTC — with unpredictable consequences for targets like Facebook and Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nJrwtB"&gt;Last week, the House Judiciary Committee &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22529857/democrats-antitrust-big-tech-facebook-amazon-google-apple-competition-package-bills"&gt;released a slate of bipartisan bills&lt;/a&gt; to chip away at tech’s power, including measures that would empower the FTC and Justice Department to break up tech firms by forcing them to sell off parts of their businesses that could create conflicts of interest. On Wednesday, Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY) went further, saying that the committee would take quick action to move forward on the bills, saying that the package could be marked up as early as next week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wV99jn"&gt;Once approved by the committee, the bills would face a vote on the full House floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2SRFiG"&gt;There’s also a bipartisan movement in the Senate to pass similar reforms. At a hearing on competition in the smart home market Tuesday, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) praised the House’s efforts. Earlier that day, &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-tech/2021/06/15/klobuchar-starts-work-on-companion-antitrust-bills-795951"&gt;Klobuchar told &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that she would begin work to introduce companion bills in the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GH1oUw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We need to use all the tools of government”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5FjGs"&gt;In a Congress that loves to stall radical change, &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22319564/filibuster-reform-manchin-democrats-nuclear-option"&gt;largely due to the filibuster&lt;/a&gt;, these sweeping competition reforms are picking up an unusual amount of momentum. At Wednesday’s House press conference on the package, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle — including the most progressive and conservative parts of the parties — called on their colleagues to support the measures. Khan’s nomination was approved bipartisanly in the Senate as well, suggesting there could be broad consensus on these reforms in the upper chamber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bzXjgJ"&gt;That consensus is important for Khan, too, since the FTC can’t push forward on her aggressive agenda without help from Congress. The FTC is still relatively weak in comparison to the large tech firms it’s seeking to regulate, with &lt;a href="https://bigtechnology.substack.com/p/its-ridiculous-underfunded-us-regulators"&gt;less than $350 million a year&lt;/a&gt; compared to the billions that companies like Facebook can spend to protect their business. It will take a full-court press approach from every branch of the government to take on Big Tech, competition experts say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ummwj6"&gt;“We need to use all the tools of government, and actually add some new tools, to get at this problem,” Charlotte Slaiman, competition policy director for Public Knowledge, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; Wednesday. “It’s going to require action at the FTC, Congress, and the DOJ.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9UxviN"&gt;Still, the Biden administration is dragging its feet when it comes to beefing up the Justice Department. Even though Attorney General Merrick Garland was praised by tech critics for his antitrust experience, Biden has yet to nominate anyone to lead the department’s antitrust division. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/01/18/biden-big-tech-antitrust-renata-hesse/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Intercept &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that two attorneys who previously advised tech companies could be tapped for the role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1HSxx"&gt;For now, the FTC has a majority of Democrats at the commission, but this could change in the coming days and weeks. Democratic Commissioner Rohit Chopra was nominated to lead the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, and once confirmed for the role, the agency would be deadlocked yet again. This creates a small window for Khan to take aggressive action before a third Democrat could be confirmed at the agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RSOmSC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best cheap wireless earbuds to buy in 2021</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Spending a little on any of these picks will get you a lot&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="NS3KAj"&gt;As fantastic as products like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;Sony WF-1000XM4, Bose QuietComfort Earbuds, and AirPods Pro are&lt;/a&gt;, it doesn’t take spending over $200 to get a perfectly good set of wireless earbuds. You can even drop below the price level of Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Plus or Jabra’s Elite 75ts and still find something that’ll do the job just fine. For this set of recommendations, I’m going to stick to an MRSP of around $100, give or take $30 in either direction. Odds are at least a few of these picks will go on sale for Amazon Prime Day 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1svWxl"&gt;You can find an endless list of true wireless earbuds under $100 on Amazon from random brands you’ve probably never heard of. But I’m sticking with some tried and true companies that can also be had in retail stores — and are more likely to have established customer support. Just because you’re being sensible about money doesn’t mean you should be left in the lurch if something goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="isVeDE"&gt;These picks won’t fully match the audio fidelity or deep bench of features of premium earbuds. You’ll give up things like active noise cancellation and wireless charging in severa lcases, but they’re still plenty enjoyable in their own right — and retain a lot of the convenience factor and freedom that make true wireless buds so appealing to begin with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ld4FN1"&gt;The best cheap wireless earbuds for 2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="XSyAdn"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Skullcandy Jib True Wireless, pictured on a table, are the best cheap wireless earbuds you can get for $30." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZU4D1FItK_aqVgzRYj8DirN8l9M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22053521/skullcandy.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Okay, so maybe the blue / yellow / red combo looks like it came out of a Happy Meal, but at least there’s also a black option.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RcfPyY"&gt;1. Skullcandy Jib True&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="1Wt5c7"&gt;Best cheap wireless earbuds for $30&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="SoeNT5"&gt;Skullcandy just recently put out its most affordable pair of true wireless earbuds yet. The $29.99 Jib True — available in black or this very attention-getting mix of blue, red, and yellow — manage to deliver a solid mix of specs and serviceable sound quality. Battery life lasts up to six hours, they’ve got the status quo IPX4 sweat resistance rating, and you can use either of the earbuds independently. That last part is something that many more expensive earbuds (hi, Jabra) still don’t offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="71tVI6"&gt;The earbud controls aren’t customizable, but Skullcandy packs in &lt;a href="https://support.skullcandy.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052905534-Jib-True"&gt;pretty much all of the functions you’d want&lt;/a&gt; (track skip / back, volume, voice assistant, and play / pause) into the large single button on each earbud. They’ve been easy to memorize in my time testing the Jib True buds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BUJ1yM"&gt;If there’s one hangup with the Jib True, it’s that Skullcandy hasn’t really optimized them for use with multiple devices. Whereas pricier earbuds tend to remember a handful of pairing sources, the company recommends that you delete these from their current device’s Bluetooth list before repairing with another. It’s not the end of the world, but it’s also fairly inconvenient. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X335IA"&gt;As for how they sound, I found that the Jib True made for a solid seal in my ear with the included large-sized tips. This always helps with bass response, and the Jib True definitely put most of their sonic weight behind the bass. It’s to the point where the low end is overemphasized and takes away from the mid- and high-range frequencies. I’m guessing that’s partly intentional since a more neutral sound signature would reveal the inherent weaknesses of $30 earbuds. Acoustic guitars lack warmth, and everything here feels like it’s happening in the middle of your head, so the soundstage is quite narrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="frNXSS"&gt;But… 30 bucks, folks. The Jib True earbuds never made me want to rip them out of my ears from audio agony, and I consider that a win. Nor did I run into sync issues when watching videos, and their connectivity proved robust and dependable when walking around busy Brooklyn streets. Perhaps most surprising of all, Skullcandy backs these $30 earbuds with a two-year warranty. If I do have one gripe, it’s that they use a Micro USB connector. We’re supposed to be long past that now, but I can forgive it for the price point. If you’re willing to spend more, stepping up to Skullcandy’s pricier earbuds like the $50 Evo Sesh will get you improved audio and other features like integrated Tile tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="The OnePlus Buds Z deliver a full sound in a small, affordable package." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rPhEbpBGp3SbOTFb5E-5_HHjuaA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22053533/oneplus.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unlike the original OnePlus Buds, the OnePlus Buds Z have silicone tips for an in-ear seal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CDNazR"&gt;2. OnePlus Buds Z&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Q3b8I0"&gt;Great cheap wireless earbuds for $50&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="zyhYIp"&gt;Jokes about their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/13/21435637/us-cbp-counterfeit-airpods-oneplus-buds-mixup"&gt;troubles with customs aside&lt;/a&gt;, I wasn’t enthralled with the original OnePlus Buds. Hard plastic one-size-fits-all earbuds never work out well for me, and these weren’t an exception. But the newer (and less expensive) OnePlus Buds Z, on the other hand, are a much better fit. These ones have traditional silicone tips and sit way more securely in my ears. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sVbYpz"&gt;Despite their $49.99 price, the OnePlus Buds Z include convenience features like auto-pause when an earbud is removed, and they also support Android’s NFC-based Fast Pair for quick setup. And they’re rated a surprisingly durable IP55 for dust and water resistance, making them a good pick for workouts — as long as you’re okay with no ambient sound mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9q58ky"&gt;Battery life is likely their biggest weakness. OnePlus estimates they can last up to five hours of continuous playback, but I’ve averaged a bit over four hours so far. But you at least get several full recharges from the case, which the company says has 20 hours worth of juice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4rpG5H"&gt;The controls are also a bit rudimentary. Out of the box, all you can do is double tap to skip tracks. If you use an Android phone that &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt; made by OnePlus, you can install the &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.heytap.headset&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;gl=US"&gt;HeyMelody app&lt;/a&gt; to configure the earbuds’ tap controls a bit more; OnePlus phones will let you do this once the earbuds are connected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hr7F7O"&gt;I’ve been quite pleased with how the OnePlus Buds Z sound. They’ve got smaller drivers than the regular OnePlus Buds but still output a nicely rounded audio profile. Again, the emphasis is on bass (and the treble is boosted), but it’s not quite so blatant as with the $30 Skullcandys. Watching videos across a few devices worked fine, and I didn’t have any connectivity problems. Also, unlike the Skullcandys, the OnePlus Buds Z work nicely with more than one device. You can long-press either earbud for three seconds to switch back and forth between the two most recently paired devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kd71BW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9591155"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="fdgLlX"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel Buds A-Series are so good, there’s little reason to get Google’s more expensive earbuds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="L7rhDk"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22465651/google-pixel-buds-a-series-earbuds-review-features-price"&gt;Google Pixel Buds A-Series&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4wsda2"&gt;Best cheap wireless earbuds for hands-free Google Assistant&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="yf4cAH"&gt;Google’s Pixel Buds A-Series offer the same sound quality and hands-free “Hey Google” voice commands as the 2020 Pixel Buds for a much lower price. The Google Assistant integration lets you receive audio alerts for incoming notifications and is a convenient way of controlling your music or smart home devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f9WrdG"&gt;The Pixel Buds A-Series look very similar to the pricier Pixel Buds, but these earbuds are lighter in your ears and retain the same IPX4 rating for water and sweat resistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dP9bMR"&gt;You do give up some conveniences in exchange for the lower price: there’s no wireless charging, nor direct volume controls, and the earbuds still exhibit occasional connection dropouts — though not nearly to the same extent as last year’s Google buds. But the Pixel Buds A-Series preserve the best aspects of the pricier pair, and there’s frankly little reason to upgrade when you can get these for $100.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Anker Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Pro are the best cheap earbuds for noise cancellation and voice calls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6JHmGR"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22323748/anker-liberty-air-2-pro-review-wireless-headphone-price"&gt;Anker Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Pro&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="uhRGQ3"&gt;Best cheap noise-canceling earbuds&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="XrdXY1"&gt;Anker’s Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Pro improve on the standard model thanks to the inclusion of active noise cancellation. They’ve got a comfortable design, good sound quality, and the mics perform well for voice calls. Anker also includes wireless charging and an IPX4 rating for water and sweat resistance. And you get a ton of ear tips in the box to help find the ideal fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P1QEtv"&gt;The Liberty Air 2 Pros can last for up to six hours on a charge with noise cancellation enabled — or seven in situations where you don’t need it. Anker’s robust smartphone app also provides many options for EQ customization, and you can adjust the balance of noise cancellation and ambient sound to your liking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nsJVNo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10609698"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="iLyYB2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gh1ia5"&gt;5. 1More ColorBuds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Nd8ldy"&gt;Best cheap wireless earbuds for style&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7NIyq4"&gt;1More is one of those companies that’s quietly been making great audio products for a long time. With the ColorBuds, the focus is on comfort — each bud weighs only 4.1 grams, barely more than an AirPod — and looks. Sound quality is also a clear step above the previous two picks, with greater clarity, a wider soundstage, and more nuance in general. (There’s still plenty of bass kick, though.) You’d hope for good sound at their $100 price, and these do come through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ox69lp"&gt;Battery life is up to six hours of continuous listening (22 with the case), and the ColorBuds are rated IPX5 for water and sweat resistance. While most of the picks on this list support the standard AAC and SBC Bluetooth codecs, 1More adds Apt-X to the mix on Android. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aXhiYb"&gt;The ColorBuds are available in a handful of attractive colors which, combined with the price and excellent performance, might be enough to sway some people toward them instead of AirPods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UjtTdU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9591243"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Xifr5L"&gt;

&lt;h2 id="vEgPSK"&gt;6. Anker Soundcore Liberty Air 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Y8OziV"&gt;Best cheap wireless earbuds for voice calls&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7QRNj1"&gt;Though they press right up against our $100 price ceiling, Anker’s Soundcore Liberty Air 2 remain one of the best pairs of “budget” true wireless earbuds on the market. They’re somewhat AirPods-like in design, thanks to the long stems, but this results in the best microphone performance of anything in this price bracket. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YlIGzP"&gt;The Liberty Air 2s also have lengthy battery life, lasting for up to seven hours of straight playback. (With the case, you get 28 hours of battery life in total.) Sound quality is enjoyable but falls short of what you’d get with the 1More buds — and Anker’s tap controls can prove a bit finicky at times. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beats Flex are the first earbuds from the company to use a USB-C connector.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MflDB8"&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522700/beats-flex-wireless-earbuds-review"&gt;Beats Flex&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="OdxZx0"&gt;Best neckband-style cheap wireless earbuds&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="89cSQz"&gt;Not everyone loves the concept of earbuds without a wire connecting them, and if that’s you, the recent Beats Flex are a great option — and that still applies for people with Android phones. These $50 “neckbuds” improve upon the older Beats X in several ways: they charge over USB-C instead of Apple’s Lightning connector, they have long-lasting battery life of up to 12 hours, and the built-in microphone is a reliable performer for voice and Zoom calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5EOFB5"&gt;The Beats Flex sound better than AirPods and many earbuds at this price range and beyond. They’ve also got a convenient auto-pause feature when you attach the two earbuds together via their magnetic connection. Connectivity is free of any dropouts or other issues, and iPhone owners can expect the usual instant setup process just by bringing the Beats Flex close to their phone. But Beats also has an Android app that lets you customize settings and shows the remaining battery percentage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Y7758"&gt;One downside is that the Flex buds aren’t rated for water or sweat resistance, so I can’t recommend them for the gym. But outside of that, they’re a great pick. Sometimes it’s nice to just let earbuds hang around your neck when not in use instead of fussing with a charging case. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s WF-XB700 are the best budget wireless earbuds if you can find them on sale. They offer terrific performance, a steady fit, and lengthy battery life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7V93kL"&gt;8. Sony WF-XB700 earbuds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="iNsCq6"&gt;Best cheap wireless earbuds if you love bass&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PpQzHU"&gt;I’m a big fan of Sony’s entry-level true wireless earbuds, the WF-XB700s. I’ve owned a pair for several months now, and I’ve never once had to put up with connection problems, battery frustrations, or other bugs. They also fit better and seal more tightly in my ears than pretty much anything on this list. Your results may vary, but there’s something about the design that works tremendously well with my ears. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="42EBDX"&gt;The XB700 buds last for up to nine hours of continuous listening and have all the oomph you could ever want. It can border on too much, but Sony does a nice job of not letting the bass take away from everything else. The mids and high frequencies aren’t drowned out. These earbuds stick out of your ears a bit more than most, and they lack any kind of ambient sound mode — which some might see as a negative considering how good the passive noise isolation is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4iNvvN"&gt;I quite like the matte finish on the XB700s and their charging case, and the buds lock into the case with a stronger magnetic pull than is typical; this has always ensured they juice up as expected. They use physical buttons on each earbud for controls, which I prefer over touch gestures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5KybL"&gt;Technically, the Sonys retail for over $100, but they’re on sale for so frequently that they’re still worth a mention. There’s a ton to like about them, even if there’s nothing flashy about them. They’re a great example of Sony keeping things simple and doing it right. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best phone to buy right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone 12, Galaxy S21 Ultra, Galaxy S21 Plus, iPhone 12 Mini, Galaxy Z Fold 2, and Pixel 4A 5G" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2xXWN-t57Q2UyqQv662Bj9KonMk=/158x0:1883x1150/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68490961/Best_Phone_Grid_2021_2.7.png" /&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Buying a new phone can be a chore, but we’ve done the work for you&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="OauOjO"&gt;In 2021, buying the best phone means looking for something that should last you a few years. Smartphones’ upgrade cycles are slowing down for a reason: even at lower prices, it’s getting harder and harder to buy a lemon. In other words, you don’t have to spend a huge amount to get something great, as a bunch of great smartphones are available for around $800. It’s harder than ever to decide between everything in that range, but for most people, our pick for the best phone is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple iPhone 12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SLLWfM"&gt;Luckily, if you’re looking for a no-compromise smartphone at any price, the choices over a thousand dollars are much clearer. If you like Android, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is incredibly good. And if you want to get the best smartphone on a budget, you can find something really good for under $500 or even under $400. For those recommendations, you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2018/7/27/17619088/best-cheap-phone-budget-iphone-android"&gt;check out our guide to budget smartphones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IJpqAH"&gt;A great smartphone will last you for several years (at least), have a great camera, a nice screen, long battery life, and be fast enough to do all the work, social networking, and gaming you want to pack into a day. Believe it or not, all of those things are easier than ever to find in a phone — so picking the best one is often a matter of degrees or preferences. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DK8L4P"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WnjecW"&gt;Best iPhone to buy in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="wW82H0"&gt;Apple has released four different variations of the iPhone 12, more than it ever has at one time. Despite all of those choices, the traditional, regular model is still a good pick. The regular iPhone 12, which starts at around $830 for a 64GB model, is the best smartphone for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VycfOO"&gt;The 12 has the same overall design, the same processor, the same wireless charging, the same Face ID system, the same 5G support, the same front camera, and the same main and wide-angle rear cameras as the pricier 12 Pro but for hundreds of dollars less. On top of all that, it comes in five colors, one more than you can choose from in the Pro models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wUSPTz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The iPhone 12 balances a big screen with manageable size well&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vgfddW"&gt;Compared to the iPhone 12 mini, the iPhone 12 has a noticeably roomier display and a bigger battery — two things that are important to many people. At 6.1 inches, it’s big enough to make watching video and reading text comfortable and engaging, but it isn’t so big that it’s terribly hard to use in one hand or fit in your pocket. Battery life is also very good; you can reliably expect this phone to last all day without needing to charge up before bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3CpBRz"&gt;The 12 gives up the telephoto camera that’s available on the 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max, but that’s something not everyone will miss. The iPhone 12’s camera system is the best you can get in this price range and is excellent at most anything you’d use it for. It also has the ability to shoot Dolby Vision HDR for brighter and more dynamic video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UaJMCS"&gt;Since the 12 has Apple’s latest smartphone processor, the A14 Bionic, it has extremely fast performance and fluid animations. It also has a sleeker, more modern design than the previous iPhone 11 or iPhone XR, which feel frumpy in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A4Yr6F"&gt;The base iPhone 12 comes with 64GB of storage, but as usual with an iPhone, it’s not expandable, so we recommend buying the 128GB model for only $50 more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qsBso"&gt;In all, the iPhone 12 is an easy choice for most people: it offers top-level performance, design, and camera features, while providing reliable battery life for less money than other options on the market.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="2t2EER"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="GxgXJO"&gt;Best Android phone to buy in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="KXRoWF"&gt;If neither size nor price is a concern, the best Android phone you can buy right now is the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra. With a big 6.8-inch screen and the best cameras you can get on an Android phone, it’s the no-compromise pick. In some cases, its cameras can even best the iPhone 12 Pro Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zc0tSW"&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra comes with the latest and best specs you can get on Android. It has the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor, which is the fastest you can get on Android. It features support for S Pen styluses if you prefer to use a pen with your phone, although it’s sold separately. The screen has a high refresh rate, which makes scrolling much smoother. It also has a huge battery that will last two days without much effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNdn1U"&gt;Samsung updated the design of the S21 Ultra, with a metal rail that curves naturally into the camera bump on the back. It is the best-looking big phone you can get right now. However, we can’t say we like Samsung’s software as much, which at the moment is a bit cluttered and features ads in places like the weather app. For a sleeker experience the OnePlus 9 Pro would be a good choice; the Ultra beats it on screen and camera quality, but it’s a good device all-around and offers a more grown-up take on Android OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOuzp6"&gt;That camera bump houses four cameras: a regular wide-angle with a 108-megapixel sensor, an ultrawide, and two different telephoto lenses. This makes it an incredibly versatile camera system that also has a ton of advanced video features like Pro modes and 8K recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b68lAw"&gt;Starting at $1,199.99, the Galaxy S21 Ultra is a very expensive phone. Thankfully, Samsung phones are discounted early and often. If you are in the market for one, it’s worth looking around for a deal before buying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="wFbUhR"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 / S21 Plus&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kVG4SO"&gt;Best Android phone to find a deal for&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="bwT4eg"&gt;Although the Samsung Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus don’t post the big numbers the S21 Ultra does, they are still our picks right now for best Android phones under a thousand bucks. The regular Galaxy S21 with a 6.2-inch screen starts at $800 while the Plus version with a 6.7-inch screen starts at $1,000. However, both are frequently discounted with either price drops or bundles, so these are great candidates for hunting down sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7grLVJ"&gt;The Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus are essentially identical phones with three differences: screen size, battery size, and materials. We’ve reviewed the regular Galaxy S21 and found it to be a very competent phone even though you could argue it’s a minor refresh over last year’s Galaxy S20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5EbSGE"&gt;However, Samsung refreshed the important part: the processor is the same Snapdragon 888 as the Ultra. That means the Galaxy S21 is super fast and should last more than a couple of years without slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHvvhF"&gt;There are likely more great Android phones coming soon but right now, the Android phone that strikes the best balance of features and price is the S21.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max is huge, but it has the best camera system on a smartphone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;h2 id="QzSdip"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="FUQpEY"&gt;Best phone for photography and video in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="G0d3Pt"&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max has the best camera system you can currently get on a smartphone. Its three rear cameras — standard wide, ultrawide, and telephoto — combine with Apple’s image processing to produce stunning images, even in poor lighting. If camera quality is your most important factor when buying a phone, the 12 Pro Max is where you should be spending your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CCe5L2"&gt;The big difference between the 12 Pro Max and the other iPhone 12 models is found in its main camera sensor. The 12 Pro Max has a physically larger camera sensor that allows it to gather more light and produce better-quality images when in dark or challenging lighting conditions. In addition, the 12 Pro Max has an improved image stabilization system that helps keep your images sharp as light levels drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3IjBeK"&gt;But unless camera quality is all you care about, the 12 Pro Max isn’t the best iPhone for most people. It’s enormous, and the squared sides make it feel even bigger than its spec sheet implies. Most people will be happier with the smaller but still large-screened iPhone 12.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 mini is small enough to be used in one hand by almost anybody.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hvSkHC"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555295/iphone-12-mini-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 12 mini&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IZTX1K"&gt;Best small smartphone in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="n8BP66"&gt;There’s really only one reason to buy an iPhone 12 mini, but it’s an important one: if you want a phone that’s easier to use in one hand or put into a small pocket. The iPhone 12 mini is one of very few small phones on the market with top-tier features and specs; you don’t have to compromise in performance, build quality, or cameras with this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNVbxg"&gt;Though it’s much smaller in size than the other iPhones released this year, the mini’s 5.4-inch screen is still big enough for text messaging, email, web browsing, apps, video, and games, and if you’re coming from an iPhone 6 / 7 / 8, it will feel quite spacious. But it’s also small enough that most adults, even those with small hands, will be able to comfortably reach all of the screen with their thumb. You won’t need a PopSocket on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Em0efZ"&gt;Otherwise, the mini is the same phone as the iPhone 12: it has the same design, processor, cameras, 5G support, and build quality as the larger model. It’s just smaller and has a smaller price tag, at about $100 less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7KsgWM"&gt;If you prefer Android, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22431051/asus-zenfone-8-review"&gt;Asus Zenfone 8&lt;/a&gt; is a good alternative. It’s a little bigger than the 12 mini with a 5.9-inch screen, and it doesn’t work on Verizon, but it’s otherwise a very similar proposition: great build quality, top-notch processor, and high-end features like a 120Hz screen all tucked into a pocket-friendly device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="MPtDpR"&gt;If you want a stylus built into your phone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="efDFTK"&gt;If you’re looking for the best phone to go from morning to night with heavy use and last through it all, Samsung’s top-of-the-line Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is the one to get. It has a massive 4,500mAh battery that keeps its enormous 6.9-inch screen going as long as you need it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u3wWez"&gt;The Note 20 Ultra is also a high-end phone in every other respect. Its giant screen supports a 120Hz refresh rate for smooth interactions; its triple rear camera system is one of the most advanced you can get; and the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Plus processor and 12GB of RAM allow it to perform without a hiccup. In addition, it supports Samsung’s S Pen for stylus input, allowing you to write or doodle on the screen with a pen instead of your finger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S6gOEi"&gt;Although you can now use a stylus with the Galaxy S21 Ultra, it isn’t built into the phone as it is here on the Note 20 Ultra. Depending on Samsung’s plans, this may be the last “Ultra” version of the Note, too — though rumors have been conflicting on that front. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="uUgURs"&gt;The OnePlus 9 is the step-down model from the OnePlus 9 Pro, which is itself an excellent phone. But you don’t give up too much by opting for the 9, and you save a ton of money. Like the 9 Pro, it offers great performance with a Snapdragon 888 processor, fast 65W wired charging, and something that will appeal especially to the landscape photographers out there: a great ultrawide camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qa2S7w"&gt;The sensor behind the OnePlus 9’s ultrawide camera is physically larger than most and offers a healthy 50-megapixel resolution. A unique lens design corrects distortion without introducing the funhouse mirror-type stretching you’ll often see in the corners of ultrawide images. And if super-wide photography isn’t your thing, know that the main camera turns in solid image quality, too. Images are well-exposed, and colors look pleasantly vibrant. OnePlus makes a big deal of the Hasselblad color science at work here, which does a fine job but isn’t as mind-blowingly good as the company suggests.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O804KE"&gt;Unfortunately, you do miss out on a couple of good camera features opting for the 9 rather than the 9 Pro. The main camera on the 9 Pro offers optical image stabilization, which isn’t included on the 9, and is useful for its ability to keep subjects looking sharp in lower light conditions. There’s also no telephoto lens — just digital zoom, which isn’t as good as the 9 Pro’s optical zoom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxzBBh"&gt;The OnePlus 9 also doesn’t work on AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G network. (It works on both T-Mobile and Verizon’s 5G networks, however.) That’s no great loss right now (honestly, it might be for the better), but in a couple of years, this will probably become a downside. Bearing this in mind and a couple of camera feature omissions, the OnePlus 9 is an excellent device. It offers a flagship feel and performance for a bit less than the highest-end Android options and a seriously good ultrawide camera for wide-angle photo fans.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The A52 5G offers a large 6.5-inch screen with 120Hz refresh rate, a feature that’s not too common yet in the midrange class.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="z3SklF"&gt;8. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399456/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A52 5G&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="7spKRS"&gt;Best cheap phone with high-end features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="gfmz0Z"&gt;The Galaxy A52 5G is our current pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21420196/best-budget-smartphone-cheap"&gt;best Android phone under $500&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s also worth highlighting here for its combination of features usually reserved for premium devices and a reasonable price. You won’t get all the bells and whistles of the S21 series phones, of course, but the A52 5G includes a 6.5-inch screen with fast 120Hz refresh rate, an IP67 water resistance rating, and (for now, at least) access to monthly bug fixes and security updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rl0lbP"&gt;The A52 5G delivers on the basics too. Its Snapdragon 750G processor isn’t the fastest in the game but it keeps up well with day-to-day tasks. Its 4,500mAh battery delivers well over a day of moderate to heavy use. And the phone supports sub-6GHz 5G, which will allow it to take advantage of improving 5G networks in the US over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q5qamU"&gt;Then there’s the typically Samsung-y stuff, including a UI that’s currently trending toward over-cluttered with the occasional unwelcome ad. The phone’s camera hardware is good, though photos tend to look a little oversaturated, which may or may not suit your taste. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcPo00"&gt;One of the phone’s best features is Samsung’s commitment to providing four years of security updates. Overall, it’s a relatively affordable device with a solid feature set that should keep up for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s Pixel 4A is the best Android phone under $500.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yteQuG"&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Google Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WMeIkj"&gt;Best Android phone under $400&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="cBeDqy"&gt;If you’re on a budget and prefer Android, then the Google Pixel 4A is the obvious choice. It doesn’t have the largest screen or the fastest processor, but it does have a clean version of Android that’s guaranteed to get software updates for at least three years. It only comes in one version: black with 128GB of storage for $349.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tZEqw2"&gt;The Pixel 4A’s main claim to fame is its camera, which can go head-to-head with smartphones that cost $1,500 or more. That’s because Google does so much of the image processing in software — the sensor itself is actually quite old and not very special. It means the Pixel 4A can take night photos, do astrophotography, and has a passable portrait mode. It can’t hang with the iPhone SE for video but beats it for photos every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZsgOa"&gt;The rest of the Pixel 4A’s specs are good but not great. It has a 5.8-inch screen, just enough RAM to keep apps from closing in the background, and a headphone jack. There’s no wireless charging, no fancy face unlock, and the body is made out of plastic instead of something more premium like glass. The Pixel 4A doesn’t even offer any IP water resistance ratings (but a splash of water is probably fine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ftzlw6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556642"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sUP4Y7"&gt;But for all that, the Pixel 4A is probably the safest bet if you want to get an Android phone for less than $400. You’ll get better software support and a better camera for $350. Not a bad deal.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 2 is expensive, extravagant, and the easiest way to fit a tablet-sized screen into your pocket.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mre8Bq"&gt;10. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4x700N"&gt;Best folding phone in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="JDL8H8"&gt;Folding phones have been around for less than two years and have already seen their share of controversies. But if you are interested in buying one and are willing to pay the hefty price required, there’s really only one model worth considering: Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Mbw2f"&gt;The Fold 2 is Samsung’s second-generation folding phone. Its main premise is this: it is sized like a normal smartphone that fits in your pocket, but it unfolds to reveal a tablet-sized 7.6-inch display on the inside. That inside screen makes everything from reading books to browsing the web to watching video to playing games more enjoyable and immersive. When you’re done using it, just fold it back up and stick it in your pocket just like any other phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKplTb"&gt;That flexibility is unmatched by any other phone you can buy right now, but it doesn’t come without a significant list of compromises. The Fold 2 is twice as thick when closed compared to normal phones, and its outside screen is much smaller than what you’re probably used to. It is also delicate; there’s no rated dust or water resistance, and its inner screen is more likely to get damaged if you poke it too hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Rta9KS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10215758"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Fp3cHb"&gt;But the biggest compromise is its cost: the Fold 2 is roughly twice as expensive as other high-end phones. Since it debuted for $2,000, it’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364162/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-5g-price-cut-announced-1800"&gt;permanently marked down by $200&lt;/a&gt;, but you’re still paying a lot for the ability to fold a tablet screen in half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="xA969T"&gt;If you’re willing to put up with those compromises for an experience that’s unlike anything else, though, the Fold 2 delivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iahfYJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AKGbug"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Podcasts start coming to Facebook next week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DRoyqGercObThBfX7AGR-INk8zw=/0x0:1590x1060/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69462339/facebookpodcasts.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BZ5xSl"&gt;Facebook is planning to start rolling out its podcast product next week, on June 22nd, and, eventually, add a feature that’ll allow listeners to create clips from their favorite shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AUX02w"&gt;According to an email sent to podcast page owners and viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, hosts can link their show’s RSS feed up to Facebook, which will then automatically generate News Feed posts for all episodes published moving forward. These episodes will show up on a “podcasts” tab that doesn’t appear to be live yet, but that the company teased in a wider announcement about audio initiatives &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391551/facebook-audio-podcasts-clubhouse-competitor-spotify-live-rooms"&gt;in April&lt;/a&gt;. (You can see it below.) &lt;em&gt;Podnews&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://podnews.net/update/podcast-ads-vs-tv-ads"&gt;first reported&lt;/a&gt; the date earlier this month, and at the time, Facebook confirmed with &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that a limited number of page owners would have access. However, emails are still being sent to additional page owners, suggesting the rollout might be wider than initially anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="883Lfd"&gt;“Facebook will be the place where people can enjoy, discuss, and share the podcasts they love with each other,” the company says in this email.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nfP0MQvs8OGeevlTQKNWZK8ei74=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22455083/Podcasts_Listening.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pages will eventually have a tab for podcasts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ROIuHo"&gt;Podcasters who publish on the platform will also be opting into Facebook’s podcast terms of service, which you can &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/podcast_terms"&gt;view here&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a relatively standard agreement, although it doesn’t have clear limits around what exactly Facebook can do with the podcasts distributed on its platform. For example, it grants Facebook the rights to make derivative works, which may be necessary for distributing shows in certain formats, but also might alarm podcasters who are protective over their IP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OtQjQw"&gt;Along with the option to distribute their show through Facebook, podcasters can decide whether to enable clips, which the company says will be created by listeners and last up to one minute in length. These “may help increase visibility and engagement.” Presumably, these will be easily shareable outside of the podcaster’s page. Short-form clips have been a key way for Twitch streamers to share moments from their lengthy streams, and Facebook seems to hope the same idea can apply to podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1uTt9GJBb7ePfo5nhwOWBq9biG0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22662942/Screen_Shot_2021_06_16_at_1.18.03_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the pop-up podcasters will see when they go to add their show’s RSS feed to Facebook.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HYKFbi"&gt;It’s unclear how Facebook is determining what pages belong to podcasters. My page, for example, received the option to publish &lt;em&gt;Why’d You Push That Button?&lt;/em&gt;, a show I co-host. I have only published links to webpages that have the show embedded, however, not the actual link to my podcast episode or RSS feed. I’ve reached out to Facebook for comment and will update if I hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MELnFX"&gt;Broadly, though, this update comes as the company begins a legitimate push into audio. Mark Zuckerberg hosted the first Live Audio Room in the US yesterday, and in April, the company also announced plans for a feature called Soundbites, which will live within the News Feed. The idea behind Soundbites is to give users a “sound studio in your pocket” and allow them to create short, shareable clips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5wdq5y"&gt;With podcasts, Facebook is seemingly banking on the fact that podcasters already use the platform to foster conversation with their listeners and to promote their shows. Directly publishing to the platform might make it easier for them to accomplish those goals while also giving people a reason to never leave the Facebook app. It’s also possible Facebook sees potential in podcast advertising, which Spotify has focused its efforts on as it launches exclusive shows and its own ad network. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon appears to have removed RavPower, a popular phone battery and charger brand </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vPQ7yC9HkteJsyGz4Q_5f5FX2nQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69462083/akrales_180816_2836_0079.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H7Aqxw"&gt;One month ago, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428858/amazon-aukey-mpow-listings-disappearing"&gt;Amazon-first gadget brands Aukey and Mpow suddenly and mysteriously disappeared&lt;/a&gt; from the giant online retailer’s storefront, with almost all their electronics vanishing from Amazon’s shelves. Today, popular battery and charger brand RavPower has completely disappeared as well, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nicnguyen/status/1405202548760334339?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1405202548760334339%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc"&gt;as spotted by the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;’s Nicole Nguyen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ymIKjk"&gt;All of the company’s product listings have disappeared, leaving blank white spaces in RavPower’s Amazon storefront. Searches for “RavPower” don’t bring up any listings for products made by the company. Existing links to RavPower products either point to Amazon’s “Sorry, we couldn’t find that page” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/16/17577654/amazon-prime-day-website-down-deals-service-disruption"&gt;cute 404 dogs&lt;/a&gt;, or listings that read “Currently unavailable.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jOz0exolfEqLyA0V0e5YMvXZKWw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22662870/ravpower_amaozn_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;RavPower’s seller page is still up, but it’s empty.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zs6aQB"&gt;By and large, this is exactly what happened to Aukey, Mpow, and other lesser-known electronics retailers last month — except here, whoever did this has been a bit more thorough. You can actually still find a couple of Aukey listings on Amazon, while RavPower seems to have none. Another important difference may be that &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ravpower.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F16%2F22536976%2Famazon-ravpower-battery-charger-removed-amazon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;RavPower has its own separate online shop&lt;/a&gt; that ranks high in Google search, so it may not strictly need to depend on Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMXCKX"&gt;Amazon and RavPower didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment, but we’re not expecting much: Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428858/amazon-aukey-mpow-listings-disappearing"&gt;would not tell us last month&lt;/a&gt; if it actually removed Aukey and Mpow, merely giving us a generic statement that suggested it generally suspends sellers that violate “the integrity of our store.” Then, Aukey and Mpow didn’t respond to requests for comment at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IyKGyo"&gt;But it’s not hard to imagine what happened here: on Sunday, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fake-reviews-and-inflated-ratings-are-still-a-problem-for-amazon-11623587313"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s Nicole Nguyen ran a story&lt;/a&gt; about how her new RavPower charger included an offer for a $35 gift card in exchange for a review, something that Amazon confirmed was a violation of company policy. Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/3/13155578/amazon-incentivized-reviews-ban-vine-program-product-bias"&gt;banned incentivized reviews&lt;/a&gt; in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cSx9lL"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Following my fake review story, listings for Amazon-native electronics brand RAVPower are gone. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The company offered $35 gift cards for reviews on a product that was sold directly by Amazon itself. RAVPower acted as a wholesale vendor on that listing.&lt;a href="https://t.co/6nazZZ5Wtb"&gt;https://t.co/6nazZZ5Wtb&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/znp9u48YHV"&gt;pic.twitter.com/znp9u48YHV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— nicole nguyen (@nicnguyen) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nicnguyen/status/1405202548760334339?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iEEseZ"&gt;Fake, inflated, paid, and other forms of scammy reviews run rampant on Amazon (and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;other online platforms&lt;/a&gt;, to be fair), and I get cards like these in my random Amazon purchases all the time. It’s weird to think that RavPower would need to stoop to this behavior, though: we’ve regularly featured good products that the company makes, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;our favorite wireless charging pad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X8ctEj"&gt;Amazon is actively trying to clamp down on this kind of fraud, though it’s not always successful. &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/how-amazon-works/creating-a-trustworthy-reviews-experience"&gt;In a Wednesday blog post&lt;/a&gt; that explains some of its enforcement efforts, the company says it “stopped more than 200 million suspected fake reviews before they were ever seen by a customer” in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jaguar Land Rover says it’s developing a hydrogen-powered prototype vehicle</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tmnuJH0i5HJ-ymqxpYFDldgEEiA=/0x12:2000x1345/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69461987/jaguar_land_rover.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Jaguar Land Rover&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uva88C"&gt;Jaguar Land Rover is working on a prototype hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV), which it plans to start testing later this year, the company announced. The vehicle is based on its Land Rover Defender, and the company says it will focus its testing on “key attributes” such as fuel consumption and off-road capabilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eFRiVF"&gt;The FCEV is part of the &lt;a href="https://www.jaguarlandrover.com/reimagine"&gt;company’s strategy&lt;/a&gt; to achieve zero tailpipe emissions by 2036 and net zero carbon emissions across its supply chain and operations by 2039. Fuel cell electric vehicles generate electricity from hydrogen to power their electric motors, and Jaguar Land Rover considers them complementary to battery electric vehicles. “We know hydrogen has a role to play in the future powertrain mix across the whole transport industry, and alongside battery electric vehicles, said Ralph Clague, head of the company’s hydrogen and fuel cells division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YX8rOa"&gt;The tech behind FCEVs makes them “ideal for larger, longer-range vehicles, or those operated in hot or cold environments,” Jaguar Land Rover said in its announcement, as the vehicles “provide high energy density and rapid refuelling, and minimal loss of range in low temperatures.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2yCXK7"&gt;Other carmakers have announced plans to develop hydrogen-powered vehicles; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391738/toyota-electric-vehicle-strategy-bz4x-concept-subaru"&gt;Toyota said in April &lt;/a&gt;that its electric vehicle strategy would include 70 new models by 2025, including hydrogen fuel cell models. And even though Honda discontinued its Clarity EV last year, the company says it plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22399212/honda-gas-car-phase-out-2040-electric-vehicle"&gt;continue to make a hydrogen fuel cell version&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251582/gm-hydrogen-truck-navistar-oneh2-range-date"&gt;in January, General Motors announced&lt;/a&gt; a partnership with trucking firm Navistar and hydrogen fuel cell company OneH2 that includes plans for a fleet of zero-emission hydrogen fuel cell trucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0QWoOk"&gt;The US &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251582/gm-hydrogen-truck-navistar-oneh2-range-date"&gt;doesn’t yet have a robust fueling infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; for hydrogen vehicles, however; while there are 39 hydrogen fueling stations in California and a few in Hawaii, only a handful of stations are open along the East Coast so far. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Slack is rolling out a new scheduled send feature </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eMZ6nOpuNCzgjV7zF1h0Va_UAQ4=/0x24:1024x707/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69461856/Scheduled_Send.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="50GDWd"&gt;Slack has announced a &lt;a href="https://slack.com/help/articles/1500012915082"&gt;new Scheduled Send feature&lt;/a&gt; that the company is starting to roll out today, which — as the name implies — will let users schedule messages to send at a later time and date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mVJcaL"&gt;The scheduled send feature adds a new drop-down arrow to the green “send message” button in Slack’s desktop app. Clicking it will reveal a new menu that allows for scheduling a message to send to a room, direct message, or group thread later on. Mobile users will be able to access a similar menu by long-pressing on the send button in the Slack app on Android and iOS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tbG0zb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A better way to message co-workers across time zones&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rA553A"&gt;Slack will offer both pre-filled options (like “tomorrow morning at 9:00AM”) as well as the ability to set a custom date and time to send a message. Messages can be scheduled up to to 120 days in advance, and users will be able to reschedule, edit, or delete scheduled messages before they’re sent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xgi2vQ"&gt;“Today we launched Scheduled Send to empower users to communicate and collaborate in a way that works best for them,” the company announced in a statement, explaining that “teams shouldn’t be obligated to sync their schedules in order to communicate effectively.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x0bHYj"&gt;The ability to schedule messages is a critical one given the various time zones and locations that offices — both remote, in-person, and hybrid — stretch across in today’s work world. And while email services like Gmail have offered the ability to schedule emails for later (so that users aren’t pinging teams at odd hours or getting messages lost overnight), the feature has been notably absent from Slack until now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l7Eiwd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H2AaNY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>China, Russia aim for first joint astronaut Moon landings in next decade</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yHWjwz-PrvIuFTBqrT8yV9bugxU=/148x0:1729x1054/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69461853/Screen_Shot_2021_06_16_at_12.12.31_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fg0ddv"&gt;China and Russia expect to put their first crews of astronauts on the Moon sometime in the next decade, representatives said on Wednesday. Already established plans for their International Lunar Research Station (ILRS) include a lineup of robotic lunar missions and coming up with a legal framework for exploring the Moon, an effort similar to the NASA-led Artemis lunar program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F8SfvG"&gt;Officials from the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and Roscosmos, Russia’s space agency, gave a joint presentation during the Global Space Exploration Conference in Russia on their three-phase plan to build a network of Moon bases and satellites in lunar orbit. The space agencies formally teamed up on the project in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wQAl4j"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are still focusing on unmanned lunar exploration in the next ten years”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yxL9r6"&gt;The first and most of the second phase of the lunar project “is just preparatory work” involving uncrewed missions, Wu Yanhua, CNSA’s deputy director, said through a translator. “We are still focusing on unmanned lunar exploration in the next ten years,” he said, responding to an audience question on when the first Russian or Chinese astronauts will be on the Moon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CqQ22w"&gt;CNSA is currently focused on sending astronauts to its new low-Earth-orbiting space station, whose first module launched in April. The station’s first crew of three astronauts is expected to launch from China sometime this month for a three-month stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nxjpw8"&gt;Russia and China’s plans for a Moon presence set up a race between the countries and the US. Their ILRS is taking shape in parallel to NASA’s Artemis program, a multibillion-dollar effort to put US astronauts on the Moon as soon as 2024 and establish a long-term presence on the surface in the following decade. NASA is working with Japan, Canada, and the European Space Agency on a Lunar Gateway. The Gateway is a planned outpost orbiting the Moon designed to relay crews of astronauts to future base stations on the lunar surface. Russia, NASA’s biggest partner on the International Space Station, had been in talks with the US to participate in the Gateway program before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22321114/lunar-moon-space-station-russia-china-agreement-nasa"&gt;turning to China’s ILRS plan instead&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="17YXIv"&gt;China and Russia have said the ILRS is open to international partners, including NASA. The two countries are also working on a “dedicated legal framework” for exploring the Moon, Roscosmos deputy director-general Sergey Saveliev said at the conference. An initial version of the agreement should be ready by year’s end, Wu said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CXMyRb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We also welcome all the parties to participate in it and follow the legal framework”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PEChKY"&gt;That framework currently lags behind NASA’s Artemis Accords, a similar document that aims to set legal norms for the Moon operations under its Artemis program. US officials emphasize the Accords are an interpretation of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty that promotes peaceful coordination between countries on the Moon. NASA signed its eleventh partner, Brazil, onto the Artemis Accords on Tuesday, after courting other US allies like South Korea, Ukraine, Australia and the United Kingdom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ChVtGv"&gt;“We have already established a specialized legal team under the joint working group” for the China-Russia-led legal framework, Wu said during the conference panel. “We also welcome all the parties to participate in it and follow the legal framework.” Saveliev said Roscosmos is talking to the European Space Agency and the French space agency as prospective partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="m5Z8H8"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="ru" dir="ltr"&gt;Видеоконцепция создания Международной научной лунной станции    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;После презентации ознакомиться с Дорожной картой и Руководством по участию в проекте &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%D0%9C%D0%9D%D0%9B%D0%A1?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#МНЛС&lt;/a&gt; можно будет на официальных сайтах Роскосмоса и КНКА &lt;a href="https://t.co/DycyqhhPFZ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/DycyqhhPFZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— РОСКОСМОС (@roscosmos) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/roscosmos/status/1405137294076559364?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y2ndyB"&gt;The agenda for ILRS consists of three phases. The first phase, between 2021 and 2025, involves at least six robotic missions launching to the Moon, split evenly between China and Russia, that will scout future lunar landing locations and conduct scientific reconnaissance. The next phase, from 2026 to 2035, focuses heavily on construction, with “massive” cargo deliveries and the complete establishment of facilities in lunar orbit and on the Moon’s surface. The final phase begins in 2036, when routine operations begin. That includes “lunar research and exploration, technology verification, supporting human lunar landing[s] with the completed ILRS. Expanding and maintaining modules if needed,” a presentation slide said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mfazFb"&gt;Despite a stretched-out timeline for crewed Moon landings, NASA administrator Bill Nelson has cast China’s growing space capabilities as “aggressive,” pointing to Beijing’s lunar plans and its debut Mars landing last month as a reason for the US to race ahead for a 2024 Moon landing. He’s urged lawmakers to keep an eye on the country’s growing partnership with Russia, a longtime NASA ally in space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HSxNt7"&gt;“We are prepared to work with the US in space,” Russian president Vladimir Putin said in a NBC news interview on Monday, ahead of his meeting with President Joe Biden. “I think recently the head of NASA said that he could not imagine development of space programs without its partnership with Russia. We welcome this statement.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Twitch streamers fighting to keep minority languages alive</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mnKH1914-_s685uDcb0VFx2Hbo8=/0x1:2040x1361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69461643/acastro_210615_4632_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Entertainment meets activism&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="jot8Ho"&gt;Minority languages are often associated with aging rural communities, thought to have fallen out of use or confined to textbooks. Defined simply as a language spoken by less than half of the population in a country, they adapt with the times like any living language, often due to the efforts of enterprising young people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="tppJjg"&gt;Recently, many of these languages have found new life from an unexpected source: video game streamers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7FwH02"&gt;On Twitch, streamers from around the world are showcasing indigenous languages as a form of entertainment and activism. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nationalgeographic.com%2Fmagazine%2Farticle%2Fvanishing-languages&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F16%2F22533319%2Ftwitch-streamers-minority-languages-basque-gaelic" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Estimates&lt;/a&gt; show that we lose one language every two weeks, and half of our 7,000 languages will be extinct by the end of the century, so preserving these tongues and the cultural identities that go with them is crucial. With its easy access, potential for a huge audience, and creators’ ability to combine hobbies and language promotion, it’s easy to see why young minority language speakers have turned to Twitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f61fy4"&gt;Many minority language streamers lack an official language tag for their streams, and these creators see their content lost in the miscellany of the “Other” tag, making it hard for other speakers to find, connect with, and enjoy gaming in their own language. Good news arrived for some on May 26th when Twitch announced that it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/22/22448809/transgender-twitch-tags-lgbt-streaming-identity"&gt;add over 350 new stream tags&lt;/a&gt;, encompassing different ethnic groups and underrepresented communities. The platform was frank about how it has been slow to act on adding the tags users want. However, not all streamers received the opportunity for visibility they’d been hoping for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="3ApnaH"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="mXQUR7"&gt;Two groups who missed out were Basque and Galician streamers. Basque, which is native to the semi-autonomous Basque Country straddling southwestern France and northern Spain, is one of the oldest languages still spoken and unrelated to any other in the world. Further along the Iberian Peninsula, the Galician language is spoken by around 2.4 million people in a tiny corner of Spain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SPnr6z"&gt;Inspired by the success of the #CatalanLoveTwitch campaign, which saw the minority Romance language added as a streaming language tag, a group of Basque streamers launched #3000Twitz last December, a campaign to see their language achieve the same status. Despite a petition, which is by far the most voted in the Twitch User Voice forums and having now surpassed the number of votes the Catalan petition received, Basque streamers are still awaiting a response from the streaming giant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iDeOEH"&gt;Iruñe, who streams as arkkuso, is one of the founding members of the campaign. For her, the addition of Basque as a streaming language has broader implications for the survival and visibility of the language. “It is very important that Basque has a presence online and therefore on social networks,” she says. “Nowadays, if you’re not on the internet, you don’t exist. The same will happen very soon with languages.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="KJ3EQO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Nowadays, if you’re not on the internet, you don’t exist”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yfXrcY"&gt;Without the help of a tag to identify streamers, Iruñe feels that Twitch has made Basque creators invisible. As a result, the growth of the Basque streaming community has been entirely grassroots, and language activism is part and parcel of her channel. “I believe that at the end of the day, all of us who create content in Basque are [activists],” she says. “For many of us, the relationship we have with our mother tongue is fundamental for us when it comes to enjoying what we do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Vma0b"&gt;Fellow streamer and native Basque speaker Eneko found himself in a similar situation. “At first, I started streaming without knowing anyone on Twitch. And since there was no Basque language tag, I didn’t know if there were more people or if they were just very difficult to find. I hit a roadblock because I wanted to stream in Basque, but it meant not reaching anyone,” he says. The current camaraderie between Basque streamers and the popular support their campaign enjoys would have seemed like a fantasy when he first started out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S819fT"&gt;“When you meet people, it is through raids and not by randomly finding someone streaming the type of content you like. There are campaigns calling for double labeling because today, many of us speak several languages, and choosing only one (especially when one is a minority) greatly reduces your ability to reach people. In these circumstances, either you participate in the digital disappearance of your language or you remain visible only to a very small part of Twitch.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pgGGkb"&gt;The collective Galician Gamers launched a language tag petition around the same time as their Basque neighbors, with the aim of “promoting the use of Galician, not only as a home life language, but as a language for culture and entertainment as well.” Dubbed “Twitch en Galego” (“Twitch in Galician”), the movement’s social media accounts announce when any Galician-speaking streamer is going live and has exploded from a small group of four or five streamers to having a Discord server with over 200 members with 58 Twitch channels registered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q3Iyqo"&gt;Given that other less popular language petitions such as Ukrainian have now been added as official streaming languages, Iruñe is understandably frustrated. “We are going to continue creating varied content in Basque, quality content that we want to use to reach more people as we are still a small community. Likewise, we want to create channels of dialogue with Twitch, and for this, we want to work together with the Basque government as well as get Basque streamers who have lots of followers to help us achieve this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ByciWx"&gt;Adrián, who goes by Dinav in the Galician Gamers team, is equally undeterred. CRTVG, a regional TV network in Galicia, recently created a Twitch channel and invited the Galician Gamers on to discuss their cause. “Though we’ll still act independently, organising events on certain dates to generate movement on the internet and get more people to sign the request, getting the support of Galician public institutions is a path we are open to explore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="rhzkEy"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="dRo5Hy"&gt;On the other side of the world, a community of streamers of te reo Māori, the indigenous language of New Zealand, is thriving. Despite suffering a decline after the Second World War, it has been enjoying a renaissance due to revitalization efforts in recent years, including national Māori Language Week and Māori immersion schools. According to the 2018 census, 4 percent of the population speaks the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qWO91h"&gt;Twitch creator Rangiora has lived his whole life through teo reo Māori. Combining his two passions, he streams under the moniker PrideLandz, and it’s only natural that he would do so in his native tongue. “Te reo Māori is what connects me to my culture, my ancestors, my family, my environment, and helps to navigate the world I live in,” he shares. “In the last five years, I noticed I was speaking next to no Māori because I wasn’t surrounded by confident speakers. Streaming in Māori has provided a space where I can practice, share, and learn about the language more often.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b9P8iQ"&gt;One of the most fascinating aspects of Māori streamers’ content is their incorporation of an ancestral language into modern gaming. As he lays waste to beasts on the screen superimposed behind him, Rangiora explains how game titles are translated into te reo Māori. &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; is composed using the name of the Māori god of war, translating as something like “a call to arms in the realm of Tūmatauenga.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Oufy5S"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I feel as if people are learning something every time I stream”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IkC8uc"&gt;His streams are open to speakers of all levels and even those just interested in learning more about the culture. “I don’t stream entirely in Māori, but I try to share some knowledge such as having Māori word of the week or Māori phrase or saying as something viewers can redeem with their channel points. Hopefully we can inspire more people to speak [the language] because I’m aware that a lot of Māori [people] aren’t confident due to colonization and the suppression in the past. I feel as if people are learning something every time I stream as we try to normalize Māori in this space.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lTOvop"&gt;The community of Māori and Pacific Islander streamers on Twitch have been a huge motivator for Rangiora, so much so that he’s launched a campaign to achieve Partner status on the platform. Spurred on by support from Ngati Gaming, a Discord community of Māori streamers, the ultimate goal is to launch a Māori esports organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="zjenHi"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="rQZaWd"&gt;Multiplayer online gaming has been a lifeline for speakers of regional tongues to stay connected over the course of the pandemic. YnChwarae, meaning “In Play,” is a group of Welsh language streamers. Pre-COVID, they met monthly to livestream games while chatting in Welsh; for the time being, they’ve brought their club online on a weekly basis. “I feel it’s important to be able to express yourself in the language you feel most comfortable. For Welsh as a language to grow quicker, there has to be a space for people to do everything in Welsh and this includes the digital realm,” says Morgan from the group. “Gaming can be an extremely sociable activity and the majority of our streams reflect this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nUDXs"&gt;Despite a gradually increasing amount Welsh speakers over the last decade, there’s still work to be done in maintaining its survival. “A lot of the crew are not able to use Welsh in their everyday jobs, so streaming with YnChwarae gives them the opportunity to use the language meaningfully doing something they love and not forget it,” Morgan explains. “We are allowing other Welsh speakers to access Welsh language content on Twitch and be a part of our streams through communicating with us in the chat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7rcFNa"&gt;Lacking in the community size of their Welsh counterparts, streamers of other Celtic languages have pioneered the use of their tongue on Twitch. Gwenn, a streamer from Brittany in the northwest of France, is the only person on Twitch who regularly streams in Breton, the traditional language of the region. As a severely endangered language, Breton faces more challenges than just visibility online. Having lost around 800,000 speakers since 1950, the language is not recognized at a national level by the French state, and so it receives little government support in media or public services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="gxgefQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s important to be able to express yourself in the language you feel most comfortable”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qNJflm"&gt;“I think it is important for Breton to be everywhere Breton speakers are,” Gwenn says. “There are a lot of young Breton speakers, and they use what young people use: Discord, Twitch, TikTok, Instagram... I think it’s a good thing to grow minority language communities on those platforms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ukjtw9"&gt;Like YnChwarae, the interactive aspect of Twitch is a huge draw. Although happy to help learners, Gwenn’s target audience is advanced speakers. “When I stream, the beginners can take their time to write out sentences that I will read and correct, and the people who are fluent are happy with just meeting other Breton-speaking people, which could be already rare in the pre-lockdown world and is even rarer now. That is why I usually stream chill games like &lt;em&gt;GeoGuessr&lt;/em&gt; that allow [people] to read the chat and have subjects to talk about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kK8Nmu"&gt;Twitch’s addition of new tags is bittersweet. “I think it’s good for the communities that will benefit from those new tags. I wasn’t expecting Twitch to add minority languages, so I’m not really disappointed. I will follow what happens for more active language communities like Basque to see if it is something that can be achievable for Breton before trying to spend energy on this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XZIX1g"&gt;Cluicheamaid, the brainchild of Scottish streamer Robbie, is an award-nominated Scots Gaelic video game streaming series including &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/em&gt; all in the ancient Scottish tongue. Classed as definitely endangered on the UNESCO Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger, Robbie’s channel is an opportunity for speakers to use their Gaelic in a world without English subtitles. “Streaming is such a new form of entertainment, and I like giving Gaelic representation on the cutting edge,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W6wcsc"&gt;Existing in a linguistic niche has given him a different perspective of what success on Twitch looks like. “There are fewer folk I can get watching my stream in terms of total numbers, but also I am not in competition with thousands of other video game streamers at the same time. I think when you grow up speaking a minoritised language, you have to adjust your expectations of success. Every stream that I get four or five folk all talking Gaelic in the chat feels like a massive win because that is what it is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="cfNgA4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I like giving Gaelic representation on the cutting edge”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1JixYs"&gt;Included in Twitch’s recent launch of new tags is “Scottish,” referring streamers from Scotland as opposed to those speaking Scots Gaelic. Irish, Welsh, and Māori creators found themselves with a new national identifier for their streams. For minority language speakers who fall into these groups, the reaction in terms of linguistic visibility has been ambivalent. “Language tags would be more useful to me than nationality tags,” Robbie says. “My stream will have more in common with Irish-language streamers than most generic ‘Scottish’ streams. So I am hopeful but not expectant that the addition of the new tags is a step towards more easy identification.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="yUETkO"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="pZhURH"&gt;Across the sea in Ireland, Úna-Minh — or yunitex as she is known on Twitch — has brought the Irish national language to an audience of over 2,500 followers. Like Gwenn and Robbie, she is the only person regularly creating content in her language, but the main aim of her bilingual channel isn’t activism. “Ultimately, I’m using it [Irish] as I would in my everyday life, and if that inspires people to become more interested, then that’s a welcome bonus,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tNtlm1"&gt;She has partnered with language-learning app Duolingo to bring a little more Gaeilge to the world through her streams, be that through livestreaming &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; or painting and sketching. However, she believes that minority language Twitch creators like herself can’t be at the forefront of language revival alone. “Too many times do I see people treating people like me, fluent speakers, like their personal teachers or translators, and it’s not fair. I’m not a teacher, I’m just me. I think it’s important that communities don’t rely on one person ever to be a beacon, they need to work together to keep the language alive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="icLoQ2"&gt;With or without formal support from Twitch, those who stream in minority languages are doing the important work of ensuring that their mother tongue is used among young people, outside of the classroom, and within a modern context — the key ingredients for survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3JvBgq"&gt;Aurélie Joubert, assistant professor of Language and Society at the University of Groningen, is all too aware of this. “The problem is that for languages to survive, they need to be considered as equal in their function and their communicative value for their own community. Language planners have realized that if kids nowadays speak more Irish, Breton, or Basque at school, it doesn’t mean that they use it in the playground. The reality is that a language needs to be perceived positively everywhere. This type of modern online interaction attracts the younger generation who needs to see and hear their minority language being used in modern online platforms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="VOBEen"&gt;Across linguistic groups, one thing remains clear: minority language movements on Twitch are grassroots, community-centric, and driven by small gains. Visibility is essential for minority language creators to grow and thrive. “We sometimes see minority languages as not fit for modern technology but if they are not part of it in the first place, they cannot develop the corresponding vocabulary needed for it,” Joubert explains. “Linguists increasingly adopt a holistic approach towards language planning and that includes all modes of interaction, social media, and video gaming. It is a battle to lead on all fronts.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best smart displays for every home</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Amazon Echo Show family of smart displays.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;From Alexa to Google, the best smart displays to buy right now&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="IVixP7"&gt;Smart displays, those cousins of voice-controlled smart speakers with full touchscreen displays, are great devices for managing your smart home, displaying useful bits of information throughout the day, or even playing music or video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6JMn4b"&gt;Like a smart speaker, a smart display is primarily voice-controlled, so you can bark commands at it from across a room. But unlike a smart speaker, a smart display can display information such as upcoming appointments, weather, in-progress timers, the current time, a grocery list, recipes, and more without you having to utter a single command. They can also be used as a modern, cloud-connected digital photo frame, allowing you to see all of those memories you’ve captured over the years that are currently trapped on your smartphone. Some models also come with built-in cameras that can be used for video calling to other smart displays or even phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="67gXUF"&gt;The best smart display has all of the capabilities of the best smart speakers, including good-sounding speakers of its own for listening to music or watching video. They are available in a variety of prices and sizes, and depending on where you want to put the display in your home, you might prefer a smaller model over one that has a larger screen and louder speakers. If you’re looking for an all-around smart display to use in your kitchen or living room, you’ll want one with a screen that’s easy to see from across the room and speakers that can fill the space with clear, pleasant sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W9Qd1R"&gt;There are essentially two types of smart displays available: ones that use Amazon’s Alexa assistant and ones that run on Google Assistant. Which one is better for you really depends on your needs and whether you already have a smart speaker in your home. The two platforms are more similar than they are different, but a simple way to differentiate between them is Google’s smart displays work best with Google services, such as Duo, Photos, other Nest devices, and YouTube, and Amazon’s smart displays work with Amazon services, like Prime Video, Amazon Photos, and Ring products. For most people, the best option is going to be &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Staging-Product-Not-Retail-Sale/dp/B084DCJKSL?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Show 8&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743409769677447969#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google’s Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;, depending on which virtual assistant you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="qTt4ks"&gt;
&lt;h1 id="PQrAAX"&gt;Best smart displays 2021&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RB1ITB"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo Show 8 (second gen)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="FVSF73"&gt;The best Alexa smart display&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="Z0E8T9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10609443" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tUKydh"&gt;The Echo Show 8 is the middle child in Amazon’s lineup of Alexa-powered smart displays, and it’s the best Alexa smart display. It has a bright 8-inch touchscreen, two powerful speakers that can put out a surprising level of volume, a built-in camera with a privacy shutter, and four microphones to hear voice commands. It doesn’t take up a ton of space on a counter, mantle, or bookshelf, but it can easily be seen or controlled from across a room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EKoMBv"&gt;The Show 8 has access to all of the same Alexa abilities as Amazon’s Echo speakers, but it includes a number of unique things that take advantage of its built-in display. You can see timers on the screen without having to ask for them, recipes are displayed with step-by-step instructions and video tutorials, grocery lists are shown right on the screen, and the Show will cycle through upcoming calendar appointments, weather reports, and news headlines whenever it’s idle. The screen can also be used to pull up feeds from video doorbells and security cameras or to view the feed from another Echo Show in your home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0GkxBr"&gt;The second-generation Echo Show 8 has a 13-megapixel camera that can be used for video calls through Amazon’s Alexa calling (to phones or other Echo Show displays) or Zoom. It is able to automatically pan and crop to keep you in the frame, and it generally has good image quality. The built-in privacy shutter allows you to block the camera’s view if you don’t want to make video calls or want to use it in a bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="8Jlno6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon Echo Show 8 (second gen) review: a little faster, a little better camera","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="x2a4xS"&gt;Since the display is a full touchscreen, you can also interact with the Echo Show 8 without having to use your voice at all, including canceling timers, controlling smart home devices, or scrolling through photos stored in Amazon Photos or Facebook albums. But the Show 8 is not designed to be an iPad-like tablet, and its interactivity is limited to simple functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="okSTsA"&gt;Like Echo speakers, the Show 8 can play audio and music from a variety of sources, including Spotify, Audible, Pocket Casts, Amazon Music, Apple Music, and Sirius XM. It can also play video from Amazon’s Prime Video, Hulu, and Netflix. But it doesn’t have an easy way to play YouTube video (you have to go through the device’s built-in web browser, a very clumsy process), nor does it have the ability to play HBO Max or Disney Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4wAMPU"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22357214/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-assistant-smart-display-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Nest Hub (second gen)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YNUQyb"&gt;The best Google Assistant smart display&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="MYAev1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9625445" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wTRK50"&gt;If you are fully invested in Google’s ecosystem or own a lot of Nest products already, the Google Nest Hub is the best smart display with Google Assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bKXHYw"&gt;A 7-inch smart display, the Nest Hub is a little smaller than the Echo Show 8 and fits more comfortably on a nightstand. Its best feature is a screen that automatically adjusts itself for the lighting in your room, so it almost looks like photos are printed on paper instead of being displayed on a screen. Combine that with Google Photos’ excellent automatic backups and smart albums that can automatically update the Nest Hub with new images whenever you take them, and you have perhaps the best digital photo frame experience you can get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kgQI1c"&gt;The latest, second-generation Nest Hub is also able to automatically track your sleep when it’s on a nightstand, making it an ideal smart alarm clock. It also lacks a camera entirely, which every other smart display in this list includes. That means you can’t use it for video calling, but it also means you don’t have to worry about a connected camera being in your most intimate of areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2Apou8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google Nest Hub (2nd-gen) review: sleep on it","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22357214/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-assistant-smart-display-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Obc10t"&gt;The Nest Hub has a single speaker, which is much less powerful and doesn’t sound nearly as good as the Echo Show 8’s dual-speaker system. The 7-inch screen is also noticeably smaller, which makes it harder to see from across a room and less comfortable to watch video on. But if you watch a lot of YouTube or are a YouTube TV customer, the Nest Hub does a much better job of displaying those services than Amazon’s options. Google also supports more video services than Amazon on its smart displays, including Disney Plus and Paramount Plus. You can also easily cast video content from a variety of apps on your phone, such as HBO Max, to the Nest Hub display, which you can’t do with an Echo Show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e57UYw"&gt;Like an Echo Show, the Nest Hub can be used to control smart home devices, display upcoming appointments, step-by-step recipes, or voice-controlled timers and alarms. Google Assistant is generally better at answering random fact-based questions than Alexa, but for everyday tasks, they are very similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NWMx8D"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529891/amazon-echo-show-5-2nd-gen-alexa-smart-display-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo Show 5 (second gen)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="MxM2OV"&gt;The best Alexa smart display for a bedroom&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="CeMKuA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10609475" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0DbeQY"&gt;The Echo Show 5 is very similar to the Echo Show 8 but smaller. That makes it more ideal for a nightstand and the best Alexa smart display for your bedroom. It’s also the least expensive Echo Show model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sh2NrA"&gt;The Show 5 only has a 5.5-inch screen, which isn’t as easy to see from across the room as larger models. It also only has a single speaker, which can get quite loud, but isn’t as good as the speaker systems in the bigger Echo Show devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Kb9g8b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon Echo Show 5 (second gen) review: small screen, small updates","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22529891/amazon-echo-show-5-2nd-gen-alexa-smart-display-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="p2jUVQ"&gt;The Echo Show 5 also doesn’t support as many video streaming services or video calling services, and its 2-megapixel built-in camera is much lower quality than the Echo Show 8 or 10’s cameras. Fortunately, it still includes the physical privacy shutter to block its view when you don’t want to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3dlrt9"&gt;Where the Echo Show 5 really shines is on a nightstand or desk. If you’re using it as a smart alarm clock, you can tap on the top to snooze the alarm. On a desk, it works well for personal audio such as podcasts or to view feeds from a security camera or video doorbell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gm2lYe"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18647606/lenovo-smart-clock-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lenovo Smart Clock with Google Assistant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mPth1E"&gt;The best Google smart alarm clock&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="k4KD9l"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10609486" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bxh83d"&gt;If you are looking for a smart alarm clock with Google Assistant, then the best option is the tiny Lenovo Smart Clock. The Smart Clock has a 4-inch screen, no camera, and a small footprint, making it ideal for a nightstand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gj9wLb"&gt;The Smart Clock is capable of showing the time, weather, calendar appointments, and Google Photos albums, just like the larger Nest Hub displays. You can interact with the screen with either voice or touch, and there are buttons on top for controlling volume and a switch on the back for muting the microphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="WnZYEr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Lenovo Smart Clock review: a Google alarm clock","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18647606/lenovo-smart-clock-review-specs-price-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="PIGlOj"&gt;Though you can play all the same music services (Spotify, YouTube Music, etc.) through the Smart Clock, its small speaker doesn’t sound that great and doesn’t get very loud. It works for hearing Google Assistant voice responses and an alarm, but not for extended listening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cXqjvT"&gt;In addition, you can tap the top of the Smart Clock to snooze an alarm, and there’s a USB port on the back that you can use to charge your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qZwK7s"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo Show 10&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="yX8aIx"&gt;The best Alexa smart display for video calls&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="okDdym"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10362085" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9TUHUo"&gt;Amazon’s biggest and most expensive smart display is the Echo Show 10. It’s the best option if you want an Amazon display for making video calls because it has a motorized base that can actually follow you as you move around the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RaRZHX"&gt;The 13-megapixel camera on the Echo Show 10 is the same as on the second-generation Echo Show 8. But its automatic crop and pan modes are supercharged by the 10’s motorized base. You can stick it in the corner of your kitchen and easily carry on a video call as you move around the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lXbws3"&gt;In addition, the motorized base makes it easy to watch video or follow a recipe as you move around since it always attempts to face you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="yphYyV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon Echo Show 10 review: Alexa’s next move","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="BWDxf0"&gt;The Echo Show 10 also has a louder and better-sounding speaker system than the smaller models, and it can fill a room with music easier. You can also pair smart home devices such as lightbulbs and other sensors directly to it through the built-in Zigbee radio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eM7hMP"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20855944/google-nest-hub-max-review-assistant-smart-display-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Nest Hub Max&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="AmL7sb"&gt;The best Google smart display for video calls&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="2OgPBm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9625470" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5rqdNQ"&gt;The 10-inch Nest Hub Max is a lot like the Nest Hub, but bigger. It also has a camera, though, which can be used for video calling through Google Duo or Zoom, or as a home security camera when you’re away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NdyD44"&gt;The Max’s camera can also automatically crop and pan to keep you in frame, though it lacks the fancy motorized base found on the Echo Show 10. The camera also recognizes who is using the Max and automatically provides relevant information, and supports basic play and pause controls through hand gestures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Qrm2JS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google Nest Hub Max review: bigger screen, better sound, and a camera","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20855944/google-nest-hub-max-review-assistant-smart-display-price-specs-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="zkm8Xt"&gt;The Max also has a louder, better-sounding speaker system than the smaller Nest Hub, which makes it more suitable for larger rooms. It’s probably too big to really use in a bedroom or on a nightstand — for that, you’ll want to stick with the smaller options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="l33CZN"&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20913653/facebook-portal-10-inch-2019-review-price-specs-features-whatsapp-video-calling" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook Portal (10-inch&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DdEmYr"&gt;The best smart display for Facebook users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="ymW2g8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10594754" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vvr7Fs"&gt;If you want a smart display specifically for making WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger calls, then the 10-inch Facebook Portal is your best option. It has a 13-megapixel camera that supports automatic panning and cropping, and it can be used for video calls on Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Zoom, Cisco WebEx, and other services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2IuNRX"&gt;The Portal has Alexa as well, making it an Echo Show alternative. But the Alexa integration isn’t quite as good, and it doesn’t support as many features as Amazon’s smart display. You can also use Facebook’s own voice commands for controlling the Portal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="CzOJUz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Facebook Portal review: for Facebook fans","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20913653/facebook-portal-10-inch-2019-review-price-specs-features-whatsapp-video-calling"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="F78XAK"&gt;You can listen to music services or watch streaming video on the Portal’s 10-inch display, but the sound quality isn’t quite as good as you get on the Echo Show 8 or 10. If Facebook support is the most important thing to you, however, the Portal is a good choice. Otherwise, stick with an Amazon Echo Show.&lt;/p&gt;
