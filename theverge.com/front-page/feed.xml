    <title>Lutron’s outdoor smart plug can control your lights through any season</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UdAIQHBhDG13ypFaGBSqwi6A_gY=/0x0:639x426/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68650995/LutronOutdoorSmartPlug.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: Lutron&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wEgaSH"&gt;Unlike indoor smart home gadgets, connected outdoor appliances have an extra problem to deal with in the form of unpredictable weather. Lutron aims to address that with its &lt;a href="https://www.lutron.com/en-US/Company-Info/Pages/News/Media-PressCenter/PressReleases/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?prid=813"&gt;new Caséta Outdoor Smart Plug&lt;/a&gt;, which is designed to withstand the elements through every season and lets you toggle your outdoor electronics on and off even when it looks too miserable to step outside yourself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4vU5RI"&gt;The Caséta Outdoor Smart Plug is an addition to Lutron’s larger Caséta smart lighting system. It’s IP65 rating means it should stand up to rain and snow, but Lutron also claims the device is essentially “dustproof” and “sunproof” as well. The plug can also survive temperatures from -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 140 degrees Fahrenheit, &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/lutron-caseta-outdoor-smart-plug-120046555.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UHmihR"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RsgHVK7rEn8?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MyJPC8"&gt;Like an indoor smart plug, this outdoor one can control power to anything connected to it, from outdoor string lights to pumps for fountains. The plug also allows you to automate the process, so if you like your patio lights to turn on at sunset during the summer, the Caséta Smart Plug can save you the hassle of doing it manually. Lutron also notes that the smart plug includes a “smart timer” that should account for daylight saving time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rL5o4l"&gt;The plug can be controlled through the Lutron app, but it’s also compatible with major smart home platforms and assistants like Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit, and Samsung SmartThings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="huxRzT"&gt;Lutron expects to ship the Caséta Outdoor Plug starting in March for $79.95.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZUs2pJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Finally you can have ice cream at home thanks to ice cream pods</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DEGG3hhntPo213b7xRIs-8f6384=/0x194:1190x987/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68650977/131766109_176443270849593_5994149864723751775_o.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: ColdSnap&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kuLQR0"&gt;We’ve had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/23/21031902/keurig-gadgets-kcups-juicero-venture-capital"&gt;pod coffee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/23/11745326/juicero-wifi-juicer-doug-evans-interview"&gt;pod juices&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22218777/ysl-beaute-rouge-sur-mesure-perso-ces-gadget-2021"&gt;pod lipstick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21042691/pax-app-vape-usb-c-nfc-smart-pods-temperature-dosing-ces-2020"&gt;pod weed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/11/13/18088118/keurig-drinkworks-cocktail-pods-k-cup-beer-bar"&gt;pod cocktails&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/11/2/13501260/chip-cookie-pod-oven-kickstarter"&gt;pod cookies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/5/11602130/flatev-tortilla-pods-kickstarter"&gt;pod tortillas&lt;/a&gt;, and so much more thanks to the VC- and Kickstarter-backed rise of pod technologies in recent years. Now, we’re finally getting to the good stuff: pod-based ice cream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OBz2wh"&gt;A new device called the ColdSnap, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/as-enticing-as-soft-serve-ice-cream-on-demand-sounds-w-1846033043"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, can take pods filled with some unknown ingredients and turn them into soft-serve ice cream on demand. While ice cream is the ColdSnap’s main selling point, the company also plans to offer frozen yogurt pods, frozen coffee pods, frozen smoothie pods, frozen “healthy shakes” pods, and slushie pods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k6wgtA"&gt;There will also be frozen cocktail pods, which the company may want to consider advertising more prominently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1YelaA"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RFvKclT8rzw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJlbdq"&gt;Mostly, though, the device is being pitched as an ice cream machine for families. The company is also planning to release a business version aimed at companies that either want to offer employees a perk (I wouldn’t say no to free ice cream) or sell ice cream in common areas like a cafeteria or hotel lobby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ONZGDG"&gt;Like every pod-based gadget, there are obvious drawbacks. Ice cream, it turns out, can be readily purchased at most stores that sell food, and modern refrigerators typically have a discrete area dedicated to storing and preserving frozen products for indefinite periods of time, all of which may obviate the need for a dedicated ice cream machine at home. It also looks fairly large, so you’d need a lot of counter space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SiazCO"&gt;There’s no word yet on how much the machine or pods will cost. The machine is supposed to start shipping in the second quarter of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HFpT3t"&gt;With the exception of pod-based coffee machines, pod-based foods haven’t been quite as explosively popular as many companies have hoped. Juicero lasted barely more than a year, and Flatev, which promised to make tortilla pods, may not have made it beyond Kickstarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lq0Dbi"&gt;ColdSnap isn’t the first company to explore the idea of pod-based frozen desserts, either. Another company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/8/9/16121474/frozen-yogurt-pods-exist-wim-yogurt"&gt;explored frozen yogurt pods&lt;/a&gt; in 2017, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/3/11/18258778/lg-snow-white-ice-cream-pods-sxsw-2019"&gt;LG explored&lt;/a&gt; pod-based ice cream, frozen yogurt, custard, sorbet, gelato, and more in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jb5O6v"&gt;At this point, it’s hard to imagine ColdSnap faring better than the rest of the pod crowd. If Dippin’ Dots are the ice cream of the future, ColdSnap may be the ice cream of our pod-obsessed present.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Google union just passed 700 members</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xb8Dg704aBceKlW6CwUGmvACmIM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68650925/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xHFMNM"&gt;The Alphabet Workers Union (AWU) passed 700 members on Monday, growing from roughly 230 at launch on January 4th. The group, which is open to employees and contractors at Google’s parent company, includes workers from 35 offices in the US and Canada. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Tu1J9"&gt;AWU organized in secret for almost a year, before &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/04/opinion/google-union.html"&gt;going public with an op-ed in &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last week&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The news prompted an outpouring of support from tech workers in Silicon Valley. “We were excited to see the response of the public and employees,” says Alan Morales, a Google engineer. “Now we’re welcoming all of our new members and hearing their motivations for joining.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="euzc3k"&gt;As a minority union, &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22213494/google-union-alphabet-workers-tech-organizing-activism-labor"&gt;AWU can’t force Google management to come to the table to negotiate&lt;/a&gt;. But it can try to pressure executives by rallying members toward a cause. That’s exactly what happened last week, when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220778/alphabet-workers-union-demands-youtube-ban-trump"&gt;AWU called on YouTube to permanently ban Trump&lt;/a&gt; in the wake of a raid on the US Capitol on January 6th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W4mjA8"&gt;“YouTube refuses to hold Donald Trump accountable to the platform’s own rules by choosing only to remove one video instead of removing him from the platform entirely,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AlphabetWorkers/status/1347331587315171330/photo/1"&gt;they wrote&lt;/a&gt;. The company “is avoiding the proactive action called for by both their workers and the broader public.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a3VjkV"&gt;The union categorized the letter as a public statement. So far, it hasn’t put out a list of demands, as it wants to hear from new members before settling on major initiatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nJVQPQ"&gt;As of this morning, YouTube hasn’t changed its stance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OrGa07"&gt;California Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, a former labor organizer, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that AWU’s minority union structure could provide a template for workers at other tech companies. “I’m excited that it’s a little bit different,” she says. “One of the challenges we’ve faced in organizing the tech sector is that it might not be achievable in the standard National Labor Relations Board format.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hLwSMg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vizio’s latest update helps its TVs catch up to the PS5 and Xbox Series X</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9dWnd-usWa0lQyp55pWyd8Ii4eU=/0x56:2529x1742/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68650877/VizioOLED.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Vizio&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YzWxAd"&gt;Vizio’s latest TV firmware update is full of features and improvements for people who game on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;, or PC with the Nvidia RTX 3080 (or any powerful G-Sync-ready Nvidia GPU). It’s currently rolling out to the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/5/21049756/vizio-new-4k-tvs-oled-p-series-quantum-x-ces-2020"&gt;OLED&lt;/a&gt; sets as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308026/vizio-2021-p-series-quantum-x-m-v-4k-hdr-tv-prices-specs"&gt;its 2021 collection of P-Series Quantum X and P-Series Quantum models&lt;/a&gt; — all of which feature HDMI 2.1 ports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wjt5NF"&gt;Breaking it down by platform, Vizio claims that the update “enables full bandwidth 4K at 120fps” for the PlayStation 5. The PS5 doesn’t natively support variable refresh rate yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DFNeCL"&gt;That’s not the case if you have a PC with something powerful in it like the Nvidia RTX 3080. This firmware allows for 4K resolution at up to a 120Hz refresh rate when connected to your rig, along with variable refresh rate support for both 4K/60Hz and 4K/120Hz settings. The latter addition means you shouldn’t notice the screen skipping or tearing if your PC suddenly drops its frames per second; the display will automatically scale its refresh rate to what your machine is capable of at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="uLQF93"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"You should listen to our HDMI-themed episode of The Vergecast","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/24/22193437/vergecast-podcast-interview-hdmi"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="dYQwfn"&gt;This update bodes well for Xbox Series X owners, too. It improves the support for variable refresh rate for the admittedly small amount of gaming content that currently supports 4K resolution at 120Hz refresh rate. Still, it’s very good news for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u7YeD1"&gt;Platform-specific notes aside, Vizio has brought a few notable tweaks to these TVs in the firmware update. It adds discrete IR codes to each HDMI port make them simpler to register with HDMI-CEC products. Vizio also improved compatibility with AV receivers that support HDMI. The company included a few other quality-of-life features that you can check out below.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Belkin’s second MagSafe dock drops the Apple Watch charger and the price</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EazKyFOGOUrWVsR6XKEG2a6VMAU=/240x0:1440x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68650761/2in1_MagSafe_lifestyle2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mapDzk"&gt;Since Apple’s reveal of its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509659/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-charging-magnetic-charger-return"&gt;MagSafe charging standard&lt;/a&gt;, officially approved wireless chargers that use the standard have been few and far between. But Belkin is boosting those numbers with its new BoostCharge Pro MagSafe 2-in-1 Wireless Charger, which also brings a more palatable $99.95 price tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfEv2n"&gt;Similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/10/14/21516404/belkin-magsafe-boostcharge-pro-charger-car-mount-iphone-12-accessories"&gt;BoostCharge Pro MagSafe 3-in-1 Wireless Charger&lt;/a&gt;, the BoostCharge Pro MagSafe 2-in-1 Wireless Charger — as you might be able to already guess — can charge two products instead of three. Now, the futuristic charging tree will offer just a MagSafe pad and a regular Qi charger for your AirPods (or any other device that fits), dropping the Apple Watch charger found on the 3-in-1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="aRpqEr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Belkin’s first MagSafe products are a wild-looking 3-in-1 charger and a car mount","url":"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/10/14/21516404/belkin-magsafe-boostcharge-pro-charger-car-mount-iphone-12-accessories"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="NhmgKk"&gt;And like the 3-in-1, the new BoostCharge Pro MagSafe 2-in-1 is an official, MFi-approved MagSafe device, meaning that it’s one of the few options out there for taking advantage of MagSafe’s faster 15W wireless charger. And the one-third reduction in functionality comes with a similar reduction in price: the BoostCharge Pro MagSafe 2-in-1 costs $99.95, compared to the $149.95 that Belkin charges for its larger counterpart. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7-ir9R3QUca94OebYXITs2Was38=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22223074/2in1_MagSafe_poduct1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FSJGEm"&gt;The BoostCharge Pro MagSafe 2-in-1 Wireless Charger is set to release later this year in March or April, when it’ll be available from both Apple’s and Belkin’s websites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bu5QuD"&gt;Along with the new wireless charger, Belkin also announced its second set of wireless earbuds, the Soundform Freedom True Wireless Earbuds. Where the original Soundform True Wireless Earbuds were a budget option at $59.99 (with features to match), Belkin is aiming higher with the Soundform Freedom buds. The new buds feature better battery life (up to eight hours, with an additional 20 hours in the case), USB-C charging, and improved isolation of background noise (although there’s no active noise cancellation). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b4ImBC"&gt;Notably, the Soundform Freedom earbuds will also be one of the first third-party products to work with Apple’s Find My network (something &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299712/apple-find-my-iphone-network-third-party-devices-support-location-tracking"&gt;Apple announced&lt;/a&gt; it would be offering as an option last year). That means that — similar to Apple’s own AirPods — you’ll be able to use the Find My app on iPhone and Mac devices to locate your missing headphones, using the same crowdsourced network of Apple products that the company’s own first-party devices can use. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RUSrMG9eWnhkTtTj2kQEj2wfpHE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22223076/SoundForm_Freedom_white1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="o8kwuy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TbeTlx"&gt;The Soundform Freedom earbuds also offer both Qi and USB-C charging, swappable ear tips, and are rated IPX5 for sweat and splash resistance. Belkin has yet to announce pricing, but they’ll be available to purchase sometime in March or April. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RxKIZ6"&gt;As part of OtterBox’s CES 2021 announcements, the consumer electronics company announced the first line of products under its gaming portfolio, releasing in mid-February with preorders beginning on January 25th. As part of a partnership with Xbox, OtterBox has created a new gaming accessories line aimed at mobile gamers. This includes a mobile gaming clip designed for the Xbox One, Series X / S, and the Elite wireless controllers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YN0s8z"&gt;OtterBox’s Mobile Gaming Clip costs $30 and includes an admittedly tough-looking phone clip that extends if you are trying to place a bigger phone or a phone with a bulky case securely into it. Now, there are other options for gaming clips like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-Moga-Mobile-Gaming-Wireless-Controllers/dp/B081C7TLVS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?hvadid=385546071587&amp;amp;hvpos=&amp;amp;hvnetw=g&amp;amp;hvrand=16157155547006757556&amp;amp;hvpone=&amp;amp;hvptwo=&amp;amp;hvqmt=&amp;amp;hvdev=c&amp;amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;amp;hvlocint=&amp;amp;hvlocphy=9008008&amp;amp;hvtargid=pla-847144215573&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;adgrpid=78881076375&amp;amp;hvpone=&amp;amp;hvptwo=&amp;amp;hvadid=385546071587&amp;amp;hvpos=&amp;amp;hvnetw=g&amp;amp;hvrand=16157155547006757556&amp;amp;hvqmt=&amp;amp;hvdev=c&amp;amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;amp;hvlocint=&amp;amp;hvlocphy=9008008&amp;amp;hvtargid=pla-847144215573&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=b225dc010f615994fa66ed8d4a530b77&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PowerA’s $15 gaming clip&lt;/a&gt;, but what makes OtterBox’s product interesting is the clip can detach from the controller and be used as a tabletop stand, providing a bit of flexibility for people who want to game on the go or are playing at home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GGeVKD"&gt;As noted previously, the clip is designed strictly for Xbox wireless controllers. If you plan to buy other products in the OtterBox gaming line, the clip is compatible with the company’s other products. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-FjSa9CuxiIrHOChppmnJ33aGiM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22222492/otterbox_gaming_clip_mobile_7.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OtterBox Mobile Gaming Clip can be detached and used for tabletop gaming.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YpoPoO"&gt;OtterBox is also releasing a Gaming Carry Case, which looks strikingly similar on the outside to the controller cases available for the Razer Wolverine Ultimate and Xbox Elite Series 2 controllers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KycxpY"&gt;For $45, Otterbox’s Gaming Carry Case includes a quick flip screen stand on the top, which you can place your phone on and use as a command center while playing titles on cloud services like xCloud or other mobile games like those offered through Apple Arcade. The case also includes a cable pass-through, so you can keep your Xbox controller juiced up via USB when you are not using it. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S7Ul1e0Wra1VqGtjSdRACYNljhw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22222588/otterbox_controller_case.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OtterBox’s Gaming Carry Case can charge your controller, and it offers a flip screen, which can be used as a mobile command center.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EBtuKu"&gt;Priced at $40, OtterBox’s new Easy Grip Controller Shell features an antimicrobial material that the company says will keep your hands comfy from sweat and offers a no-slip grip performance. The shell also includes swappable grip pads for more comfortability, and it comes in three colors (“dark web,” “dreamscape,” and “galactic dream”). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VEN-SzAM4r6iQGaTpJoxWOHPirQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22222647/otterbox_controller_shell.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OtterBox&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OtterBox’s Easy Grip Controller Shell is ideal for gamers who worry about losing their grip while gaming.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MIJ8ho"&gt;OtterBox is known for durable phone cases and accessories, and alongside the previously mentioned products, the gaming line also includes a $55 Easy Grip Gaming Case, which offers durability and an anti-slip grip that’s compatible with the iPhone 12 line, iPhone 11 and 11 Pro Max, iPhone SE (second-gen), and the iPhone 7 and 8. OtterBox says the case will also be available “soon” for select Android devices. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Linksys’ mesh router motion-tracking system can now work with other smart home gadgets </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZjGYTIbOVGYhzqvWWV3_Wa-UMSk=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68650758/axe8400.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Linksys AXE8400 Wi-Fi 6E router&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g3DGXY"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/8/20905223/linksys-aware-mesh-routers-motion-detection-wifi-smart-home"&gt;Linksys Aware&lt;/a&gt; — the company’s subscription service that uses its mesh Wi-Fi systems to detect motion in your house — is getting even smarter with a new update that will let the routers utilize the internet to connect to other stationary smart home products to track motion in your house more accurately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwjGEe"&gt;The original Aware motion-sensing system detects how Wi-Fi signals bounce around your house between routers in a mesh system. Movement naturally interferes with those signals, allowing the routers to act as a motion-sensing setup without the need for any additional hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uNoUbe"&gt;Now, Linksys is adding support to leverage other internet-connected smart home products — like speakers, smart switches, and thermostats — to serve as additional points of communication, allowing the motion-sensing system to work in a larger area and eventually pinpoint more specific locations for where motion is being detected. With the new update, users will be able to see when motion has been detected near a specific device (like the Apple TV in your living room or the smart plug in your hallway). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ix6jiK-Bc--ixoYst6dJk7WsTrg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22226559/linksys_aware.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new device-based tracking for Linksys Aware.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TMAwRb"&gt;And since the setup just relies on existing internet connections, it should work with most third-party devices without requiring any software updates (the Linksys app will let you know which devices are compatible). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zIHzam"&gt;The Linksys Aware update will be rolling out in the US in March / April, with additional releases coming to the rest of the world in the months following. Pricing will still be set at $2.99 per month or $24.99 per year, with the option of a free 90-day trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UBkeQf"&gt;Alongside the updated features for Linksys Aware, the company also announced its new AXE8400 mesh router system, its first to support Wi-Fi 6E. The AXE8400 is meant for customers with heavy Wi-Fi usage, not entry-level customers, and it’s priced to match: a single router costs $449.99, a two-pack $849.99, and a three-pack $1,199.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="czaJlM"&gt;Those prices get you a whole lot of router, though. Each AXE8400 unit is a tri-band router that supports 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz networks and can cover up to 3,000 square feet. There’s a 5Gbps WAN port — largely for future-proofing at this point — along with an additional four 1Gbps LAN ports and a USB 3.0 port. Linksys says that the AXE8400 should be able to comfortably handle over 65 devices all sharing the same bandwidth at the same time. The AXE8400 is also compatible with other Linksys Intelligent Mesh routers, so you’ll be able to slot them into your existing mesh setup if you’re already a Linksys customer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qTaYkn"&gt;The Linksys AXE8400 will be available in spring / summer 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook pauses some political spending after Capitol riot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0Z0oN4O9WZWhPd1NA4d3FXLqnEA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68650664/acastro_180406_1777_facebook_Congress_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="20tEL8"&gt;Facebook announced Monday that it would pause its contributions to political action committees after last week’s deadly attack on the US Capitol, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/scoop-facebook-freezing-political-spending-after-capitol-attack-aae93e2c-0050-4e6e-aa85-6752cf8bee3d.html?utm_campaign=organic&amp;amp;utm_medium=socialshare&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;as first reported by &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a0eH0I"&gt;“Following last week’s awful violence in DC, we are pausing all of our PAC contributions for at least the current quarter, while we review our policies,” Facebook spokesperson Danial Robert told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a statement Monday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0UrWmA"&gt;Facebook’s political spending freeze will last at least through the first quarter of 2021. This freeze only affects PAC contributions, not all of Facebook’s political spending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mCfZbz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are pausing all of our PAC contributions for at least the current quarter.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="niR01d"&gt;The social media company is joining a group of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/01/11/business/us-economy-coronavirus"&gt;other private companies&lt;/a&gt; halting political contributions, including JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs. Microsoft is also halting its political spending “until after it assesses the implications of last week’s events,” according to &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wmy8GR"&gt;“The PAC regularly pauses its donations in the first quarter of a new Congress, but it will take additional steps this year to consider these recent events and consult with employees,” a Microsoft spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KatCvn"&gt;The political spending freezes follow last Wednesday’s deadly pro-Trump riot at the Capitol. Days after, social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter banned &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/scoop-facebook-freezing-political-spending-after-capitol-attack-aae93e2c-0050-4e6e-aa85-6752cf8bee3d.html?utm_campaign=organic&amp;amp;utm_medium=socialshare&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;high-profile QAnon accounts&lt;/a&gt; belonging to individuals like Michael Flynn and Sidney Powell. Over the weekend, both Facebook and Twitter permanently banned President Donald Trump for violating their rules and encouraging further violence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ckxvf9"&gt;Twitter officially closed its PAC in November. “In line with our belief that political influence should be earned, not bought, Twitter will officially close its Political Action Committee; #PAC. #PAC has not made donations to candidates since 2018 and is donating the remaining funds to support non-partisan voter registration activities,” a Twitter spokesperson said in a statement at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hPWJVR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 1/11/21 at 1:20PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Included a statement from Microsoft.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGbib3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG announces a stunning 4K OLED monitor for creative pros</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2RQjgt"&gt;LG has announced a new entry in its high-end UltraFine monitor lineup, the LG UltraFine OLED Pro, as part of the company’s CES 2021 announcements. LG is pitching the new monitor primarily for use by creative professionals, as you can see in &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/WKTCH1FIsJM"&gt;LG’s video&lt;/a&gt; about the new display that we’ve embedded at the top of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bdxIaq"&gt;The UltraFine OLED Pro is a 31.5-inch 4K display, &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-ultrafine-oled-pro-monitor-ces-2021-135201171.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LGUS/status/1348622023384309760"&gt;LG says&lt;/a&gt; the display has individual dimming for its more than 8 million pixels. The monitor covers 99 percent of the DCI-P3 and Adobe RGB color spectrum and has a 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio, according to LG’s video. And the display has a good number of ports, including one USB-C port with 90-watt power delivery, two DisplayPorts, three USB-A ports, one HDMI port, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ODOtIe"&gt;
