    <title>Twitter updates offensive tweet warnings, accepts that you like to swear at your friends</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Twitter bird logo in white against a dark background with outlined logos around it and red circles rippling out from it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UDYOT-6zV8Y_ZdFhKyxTqO3asaA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69241394/acastro_180827_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Riigw1"&gt;Twitter is updating its “be nice, think twice” system that prompts users to reconsider when they’re about to tweet a “potentially harmful or offensive” reply. The upgraded feature is now better at spotting “strong language,” claims Twitter; is more aware of vocabulary that has been “reclaimed by underrepresented communities” and is used in non-harmful ways; and also now takes into account your relationship with the person you’re messaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XOFaLj"&gt;In other words, if you’re tweeting at a mutual who you interact with regularly, Twitter will assume “there’s a higher likelihood [you] have a better understanding of preferred tone of communication” and &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; show you a prompt. So, you can call your friend a **** or a ****-**** or even a ****-******* son of a ****-less ***** and Twitter won’t care. That’s freedom, folks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6JudW4"&gt;Twitter first started testing this system in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/5/21248201/twitter-reply-warning-harmful-language-revise-tweet-moderation"&gt;May 2020&lt;/a&gt;, paused it a little later, then brought it back to life in &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/02/22/twitter-relaunches-review-before-you-tweet-offensive-language/"&gt;February this year&lt;/a&gt;. It’s one of a number of prompts the company has been testing to try and shape user behavior, including its “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21455635/twitter-read-before-you-tweet-article-prompt-rolling-out-globally-soon"&gt;read before you retweet&lt;/a&gt;” message.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X6j91hL3Q9k25ZzPdylAwu74Xns=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22493024/pasted_image_0.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A sample prompt shown to a user before sending an offensive reply. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XXvRLu"&gt;Improvements to the offensive-tweets prompt will roll out to English users of the Twitter iOS app today and to Android users “in the next few days.” The company says it’s already making a difference to how people interact on the platform, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="itdoQE"&gt;Twitter claims internal tests show 34 percent of people who were served such a prompt “revised their initial reply or decided to not send their reply at all.” After receiving such a prompt once, people composed, on average, 11 percent “fewer offensive replies.” And people who were prompted about a reply (and therefore may have toned down their language) were themselves “less likely to receive offensive and harmful replies back.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gX0O3k"&gt;These “statistics” are as opaque as you would expect from any major internet platform (how exactly has the company quantified “less likely” in that last example? How many people are included in any of these tests? How do we know that people who revised their reply made it less offensive, or did they just use offensive language the system didn’t recognize?). But the ongoing roll-out does suggest that the feature is, at least, not making things &lt;em&gt;actively&lt;/em&gt; worse on Twitter. That’s probably the best we can hope for. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix switches from prestige pics to shredded zombies for its widest theatrical release yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rb6xTYn9GSxdIS6hcPMjG71lMro=/708x0:4188x2320/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69241389/Screen_Shot_2021_05_05_at_9.42.44_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HQMh8K"&gt;Netflix is taking a different route for its new Zack Snyder-directed zombie heist movie, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300924/army-of-the-dead-trailer-zack-snyder-netflix-vegas-heist-movie"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than skip theaters and drop the new thriller directly in subscribers’ laps and homes, the company has reached an agreement with theater chains to screen the movie a week early starting May 14th in around 600 theaters, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/zack-snyder-army-of-the-dead-netflix-theaters-1234966466/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OgCMet"&gt;That’s Netflix’s widest US release yet for one of its feature projects, and it positions the film and the company to capture summer theatergoers’ attention and dollars right as screens are beginning to reopen across the country, and newly vaccinated film fans feel comfortable enough to watch how they used to. &lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;says Netflix has partnered with Cinemark, Alamo Drafthouse, iPic, Landmark, Harkins, and Cinépolis theaters to make the release happen. Cinemark will reportedly screen &lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead &lt;/em&gt;in 200 of its theaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="89SlsZ"&gt;In comparison to a traditional blockbuster release that can reach thousands of theaters, 600 might seem minor, but this is Netflix, a company that’s usually scorned the traditional theatrical release model. Theaters typically want a 90-day window for theatrical releases so that people have a reason to go see a movie in person. This is why &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;Warner Bros.’ same-day streaming and theater release strategy&lt;/a&gt; on HBO Max films stirred up so much controversy. Theaters need a reason for people to show up, especially during the pandemic when they’re at their most vulnerable. Streaming services might not feel so generous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4XT4ll"&gt;Past major Netflix releases have only chosen to screen in theaters to qualify for awards like the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/7/20903107/netflix-the-irishman-martin-scorsese-belasco-theater-screening-award-eligibility"&gt;and have sometimes struggled&lt;/a&gt; to find cinemas that wanted to play ball. &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/08/roma-movie-review-alfonso-cuaron.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roma&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;which won Best Foreign Language Film at the 91st Academy Awards, was only shown in around 250 theaters, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/01/business/irishman-netflix-theaters.html#:~:text=The%20film%20eventually%20played%20on,them%20in%20the%20United%20States.&amp;amp;text=%E2%80%9CThe%20Irishman%E2%80%9D%20will%20move%20on,short%20of%20a%20major%20release."&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Martin Scorsese’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/27/20887812/the-irishman-movie-review-netflix-martin-scorsese-robert-de-niro-al-pacino-joe-pesci-nyff"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Irishman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; received a limited release in eight theaters initially and hit around 550 theaters at its widest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="onE0CY"&gt;There’s only &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H83kjG5RCT8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/em&gt;’s trailer&lt;/a&gt; to go off of, but shooting for something closer to a big blockbuster summer release seems to make sense for a zombie movie. It could be fun! &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New climate goals are going to need a lot more minerals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Operations At Bald Hill Lithium Mine As Lithium Sector’s Newest Exporter Sees No Threat of an Oversupply" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xfoRIpjgbRbS7B16Wt6ClTOMduM=/4x0:3997x2662/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69241383/1015906156.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A excavator operates next to a dump truck on a mine floor at the Bald Hill lithium mine site, co-owned by Tawana Resources Ltd. and Alliance Mineral Assets Ltd., outside of Widgiemooltha, Australia, on Monday, Aug. 6, 2018.&amp;nbsp; | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/search/photographer?family=editorial&amp;amp;photographer=Bloomberg" target="_blank"&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;Contributor via Getty News&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gmlmGs"&gt;The world isn’t mining enough minerals to reach a future that runs on clean energy, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/news/clean-energy-demand-for-critical-minerals-set-to-soar-as-the-world-pursues-net-zero-goals"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; by the International Energy Agency (IEA). Minerals like lithium, cobalt, and nickel are the building blocks for clean energy economies. Countries can’t meet their new climate goals without them. If supply chains can’t meet skyrocketing demand, mineral shortages could mean clean energy shortages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="Q4dFOU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The building blocks for clean energy economies&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MzF9ND"&gt;Many of the world’s biggest economies have set goals to nearly eliminate climate pollution from fossil fuels in the next few decades. Leading climate scientists &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/"&gt;have found&lt;/a&gt; that greenhouse gas emissions need to reach net zero globally by around 2050 to stave off the worst effects of climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JnqE6i"&gt;Hitting that 2050 target would require six times more critical minerals than are produced today, the IEA found. For some minerals, the gap between supply and predicted future demand is way bigger. Demand for lithium, for example, is expected to grow 70 times over the next couple decades. But the supply from existing lithium mines and projects under construction can only meet about half the projected demand this decade.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1oqPDK"&gt;“This mismatch is something that worries us,” Fatih Birol, the executive director of the IEA, said at a press conference today. “Our numbers show that the critical minerals are not a sideshow in our journey to reach climate goals. It’s a part of the main event.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WDE4ll"&gt;Batteries for electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy storage are the biggest factor driving the potential mineral shortage. An EV requires six times more mineral resources than a car that runs on fossil fuels. Cobalt, nickel, graphite, and manganese are essential for batteries, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OJxn0q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Existing supply chains for these minerals are already vulnerable&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lG4bW2"&gt;Wind and solar power generation are also mineral-hungry industries. Wind turbines need rare earth minerals for magnets, while solar panels are made with copper, silicon, and silver. An increase in renewable energy is also spurring the need to modernize electrical grids, which can’t be done without more copper and aluminum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FKJHa5"&gt;Existing supply chains for these minerals are already vulnerable, the IEA notes. Mining for certain minerals tends to be concentrated in a few places — sometimes in just one country. About seventy percent of the world’s cobalt came from the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2019, while some 60 percent of rare earth minerals were mined in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SkPING"&gt;Relying on a single source for these minerals means that the whole world could be affected by otherwise localized disasters like flooding, drought, or conflict. It can also breed human rights, labor, and environmental abuses. Major tech companies and Tesla have already faced a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/dec/16/apple-and-google-named-in-us-lawsuit-over-congolese-child-cobalt-mining-deaths"&gt;lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; over children killed while mining cobalt in the DRC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldLFUM"&gt;Leaders will need to grapple with these problems as they work to transition their economies to clean energy. Designing technologies that minimize the use of these minerals could help alleviate some of the pressure on supply chains, according to the IEA. So could more recycling of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20951807/electric-vehicles-battery-recycling"&gt;EV batteries&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/25/18018820/solar-panel-waste-chemicals-energy-environment-recycling"&gt;solar panels&lt;/a&gt;, and wind turbines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="j6uRCi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;investors aren’t convinced that world leaders are fully committed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VYN6BD"&gt;Even with that kind of progress, the IEA expects a shortfall unless new mineral deposits are tapped. Production of new critical minerals isn’t ramping up fast enough because investors aren’t convinced that world leaders are fully committed to their climate goals, according to Birol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GI8Zs5"&gt;“If they get from the governments unmistakable signals that clean energy technologies are the technologies of tomorrow, then I believe this investment will flow,” he says. Until then, limited supplies of critical minerals will loom large over any global action on climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1I8QQe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7JtnL0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clubhouse is funding 50 pilot audio shows from creators</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Clubhouse App Photo Illustrations" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_3wXEjIlPw_woVRTO4MRw-1zt_o=/0x0:3543x2362/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69241242/1232148642.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FYlVtX"&gt;Clubhouse is funding the creation of &lt;a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/blog/meet-the-creator-first-finalists"&gt;50 audio shows&lt;/a&gt; made by creators on its platform. The concepts include everything from an interview series with Taryn Southern to a pair of shows discussing the culture of hairstyles to a game show called “Serial Killer Speed Dating.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zQyShb"&gt;Participants will each get a $5,000-per-month stipend for three months, plus gear and creative support, to help them create the series. The goal is to develop and pilot each show over the next three months. If shows take off, there’s a possibility Clubhouse will sign some of them to a longer-term deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YnyIjy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Clubhouse’s goal is to “support new voices” on its platform&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cvv3WL"&gt;This is the first round of creators to benefit from Clubhouse’s accelerator program, which it says will “help support new voices with tools and resources to unlock their creativity on the platform.” Clubhouse says it’s not taking any ownership of the content or shows that creators develop. “The goal is to ensure that the creators themselves enjoy complete control and ownership over their creative output,” Clubhouse says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dCRHa7"&gt;Clubhouse announced its accelerator program &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/14/22330281/clubhouse-accelerator-creators-davison-app"&gt;back in March&lt;/a&gt; ahead of the service’s first anniversary. Its popularity with the Silicon Valley venture capitalist crowd has led to a large amount of early buzz around the service that’s arguably disproportionate to its mainstream popularity. For example, as of this writing, you still need an invite to sign up for Clubhouse, and it doesn’t have an Android app. Despite this, a recent funding round &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theinformation.com%2Farticles%2Fclubhouse-gets-investment-interest-at-1-billion-valuation%3Firclickid%3DwqaySkUP0xyOTQBwUx0Mo3ERUkBxpYzpX3qOTM0%26irgwc%3D1%26utm_source%3Daffiliate%26utm_medium%3Dcpa%26utm_campaign%3D10078-Skimbit%2BLtd.%26utm_term%3Dtheverge.com&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F5%2F22420644%2Fclubhouse-creator-first-pilot-program-season-audio-social" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;valued the company at $1 billion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tV3Iz8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22362980/clubhouse-social-audio-facebook-twitter-android"&gt;Established tech firms have responded&lt;/a&gt; to Clubhouse with plans to build similar social audio features into their own services. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391551/facebook-audio-podcasts-clubhouse-competitor-spotify-live-rooms"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22413033/twitter-spaces-android-ios-ticket-schedule-clubhouse-captions"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356993/spotify-locker-room-clubhouse-launch-acquisition"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/slack-wants-to-be-more-than-a-text-based-messaging-platform/"&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22359332/linkedin-clubhouse-clone-social-audio-networking-room"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22356682/discord-stage-channels-clubhouse-like-feature-voice"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt; have all expressed varying levels of interest in launching their own Clubhouse-style features. With competitors circling, Clubhouse’s success is likely to rely on the strength of the creators found on its platform. Initiatives like its accelerator program appear designed to help with exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Loki’s show is coming out two days earlier, in the spirit of the trickster god</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AjPkKNnxmhanu6d_OnLw4KpW29Q=/533x0:2336x1202/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69241096/Screen_Shot_2021_02_24_at_12.21.03_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EenqOj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;, the upcoming Disney Plus show about the trickster god and brother of Thor, will be coming out slightly earlier &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299343/loki-premiere-date-disney-plus-marvel-tom-hiddleston-wandavision-black-widow"&gt;than originally planned&lt;/a&gt;: the premiere date has moved to June 9th, from the 11th. The show will also air on a new day of the week, with new episodes airing on Wednesdays instead of Fridays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3L2MP"&gt;The announcement was made in a video uploaded to Marvel’s YouTube channel. The video starts with a typical Marvel montage, but then is interrupted by Tom Hiddleston talking about how Loki is always left out of superhero montages. (It’s understandable that he’d feel left out — even in articles about a show dedicated to the character, he’s typically described in relation to his brother.) “Wednesdays are the new Fridays,” he says, before the new date is revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jufhUL"&gt;It’s currently unclear why the day change was made, but fans of the series will have a slightly shorter wait until the show premieres. Disney didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about the reasoning behind the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vTm9kG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Disney Plus ","description":"Subscribe to Disney Plus ","label":"Sign-Up ","url":"https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1061256/9358?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fseries%2Floki%2F6pARMvILBGzF"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Trump objects to continued Facebook ban in email screed calling for ‘political price’ to be paid</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zgfNiw"&gt;Former President Donald Trump’s Facebook ban is sticking around for now, following the decision from Facebook’s Oversight Board to uphold its original ban from earlier this year. And Trump is not pleased, according to his first official statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qLpams"&gt;“Free speech has been taken away from the President of the United States,” an emailed statement from Trump &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MikeIsaac/status/1389962790467620866"&gt;obtained by &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reads&lt;/a&gt;, calling for a “political price” to be paid not just by Facebook, but by Google and Twitter as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="TEn1qw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Facebook’s Trump ban can stay in place, says Oversight Board","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22320329/facebook-oversight-board-trump-ban-decision"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5FMU3n"&gt;Facebook’s Oversight Board is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21249427/facebook-oversight-board-nobel-peace-prize-instagram-snowden"&gt;panel of independent experts&lt;/a&gt; established to oversee high-stakes moderation and policy disputes on the social media platform.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;In its decision, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22320329/facebook-oversight-board-trump-ban-decision"&gt;the Oversight Board explained&lt;/a&gt; that while Facebook’s initial decision to suspend Trump’s account following the Capitol Riot was valid, the company’s institution of an indefinite suspension was not. Instead, the Board asked that Facebook “apply and justify a defined penalty” — whether that be permanently banning the former president or instilling a set amount of time before Trump is allowed back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oAvSb2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Trump statement, over email (not his new blog) via &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/maggieNYT?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@maggieNYT&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/mA3MVDCt9Y"&gt;pic.twitter.com/mA3MVDCt9Y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— rat king (@MikeIsaac) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MikeIsaac/status/1389962790467620866?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AbRBW8"&gt;Notably, Facebook’s Oversight Board chose to punt the decision over whether Trump should be permanently banned, instead choosing to pass the final call back to Facebook. Per that decision, Facebook will be taking the next six months to “determine and justify a proportionate response that is consistent with the rules that are applied to other users of its platform,” meaning that the former president’s fate on the platform is still up in the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DGj9SY"&gt;Trump’s statement doesn’t actually comment specifically on Facebook’s Oversight Board decision or advocate for Facebook to make any direct changes as it looks to create more concrete rules for how to handle both Trump’s ban and future incidents. Instead, Trump sticks to his typical inflammatory rhetoric and insults, rather than addressing specific policy concerns with the ongoing review process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="NT3UnX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Donald Trump’s ‘social media platform’ has launched and it’s just a blog","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419850/donald-trump-social-media-platform-ban-twitter-facebook"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Dy2euQ"&gt;Having access to Facebook is more than just a place for Trump to post content on social media. &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/trump-facebook-reinstate-2024-bid-c9e51b54-7b35-4751-b620-0ceccd0979f8.html?utm_campaign=organic&amp;amp;utm_medium=socialshare&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook is a huge part of Trump’s political strategy and future, giving the former president and his team the ability to specifically target supporters with ad campaigns, in addition to serving as one of the biggest sources of Trump’s grassroots fundraising efforts. And a return to Facebook could be a major factor in whether Trump decides to run for office again in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XAfMcK"&gt;In lieu of access to Facebook, Twitter, and other major social media platforms, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419850/donald-trump-social-media-platform-ban-twitter-facebook"&gt;Trump has started a new, short-form blog&lt;/a&gt; that mimics the format (if not the broad reach) of his former Facebook and Twitter accounts. And while Trump is free to post to the internet, it’ll ultimately be Facebook’s decision whether to hand him back the platform that he last used to help incite the Capital riot in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QR65Fg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8vOd8h"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new 11-inch iPad Pro is already $50 off at Walmart</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XhdJUoJIvAT4grCWyb1qUU4JkoU=/0x38:980x691/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69241072/ipad_pro_2021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="601EPa"&gt;The new 11-inch iPad Pro with the M1 processor costs $799 to preorder at most retailers, but not at Walmart. You can reserve an &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1039828/9383?sharedid=VergeApple11InchPro050521&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-11-inch-iPad-Pro-2021-Wi-Fi-128GB-Silver%2F307298322&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;11-inch model with 128GB of storage for $749&lt;/a&gt;, and it’ll arrive at your door on or before June 1st. The step-up configuration with 256GB of storage is $50 off, too, costing $849 to preorder. We’ve seen similar preorder deals on the new iPad Pro from &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fexpercom.com%2Fcollections%2Fipad%2Fproducts%2Fipad-pro-11-inch-1%3Fvariant%3D39316139212834#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a site called Expercom&lt;/a&gt;, but it currently offers a vague “3-6 week” estimate for shipping your purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LjcFdP"&gt;Granted, it’ll still be another handful of weeks before a purchase from Walmart ships, but at least there’s some reassurance there that it’ll arrive by early June at the latest. At the time of publishing, Walmart says that orders will ship on Monday, May 24th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dcxYVO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10474637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9efM2W"&gt;With this new generation of iPad Pro, Apple uses the same M1 processor that’s found in the MacBook Air, 13-inch MacBook Pro, Mac mini, and new iMac. The company’s tablet and computing lineups are still distinct in the software they use (iPadOS versus macOS), but they’re getting more similar with every new iteration. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396449/apple-ipad-pro-macbook-air-macos-2021"&gt;My colleague Monica Chin thinks Apple ought to just rip off the bandage&lt;/a&gt; and put macOS on the iPad since its hardware is similar in many ways to a laptop.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blue Origin targeting July for first crewed flight, opens auction for a seat</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos Introduces The Blue Origin&amp;amp;nbsp;New Shepard&amp;amp;nbsp;System" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sesOE8LELsgKELwpHtY85dwvLEM=/0x0:5616x3744/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69240993/665033916.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NqS9k4"&gt;Jeff Bezos’ space company Blue Origin is aiming to launch its first crew of humans to the edge of space on July 20th aboard its suborbital space tourism rocket, New Shepard, the company announced on Wednesday. One seat aboard that flight will be auctioned off to support its Club for the Future foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wdfOZq"&gt;“On July 20th, New Shepard will fly its first astronaut crew to space,” the company said in a press release. “We are offering one seat on this first flight to the winning bidder of Blue Origin’s online auction.” The auction starts today, the statement added, inviting the public to place a bid on its website. The statement didn’t include any information on how much each seat will cost going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UUKLMG"&gt;Blue Origin said the auction, managed by Massachusetts-based R&amp;amp;R Auction Company, will accept sealed, anonymous bids of any price until May 19th. Any bids after that will be visible to the public (and, of course, must exceed the highest bid to advance in the auction). Then there’ll be a live online auction on June 12th as a conclusion to determine the winning bidder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="12VnL4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;On July 20th, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NewShepard?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#NewShepard&lt;/a&gt; will fly its first astronaut crew to space. We are offering one seat on this first flight to the winning bidder of an online auction. Anyone can place an opening bid by going to &lt;a href="https://t.co/6DpTdTxo36"&gt;https://t.co/6DpTdTxo36&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GradatimFerociter?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GradatimFerociter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/jBMFYX7xHg"&gt;pic.twitter.com/jBMFYX7xHg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Blue Origin (@blueorigin) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/blueorigin/status/1389973625537712135?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vJJpaZ"&gt;Blue Origin made the announcement on the 60th anniversary of the first crewed American flight to space. The company’s first crewed flight will be the culmination of over a decade of rocket testing, which has been set back by delays — the company initially planned to start selling seat tickets in 2019, with a goal to fly its first crew in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="32I9y5"&gt;According to the auction’s terms and conditions, the capsule for the debut crewed flight will be dubbed “RSS First Step Crew Capsule” and will include other astronauts picked by Blue Origin. The fine print doesn’t mention the July 20th launch date as mentioned in the press release, but says the flight “is expected to take place within six (6) months after the close of the Auction, and Blue Origin will keep the Astronaut updated as to changes to the date of the Flight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gVCCyx"&gt;The fine print also listed physical requirements for the winning astronaut: passengers must weigh between 110 lbs and 223 lbs, and should be between five feet and six-foot-four inches tall. Passengers should also be able to take forces of up to 3Gs for a couple minutes during ascent (or up to three times their weight), and five-and-a-half times their weight (or 5.5gs) “for a few seconds during descent into the atmosphere.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mqDJnf"&gt;New Shepard — named after the first American to enter space, Alan Shepard — is a 60-foot-tall reusable launcher designed to shoot a gumdrop-shaped capsule with seats for six passengers to the edge of space, about 65 miles above ground. The suborbital rocket has successfully flown 15 tests since its first launch in 2015 but has never flown with a crew on board. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383407/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-new-shepard-launch-first-crewed-flight"&gt;Its most recent flight&lt;/a&gt;, in April, served as an “astronaut rehearsal for future customer flights.” Company executives roleplayed astronauts and ran through a bunch of pre-flight tests but left the capsule before liftoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rf0RWR"&gt;The astronaut capsule is tailored for space tourists — each reclined seat gets its own massive window that stretches over three feet tall. The seats also come with their own push-to-talk buttons so passengers can chat with ground control, as well as tablet-sized screens fixed to the border of each window that shows live flight data and video from the launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qx9o6M"&gt;Near the 65-mile altitude, the capsule separates from New Shepard, which begins its return to land guided by its single rocket engine. Meanwhile, the capsule spends about 10 minutes floating in microgravity where Earth’s atmosphere borders space. At that point, passengers can leave their seats and float around the capsule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ApMfNo"&gt;After basking in 10 minutes of weightlessness, the capsule starts to fall back to land, deploying a set of three parachutes to slow its return in the desert of Van Horn, Texas, a few miles from where New Shepard landed. Small rocket motors at the base of the capsule fire milliseconds before landing to soften the impact of touchdown. The capsule’s six seats are supported by a scissor-like mechanism that is designed to absorb the touchdown shock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lf9fMI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zjSV3R"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Corsair K70 RGB TKL mechanical keyboard review: great gaming, good typing  </title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Great for gamers, good for everyone else&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="xQzA0F"&gt;Corsair’s K70 RGB TKL is an unashamedly gaming-focused keyboard. For one thing, it’s only available with the kinds of switches people normally recommend for playing games, while other features like low input latency and a dedicated “tournament switch” for esports clearly have gamers in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rDVBl0"&gt;At a price of $139.99 (£139.99), these features are coming at a premium, and they’re overkill for anyone not planning on competing at the next &lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt; International. But the K70 RGB TKL is a complete package with lots of quality-of-life features for non-gamers. It attaches to your PC with a detachable USB-C cable (a first for Corsair) and features customizable per-key RGB backlighting, dedicated media keys, and a roller wheel for volume control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zfzVeU"&gt;At this price, the result is a great gaming-focused keyboard but only a good general purpose keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zLZPGv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10484060"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gO2uJL"&gt;In case the specs didn’t tip you off beforehand, just looking at the Corsair K70 RGB TKL should tell you everything you need to know about its target audience. The bold, squared-off font on its keycaps is peak gamer, and the case itself has a minimalist, angular design. The only branding you get is a small Corsair logo on the keyboard’s forehead, which illuminates along with the rest of the keyboard’s lighting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5snihp"&gt;Its design might not be for everyone, but construction quality is good here. The K70’s keycaps are made of hard-wearing PBT plastic, and their legends are double-shot, meaning they let each switch’s lighting shine through and will never rub off. Corsair uses a standard keyboard layout, so you shouldn’t have any problems finding replacement keycaps in the right sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ffc4Uk"&gt;As its name implies, the K70 RGB TKL is a tenkeyless board (hence the “TKL” in its name), meaning you don’t get a numpad to the right of the arrow keys. This makes perfect sense on a gaming keyboard, where you’ll typically spend most of your time with your left hand on the WASD keys and your right hand on a mouse. Unless you really need it for data entry, a numpad just gets in the way. Available layouts include US ANSI, UK ISO (which I’m using), and other European layouts, but there are no Mac-specific keys available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5tht1gQjD2DaVNQ5ZkvAqO-VTQM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22491339/jporter_20210430_4567_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A discreet volume roller can be found on the top right of the board.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f6NOzpuGTaY9QINlBLXJIxJJQ74=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22491340/jporter_20210430_4567_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Switch options are limited to Cherry’s linear gaming-focused models.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6IyL1t"&gt;Although it’s not particularly wide, Corsair’s keyboard has a bit of a forehead to house its media keys and volume roller. I generally prefer this simple approach, rather than having to access media controls through a combination of keypresses, even if it adds a little more bulk to the board. Build quality is otherwise solid; the keyboard wouldn’t flex, no matter how much I tried to bend it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2oB56Z"&gt;The keyboard’s configuration options are aimed squarely at gamers. There’s no option for tactile Cherry MX Browns or clicky Cherry MX Blue switches here. Instead, your options are classic gamer Cherry MX Reds, competitive gamer Cherry MX Speed Silvers, or, if you’re in Korea, considerate gamer Cherry MX Silent Reds. My review board came equipped with standard Red switches. The switches aren’t hot-swappable, so you’re going to have to use desoldering tools and then a soldering iron if you want to try out any other switch types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ez5twO"&gt;The nice thing about buying from an established company like Corsair is that its companion software for configuring the keyboard’s layout and lighting effects is slick and polished. iCue is available for Mac and Windows and offers a truly dizzying amount of control over the K70 RGB TKL. You can remap the keyboard’s keys however you like and get access to a plethora of additional lighting effects. The controls are granular and get complicated fast, so I ended up ignoring them and just controlled the keyboard’s lighting from the board itself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U6P_HFuMqYVaePe1XcyrGQfr6TI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22491336/jporter_20210430_4567_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can control its lighting directly from the keyboard itself or via companion software.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1SKfhT"&gt;As well as handling lighting controls, iCue can also handle key remapping if you want to swap the layout of your keyboard around. It’s not as necessary a feature on a TKL board as on a smaller board with a more limited selection of keys, but it’s a useful inclusion if you want to tinker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FE3QxG"&gt;All of these are useful features regardless of what you want to use the Corsair K70 RGB TKL for. But its more unique features are gaming-focused. First up is a “tournament switch” on the top of the board, which disables any custom macros you’ve set up and switches the backlighting to a single less-distracting color. (You can customize which color using iCue.) It’s the kind of feature I could see being helpful if you’re simultaneously big into online gaming and also use a ton of macros. That’s a pretty slim Venn diagram of users, but thankfully, the switch is completely out of the way otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jx3qDD"&gt;The other gaming feature here is an advertised polling rate of 8,000Hz, which is eight times higher than the 1,000Hz rate used by most keyboards. In theory, this means the keyboard’s input lag or the time between you pressing a key and the signal being transmitted to your PC, is as minimal as possible, presumably making all the difference in a high-speed gaming situation. Corsair tells me this brings down median latency to under a quarter of a millisecond, compared to 2 milliseconds and up with a 1,000Hz keyboard. You enable the 8,000Hz polling rate from within Corsair’s software. It’ll warn you that the higher polling rate uses more system resources, but I didn’t notice any impact on performance on my Ryzen 5 3600-equipped gaming PC, and Corsair tells me this should be the same for anyone using a gaming machine built in the last three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bCLcIJMximxlaIB00lCJbKhuECg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22491341/jporter_20210430_4567_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Its keycaps are good quality, but their standard layout means it should be easy to find replacements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="InxyMQ"&gt;We’ve seen a similar trend with gaming mice, and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOQNRvJbpmk"&gt;Linus Tech Tips did a great analysis&lt;/a&gt; of what that actually means for performance. But the real-world difference it makes is minor, and I struggled to feel any difference in responsiveness when switching between playing &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; on the Corsair K70 RGB TKL and a regular 1,000Hz Filco office keyboard when playing on a 100Hz monitor. I have no reason to doubt Corsair’s low latency claims, but I think it’s the kind of improvement that only a small number of players will actually be able to notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8FPMoQ"&gt;The Corsair K70 RGB TKL is being sold by a gaming-oriented brand as a gaming-oriented keyboard with gaming-oriented switches, so it shouldn’t come as a surprise that it doesn’t offer the best typing experience. The typing feel just doesn’t match the crispness of a board like the similarly priced Filco Majestouch 2. Instead, bottoming out each keypress feels slightly dulled or softened, and since this keyboard is only available with linear switches, you’re all but guaranteed to bottom out each keypress while you’re typing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="B9qP0S"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10460594"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a3ipn4"&gt;I’ll give credit to Corsair for the K70’s spacebar stabilizer (the mechanism installed under the larger keycap to stop it from wobbling). While this can sometimes sound rattly on other keyboards, there’s no such problem here. But if you listen to the typing sample above, you’ll hear that other stabilized keys like Backspace and Enter have more rattle. Ultimately, the overall typing experience on the K70 RGB TKL is only good, never great.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pXCwzxvXl0fTBQryBGC_WxgvizI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22491338/jporter_20210430_4567_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;No numpads here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7w5GLy"&gt;At this point, Corsair knows what it’s doing when it comes to mechanical keyboards for gaming. The K70 RGB TKL comes equipped with all of the quality-of-life features that are expected out of a mainstream keyboard at this point: nice durable keycaps, media keys and volume dial, and a detachable USB-C cable. Some of its more gaming-focused features are borderline overkill, but they don’t get in the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W9f9em"&gt;At its core, though, the K70 RGB TKL is a keyboard designed for gamers, and there are better keyboards out there if you’re only an occasional gamer. You can get a better range of switches elsewhere, as well as a more satisfying typing experience overall. That makes the Corsair K70 RGB TKL a great option for a gaming keyboard, but only a good keyboard overall.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Entertainment Space for Android tablets puts videos, games, and books in one place</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dUsgdfGxfW_z4j4mrcuaINoPsuQ=/0x83:1987x1408/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69240715/entspace1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pdFckA"&gt;Google is today announcing a new feature on Android tablets that plays to one of their greatest strengths: media consumption. The simply named “Entertainment Space” will be a new section to the left of the home screen on tablets from Walmart starting this month, and it’ll expand globally to devices from Lenovo, Sharp, and others later in the year. It’s an all-encompassing hub that brings together video (TV shows, movies, and YouTube), games, and books. Entertainment Space is something Google has been building for a couple years, and it’s one of the more significant changes to the Android tablet experience in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6JXixY"&gt;“You’ll save time and avoid having to hop between apps to try to figure out what to do, whether it’s to watch, play or read,” Google’s James Bender &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/android/entertainment-space"&gt;wrote in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “Once you sign in to your subscription apps, Entertainment Space will show you your content in one place and tailored for you. And if you want to share your tablet, everyone in the family can have their own personalized profile.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0EEceH"&gt;The Watch section basically looks like the Google TV experience on Chromecast — but downsized for a tablet screen. There’s a big hero banner at the top, followed by a list of streaming apps installed on your device, and then you get to the recommendations. These actually &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; sourced from Google TV, so if you’ve got the new Chromecast, rows like “continue watching” should keep in sync. And you’ll see the familiar row of trending content and personalized picks. Hitting play means getting punted over to whatever app a video is from, but Google hopes its recommendations can help you cut through the noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kXXrpq"&gt;Move over to the Games area and you’ll find recommended titles to try, plus a “continue playing” row of games on your device. Google is also trying to do a better job of putting the spotlight on “instant play” games that let you hop right in without waiting for a download. They get their own row in Entertainment Space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EKSaOX9w7KfRqbyyFBdXSjKzzs0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22492751/Blog_Post_Read_Tab.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zJKNX1"&gt;Last is the Books tab, which lets you quickly get back to whatever you’re currently reading in Google Play Books. Audiobooks are also here, and Google serves up a list of popular books and highlights items on sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="unUY1m"&gt;As you might be able to tell, there’s nothing particularly revolutionary about Entertainment Space. Google says over the last year it has seen “over 30 percent more people start using Android tablets compared to the prior year,” and the company’s research shows that people increasingly want help with content discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gDeGL1"&gt;But there are already some early complications. For one, Samsung — the company that makes the nicest Android tablets on the market — isn’t yet on board with Entertainment Space. That could change in the months ahead; Google and Samsung are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407361/google-messages-samsung-s21-ultra-one-ui-redesign"&gt;increasingly&lt;/a&gt; working closer together on software. But for now, the list of OEM partners is rather small. That’s partially because Entertainment Space is integrated right into the launcher; it’s not a standalone app you install.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5sfZTj"&gt;The other issue is that Netflix isn’t taking part in Entertainment Space. It’ll show up in the “recently used” apps row, but Netflix’s content won’t be part of the recommendations in the Watch section. This isn’t all that surprising considering that Netflix has also backed away from Google TV and generally doesn’t seem to like having its shows aggregated and mixed in alongside other services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NU00M4"&gt;To take part in Entertainment Space, companies can go about it in one of two ways. They can do the work to add their streaming app to Google TV, or make smaller changes with new code coming to the Android developer portal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47t42u"&gt;If you have no interest in Entertainment Space, you &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be able to turn it off. Hardware OEMs get to decide whether customers can disable the feature entirely. Google controls all content recommendations, but since OEMs can preload apps on devices, that could impact which videos get prominence until you go in and customize your services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fSWUys"&gt;Google views Entertainment Space as similar in concept to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21406896/google-kids-space-lenovo-android-tablets-parental-controls"&gt;Kids Space&lt;/a&gt;, a portal that contains age-appropriate features and content for children. But this one is for older members of the family. Such a renewed focus on tablet software from Google is interesting — especially after the Pixel Slate &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/20/18693399/google-abandoning-tablets-pixel-slate-failure"&gt;crashed and burned so badly&lt;/a&gt; that it convinced the company to quit making tablet hardware altogether. But the devices are proving to be essential for some during this prolonged work-from-home and remote education period, and with Entertainment Space, Google wants to help make the leisure side a little simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
