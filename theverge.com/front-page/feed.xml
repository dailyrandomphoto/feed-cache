    <title>The original Ninja Gaiden Black and II code has apparently been lost, so you’re getting Sigma</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Ninja Gaiden Black" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yBEuOkOQB-4ucL8rELLRtLNLTOE=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69027031/ae016fda_8fb5_4bf2_9212_93ab0524d758.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A still captured from Ninja Gaiden Black running on the Xbox One X.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9H6Maq"&gt;People who missed out on the first 3D-action &lt;em&gt;Ninja Gaiden&lt;/em&gt; games released in the aughts (and that other one that we don’t really talk about from 2012) will have a chance to play all three this coming June in &lt;em&gt;Ninja Gaiden: Master Collection&lt;/em&gt;, announced for Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and PS4. But sadly, the first two entries in the trilogy will be based on the &lt;em&gt;Sigma &lt;/em&gt;re-releases that originally came out on PS3 and PS Vita, not their definitive versions (&lt;em&gt;Ninja Gaiden Black&lt;/em&gt; for the original Xbox and &lt;em&gt;Ninja Gaiden II&lt;/em&gt; for the Xbox 360) because the team says their source code went missing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CzeilD"&gt;Citing a recent &lt;em&gt;Famitsu &lt;/em&gt;interview (via &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/koei-tecmo-couldnt-salvage-the-data-for-ninja-gaiden-bl-1846550279"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), a staffer from developer Team Ninja told the publication that “there are only fragments of the data that remain. We couldn’t salvage them.” So, it’s not that the company prefers the &lt;em&gt;Sigma&lt;/em&gt; remakes over the beloved original titles: this was Team Ninja’s only option, apparently.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Ninja Gaiden Black" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9TLOd7H--AMbIRgxvT-UZmMkH8c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22397952/8bc003df_2fc2_4cd1_8f1f_ffa84b3c7573.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Another screengrab from Ninja Gaiden Black running on Xbox One X, showcasing the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/SeamusBlackley/status/1138830407539994625" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;original design of the Xbox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; as an easter egg.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mIEtRW"&gt;“I am aware there are pros and cons,” says Team Ninja brand manager Fumihiko Yasuda, referring to the &lt;em&gt;Sigma &lt;/em&gt;remakes. “For me personally, &lt;em&gt;Ninja Gaiden II&lt;/em&gt; was my debut, and so I have a deep feeling for it,” Yasuda said in &lt;em&gt;Famitsu&lt;/em&gt;. The pros he’s speaking of are the graphical and performance enhancements and extra content. The cons are more plentiful, like how many people felt &lt;em&gt;Ninja Gaiden&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Sigma &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Sigma II &lt;/em&gt;were made easier than the 2004, 2005, and 2008 copies of those games, and that some of the level design, game items, story beats, and enemies were changed. The interview doesn’t address whether the data for the original 2004 version of &lt;em&gt;Ninja Gaiden&lt;/em&gt; still exists, or if &lt;em&gt;Sigma&lt;/em&gt; is really the only complete copy of the game in existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DDlJtb"&gt;I’m still looking forward to playing all of these games again, possibly on my Nintendo Switch, but this is yet another example of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21516254/video-game-history-foundation-secret-of-monkey-island-code"&gt;why preservation in gaming is so important&lt;/a&gt;. These aren’t even particularly old titles, with the original &lt;em&gt;Ninja Gaiden&lt;/em&gt; releasing on the Xbox just 17 years ago. But, regardless of age, gaming’s rich history is better off remembered by having those games around rather than wishing they still existed. Well, time to go clutch my copy of &lt;em&gt;Ninja Gaiden Black&lt;/em&gt; and never let go.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rec Room rides uptick in users during the pandemic to become a VR unicorn</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/48Pex6eiBkn5c-VplRJwiCrt2C0=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69027021/RecRoom_Fantasy.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Rec Room&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GoWiY2"&gt;Gaming platform &lt;em&gt;Rec Room&lt;/em&gt; is now a unicorn, &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/03/23/social-gaming-platform-rec-room-raises-100m-at-1-25b-valuation/"&gt;valued at $1.25 billion&lt;/a&gt; during a recent funding round of $100 million. It appears to be one of the first, if not the first, virtual reality-focused startup to achieve unicorn status, a notable feat since Facebook’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/3/25/5547456/facebook-buying-oculus-for-2-billion"&gt;landmark acquisition of Oculus VR for $2.4 billion in 2014&lt;/a&gt; helped established the modern VR business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CUyftN"&gt;Founded in 2016, &lt;em&gt;Rec Room&lt;/em&gt; is a free app that lets players build custom virtual spaces and games that can be played across various platforms. The Seattle-based company launched on Steam as a VR-focused platform, and in 2018, expanded to non-VR platforms. It’s now available on Xbox, PlayStation, iOS, and PC. CEO Nick Fajt said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that VR usage on the platform climbed over the holiday season due in part to &lt;a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/zuckerberg-quest-2-mainstream-vr-headset-facebook-q4-2020-earnings/"&gt;sales of the Oculus Quest 2 headset&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4e2oaC"&gt;In 2020, &lt;em&gt;Rec Room&lt;/em&gt; saw a 566 percent increase in revenue — most of that comes from in-game purchases — and it now has more than 15 million lifetime users. Fajt says the company now has 1 million monthly active VR users, a number that tripled during the pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/online-gaming-platform-rec-room-valued-at-1-25-billion-in-fundraising-round-11616544000"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HUtbqm"&gt;The platform’s primary users are teenagers between ages 13 and 16, Fajt said, so &lt;em&gt;Rec Room&lt;/em&gt; benefited from students being online longer during the coronavirus lockdowns of 2020. But it was also growing in popularity before people were confined to their homes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HaYGnF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“People need a space like this”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ik60i3"&gt;“The pandemic accelerated trends we’d been seeing for several years,” Fajt said. “A lot of people are looking for a digital third place that’s distinct from home and school or work where they can meet up with friends, hang out, explore, and be creative. I think that’s been true whether teenagers were going to school physically or on Zoom. People need a space like this.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KDTf6T"&gt;He added that while it’s possible the platform may see a decrease in users once teenagers can gather in person, he sees &lt;em&gt;Rec Room&lt;/em&gt; as more than just a replacement for real-life socializing. “It’s helping a lot of people maintain connections with friends that are hundreds or thousands of miles away,” Fajt said. “These are friends separated by physical distance not just social distance. So if &lt;em&gt;Rec Room&lt;/em&gt; has become part of your routine, I suspect it will stay that way even beyond the pandemic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UTySJt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rec Room&lt;/em&gt; is preparing for an IPO in the coming years. In the meantime, other gaming platforms are continuing to grow thanks to a boost from pandemic audiences. &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;, an online gaming platform for slightly younger users than &lt;em&gt;Rec Room’&lt;/em&gt;s, also has seen a sharp uptick in use during the pandemic. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/roblox-shares-jump-in-public-markets-debut-11615402033?mod=article_inline"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; went public&lt;/a&gt; via direct listing earlier this month and said in &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm"&gt;its prospectus&lt;/a&gt; that it has 31.1 million daily users, who spent an average of 2.6 hours daily on the platform in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8CfrPz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last summer that over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21333431/roblox-over-half-of-us-kids-playing-virtual-parties-fortnite"&gt;half of US kids and teenagers&lt;/a&gt; under the age of 16 play the game. During the pandemic there has been much &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/16/health/covid-kids-tech-use.html"&gt;hand-wringing about kids’ increased screentime&lt;/a&gt;, but games like &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; and Epic Games’ &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;provide socialization, just not the in-person kind we may be used to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LjDk5A"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A fifth of Facebook’s workforce is working on VR and AR devices&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rUff5b"&gt;Before the pandemic, some of the appetite to develop new AR and VR hardware had started to wane — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21540786/sony-playstation-jim-ryan-psvr-headset-timeline-ps5"&gt;Sony PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan suggested&lt;/a&gt; in October that an update to Sony’s PlayStation VR headset was still a few years away. (Sony has since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296998/sony-ps5-next-gen-vr-headset-virtual-reality-features"&gt;teased more details about its next iteration of PlayStation VR&lt;/a&gt; with a formal product announcement, followed by images of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22337700/sony-new-ps5-playstation-5-vr-controllers-features"&gt;new controllers&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Goct4A"&gt;But other companies have for years been ramping up their efforts in AR and VR hardware. &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; reported earlier this month that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22326875/facebook-reality-labs-ar-vr-headcount-report"&gt;Facebook has some 10,000 employees&lt;/a&gt; — roughly a fifth of its workforce — focused on new devices in both fields, and the company has already shown off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338008/facebook-reality-labs-emg-wristbands-ctrl-labs-ar-interface-demo"&gt;prototypes of experimental research products&lt;/a&gt; and plans to release a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21439929/facebook-ar-smart-glasses-ray-ban-announcement"&gt;pair of Ray-Ban-branded smart glasses&lt;/a&gt; later this year. Apple has long been rumored to be working on AR and VR hardware, too, and recent reports suggest the iPhone maker will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272555/apple-dan-riccio-ar-vr-development"&gt;debut a VR device sometime in 2022&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CdSoCW"&gt;“The market has shown an increased appetite for gaming companies,” Fajt said. “I think that will only grow as more data becomes available about the strength and durability of these businesses.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla’s new touchscreen drive selector doesn’t violate the rules, NHTSA says </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b1hU_SxBx2DW-VobuerJjerUcPg=/0x0:1201x801/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69026837/tesla_model_s_witcher_3_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QAJj5x"&gt;Tesla’s decision to remove the gear-selector stalk from the steering wheel and automate shifting between park, reverse, neutral, and drive (PRND) does not violate any federal motor vehicle rules, a spokesperson for the National Highway Traffic Safety Agency told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZY2QHX"&gt;The gear selection via touchscreen is a backup while Tesla still works to fully automate the process. A video of the new touchscreen interface that will be available in refreshed versions of Tesla’s Model S and X surfaced earlier this week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22348668/tesla-prnd-drive-mode-park-neutral-model-s-x-refresh"&gt;causing a bit of a stir&lt;/a&gt; over the safety of using a touchscreen to control such basic, safety-critical functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BW5sbu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A properly configured transmission shift control operated by means of a touch screen interface would not violate federal motor vehicle safety standards”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9WFvvW"&gt;But NHTSA says that Tesla isn’t violating any safety standards with its unorthodox approach to PRND, and it’s not aware of any problems “at this time.” The spokesperson said in an email (emphasis ours):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="26G0eG"&gt;NHTSA is aware of the touch screen shift control Tesla developed for its Model S and other vehicles. A properly configured transmission shift control operated by means of a touch screen interface would not violate federal motor vehicle safety standards. Also, Tesla has certified compliance with all applicable safety standards. &lt;strong&gt;At this time, there are no known compliance concerns related to the shift control configuration.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="G6u13I"&gt;The operative phrase is “at this time” because the refreshed versions of the S and X are only just now reaching customers. If problems do arise, NHTSA says it stands ready to act and urges Tesla owners to report any safety concerns to the agency at their website or by calling the vehicle safety hotline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k1Fcig"&gt;By law, all vehicles sold in the US must be self-certified by the manufacturer as meeting all applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS). That certification is in the form of a label on the door jamb of each vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qEhW28"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-crash/u-s-safety-agency-reviewing-23-tesla-crashes-three-from-recent-weeks-idUSKBN2BA2ML"&gt;NHTSA is already investigating&lt;/a&gt; over two dozen crashes involving Tesla vehicles. Earlier this week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338427/tesla-autopilot-crash-michigan-nhtsa-investigation"&gt;NHTSA said it was sending its special crash investigation team&lt;/a&gt; to probe two crashes in Michigan, including a crash involving a Tesla suspected of being in Autopilot mode when it smashed into a parked state police patrol car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vfLAIg"&gt;Tesla also recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262072/tesla-display-failure-flash-mcu-recall-model-s-x-nhtsa"&gt;agreed to recall&lt;/a&gt; more than 134,000 Model S sedans and Model X SUVs that will eventually suffer from faulty displays after pressure from NHTSA.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PUBG Mobile has been downloaded more than 1 billion times</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vHsdeepKc79no8Fy5aVfvYqVXKE=/720x0:1920x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69026735/pc_kv3.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fiNSVa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PUGB Mobile &lt;/em&gt;has passed yet another milestone with 1 billion total downloads worldwide, Tencent announced. Although that number excludes Mainland China, it still marks a significant presence for the already huge game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HrWWwF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PUGB Mobile&lt;/em&gt; has long been considered one of the most popular games on the planet, following its 2018 release. In 2019, it passed the marker for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/11/18660985/pubg-mobile-monthly-revenue-players-highest-grossing-mobile-game"&gt;highest-grossing&lt;/a&gt; mobile game. Along with the news, Tencent also announced a partnership with &lt;em&gt;Godzilla vs. Kong&lt;/em&gt;. Players will be able to take part in an in-game event to go along with the upcoming movie, which includes a game mode and themed content. Tencent is also making classic map Karakin open to mobile players on April 7th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5KSMaJ"&gt;The developer continues to support the mobile game with updates including maps and more. Earlier this year, Tencent announced a new mobile entry in the series, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22297267/pubg-new-state-battle-royale-game-android-ios-2021"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PUBG: New State&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; That game is expected to launch on Android and iOS later this year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Competitively priced Motorola G100 and G50 offer 90Hz screens and 5,000mAh batteries</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ex2R7u7FDA_J2DB2Uju9aKZ4B0Y=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69026703/both.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 6.7-inch Motorola G100 (left) and the 6.5-inch G50 offer big batteries and 5G connectivity.&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;em&gt;Image: Motorola&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oiVLTU"&gt;Motorola &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.motorola.com%2Fblog%2Fhello-moto-g100&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F25%2F22350611%2Fmotorola-g100-g50-launch-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;has unveiled the G100 and G50&lt;/a&gt;, two midrange phones headed first for European and Latin American markets. Both offer displays with fast 90Hz refresh rates for smooth scrolling and animations, 5G connectivity, and they embrace Motorola’s ethos of “more battery, more better” with huge 5,000mAh cells. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GMcr76"&gt;The higher-end G100 is poised to compete with the likes of the Google Pixel 4A 5G with a Snapdragon 870 5G processor, 8GB of RAM, and a dual wide / ultrawide selfie camera for €499.99 (~$587). The G50, on the other hand, looks like a respectable, budget-friendlier device — its faster refresh rate, 6.5-inch screen is still a bit rare at its €229.99 (~$269) price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NlJWI5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10412513"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fDG5VZ"&gt;The Motorola G100 offers a large 6.7-inch 1080p LCD. Its 8GB of RAM is accompanied by 128GB of storage, which is expandable thanks to a MicroSD card slot. Support for sub-6GHz 5G frequencies is included, as is Wi-Fi 6. The G100 features a main 64-megapixel camera (lacking optical stabilization, sadly) complemented by a 16-megapixel ultrawide that doubles as a macro camera, complete with a built-in ring flash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RVGckN"&gt;Two selfie cameras are offered — an approach Google took with the Pixel 3 and subsequently abandoned — with a 16-megapixel wide and 8-megapixel ultrawide. Up to 6K / 30p video recording is possible with the main rear camera, and the rear ultrawide can capture 4K / 30p clips — something found on many flagships but isn’t too common in this upper midrange class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hNRPCM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10412520"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ClDon0"&gt;The Motorola G50 uses a slightly smaller (but still, you know, large) 6.5-inch 720p screen. It includes a slower Snapdragon 480 chipset with 4GB of RAM and 64 or 128GB of storage (thankfully, there’s a microSD slot here, too). The rear triple-camera array is mostly just a 48-megapixel standard wide camera; the accompanying 5-megapixel macro and 2-megapixel depth sensor don’t offer a whole lot of practical use. If none of that sounds too compelling, consider that the European pricing equates to well under $300. If the device were to make it to the US, it would be well-equipped to compete at that price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DFkxlJ"&gt;There’s no confirmation just now if and when these phones will be sold in the US, but we’ll be keeping an eye out for them. In the meantime, the G100 goes on sale in European and Latin American markets today, while the G50 will arrive in “selected European markets” in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7qmpa6"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jack Dorsey is just trolling Congress with Twitter polls now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="House Committees Confront Tech CEOs Over Online Spread Of False Info" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I9duW3xFZTHlUvD1i08VkfmM7ls=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69026692/1231928203.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VbNExA"&gt;Congressional “Big Tech” hearings often follow a three-step formula.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H2b0Hs"&gt;Step one: lawmakers demand that Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai answer questions simply with “yes” or “no.” (Sample: “Is YouTube’s recommendation algorithm designed to encourage users to stay on the site?”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pGO2SD"&gt;Step two: the aforementioned CEOs inevitably say something else, either to inject some legitimate nuance or to dodge obvious, unflattering answers with vague platitudes. (Sundar Pichai’s response to the above question: “Content responsibility is our number one goal.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j9dVD6"&gt;Step three: lawmakers point out that they’re avoiding the question and mock them. (Sample, from Rep. Billy Long of Missouri: “I’m going to ask you a yes-or-no question. Do you know the difference between these two words: ‘yes’ and ‘no?’”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cI6oTf"&gt;Later today, my colleague Makena Kelly will publish a breakdown of “Disinformation Nation,” &lt;a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/hearing-on-disinformation-nation-social-medias-role-in-promoting"&gt;a marathon House of Representatives hearing&lt;/a&gt; about social media, extremism, and misinformation. But to massively oversimplify, just imagine several hours of that three-step process — and that Jack Dorsey is clearly, obviously sick of it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3MZGol"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;jack pulling out phone to probably check notifications after done speaking: &lt;a href="https://t.co/kvafY0Dpwz"&gt;pic.twitter.com/kvafY0Dpwz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jane Manchun Wong (@wongmjane) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1375157286591590400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9N2rPu"&gt;While Pichai and Zuckerberg have mostly stuck to answering questions, Dorsey has started openly tweeting through the hearing — favoriting other people’s commentary, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1375159131548512257"&gt;sending passive-aggressive quote tweets&lt;/a&gt; wishing the questions were better, and trolling Congress with a Twitter poll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WxYqDQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;— jack (@jack) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1375152199433527296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ORSKuj"&gt;Jack Dorsey, for what it’s worth, answered “yes” to Long’s question. And on Twitter, “yes” is winning by a margin of 65.5 percent to 34.5 percent — but depending on how much longer this hearing lasts, there’s plenty of time for that to change.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter’s ‘unofficial mayor’ Chrissy Teigen quits platform after years of harassment</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Chrissy Teigen" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H3o7C64JjinL2mrLpgtsXwy-0yA=/234x0:2766x1688/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69024194/1231632327.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: NBC / NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hgqRM5"&gt;Chrissy Teigen, a prolific tweeter the company once called the mayor of Twitter, quit the social media platform Wednesday night. In a series of &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210325015153/https://twitter.com/chrissyteigen/status/1374898752545169409"&gt;now-deleted tweets&lt;/a&gt;, Teigen said Twitter “no longer serves me as positively as it serves me negatively, and I think that’s the right time to call something.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="96AZxT"&gt;The model and media personality who is married to singer John Legend was a witty presence on Twitter, and she had 13.7 million followers on the platform, which she joined more than a decade ago. Teigen tweeted about everything from her kids to her &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cravings"&gt;cooking projects&lt;/a&gt; to personal challenges in her life, including a &lt;a href="https://chrissyteigen.medium.com/hi-2e45e6faf764"&gt;miscarriage she suffered last October&lt;/a&gt;. She was famously &lt;a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/07/165013/chrissy-teigen-donald-trump-twitter-fight"&gt;blocked on Twitter by former President Trump&lt;/a&gt; (who was himself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;banned from the platform&lt;/a&gt; in January) and was one of a handful of accounts followed by the &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/joe-biden-twitter-potus-follows-chrissy-teigen-1234889200/"&gt;official POTUS account&lt;/a&gt; when President Biden took office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JIdBKT"&gt;Twitter even promoted her as its unofficial mayor, doing a “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/behindthetweets"&gt;behind the tweets&lt;/a&gt;” video segment in 2019 where she gave some backstory about several of her higher-profile tweets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="m3tCH1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Go &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BehindTheTweets?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#BehindTheTweets&lt;/a&gt; with the unofficial mayor of Twitter, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chrissyteigen?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@chrissyteigen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/oCf9UMtL5O"&gt;pic.twitter.com/oCf9UMtL5O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter (@Twitter) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter/status/1092845570694307842?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 5, 2019&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DREi8v"&gt;But Teigen was also the target of vitriolic abuse and ongoing harassment both on and off of Twitter. &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/reliable-source/wp/2018/01/01/chrissy-teigen-fights-back-after-twitter-user-drags-model-into-the-false-pizzagate-conspiracy-theory/"&gt;Pizzagate conspiracy theorists&lt;/a&gt; baselessly claimed Teigen and Legend were part of the nonexistent pedophile ring supposedly run out of a Washington, DC pizzeria. She said she &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/chrissy-teigen-blocked-million-twitter-accounts-deleted-tweets-epstein-1518008"&gt;deleted thousands of tweets&lt;/a&gt; and blocked more than a million Twitter accounts last July after ongoing harassment by QAnon followers. “For years I have taken so many small, 2-follower count punches that at this point, I am honestly deeply bruised,” she tweeted Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5H9bxv"&gt;This is a very bad look for Twitter, which despite all of its efforts to reduce harassment on its platform, was unable to protect a woman of color — and arguably one of its best-known personalities — from being targeted and harassed. The company declined to comment to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="law1hn"&gt;Teigen herself said on Instagram Thursday that she doesn’t blame Twitter. “I believe they do all they can to combat relentless bullying,” she wrote. “It’s not the platform. It’s not the ‘bullying’. And it’s not the trolls. The trolls I can deal with, although it weighs on you. It’s just me. I have to come to terms with the fact some people aren’t gonna like me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rWLhJv"&gt;Here’s the full statement from Teigen, which she tweeted out before deleting her account:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="RkzJps"&gt;Hey. For over 10 years, you guys have been my world. I honestly owe so much to this world we have created here. I truly consider so many of you my actual friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qtj7HO"&gt;But it’s time for me to say goodbye. This no longer serves me as positively as it serves me negatively, and I think that’s the right time to call something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N1qhZM"&gt;My life goal is to make people happy. The pain I feel when I don’t is too much for me. I’ve always been portrayed as the strong clap back girl but I’m just not. My desire to be liked and fear of pissing people off has made me somebody you didn’t sign up for, and a different human than I started out here as! Live well, tweeters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KvE4n5"&gt;I encourage you to know and never forget that your words matter. No matter what you see, what that person portrays, or your intention. For years I have taken so many small, 2-follower count punches that at this point, I am honestly deeply bruised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vz7PfY"&gt;I have made my mistakes, throughout years and in front of hundreds of thousands, and been held accountable for them. I’ve learned an incredible amount here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QiPGc9"&gt;God I have said fucked up shit and killed myself over it as much as you killed me. But one thing I haven’t learned is how to block out the negativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gL1Ces"&gt;I’m just a sensitive shit, okay!? I don’t wanna be this way! I just am! But I love you guys and I cherish our time together. I truly do. I also hate you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="38sFWX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: John Legend is on the board of directors for Vox Media, &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt;’s parent company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xCPXWI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 25th 3:47PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adds remarks from Teigen’s Instagram account &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The New York Times just sold an NFT for more than half a million dollars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The New York Times hq (1020)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6m-94ifloMyeo3ur0vjoxkc5Z8E=/3x0:1017x676/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69026327/nytimes-logo-hq-stock_1020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DBlptv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://foundation.app/kevinroose/the-new-york-times-x-nft-13129"&gt;has entered the NFT game&lt;/a&gt;, selling the chance to own “the first article in the almost 170-year history of &lt;em&gt;The Times&lt;/em&gt; to be distributed as an NFT” — and it’s sold for right around $560,000. While the Paper of Record &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319868/taco-bell-nfts-gif-tacos-sell"&gt;isn’t the first brand&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1984094/quartz-is-selling-the-first-ever-nft-news-article/"&gt;even the first&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/associated-press-nft-100k"&gt;news organization&lt;/a&gt;) to sell one of the digital tokens, it’s certainly been one of the more successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pqWZGv"&gt;The auction for the NFT was announced &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/24/technology/nft-column-blockchain.html"&gt;in a column by Kevin Roose&lt;/a&gt;, which acts as both an NFT explainer and a sales pitch for why someone should buy the article. The author is also able to talk about what the process of actually minting an NFT and putting it up for auction is like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rBKrka"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The NYT made a NFT!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My new column is about NFTs, and I also turned the column into a NFT and put it up for auction on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/withFND?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@withFND&lt;/a&gt;, with proceeds going to charity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bid away, and you could own the first NFT in the paper's 170-year history. &lt;a href="https://t.co/9ItGZvID8B"&gt;https://t.co/9ItGZvID8B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kevin Roose (@kevinroose) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kevinroose/status/1374753980958437378?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="cdrIdY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="COfsTH"&gt;Like other branded NFTs, the &lt;em&gt;NYT &lt;/em&gt;added a few extras to sweeten the deal. Of course, there’s a PNG of the article that the NFT points to, but the buyer will also be sent a congratulatory voice memo from the host of &lt;em&gt;The Daily&lt;/em&gt; podcast and be featured in a follow-up article about the NFT’s sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V6Pfql"&gt;As with many of the branded NFTs, the proceeds of the sale will be going to charity (specifically &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/neediest-cases/about-donate.html"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;’s Neediest Cases Fund&lt;/a&gt;). Which is great, because it’s a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kevinroose/status/1375121285181665283?s=20"&gt;mind-boggling amount of money&lt;/a&gt;: enough to buy two millennia’s worth of &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; digital subscriptions. The paper hasn’t yet said if or how it plans to offset the carbon emissions from the sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zpEd4L"&gt;When asked for comment on the sale, Roose simply responded with “wow.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jack wants the entire world to know he’s got a bitcoin clock</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3BwBlNwcx6R3ZoVjQ5S6BDdIP8Y=/25x0:714x459/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69026183/jack_blockclock.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1TiSbJ"&gt;If you’re watching Thursday’s House hearing on misinformation, where Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai are testifying, you might have noticed a clock-like device prominently displayed over Dorsey’s right shoulder. (It’s hard to miss — besides Dorsey, a window, and some houseware, it’s basically the only other thing in frame.) But the device doesn’t seem to be showing the time — or at least, I haven’t seen that. So what is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DrpIGQ"&gt;It’s a bitcoin clock. Specifically, &lt;a href="https://store.coinkite.com/store/block-clock"&gt;Coinkite’s $399 BlockCl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://blockclockmini.com/"&gt;o&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://store.coinkite.com/store/block-clock"&gt;ck mini&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re even tangentially aware of Dorsey’s love of bitcoin, this will not come as a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vYRdCQweEdvjUGagw-4ryzCIo5k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22397379/blockclock_mini.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Coinkite&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The BlockClock mini.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2xgKms"&gt;Dorsey is a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; fan of bitcoin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="VCCtrB"&gt;The only thing in his Twitter profile description is “#bitcoin” with a Twitter emoji of the bitcoin logo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TZQ8wl"&gt;He said in 2018 that he believes bitcoin will become &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/21/17147574/twitter-ceo-bitcoin-jack-dorsey-square-interview-currency-10-years"&gt;the world’s single currency within 10 years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0akjYk"&gt;He partnered with Jay-Z on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280005/jack-dorsey-jay-z-bitcoin-development-fund-africa-india"&gt;$23 million bitcoin development fund&lt;/a&gt;, which was announced in February.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Ii6Wnl"&gt;His other company, Square, invested $50 million in bitcoin &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507533/square-50-million-bitcoin-dorsey-cryptocurrency"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt; and upped that soon after with &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; $170 million investment &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297935/square-bitcoin-purchase-170-million-investment-cryptocurrency"&gt;in February&lt;/a&gt;. You can also buy bitcoin with Square’s Cash App.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="oB4epI"&gt;Dorsey just seems to be into blockchain-based things in general, having just auctioned off his &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344937/jack-dorsey-nft-sold-first-tweet-ethereum-cryptocurrency-twitter"&gt;first tweet as an NFT for nearly $3 million&lt;/a&gt;. (He donated the proceeds to charity.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BQA7hu"&gt;As for the BlockClock mini, &lt;a href="https://blockclockmini.com/docs.html"&gt;it can indeed show the time&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s also a Wi-Fi-enabled device that can also show you the current price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrency-related data. “Track prices from exchanges, see blocks as they are published by miners and connect Opendime to display balance, fiat value, and deposit QR codes,” &lt;a href="https://store.coinkite.com/store/block-clock"&gt;reads a description on Coinkite’s store&lt;/a&gt;. (The current price of bitcoin is more than $52,000 as of this writing, if you were wondering.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8fGfhG"&gt;If you’re enamored with the BlockClock mini after seeing it on Dorsey’s counter, you may not get it soon. Coinkite lists it as a “long lead item” and notes in the clock’s description that “lead times may vary — no delivery date guarantees due to high demand.” The device’s &lt;a href="https://blockclockmini.com/"&gt;main website&lt;/a&gt; also has a big button to “Reserve Now &amp;lt;3” that points to Coinkite’s store, which doesn’t fill me with confidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5vnGVi"&gt;Also, it’s $399.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now subscribe to a Porsche Taycan for as little as $2,500 a month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BMGBCsUjDPA6y2KqvjTPYxtxxlc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69025882/sokane_191127_3819_5467.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q7i0bZ"&gt;Porsche is adding its all-electric Taycan sports car to its subscription service. For as little as $2,500 a month, you can burn rubber in a 522-horsepower, 390-kW Taycan 4S with rear-wheel drive. The 4S normally retails for around $103,800.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gc5yny"&gt;The German automaker’s subscription service, Porsche Drive, first launched in October 2017 as a pilot program in Atlanta, Georgia. It has since grown to eight other cities, including San Francisco, San Jose, Los Angeles, Monterrey, Irvine, Houston, and Phoenix. As a subscriber, you can get access to up to seven different models for a month-to-month subscription or for as little as a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOehaY"&gt;“Think of Porsche Drive as sports car-as-a-service, a convenient digital way to access the Porsche experience,” said Kjell Gruner, president and CEO of Porsche Cars North America, in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bVWfy2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Think of Porsche Drive as sports car-as-a-service, a convenient digital way to access the Porsche experience”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DKcswW"&gt;Porsche is only making the Taycan 4S available to subscribers initially. Customers can access it through the automaker’s Single-Vehicle subscriber plan, not as a swap in the multivehicle program. The fees are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="B4LSji"&gt;$3,250 per month for the Taycan 4S &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fduwdA"&gt;$2,500 per month for the Taycan with rear-wheel drive &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="e8Dh5x"&gt;$335 per day for daily rentals for three days or fewer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RISsR2"&gt;$295 per day for four-plus days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="1sY5Nx"&gt;Porsche says its monthly subscription fees are about 20 percent more than the monthly fees associated with a two-year lease, but they come with the added flexibility of being able to cancel your subscription at any time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WACZWR"&gt;As part of the subscription, Porsche also covers vehicle tax and registration, insurance, maintenance, and detailing. There is a $500 activation fee at first and a credit check, but Apple iOS and Android users can then download the app and schedule same-day or future vehicle exchanges through the Porsche Passport app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PkaLPE"&gt;Subscriptions have been a mixed bag for the auto industry. Ford walked away from its service last fall following low demand. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/2/18050020/cadillacs-car-subscription-service-shutting-down"&gt;Cadillac shut down its service Book in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, only to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18197772/cadillac-book-2-subscription-service-dealers"&gt;resurrect it&lt;/a&gt; several months later with fewer options. Last summer, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21306823/mercedes-benz-collection-subscription-service-cancel-sales"&gt;Mercedes-Benz pulled the plug&lt;/a&gt; its Collection subscription service, citing mediocre sales. And most recently, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22231451/bmw-access-subscription-shut-down-nashville-cancel"&gt;BMW suspended&lt;/a&gt; its two-year-old service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R2i7XI"&gt;Other automakers have had some success. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/21/17888304/audi-subscription-service-monthly-fee-dallas"&gt;Audi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/30/16720830/volvo-suv-subscription-plan-600-la-auto-show-2017"&gt;Volvo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21143852/nissan-switch-subscription-service-price-model-vehicle"&gt;Nissan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/15/17464548/jaguar-land-rover-car-subscription-service-carpe-uk"&gt;Jaguar&lt;/a&gt; are still offering some variation of a subscription service. Even the big car rental companies, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/4/18652907/hertz-my-car-subscription-rental-terms-enterprise"&gt;Hertz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/24/18514404/enterprise-car-subscription-service-rental"&gt;Enterprise&lt;/a&gt;, are getting in on the action. Most of these subscriptions are only available in specific cities and are still in the pilot phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="moKMs0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
