    <title>If your iPhone 12 or 13 is having issues with calls, updating iOS may help</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13, in pink." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hzOzZiGzLh0VtWA7ztijbsr3KgM=/0x0:2019x1346/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70156363/vpavic_210916_4760_0069.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p8Gk5O"&gt;A new iOS update is starting to hit phones — no, not the seemingly feature-packed iOS 15.2, but iOS 15.1.1, which Apple says will solve an issue with calls dropping. According to the update note, the new version of iOS “improves call drop performance on iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 models.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XWdorh"&gt;While we haven’t seen large amounts of users complaining about their new-model iPhones dropping more calls than normal, it’s nice to see that Apple is paying attention to how its phones perform as, well, phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OWl7X5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;15.1.1 is worth updating to if you’ve been having issues with calls dropping&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="igyTso"&gt;You can update to iOS 15.1.1 by going to Settings &amp;gt; General &amp;gt; Software Update. If you find updating to be a pain and haven’t been experiencing any call issues, though, it may be best to just wait for iOS 15.2 — the beta has been absolutely packed with features, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22778650/apple-iphone-13-pro-beta-macro-mode-button-auto-switching"&gt;improvements to the iPhone 13 Pro’s macro mode&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22749352/apple-app-privacy-report-ios-15-2-beta-feature"&gt;addition of the App Privacy Report&lt;/a&gt;, the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774124/ios-15-2-beta-2-airtag-tracker-scan-privacy-invasion"&gt;manually scan for suspicious AirTags&lt;/a&gt;, and more. That update seems to be coming soon, so waiting to go through the update process would be understandable, especially given that Apple’s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201222"&gt;not reporting any major security patches in 15.1.1.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Withings’ ScanWatch takes an extra step to start using its EKG</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bZw95knh35qcRj46887pkVZYHo4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70156305/akrales_200916_4186_0036.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9LgKrv"&gt;In order to use the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22772984/withings-scanwatch-blood-oxygen-sleep-apnea-watch-fda"&gt;EKG feature on the newly available Withings ScanWatch&lt;/a&gt;, people have to first get the tool unlocked through a prescription from a healthcare provider — a first for EKG-enabled smartwatches on the market. Other smartwatches like the Apple Watch let people start using the feature right out of the box. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nsNtCc"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://support.withings.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407741101457-ScanWatch-Frequently-asked-questions-about-ECG-US-users-only-"&gt;requirement&lt;/a&gt; was part of Withings’ Food and Drug Administration authorization, &lt;a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf20/K201456.pdf"&gt;which says&lt;/a&gt; that the device can track heart rhythms and detect atrial fibrillation “when the monitor is prescribed or used under the care of a physician.” The extra step of obtaining a prescription came out of the company’s initial conversations with the agency, Shikha Anand, Withings’ chief medical officer, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ebBmW"&gt;“We don’t imagine that will be true for in perpetuity or even for very long,” she says. “This is really around sort of satisfying our needs” of the initial launch.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xV22gF"&gt;Withings has partnered with the telehealth platform Heartbeat Health to give out those prescriptions. When someone takes their first EKG reading with the ScanWatch, Withings’ app batches the recording off to Heartbeat, which matches the user with a cardiologist in their state. The cardiologist then reviews the reading and can unlock the full EKG tool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ece3P0HSnk8CIqbAElm_fxRbWMs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23022530/IMG_2047.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Victoria Song&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ScanWatch requires a healthcare provider review before the EKG feature is turned on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B77iID"&gt;The providers at Heartbeat Health review the EKG and give the users information on what it showed — like whether it was normal or if it showed any signs of atrial fibrillation. In some cases, if the reading was unclear (like if someone was moving around too much), they might ask the user to take another EKG, Anand says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7vMRVl"&gt;But there aren’t really any situations where the Heartbeat Health provider &lt;em&gt;wouldn’t&lt;/em&gt; give a user a prescription and unlock full access to the EKG. The only restriction is around age, says Jana Goldberg, the Medical Director at Heartbeat Health — the feature is only available to people over 22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J8AyGk"&gt;Otherwise, the review is more to make sure that the recording looks like an EKG recording should, not necessarily to make any sort of medical determination about the user, Anand says. She told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the external review reflected the company’s focus on quality and scientific credibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UfJAEd"&gt;“We really wanted that added layer of quality control,” she says. “And that added layer of quality control comes with a person — that is still the gold standard.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BuMBUY"&gt;Still, the company has already filed with the FDA to get clearance for a version of the device that wouldn’t need users to get that that third-party review, Anand told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C3GSqr"&gt;Withings hopes to build out a more comprehensive relationship with Heartbeat Health that could let users talk to providers about their heart health, Anand says. Heartbeat Health also sees the relationship as a step towards their expansion into working with wearable device makers, Goldberg says: “This is probably the first step in terms of the clinical-consumer device partnerships.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hUPREl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Heated seats for 2022 Chevy trucks are the latest victim of the chip shortage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UW17Y1_j8EgNGHRllIk5e9C0_ZM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70156291/akrales_170313_1481_A_0013.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7D8Vj8"&gt;If you’re looking to buy a 2022 Chevrolet (or nearly any GM vehicle) this winter, you might want to invest in a warmer pair of sweatpants: the company has announced that due to the ongoing chip shortage, it’ll no longer be able to offer heated or ventilated seats on virtually all its upcoming SUVs and pickups, &lt;a href="https://www.autonews.com/automakers-suppliers/gm-removes-popular-heated-seats-option-much-lineup-due-chip-shortage"&gt;as first reported by &lt;em&gt;Automotive News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ci1MRQ"&gt;“By taking these measures, it will enable continued production and delivery of inventory to help respond to the strong customer and dealer demand for all our products as the industry continues to rebound and strengthen,” a letter to dealers from GM obtained by &lt;em&gt;Automotive News&lt;/em&gt; reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lYz0sq"&gt;The change went into effect earlier this week on November 15th and affects a wide range of Chevy and GMC vehicles. As one &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@chevyknowhow/video/7030921030700993798?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1"&gt;Chevy dealer explained on TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, virtually all 2022 SUVs and trucks — barring a few high-end trims — won’t be getting heated seats anymore. Seat warmers aren’t the only feature to be impacted, either: heated steering wheels are set to get the axe on November 22nd on most models, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4lfL48"&gt;&lt;q&gt;No heated seats or steering wheels on most models&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cydcCU"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/heated-seats-steering-wheel-general-motors-chip-shortage-chevy-buick-cadillac-gmc/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roadshow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, GM says that the change is intended to be “temporary” as it tries to wrangle more chips but is expected to impact the entire 2022 model year. Buyers will instead get credit towards their new car of $150 to $500 to make up for the missing feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5lF8S"&gt;The lack of heated seats is one of the more tangible impacts of the chip shortage on cars yet and speaks to just how important chips are to modern cars — even for features like seat warmers, which you wouldn’t necessarily be particularly reliant on semiconductor technology. It’s the latest in a &lt;a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/g38179550/new-cars-tech-features-missing-chip-shortage/"&gt;series of issues with chips for automakers&lt;/a&gt;, which have also seen some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/5/22765709/bmw-chip-shortage-touchscreen-car-suv-manufacturing"&gt;BWM models recently remove touchscreens&lt;/a&gt; and some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/13/22780037/tesla-reportedly-shipping-cars-without-usb-ports"&gt;Teslas lose USB ports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2RBRV"&gt;It’s not all bad news, though: in the same announcement to dealers, GM also noted that thanks to better supplies of chips, it was able to bring back digital temperature displays, side blind spot alerts, and its Super Cruise driver-assist technology — three features that it was forced to remove earlier in the year due to supply shortages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KgmkeD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google says it’s improving fingerprint scanner performance with a Pixel 6 update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pixel 6 Pro and Pixel 6." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uN_XFSCdx54aHN63T8GT35iSso4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70156269/bfarsace_211014_4802_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qnscZx"&gt;Google quietly rolled out a Pixel 6 update that addresses fingerprint scanner issues, as first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/pixel-6-november-update-fingerprint-bug-fixed/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The update details have been confirmed in a post on a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/135866170/november-software-update-for-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro-us-and-japan-only-selected-carriers"&gt;Google Support page,&lt;/a&gt; which vaguely notes that it includes “minor bug fixes and some fingerprint sensor performance improvements for Pixel 6 and 6 Pro,” without really giving us any details about how the sensor was improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R9NzPW"&gt;Dan Siefert called out the fingerprint reader in our reviews of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro last month&lt;/a&gt;, noting that it’s often finicky to use or slow to recognize your print. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/7/22768853/google-explains-pixel-6-fingerprint-scanner-unreliable"&gt;Google responded&lt;/a&gt; by saying that the scanner’s “enhanced security algorithms” may result in sluggish or unreliable performance. Google never really indicated whether the scanner’s performance had something to do with issues in the device’s software or hardware, and its initial response implied that the scanner was supposed to be slow for its security features to work properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Y1ts1F"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jPm4ouSR_NI?rel=0&amp;amp;start=288" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LANtM2"&gt;But now that Google has rolled out an update, the issue might be software-related after all. To see if the update actually made a difference, I asked some of my colleagues at &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;about their experiences with the fingerprint scanner after downloading the Pixel 6 update. Here are our findings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="G6OY1P"&gt;I haven’t noticed a difference in the scanning, but it seems like it’s making me use my fingerprint less to unlock the phone. —Richard Lawler&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AUQj0P"&gt;I think the fingerprint reader does work better — I never had trouble with the left thumb, but the right thumb always took two or three tries, and now it seems to work pretty quickly. —Barbara Krasnoff&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DbN0jN"&gt;It’s certainly not so much faster (or more accurate?). But even best case, it’s still slower than an S20. —Dieter Bohn&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="X2GE4n"&gt;Overall, the results of the Pixel 6 update are a mixed bag. It seems like it offers &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; improvement, but it still doesn’t put it on par with fingerprint scanners from other companies. Reactions from users on &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/qvg2nz/google_releases_surprise_pixel_6_november_update/"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; offer the same kind of varied results; while &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/qvg2nz/comment/hkxbxai/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;some say&lt;/a&gt; the update fixed the problem, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/qvg2nz/comment/hkyc83e/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;others say&lt;/a&gt; the difference is there, but only slightly. It’s unclear whether the update to the fingerprint scanner will be the last of its kind or if Google has another one planned in the future. Then again, the issue may be related to the fact that Google decided to use an under-the-screen optical scanner instead of an ultrasonic one — and in that case, Pixel 6 owners may be stuck with the issue. For now, the sensor seems to be &lt;em&gt;just good enough&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="baH1vl"&gt;Google says that the update — which consists of two software builds: one for Verizon-specific devices (SD1A.210817.037.A1) and one for international models (SD1A.210817.037)  — has started rolling out today and will “continue over the next week.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="41vb7N"&gt;It’s also worth noting that while the update is just 14.56MB, Google says it takes about 25 to 30 minutes to download and install depending on the number of apps you have, which my colleagues can also attest to. The update will be available to you in November if your device is on any of the major wireless carriers in the US or Japan, including AT&amp;amp;T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Google Fi. You can view the full list of carriers on &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/135866170/november-software-update-for-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro-us-and-japan-only-selected-carriers"&gt;Google’s website&lt;/a&gt;. If your carrier isn’t listed, the update will be pushed to your device in December.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram will now let you rage shake your phone to report a problem</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o1CSNn12jVCMCYFfk38TT_QUIMA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70156169/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0002.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Rage shake your phone to tell Instagram about a problem | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gdfdDS"&gt;Instagram head Adam Mosseri said Wednesday that the company has added two new features to improve user experience, including a “rage shake” that will let users report a problem more quickly. If you’re using the app and it isn’t working as it’s supposed to, shake the phone while the app is open, and a pop-up screen will ask, “Did something go wrong?” with space for you to report the issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q4Qu97"&gt;This feature will give Instagram feedback that will help it prioritize bug fixes, Mosseri said. “You can explain exactly what happened, how you ended up in that place, and all of the emotions and feels that you’ve got going on, and we’ll have someone take a look at it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="56zMRq"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Covering ✌️ this week: &lt;br&gt;- Carousel Deletion (finally!)&lt;br&gt;- Rage Shake&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Did you know about these  s? Any other features you’d like me to cover? Let me know   &lt;a href="https://t.co/Yx0q4UGFfb"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Yx0q4UGFfb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Adam Mosseri   (@mosseri) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1461034689632686082?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AUdSJj"&gt;The other new feature Instagram shipped Wednesday is what Mosseri called a “finally” feature: the ability to delete a single image from a photo carousel. It’s something users have been asking for, he added, and the company finally got around to shipping it. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mgA9L4J4hvrjU6VL_hd_gIyWTfw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23022501/insta_carousel.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Instagram&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Users can now remove a single photo or video from a multi-feed Instagram post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IsTPbw"&gt;“You can now go and pick one that you don’t like — maybe you’re not that into it anymore,” he explained in a video posted to Twitter. When you have a photo carousel open in the app, go to the three dots menu at the top right, hit edit, swipe to the photo you want to get rid of, and you’ll see a delete icon in the top left that will let you remove it from the carousel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RvLTTw"&gt;The carousel feature is iOS only for now, but all US Instagram users can rage shake right away, regardless of platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZAAh0H"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="icZRRr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dTek9L"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Discord is quietly building an app empire of bots</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oVSM0A0qq7iaikXW3P5ox9Y4Em4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70155940/acastro_210129_1777_discord_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uM4BQ1"&gt;Discord has been quietly building its own app platform based on bots over the past few years. More than 30 percent of Discord servers now use bots, and 430,000 of them are used every week across Discord by its 150 million monthly active users. Now that bots are an important part of Discord, the company is embracing them even further with the ability to search and browse for bots on Discord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pBOzMx"&gt;A new app discovery feature will start showing up in Discord in spring 2022. Verified apps and bots (which total around 12,000 right now) will be discoverable through this feature. Developers will be able to opt into discoverability, once they’re fully prepared for a new influx of users that can easily find their bots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZWsoCh"&gt;Bots are powerful on Discord, offering a range of customizations for servers. Discord server owners install bots on servers to help moderate them or offer mini-games or features to their communities. There are popular bots that will spit out memes on a daily basis, bots that help you even create your own bot, or music bots that let Discord users listen to tunes together.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1ueoFiEct-Yz8IKc9ZUpoUHWOhc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23021410/2_member_count.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://autocode.com/solutions/discord-bot/" target="_blank"&gt;Autocode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discord bots can be used to provide information and lots more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZSTRu0"&gt;Two of the most popular music bots, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22669502/youtube-discord-rythm-music-bot-closure"&gt;Rythm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22640024/youtube-discord-groovy-music-bot-closure"&gt;Groovy&lt;/a&gt;, were forced offline recently by Google, due to their use of YouTube to play music in Discord servers. It’s an incident that shook the Discord bot community and confirmed that Discord bots are getting popular enough for a huge multinational company like Google to take notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t8hIbH"&gt;Discord has been gradually improving its official API for developers, including Slash Commands to make it easier to learn how to use a bot. Buttons, dropdown lists, and the ability to integrate bots into menus in a Discord server have also been added recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wIeZUM"&gt;The new app discovery will certainly help Discord users find bots more easily, instead of relying on third-party websites or simply finding bots using a search engine. Discord is also making it a little easier to add bots to servers by adding an “Add to Server” button on the profile of bots.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hyundai goes really big with its latest electric concept SUV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RjjPnYv9AvxoEAj0znnJs72Pb0s=/88x0:3309x2147/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70155883/48639_HyundaiMotorUnveilsSEVENConceptSegment_bustingSUEVfortheIONIQBrand.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IJ5G2j"&gt;Hyundai revealed a new electric vehicle concept at the 2021 Los Angeles Auto Show, showing how its scalable EV platform can be stretched to accommodate extra-large SUVs. The Hyundai Seven is built on the automaker’s Electric-Global Modular Platform (E-GMP), which also underpins the upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296991/hyundai-ioniq-5-electric-suv-ev-battery-range-specs"&gt;Ioniq 5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22357654/kia-ev6-revealed-specs-photos-electric-car-release-date"&gt;Kia EV6&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/genesis/gv60"&gt;Genesis GV60&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nb7xJ1"&gt;Unlike those vehicles, though, the Hyundai Seven is just a concept and isn’t guaranteed to go into production. That said, given how popular SUVs are with the car-buying public, it seems likely that the Seven will eventually reach dealerships in some form or the other. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/10/20828319/hyundai-45-electric-concept-car-design-frankfurt-motor-show-2019"&gt;Hyundai’s 45 concept&lt;/a&gt; eventually became the Ioniq 5.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6b3gTe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;a range of “over 300 miles”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DJtU1d"&gt;Using chargers with 350kW capacity, the Hyundai Seven is capable of charging from 10 percent to 80 percent in about 20 minutes. The automaker is also targeting a range of “over 300 miles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="p7FuZI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10871188"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HOr0Te"&gt;The Seven is one of the biggest concepts we’ve seen from the South Korean automaker, with a wheelbase that stretches 10.5 feet, which is longer than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21522959/cadillac-escalade-2021-first-drive-safety-oversized"&gt;Cadillac Escalade&lt;/a&gt;. The extra-tall grille also puts this concept firmly in the “dangerously large” camp of vehicles that includes the Escalade and other oversized SUVs and trucks. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21065319/suv-truck-front-blindspot-children-injury-death-wthr-13"&gt;Read this&lt;/a&gt; for more information about why front blindspots are a growing problem for the auto industry.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ecdxF"&gt;With coach-style doors, adjustable seating, and retractable controls, the Hyundai Seven is also a vision of what the automaker’s autonomous vehicles may look like in the future. A bench seat sweeps around from the rear to the side, while individual captain’s seats are able to pivot and slide around. The driver’s seat features a retractable control stick that hides away when not in use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0cl7xQ"&gt;Automakers love concept cars that tease a future in which people ride around in autonomous vehicles that look like luxurious living spaces. Other car companies, such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/ces/2017/1/4/14166808/bmw-interior-concept-inside-future-sculpture-photos"&gt;BMW&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/5/17822398/volvos-360c-concept-autonomous-car-electric-future"&gt;Volvo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22653897/audi-grandsphere-concept-autonomous-electric-interior-pics"&gt;Audi&lt;/a&gt;, have projected similar ideas onto their concepts, with interiors transformed into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/ces/2017/1/9/14190880/self-driving-car-third-place-rinspeed-oasis-ces-2017"&gt;“third places”&lt;/a&gt; in which we work, eat, sleep, and socialize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eiE2xn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;autonomous vehicles that look like luxurious living spaces&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gHuhIG"&gt;Hyundai is also putting emphasis on hygiene, with the understanding that in our post-pandemic world, people may want features that can help keep their vehicles sanitized. The interior surfaces are comprised of renewable and recycled materials like bamboo, as well copper and hygienically treated fabric. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zcjwQz"&gt;Hyundai took inspiration from airplane cabins in designing an HVAC system that has both a horizontal and vertical mode to control airflow. And when everyone has left the vehicle, the Seven’s built-in UVC lights sterilize everything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="558I4M"&gt;Unlike previous concepts, like the excessively rad &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22783810/hyundai-grandeur-heritge-concept-ev-80s"&gt;Heritage Series Grandeur restomod EV&lt;/a&gt;, the Seven’s roots lie firmly in the future. How much of these design elements make it through to an actual production car will say a lot about Hyundai’s commitment to going big. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u36ITM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The shareholder fight that forced Apple’s hand on repair rights</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A repair tutorial from iFixit shows a user accessing the internal electronics of an iPhone" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oOsFCsRYONNdeXoArLCZ2tyZWA0=/0x25:592x420/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70155770/ifixit_teardown_iphone_13_pro.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A repair tutorial from iFixit shows a user accessing the internal electronics of an iPhone | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPhone+13+Pro+Teardown/144928?vgo_ee=3bheJeT%2FPRsWKKl8dfWh0vlMy%2BOWWuyaZunZiCXh6gI%3D" target="_blank"&gt;iFixit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aANBG1"&gt;Wednesday morning, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/apple-announces-self-service-repair/"&gt;Apple announced&lt;/a&gt; that the company will soon make parts and repair manuals available to the general public, reversing years of restrictive repair policies. The new policy represents a seismic shift for a company that has fought independent repair for years by restricting access to parts, manuals, and diagnostic tools, designing products that are difficult to fix, and lobbying against laws that would enshrine the right to repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fHPqCC"&gt;But Apple didn’t change its policy out of the goodness of its heart. The announcement follows months of growing pressure from repair activists and regulators — and its timing seems deliberate, considering a &lt;a href="https://www.greencentury.com/green-century-shareholder-proposal-presses-apple-to-expand-access-to-repair/"&gt;shareholder resolution&lt;/a&gt; environmental advocates filed with the company in September asking Apple to re-evaluate its stance on independent repair. Wednesday is a key deadline in the fight over the resolution, with advocates poised to bring the issue to the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Securities and Exchange Commission to resolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BdtzSp"&gt;Apple spokesperson Nick Leahy told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that the program “has been in development for well over a year,” describing it as “the next step in increasing customer access to Apple genuine parts, tools, and manuals.” Leahy declined to say whether the timing of the announcement was influenced by shareholder pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nffZMT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The timing is definitely no coincidence”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WLSKQt"&gt;Activist shareholders believe that it was.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“The timing is definitely no coincidence,” says Annalisa Tarizzo, an advocate with Green Century, the mutual fund company that filed the right-to-repair resolution with Apple in September. As a result of today’s announcement, Green Century is withdrawing its resolution, which asked Apple to “reverse its anti repair practices” and evaluate the benefits of making parts and tools more available to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oI4PEX"&gt;That’s exactly what Apple seems to be doing with its new Self Service Repair program. Announced this morning, the program will allow members of the general public to order genuine Apple parts in order to make basic iPhone repairs at home — something Apple has long argued is too dangerous for individuals to do. According to Apple, Self Service Repair will initially focus on the display, battery, and camera for iPhone 12 and 13 models. Individuals interested in doing screen repairs or battery replacements for those models at home will be able to place an order for genuine Apple parts through a new Apple Self Service Repair Online Store, send in their old part for recycling, and receive a new one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MqNaBN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The announcement effectively fulfills Green Century’s request that Apple make significant changes to its repair policies&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jOAhiz"&gt;Apple’s announcement of the program is light on details, including whether the program will be expanded beyond iPhone 12 and 13 as well as Mac computers using M1 chips, how much genuine parts will cost customers, and whether it will eventually make parts available for a wider range of repairs. Although the announcement implies it will, Leahy declined to confirm that the program will eventually be expanded to other iPhone models. Still, the announcement effectively fulfills Green Century’s request that Apple make significant changes to its repair policies to facilitate independent repair — assuming the tech giant follows through with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="byZEva"&gt;Apple’s initial response to the Green Century resolution was less than conciliatory. Tarizzo says that on October 18 (30 days before the self service announcement), Apple submitted a “no action request” to the Securities and Exchange Commission asking the investor oversight body to block the proposal. According to Tarizzo, Apple’s argument before the SEC was that the proposal — that the company “prepare a report” on the environmental and social benefits of making its devices easier to fix — ran afoul of shareholder proposal guidance by infringing on Apple’s normal business operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7gHGaA"&gt;However, earlier this month, the SEC &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/staff-legal-bulletin-14l-shareholder-proposals"&gt;issued new guidance&lt;/a&gt; concerning no-action requests that includes a carve-out for proposals that raise “significant social policy issues.” In other words, shareholders &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; bring resolutions that affect a company’s day-to-day business operations if those proposals raise issues with significant societal impact. Tarizzo believes that this change made it much more likely the SEC would side with Green Century rather than Apple, particularly since the mutual fund company connected the dots between increased access to repair and the fight against climate change. (Using devices as long as possible through maintenance and repair is &lt;a href="https://debugger.medium.com/apples-new-iphone-is-far-from-green-1803f4f9a58a"&gt;one of the best ways to reduce the climate impact&lt;/a&gt; of consumer technology since the majority of the emissions associated with our gadgets occur during the manufacturing stage.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l1Dj9C"&gt;“It wasn’t a guarantee that the SEC would side with us, but the new guidance indicates it’s very likely we would prevail,” Tarizzo says. “It effectively took away a lot of Apple’s leverage in the process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jX8BDL"&gt;Now, Apple seems to have regained some leverage by announcing its new Self Service Repair program on the same day that Green Century was required to respond to the no-action request. Instead of arguing that the SEC should allow the shareholder resolution to move forward, Green Century is now withdrawing the resolution entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EpEfic"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some of Apple’s biggest competitors have already embraced right-to-repair policies&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PZNN0P"&gt;Companies routinely ignore shareholder resolutions, and many had assumed Apple would respond to Green Century’s resolution the same way — but it came at a time of unique momentum for the right-to-repair cause. This year, a &lt;a href="https://uspirg.org/blogs/blog/usp/half-us-states-looking-give-americans-right-repair"&gt;record 27 states&lt;/a&gt; have considered right to repair bills, and the first national right to repair bill was introduced to Congress &lt;a href="https://uspirg.org/news/usp/broad-right-repair-bill-introduced-congress"&gt;in June&lt;/a&gt;. None have passed into law, but they’ve sent an alarming message to companies like Apple that restrictive repair practices may not be legal for much longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S2Iwf5"&gt;That’s also resulted in pressure from the federal government. In May, the Federal Trade Commission &lt;a href="https://grist.org/technology/should-customers-be-able-to-repair-their-devices-this-federal-agency-says-yes/"&gt;came out strongly in favor of independent repair&lt;/a&gt; with the release of a report finding “scant evidence” to justify restrictions imposed by companies like Apple. In July, President Biden himself &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/09/fact-sheet-executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/"&gt;signed an executive order&lt;/a&gt; encouraging the FTC to craft new regulations that would limit the ability of cell phone makers to restrict DIY repair. Those rules are a long way from coming into effect, but the &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/07/ftc-ramp-law-enforcement-against-illegal-repair-restrictions"&gt;specter of looming regulations&lt;/a&gt; was certainly a factor in Apple’s decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="syQVvj"&gt;Some of Apple’s biggest competitors have already embraced right-to-repair policies, adding even more pressure on the company. Last month, Microsoft &lt;a href="https://grist.org/accountability/bowing-to-investors-microsoft-will-make-its-devices-easier-to-fix/"&gt;agreed&lt;/a&gt; to comply with a first-of-its-kind right-to-repair resolution brought by environmental nonprofit &lt;em&gt;As You Sow &lt;/em&gt;in June. The resolution asked Microsoft to study the environmental and social benefits of increasing access to repair; Microsoft not only agreed to conduct such a study but to act on the findings by the end of 2022. Microsoft’s concession to activist shareholders came on the heels of Green Century filing a similar shareholder resolution with Apple, a move activists speculated could pressure on the iPhone maker to respond in kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="niFteq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The company’s about-face on independent repair is “really the product of the combined pressure of all sides of the right-to-repair movement”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="66i69y"&gt;The result is a huge victory for Green Century and a validation for shareholder activism more broadly. Tarizzo says that while Apple’s new program “doesn’t go all the way where we want the company to go, we think it’s a significant enough step that it warrants a withdrawal. The fact they’ll be selling common replacement parts, tools, releasing repair manuals, it’s all very much in the spirit of what we were hoping to see happen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G8Jw4g"&gt;While Tarizzo feels that the timing of Apple’s announcement is directly related to Green Century’s shareholder resolution, she believes the company’s about-face on independent repair is “really the product of the combined pressure of all sides of the right-to-repair movement” from federal action to statehouse bills to grassroots advocacy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2V0KOE"&gt;Nathan Proctor, the senior right to repair campaign director at the US Public Research Interest Group, agrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FXq9yf"&gt;“If I was to hazard a guess, it would be the whole compilation of the campaign has successfully changed Apple’s position,” Proctor tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I don’t think you can point to any one particular thing that was done that made it happen. It all made it happen.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood says hackers also got thousands of phone numbers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tEElVxna2jFjo8DTsftQ8qbWhEA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70155510/acastro_210201_1777_robinhood_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="APq2Ls"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/11/8/data-security-incident"&gt;Robinhood has revealed&lt;/a&gt; that “several thousand entries” in a list obtained by hackers included phone numbers, indicating that a November 3rd security breach compromised more information than the company originally reported. More precisely, the list contains around 4,400 phone numbers &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3vddm/robinhood-hack-included-thousands-of-phone-numbers"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which reportedly obtained the list from a “proxy for the hackers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N4AwHv"&gt;Earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22770861/robinhood-7-million-customers-hacker-breach-extortion-security"&gt;Robinhood reported&lt;/a&gt; that an employee falling victim to a social engineering attack led to hackers obtaining 5 million customers’ emails, and 2 million customers’ names. Additionally, around 300 customers had more details like zip codes and dates of birth stolen, while 10 customers had “more extensive account details revealed.” Phone numbers weren’t mentioned in the company’s original post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TpZYRG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Robinhood reiterated that it doesn’t think SSNs or bank account numbers were stolen&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yTZjmg"&gt;Robinhood told &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; that it still believes information like Social Security, bank account, and debit card numbers weren’t compromised, but that it’s also analyzing “other text entries” in one of the lists the hackers obtained. The company also posted this information in an update to &lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/11/8/data-security-incident"&gt;its original blog post about the incident&lt;/a&gt; and said that it would “continue making appropriate disclosures to affected people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kmrXp8"&gt;This isn’t the first bit of new information to come out since the company originally revealed that it had been hacked. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774954/robinhood-hack-screenshots-information-devices-bank-transfers-balance-phone-number"&gt;Screenshots reportedly showing the tools and extra information&lt;/a&gt; hackers had access to for around 10 accounts were also posted by &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; last week, after the publication says they were provided by a source connected to the hackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hZedNa"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; points out, access to Robinhood users’ phone numbers could make the users vulnerable to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675709/sim-swapping-crypto-theft-iphone-8"&gt;SIM swapping&lt;/a&gt;, or targeted phishing attacks from the hackers or anyone to whom they sold the numbers. It’s also concerning that Robinhood hadn’t released this information until more than a week after it first disclosed the attack. While it’s possible the company wasn’t aware the phone numbers had been taken, that’s not a particularly reassuring explanation. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="QuftUQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 17th, 1:00PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verizon’s waves of PlayStation 5 consoles on its site have ended for today, as it now only shows out of stock. We’ll be sure to keep you up to date when we hear about the next restocks from Verizon and all the usual retailers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gPCXuo"&gt;If you’re shopping for Sony’s next-gen console, it may feel like a PlayStation 5 is one of the scarcest materials on the planet. The PS5 launched more than a year ago, yet it remains difficult to get a hold of one. Things have gotten a bit easier recently, with more frequent restocks from retailers and directly through Sony, but the struggle is real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PrbnyJ"&gt;But right now, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergePS5Verizon111721/https://www.verizon.com/products/sony-playstation-5-console-disc-edition-ps5/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon customers can pick up the standard, disc-based PS5 for $500&lt;/a&gt; directly from the carrier. The console listing is already up and the carrier is seemingly releasing stock in waves, so you have to get in there as soon as possible and see if luck is on your side today. Remember to log in to your Verizon cellular account while you wait and be sure your billing and shipping info is current, which will reduce the time it takes to check out and minimize the room for error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Z0MSo"&gt;If you don’t manage to nab a console today, fear not, we will continue serving you with details when more restocks happen. We are also happy to save you money on everyday purchases, so feel free to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/newsletters"&gt;subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
