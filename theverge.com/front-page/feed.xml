    <title>Hollywood wasn’t built for a year without theaters</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6_1dnevn7xUNyzc8Q83eILWJX8A=/66x0:1400x889/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68528243/tenet.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XTmWub"&gt;Hollywood scheduling has always run like a finely tuned watch: a delicate dance of release dates as studios try to optimize movies for the most money, avoiding other massive blockbusters, while juggling the shifting demands of film editing, reshoots, and special effects work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NSORVQ"&gt;But the shuttering of theaters by the pandemic has thrown all of that into disarray, forcing studios to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/12/21176895/fast-and-furious-f9-delay-universal-coronavirus-vin-diesel"&gt;shift release dates&lt;/a&gt; in a chaotic cascade. Each change has ripple effects due to that strict schedule: when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21437889/black-widow-delayed-release-date-marvel-cinematic-universe-disney-streaming-mulan"&gt;one massive superhero film moves dates&lt;/a&gt;, it trickles down the line, forcing both movies from within the studio and from competitors to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21503618/the-batman-matrix-4-release-dates-warner-bros"&gt;shuffle their dates&lt;/a&gt; to avoid risking splitting their audiences (and box office takes). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5JDav1"&gt;Small delays turned into large ones; films that were scheduled for 2020 jumped to 2021. And yet, in all the uncertainty, it seemed that studios were extremely reluctant to turn to what might have seemed like an obvious solution: just releasing their biggest films on any of the newly minted streaming services or digital video storefronts in lieu of a theatrical release. The current model of Hollywood just wasn’t built to survive without theaters. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zxT0YlLT9Cw718R8-sS0W2KDitc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16199970/AvengersEndgame5cbe860b2f312.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Film Frame / Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TFiFwA"&gt;There’s a simple explanation for Hollywood’s hesitation to embrace streaming: theaters are &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/is-netflix-killing-the-movie-theater-not-so-fast/2018/12/24/7a16dbf8-037a-11e9-8186-4ec26a485713_story.html"&gt;where the money&lt;/a&gt; is, and &lt;a href="https://medium.com/swlh/one-clear-casualty-of-the-streaming-wars-profit-683304b3055d"&gt;streaming&lt;/a&gt; — at least in today’s world — &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/23/why-hollywood-is-sticking-with-movie-theaters-and-not-streaming.html"&gt;can’t match that revenue&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJCvPo"&gt;Traditional theater chains like AMC and Regal Cinemas still wield immense power over the current movie landscape. The amount of money they bring in to studios is great enough that companies like Disney and Warner Bros. are willing to forgo close to half of their revenue (theaters typically keep roughly 45 percent of the box office). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QngZzN"&gt;When Universal began to even mutter about the idea of releasing some of its films on streaming alongside theaters, AMC CEO Adam Aron went to near total war, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21240637/amc-theaters-universal-trolls-world-tour-disney-warnermedia-digital-streaming"&gt;threatening to no longer play any of its films&lt;/a&gt;. The two companies have since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21345713/amc-universal-movies-theaters-digital-rentals-pvod-streaming-agreement"&gt;reached a new deal&lt;/a&gt; to allow for Universal’s films to debut on streaming services just 17 days after they debut in theaters — an unprecedented time frame for major films — in exchange for giving AMC a cut of the digital take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v1IVf6"&gt;There’s also the prestige of being a “theatrical” movie, one that remains a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21240422/oscars-streaming-theaters-rules-2021-netflix-digital-release-academy"&gt;requirement for eligibility&lt;/a&gt; for major awards like the Oscars. Years on, companies like Netflix and Amazon are still trying to work their way out of the reputation that streaming is somehow a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/18/18229794/steven-spielberg-streaming-theatrical-films-netflix-roma"&gt;lesser form of entertainment&lt;/a&gt;. Smaller movies have done well in the chaos — some, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21239703/trolls-world-tour-amc-digital-streaming-theaters-nbcuniversal-disney-warnerbros"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trolls: World Tour&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, have even defied expectations. But barring a few notable exceptions, major studios haven’t been willing to risk their billion-dollar films on the unproven marketplace of direct-to-consumer sales or streaming. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/brLHsvJc8MeS64QD43qRKhk5GYE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19932674/trolls_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fHTH9i"&gt;Because it’s true: today’s biggest blockbusters rake in more — like last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18513309/avengers-endgame-spoiler-free-review-marvel-cinematic-universe-iron-man-thor-captain-america-phase-4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which smashed through the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/21/20702651/avengers-endgame-avatar-biggest-movie-box-office-comic-con-phase-4"&gt;all-time box office record&lt;/a&gt; and made an astronomical $2.79 billion. But these massive films also bring with them eye-watering costs: &lt;em&gt;Endgame&lt;/em&gt; is estimated to have cost roughly $400 million when factoring in the production budget, multimillion-dollar salaries for stars like Robert Downey Jr., and the &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2019/04/avengers-endgame-mcdonalds-google-coca-cola-ultra-beauty-audi-all-time-record-marketing-campaign-videos-1202595738/"&gt;massive marketing campaign&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mmym67"&gt;But the shuttering of theaters has effectively frozen the entire business in stasis as studios struggle to figure out what exactly to do with their multimillion-dollar investments that have no clear release strategy anymore. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x9KLnkBPzqvZK_uPwucXyWhGeGs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19954729/tenet_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Melinda Sue Gordon&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PHsaFo"&gt;Take Warner Bros.’ &lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt;, for example. The blockbuster Christopher Nolan film was supposed to be one of the studio’s biggest movies of the year, an event that — in a normal world — would have brought huge crowds to theaters and was projected to rake in $1 billion at the box office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jou6XT"&gt;Instead, &lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt; was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/26/21304259/warner-bros-tenet-delay-date-disney-mulan-theaters-reopening#:~:text=Warner%20Bros.%20has%20announced%20that,spike%20around%20the%20United%20States."&gt;delayed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/12/21250529/tenet-movie-delay-release-date-christopher-nolan-robert-pattinson-disney-universal-warner-bros"&gt;delayed&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/20/21331356/tenet-delayed-warner-bros-christopher-nolan-international-disney"&gt;delayed again&lt;/a&gt; before it finally attempted to release while coping with the severe limitations of COVID. But even then, theater capacities (and therefore, ticket prices) were cut down a fraction of their usual numbers for safety purposes, some of the biggest theater marketplaces in the world, like New York City or Los Angeles, never saw it on the big screen at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Gr9aZ"&gt;The results are staggering: while &lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt; grossed a more than respectable $300 million in international markets, &lt;a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl1442940417/weekend/"&gt;it’s made just $57 million in the US&lt;/a&gt; — a considerable decrease, given the &lt;a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2020/01/tenet-budget-205-million-christopher-nolan-plan-1202202123/"&gt;estimated $205 million production budget&lt;/a&gt; that Warner Bros. invested in the film (a figure that doesn’t even include the film’s marketing spend).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x5qWwk"&gt;With results like that, it’s no wonder that most of 2020’s biggest films have elected to punt on their releases and rescheduled for 2021 and beyond. When gambling hundreds of millions of dollars on a single release, studios can’t afford to risk another theatrical flop in the United States from 2020’s anemic audiences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iea48K"&gt;But simply stockpiling movies isn’t the answer, either. Each of these films is an investment of tens, if not hundreds of millions of dollars that studios need to at least recoup at some point and which theaters need to stay open. It’s a delicate balance: the movie industry &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514822/amc-theaters-cash-movies-delays-closing-pandemic-debt-regal"&gt;needs money in the short term to survive&lt;/a&gt;, but it is also designed to run on hundreds of millions in revenue, which theatrical releases in 2020 just haven’t been able to provide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pKmEJO"&gt;The model is already changing, and studios and theaters alike are starting to experiment with new ways of doing things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dVuvTG"&gt;Disney shifted the release of major films like &lt;em&gt;Hamilton&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Soul&lt;/em&gt; to Disney Plus, and it’s experimenting with a new Premiere Access for releasing big films for higher digital price tags instead of traditional theatrical releases. Though, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2020/11/mulan-pvod-bob-chapek-revenue-viewership-1234613878/#:~:text=Disney%2B%20reported%2073.7%20million%20subscribers,with%20525%20million%20minutes%20viewed."&gt;it’s not clear&lt;/a&gt; how well (or poorly) the live-action &lt;em&gt;Mulan&lt;/em&gt; actually did in terms of revenue for the company. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rzNnVZFzGddRF5dcdBUvKzpDNvs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21874479/wonder_woman.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GMtCmq"&gt;Warner Bros. appears to have learned from its lackluster &lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt; strategy and is trying a different approach for both the highly anticipated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21504152/wonder-woman-1984-release-delay-new-date-warner-bros-disney-black-widow-dune-tenet"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;&lt;em&gt;every single one of its 2021 films&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Starting this December, and going through the end of 2021, Warner Bros. will release its movies both in theaters (where possible) and on the company’s streaming service HBO Max. It’s a move that theoretically will give the studio the best of both worlds, capitalizing on the high ticket revenue of traditional theaters while still letting it reach audiences that can’t, or simply won’t, go to a theater during a pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="B5ULzG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Warner Bros. will release all of its new 2021 movies simultaneously on HBO Max","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="cwjuK4"&gt;All of these approaches are still largely untested, mainly because of the huge risk involved: no one wanted to gamble their possible billion-dollar movie, at least not until absolutely necessary. And it’s not clear whether any of them will be able to offer results on par with traditional theaters. In 2019, the global box office hit an &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8547827/2019-global-box-office-revenue-hit-record-425b-despite-4-percent-dip-in-us"&gt;astonishing $42.5 billion worldwide&lt;/a&gt; — big shoes that these new methods will have to fill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1jvF5"&gt;2020 has shown that Hollywood wasn’t designed for a world without theaters. But 2021 might show us the first glimpse at a world of movies that extends far beyond the walls of a traditional movie theater. But one thing’s for sure: however we watch the movies of the future, it’ll look very different from the last century of film.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>In 2021, we need to fix America’s internet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6J_fP3a461Ah3Z-rAteG9fJUMOk=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68528179/VRG_ILLO_4341_American_Ethernet.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;We pay twice as much as Europe for high speeds, assuming we can even get them&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="2PG4GB"&gt;Every few months it’ll send me a postcard. Once, in the midst of the pandemic, it even sent salespeople to my door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zsCNQ9"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T wants to sell me 1,000Mbps fiber-optic internet, and I’m beyond ready to pay for it. In fact, I’ve already signed the contract at least nine times now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PVo94Z"&gt;But like tens of millions of my fellow citizens across the United States, I don’t actually have the ability to switch. Across the country, the FCC and internet service providers are pretending there’s competition in an unimaginable number of places where it doesn’t actually exist. It’s a nationwide problem, but one that I’m experiencing even in the Silicon Valley — where you’d think the internet might be better.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Nine Gmail subject lines that say “Hello, review your AT&amp;amp;amp;T order”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RKIwBfUbMUmD1Ck9ere_omo4i-Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22173217/att_order_fiber_optic.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I ordered AT&amp;amp;T Fiber at least nine times. It never rejected me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lCHBBU"&gt;Today, I pay $100 a month for Comcast internet, and the cable company’s speeds leave something to be desired. My wife, a video producer, can’t reliably upload her company’s videos to its FTP servers. The family videos we shoot on our smartphones take hours to appear in Google Photos, and there’s no point in me even trying to stream games to YouTube or Twitch. While my download speed is decent at 200Mbps, the uploads are absolutely atrocious at just 5Mbps up, and I’d have to pay Comcast even more to change that. And my bill has already gone up: I paid $70 until the pandemic hit and we started running into Comcast’s completely arbitrary 1.2TB data cap. Now, I have to pay extra for unlimited so I don’t rack up overage fees every single month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G5BOht"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T seems like the obvious answer. The company’s fiber network offers 1,000Mbps downloads &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; 1,000Mbps uploads for $70 a month, no data cap whatsoever. Competition is good, eh? The only problem is that AT&amp;amp;T doesn’t actually serve my address... even though it continues to insist it does. The company’s field technicians have visited my home easily a dozen times now, but their conclusion is always the same: AT&amp;amp;T buried its fiber in the wrong place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6mJnjH"&gt;A few houses down from me, there’s a concrete cover embedded in the pavement. If you look underneath, you’ll find a fiber-optic node labeled with my exact street address. It’s supposed to be in front of my home; AT&amp;amp;T’s service maps say it’s in front of my home, but those maps are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Walking down the sidewalk, you can see chalk arrows pointing from one box to another." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ypZNpnDiFScppZzx9FgSLTgd3GI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22173278/sidewalk_run_3.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF by Sean Hollister/The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where AT&amp;amp;T’s fiber should be vs. where it actually is. One day, I walked outside to find these chalk arrows connecting the two — false hope, sadly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JmFbO9"&gt;The more grizzled AT&amp;amp;T vets warned me I’d get no satisfaction from AT&amp;amp;T. They told me it was illegal to run wires over my particular street — and that there was little to no chance AT&amp;amp;T would spend $10,000+ to dig up the sidewalk just to serve more houses on my side of the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kQQ4C4"&gt;Some friendly techs filed dig tickets anyhow! I was told at least twice it was actually going to happen. (AT&amp;amp;T sales reps told me it had &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; happened according to their records.) Once, I even got an actual notice from AT&amp;amp;T than my order had been canceled. But every other time, I’d call weeks later to find out my order had simply, quietly vanished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="suBfFz"&gt;If the company wasn’t going to give me internet, why couldn’t it remove me from its marketing lists? Why couldn’t it simply update its maps? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M1TO0q"&gt;That last question, it turns out, is far bigger than I imagined. It may help explain why America’s internet is so broken to begin with, and get us on the path to fixing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NIKe2F"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21183589/fcc-commissioner-jessica-rosenworcel-homework-gap-editorial-wifi-hotspots-coronavirus"&gt;As FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel wrote&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last March, as many as one in three US households doesn’t have broadband internet access, currently defined as just 25Mbps down and 3Mbps up — which feels like the bare minimum for a remote learning family these days. Even before the pandemic, that statistic might have been shocking; now, it’s the difference between whether millions of schoolchildren can attend classes and do their homework or not. Nearly 12 million children don’t have a broadband connection at home, &lt;a href="https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/democrats/2018/12/axios-the-homework-gap-12-million-schoolchildren-lack-internet"&gt;the Senate Joint Economic Committee reported&lt;/a&gt; in 2017. And the “homework gap” hits harder if you’re poor, of course: only 56 percent of households with incomes under $30,000 had broadband as of last February, &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/internet-broadband/"&gt;according to the Pew Research Center&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kLOPv9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"America’s internet wasn’t prepared for online school","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21504476/online-school-covid-pandemic-rural-low-income-internet-broadband"},{"title":"As classes move online, many students aren’t coming with them","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21239567/remote-school-distance-learning-digital-internet-tech-gap-devices-access"},{"title":"Both parties want rural broadband.

&lt;p id="YuxVdB"&gt;In 2009, the US spent $350 million on a “National Broadband Map” that turned out to be nothing more &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/24/17882842/us-internet-broadband-map-isp-fcc-wireless-competition"&gt;than a chance for the wolves to guard the hens&lt;/a&gt;: it relied on ISPs like Comcast and AT&amp;amp;T to &lt;em&gt;submit their own data&lt;/em&gt;, which the FCC &lt;em&gt;does not audit.&lt;/em&gt; According to the FCC’s map, I have 11 different broadband providers at my address! But if you break it down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="flJ88y"&gt;Two of them are “fixed wireless” that cater to businesses, not homes, one of which starts at $99 a month for 3Mbps (not a typo)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kznsJ7"&gt;Two of them are slow, data-capped satellite internet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eGKJZk"&gt;Four of them are duplicates of the same providers (including three different tiers of AT&amp;amp;T DSL)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bhGTq0"&gt;Two of them don’t offer service at my address at all&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Cf7ysq"&gt;That leaves me with just Comcast — and you with the reason why the United States and its ISP lobbyists get to &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/new-report-suggests-fcc-massively-overstated-gigabit-co-1845842681/amp?__twitter_impression=true"&gt;pretend they’re doing a decent job&lt;/a&gt;, even when there’s no meaningful competition. About 88.3 million Americans only have a single choice of broadband provider, &lt;a href="https://ilsr.org/report-most-americans-have-no-real-choice-in-internet-providers/"&gt;according to the Institute for Local Self-Reliance&lt;/a&gt;, because their other choice is DSL that doesn’t even meet the FCC’s own definition of broadband at 25Mbps down / 3Mbps up. That’s effectively a monopoly, and the report claims 22 million of them are dependent on Comcast alone. And those are *low* estimates, by the way, because they’re based on the same faulty, self-reported data as the FCC’s terrible maps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XKaoeP"&gt;When Comcast knows you have no other alternative, it can get away with things you’d never see anywhere else. Exhibit A: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21591420/comcast-cap-data-1-2tb-home-users-internet-xfinity#:~:text=Next%2520year%252C%2520Comcast%2520plans%2520to%2Cother%2520parts%2520of%2520the%2520country.&amp;amp;text=Customers%2520will%2520be%2520notified%2520as%2520they%2520approach%2520the%25201.2TB%2520threshold."&gt;the 1.2TB home internet data caps&lt;/a&gt; it’s about to erect in a dozen additional states next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wxzCr4ydQnWeWDz6KzcGC8Tp_I4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13070431/DSCF0919.0.1482423018.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dAvi7k"&gt;Forget for a moment that Comcast itself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/smart-home/2015/11/7/9687976/comcast-data-caps-are-not-about-fixing-network-congestion"&gt;was caught red-handed&lt;/a&gt; explaining that data caps have nothing to do with network congestion. Forget that the CEOs of several smaller ISPs &lt;a href="https://money.com/internet-data-caps-bogus-ploys/"&gt;have admitted that internet capacity is anything but scarce&lt;/a&gt;. Forget that Comcast &lt;em&gt;disabled its own congestion management system&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/06/comcast-says-it-doesnt-throttle-heaviest-internet-users-anymore/"&gt;because it found it was unnecessary&lt;/a&gt;. Forget even that Comcast is a wildly profitable company whose cable division spends &lt;a href="https://www.cmcsa.com/news-releases/news-release-details/comcast-reports-4th-quarter-and-full-year-2019-results"&gt;&lt;em&gt;only a tenth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of its yearly revenues on keeping that network strong. The proof that data caps are a swindle is something you probably witnessed yourself earlier this year: Comcast, AT&amp;amp;T, and T-Mobile all &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21179330/comcast-t-mobile-coronavirus-data-caps-hotspots-fcc"&gt;suspended their data caps&lt;/a&gt; when the pandemic hit, and the internet kept on working without a hitch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e7rbGk"&gt;But Comcast’s generosity didn’t last for long. Now, with cases and deaths repeatedly hitting record highs in the United States, tens of millions of Americans out of work, and many of them &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/12/07/unemployed-debt-rent-utilities/"&gt;thousands of dollars behind on rent&lt;/a&gt;, the ISP is so unconcerned about angry customers that it’s bringing those data caps to even more states. AT&amp;amp;T, to its credit, extended its initial data cap waiver through the end of the year — but that wasn’t enough to pressure Comcast to do the same. Comcast’s waiver expired on July 1st, alongside most other ISPs, and now it’s back to extracting money hand over fist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZr8DU"&gt;Exhibit B: Though the United States once led development of the world’s internet, we now pay more than the rest of the developed world on average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="qH0RSN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;We pay twice as much as Europe for high-speed internet — before you even count caps and fees&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W4Aq7i"&gt;We consistently pay more than Europe regardless of speed, according to a fascinating, approachable &lt;a href="https://www.newamerica.org/oti/reports/cost-connectivity-2020/global-findings"&gt;study you should read from&lt;/a&gt; the New America think tank. In fact, we pay &lt;em&gt;roughly double &lt;/em&gt;that of Europe at the 100Mbps and 1,000Mbps tiers, and eight to 17 times more to rent a modem on average than Asia and Europe do, respectively. Only one US city cracked the top ten in affordability but only because it had &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90416863/the-city-with-the-best-fiber-optic-network-in-america-might-surprise-you"&gt;an ace up its sleeve&lt;/a&gt;: a municipal fiber-optic network erected by the city itself, where ISPs provide their services across fiber that the residents themselves own. Those sorts of municipal networks create competition that simply doesn’t exist in many places in the US &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/1/8321437/maps-show-why-internet-is-more-expensive-us-europe-competition"&gt;because it wasn’t designed to exist&lt;/a&gt;. In places that do erect municipal networks, New America shows that both speed and affordability far outpace the rest of the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IhEkOd"&gt;That’s why it’s a real shame many states (and telecom lobbyists) &lt;a href="https://broadbandnow.com/report/municipal-broadband-roadblocks/"&gt;have erected roadblocks&lt;/a&gt; to keep those municipal networks from spreading. In one particularly egregious example, Comcast &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/1/8530403/chattanooga-comcast-fcc-high-speed-internet-gigabit"&gt;sued the city of Chattanooga, Tennessee&lt;/a&gt; to try to block its municipal network in 2015, lobbied for a law to prevent its award-winning network from expanding to rural areas, then finally convinced the state &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3d98mw/tennessee-could-give-taxpayers-americas-fastest-internet-for-free-but-it-will-give-comcast-and-atandt-dollar45-million-instead"&gt;to spend $45 million of taxpayer money&lt;/a&gt; to subsidize the big ISPs instead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kzuHvO"&gt;We need competition. We need accurate maps to clearly see just how little competition there actually is, and we need to change the laws to let citizens fed up with being unserved and underserved build their own networks instead. We need those maps to show how much people actually pay. We need to stop pouring taxpayer money into hugely profitable telecoms that claim they’ll build out internet access, since they’ve found they can often &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/10/att-took-283-million-but-didnt-deploy-required-broadband-mississippi-says/"&gt;just straight-up lie&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20201125/10263845770/verizon-nyc-settle-lawsuit-over-verizons-empty-fiber-promises.shtml"&gt;wait to be sued&lt;/a&gt; instead of fulfilling their obligations. (If you want to be infuriated, follow that last link and keep on clicking through the examples.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7GDcbv"&gt;At least in 2020, the US is finally making some progress. This year, &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/1822"&gt;Congress finally passed a bill&lt;/a&gt; that requires the FCC to actually audit its broadband map data and create a “user-friendly challenge process” so people like me can point out that no, AT&amp;amp;T doesn’t actually offer fiber (or even fast DSL) at my address. And earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22159791/fcc-awards-spacex-886-million-satellite-internet-broadband-rural"&gt;the FCC already awarded $9.2 billion&lt;/a&gt; to 180 different companies to bring broadband to 5.2 million rural Americans over the next ten years — though big companies like Charter, CenturyLink, Frontier, and Windstream still account for at least $2.4 billion of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kqSB8L"&gt;But another way of looking at things is that we’re already too late: the FCC just awarded a decade’s worth of money to bring broadband to &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; five million additional addresses, without knowing whether it was awarding those contracts to communities that will now see competition — or just erecting more pockets of monopoly on the fringe. What is the rest of America supposed to do, wait another decade? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EoT6f5"&gt;We need to go much, much further than fixing our maps. If the best we can do during the pandemic is ask ISPs to “pretty please make the internet work better for 60 days,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reckless/status/1330935922528034817"&gt;to borrow a phrase&lt;/a&gt;, it’s time for more regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ob2rBv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The internet is more important than the telephone ever was; let’s regulate it that way&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pX92cR"&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic has shown, perhaps for the first time, how essential the internet is. The internet was already a powerful tool for learning, but now it’s a critical one for kids to attend school. Many millions are jobless but could maybe find a new job that lets them work from home. Many are already working from home because — with no other choice — companies are learning to adapt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KnX3JM"&gt;This all means there might finally be enough political will to declare the internet should be delivered to homes like a utility, the way water and electricity are delivered today, the way landline telephones were under the Communications Act of 1934 that originally created the FCC. The last time it was truly overhauled was 1996 — back when the internet was delivered one digital screech at a time over standard phone lines, after all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="kqMuoj"&gt;That’s how we’ve always dealt with necessary monopolies, the ones that own the pipes and wires that feed your house. We put them on a tight leash and make them serve everyone, not just the homes they deem most profitable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hc1drm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGcIPn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is temporarily disabling some Messenger and Instagram features in Europe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W749SlkRh1Vh_FDI1T74agmEaWs=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68527717/facebookeumessage.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some Messenger and Instagram features aren’t available in Europe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3wfv3x"&gt;Facebook is notifying Messenger and Instagram users in Europe that some features are temporarily unavailable. A small message has appeared in both the Facebook Messenger and Instagram apps for European users this week, noting that some features aren’t available to “respect new rules for messaging services in Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gmKitz"&gt;Facebook doesn’t outline exactly what features will be missing, but the company does reveal on its support pages that &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/627307411210372?locale=en_US&amp;amp;draft=627307411210372"&gt;polls&lt;/a&gt; on both Messenger and Instagram are currently unavailable in Europe, alongside a lack of &lt;a href="https://help.instagram.com/151273688993748"&gt;stickers&lt;/a&gt; in Instagram and no &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/android/1406970902944033?helpref=typeahead_suggestions&amp;amp;rdrhc"&gt;personalized replies&lt;/a&gt; on Messenger. Other missing features may include a lack of certain file sends on Messenger, missing nicknames, or the ability to share AR effects in DMs on Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WsrJ7-CGmFEubG5gq4d00JmHKxs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22177113/IMG_8479.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook’s warning in Instagram DMs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bvRD6b"&gt;Facebook has temporarily disabled some of these features to comply with new rules on data usage in EU countries. It’s part of the national implementations that are taking place of the 2002 Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive (&lt;a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:2002L0058:20091219:EN:HTML"&gt;ePrivacy Directive&lt;/a&gt;). This directive imposes stricter rules on data use across communications services that operate in countries that are part of the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aaSbbm"&gt;It’s not clear when Facebook will reinstate these features for European users, but a spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that most will return “very soon.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ClFrDT"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Pro have leaked again, this time in a full 360-degree animation courtesy of Evan Blass. The latest &lt;a href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-360degree-look-1608168459-1380650881"&gt;@Evleaks drop&lt;/a&gt; gives us our best look yet at how Samsung’s latest true wireless earbuds will look from every angle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p8wb3E"&gt;Rumored to arrive alongside the Galaxy S21 in January, Samsung’s followup to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price"&gt;Galaxy Buds Live&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147654/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review-wireless-earbuds-sound-quality-battery-life"&gt;Galaxy Buds Plus&lt;/a&gt; has already leaked in three different colors: black, violet, and silver, again courtesy of &lt;a href="https://www.voice.com/profile/evan"&gt;Blass&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="FYBoeM"&gt;The Galaxy Buds Pro are expected to feature active noise cancellation, that should be much improved over the open-ear design of the Galaxy Buds Live. The Pros will also feature a beefier 500mAh battery according to an FCC filing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vZhk5b"&gt;Samsung is rumored to be hosting an Galaxy S21 launch event on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167208/samsung-galaxy-s21-january-14th-launch-india-plus-ultra-s-pen"&gt;January 14th&lt;/a&gt; where we should learn more about Galaxy Buds Pro.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook hits back at Apple with second critical newspaper ad</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jA6SMOOBNT1JjSdmhNArjUS-Vog=/0x0:2640x1760/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68527690/facebooknewspaperad2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook’s second newspaper ad.&lt;/em&gt; | Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CNoEI3"&gt;Facebook is stepping up its campaign against Apple’s privacy changes with a second full-page newspaper ad today. This new ad claims Apple’s iOS 14 privacy changes “will change the internet as we know it,” and force websites and blogs “to start charging you subscription fees” or add in-app purchases due to a lack of personalized ads. It follows a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178068/facebook-apple-newspaper-ads-ios-privacy-changes"&gt;similar full-page newspaper ad&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, and the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ag8glr"&gt;Apple is planning to make changes to iOS 14 early next year that will require developers to ask for permission to gather data and track users across mobile apps and websites on an iPhone or iPad. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22179721/apple-defends-upcoming-privacy-changes-standing-up-for-users-facebook-data"&gt;Apple revealed&lt;/a&gt; how iOS 14 users will be prompted to opt into tracking in apps this week, noting that developers like Facebook can explain to users why they should allow tracking within the prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/427F9SagLFMdWvLHnnL25eM5sTY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22176650/FB_ATT_Prompt.001.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s upcoming iOS 14 privacy prompt.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BMjwm4"&gt;These changes will impact Facebook’s lucrative ad business, but the social networking giant is framing them as something far larger that could impact small businesses. Unsurprisingly, Apple doesn’t agree. “We believe that this is a simple matter of standing up for our users,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22179721/apple-defends-upcoming-privacy-changes-standing-up-for-users-facebook-data"&gt;said an Apple spokesperson&lt;/a&gt; in response to Facebook’s first full-page newspaper ad yesterday. “Users should know when their data is being collected and shared across other apps and websites — and they should have the choice to allow that or not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VYDTCA"&gt;Facebook clearly isn’t holding back on its PR campaign, with this latest newspaper ad trying to sway readers that Apple’s changes are more about moving websites and apps into a paid model where Apple stands to benefit from in-app purchases and subscriptions. With full-page ads in &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, and the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, Facebook is also very clearly trying to convince regulators (i.e. people that still read paper newspapers) to look at Apple’s privacy changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eQtPva"&gt;This is just the latest in an ongoing public spat between Apple and Facebook over iOS 14 privacy and policy changes, and follows &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174017/apple-app-store-new-privacy-labels-ios-apps-public"&gt;Apple’s new App Store privacy labels&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook also hit out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/7/21358355/facebook-apple-app-store-policies-comments-facebook-gaming-ios"&gt;against Apple’s App Store policies&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, adding to the growing industry pressure against Apple’s cloud gaming restrictions. Facebook also welcomed the EU’s new Digital Markets Act (DMA) and the Digital Services Act (DSA) this week, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/16/facebook-criticizes-apple-as-it-welcomes-europes-new-tech-rules.html"&gt;hoping that the DMA&lt;/a&gt; “will also set boundaries for Apple.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple defends upcoming privacy changes as ‘standing up for our users’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cjUE4d55cL1LqEvbMWOHVBAAlDA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68526857/FB_ATT_Prompt.001.5.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of the prompt you’ll see when an app asks permission to track your data.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i2gU3K"&gt;Apple has responded to Facebook’s critiques of its upcoming privacy changes by saying that is “standing up for our users,” in a statement shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;Facebook has been criticizing the company ahead of a future iOS update that will require users to give their permission for apps to collect data about them. Facebook took out full-page newspaper ads today &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178068/facebook-apple-newspaper-ads-ios-privacy-changes"&gt;attacking Apple&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that the changes will “limit businesses’ ability to run personalized ads and reach their customers effectively.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rW1vJL"&gt;Here is Apple’s full statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="4s8wWG"&gt;We believe that this is a simple matter of standing up for our users. Users should know when their data is being collected and shared across other apps and websites — and they should have the choice to allow that or not. App Tracking Transparency in iOS 14 does not require Facebook to change its approach to tracking users and creating targeted advertising, it simply requires they give users a choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="tshaoY"&gt;Apple’s statement comes as Facebook reportedly plans to run another anti-Apple ad on Friday, according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JohnPaczkowski/status/1339375939369615360"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt; editor John Paczkowski&lt;/a&gt;. This new ad will reportedly claim that Apple’s software update will “change the internet as we know it for the worse” because places like blogs and cooking sites will have to charge for subscriptions or in-app purchases instead of running personalized ads that would allow them to offer content for free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sYx9Lw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Facebook?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Facebook&lt;/a&gt; plans to run a second anti-Apple ad tomorrow. This one will claim &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Apple&lt;/a&gt; is trying to stop the internet from being free. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here’s some draft text: &lt;a href="https://t.co/Spzx1rwJSc"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Spzx1rwJSc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— John Paczkowski (@JohnPaczkowski) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JohnPaczkowski/status/1339375939369615360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 17, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GJ5myY"&gt;Apps won’t be required to ask for users’ permission until &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21420176/apple-ios-14-tracking-permission-rule-developers-delay"&gt;sometime early next year&lt;/a&gt;. The change has already been delayed once — it was originally supposed to kick in with the release of iOS 14 this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="flCVEL"&gt;The spat between the two companies comes on the heels of Apple adding &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174017/apple-app-store-new-privacy-labels-ios-apps-public"&gt;new App Store privacy labels&lt;/a&gt; that spell out how iOS apps use your data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="J6aKHB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Facebook criticizes Apple’s iOS privacy changes with full-page newspaper ads","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178068/facebook-apple-newspaper-ads-ios-privacy-changes"},{"title":"Apple delays privacy feature that would let iPhone owners keep ad tracking at bay","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21420176/apple-ios-14-tracking-permission-rule-developers-delay"},{"title":"Apple launches new App Store privacy labels so you can see how iOS apps use your data","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174017/apple-app-store-new-privacy-labels-ios-apps-public"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Hilary Duff says the Lizzie McGuire Disney Plus series is officially dead</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yOFqhDRvPwgQopkwvyfYuQGjp6c=/74x0:649x383/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68526670/lizzie_mcguire_lizzie_and_gordo_photo_e1574211145930.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LBhTYK"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Lizzie McGuire&lt;/em&gt; Disney Plus series is officially dead, according to an &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CI3x83hDMYt/"&gt;Instagram post&lt;/a&gt; from Hilary Duff. The series was reportedly going to feature an adult Duff reprising her role as Lizzie in her 30s, navigating a career in New York, and dealing with more “adult” themes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L3Rlvz"&gt;“It’s been an honor to have Lizzie in my life,” Duff wrote. “I know the efforts and conversations have been everywhere trying to make work, but sadly and despite everyone’s best efforts [the reboot] isn’t going to happen.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UQkpar"&gt;The new &lt;em&gt;Lizzie McGuire&lt;/em&gt; series’ original showrunner Terri Minsky was fired by Disney over “differences” in creative direction only two episodes into production, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/lizzie-mcguire-disney-plus-showrunner-1203462382/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. Following Minsky’s removal, work on the show was halted completely in January 2020, with the future of it unknown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E3pE4d"&gt;Disney has taken steps in the past to maintain Disney Plus’ family friendly image, even going as far as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21220576/splash-tom-hanks-disney-plus-butt-cgi-hair-streaming-physical-digital"&gt;censoring a nude butt in the film &lt;em&gt;Splash&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company has placed movies and shows that it considers “adult” on Hulu. For instance, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21152428/love-simon-spinoff-hulu-disney-plus-xmen-simpsons-streaming"&gt;it moved &lt;em&gt;Love, Victor&lt;/em&gt; to the service&lt;/a&gt; from Disney Plus for featuring alcohol use and sexual exploration. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/28/21158617/hilary-duff-wants-lizzie-mcguire-on-hulu-not-disney-plus"&gt;Duff publicly asked Disney&lt;/a&gt; to consider moving her show as well, but no change ever came, and Duff’s announcement has sealed &lt;em&gt;Lizzie McGuire&lt;/em&gt;’s fate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZAlDg4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vmD6gA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R0KWId"&gt;Twitter will no longer automatically show the quote tweet prompt when you try to retweet something starting on Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1339350334162890753"&gt;the company announced&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sZhvcw"&gt;The change to the way retweets worked was first implemented &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21509439/twitter-election-trump-quote-tweet-labels-rules-election"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt; ahead of the 2020 US presidential election. Twitter’s aim with the change was to encourage people to tweet and amplify information more thoughtfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iCz77h"&gt;“We don’t believe that this happened, in practice,” Twitter said in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1339350334162890753"&gt;a series of tweets&lt;/a&gt;. “The use of Quote Tweets increased, but 45 percent of them included single-word affirmations and 70 percent had less than 25 characters.” Twitter also saw a 20 percent decrease in retweets and quote tweets while the automatic quote tweet prompt was in place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uqNu7L"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The increase in Quote Tweets was also offset by an overall 20% decrease in sharing through both Retweets and Quote Tweets. Considering this, we'll no longer prompt Quote Tweets from the Retweet icon. For more details: &lt;a href="https://t.co/Were7yWdOz"&gt;https://t.co/Were7yWdOz&lt;/a&gt; (3/4)&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1339350336184541184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 16, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NqqXZH"&gt;While the changes to retweets were in place, you didn’t &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to write anything in the quote tweet prompt that appeared. Leaving the prompt blank and hitting the retweet button in the prompt would share that tweet to your followers with no context from you. But apparently, the change to retweets didn’t exactly accomplish what Twitter wanted, so the company is changing how retweets work back to the way they used to be.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zoom is lifting its 40-minute meeting limit for several upcoming holidays</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M3ENwNELmbGFDRwDniQeoOXlTuo=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68526416/acastro_200331_1777_zoom_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DYBFah"&gt;Zoom will be lifting its 40-minute meeting limit for free accounts globally in recognition of several upcoming holidays, the company confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The limits will &lt;a href="https://blog.zoom.us/zoom-together/"&gt;be removed&lt;/a&gt; in recognition of Hanukkah, Christmas Eve, Christmas, New Year’s Eve, New Year’s Day, and Kwanzaa. The company similarly lifted its 40-minute limit last month &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21564310/zoom-40-minute-time-limit-thanksgiving-restriction-lifted-temporary"&gt;for Thanksgiving Day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vDx2vK"&gt;Here’s exactly when Zoom will be removing the 40-minute limit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="6sadZX"&gt;10AM ET Thursday, December 17th, to 6AM ET Saturday, December 19th, for the end of Hanukkah&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QHQQDC"&gt;10AM ET Wednesday, December 23rd, to 6AM ET Saturday, December 26th, for Christmas Eve and Christmas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hrZ2Lt"&gt;10AM ET on Wednesday, December 30th, to 6AM ET on Saturday, January 2nd, for New Year’s Eve, New Year’s Day, and the end of Kwanzaa&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Hzqzjk"&gt;Normally, meetings with three or more people hosted on Zoom’s free tier can’t last longer than 40 minutes. If you wanted to talk longer, you’d have to go through the hassle of starting another meeting and getting everyone to join again. By removing the limit for these holidays, hopefully virtual meetups with friends and family can be less focused on the clock and more on catching up with loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1PpWEy"&gt;If you prefer to use Google Meet to connect with family and friends, that’s an option, too, as Google is letting free users host calls that last for up to 24 hours &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21494189/google-meet-limit-calls-minutes-march-2021"&gt;through March 31st, 2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google acquires Neverware, a company that turns old PCs into Chromebooks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Chromebooks 2020: Acer Chromebook Spin 713" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lq0RXPCU0qoaoS5ivSXeslciQko=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68525840/mchin_181029_4126_0006.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZSw8JL"&gt;Today, Neverware &lt;a href="https://cloudreadykb.neverware.com/s/article/Neverware-is-now-part-of-Google-FAQ"&gt;announced in an FAQ&lt;/a&gt; that it’s now part of Google. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YFgilf"&gt;Neverware, based in New York City, makes a software application called CloudReady that allows you to convert a PC into a system that runs Chrome OS. In its FAQ, Neverware states that it and its CloudReady software are “officially part of Google and the Chrome OS team.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JcdbJC"&gt;CloudReady offers a free version for personal use, as well as paid tiers for enterprise and education. The idea is that companies and schools (as well as individuals) can convert old, slow systems into Chromebooks rather than throwing them out — Chrome OS is a less demanding operating system for these machines to run than Windows 10 is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wZVs9U"&gt;According to Neverware’s FAQ, not much is going to change for current CloudReady customers in the near future. The company’s website, forums, customer support, and admin portal will continue to function as usual, though it seems that they’ll eventually migrate over to Google’s services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p18zbV"&gt;As the &lt;a href="https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/google-acquires-neverware-cloudready-chrome-os-chromebooks/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;About Chromebooks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; site notes, some of the software that Neverware makes could help Google continue to push Chrome OS updates to older devices, extending the time frame in which some Chromebooks can receive the latest software. (Google hasn’t said anything of the sort, so that’s just hopeful speculation for now).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sWvcow"&gt;Google and Neverware are well acquainted — Google led an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/11/16455490/google-invest-neverware-chromebooks-refurbish"&gt;investment round&lt;/a&gt; in the startup back in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
