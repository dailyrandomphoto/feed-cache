    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VMnoaX"&gt;Amazon’s Alexa told a child to touch a penny to the exposed prongs of a phone charger plugged into the wall, according to one parent who &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/klivdahl/status/1475220450598924297?s=20"&gt;posted screenshots of their Alexa activity history&lt;/a&gt; showing the interaction (&lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/technology/amazon-alexa-slammed-for-giving-lethal-challenge-to-10-year-old-girl/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The device seemingly pulled the idea for the challenge from an article describing it as dangerous, citing news reports about an alleged challenge trending on TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4babCT"&gt;According to Kristin Livdahl’s screenshot, the Echo responded to “tell me a challenge to do” with “Here’s something I found on the web. According to ourcommunitynow.com: The challenge is simple: plug in a phone charger about halfway into a wall outlet, then touch a penny to the exposed prongs.” &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59810383"&gt;In a statement to the BBC&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon said: “As soon as we became aware of this error, we took swift action to fix it.” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/klivdahl/status/1475616003996459016?s=20"&gt;Livdahl tweeted yesterday&lt;/a&gt; that asking for a challenge was no longer working. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="T8ceVS"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;OMFG My 10 year old just asked Alexa on our Echo for a challenge and this is what she said. &lt;a href="https://t.co/HgGgrLbdS8"&gt;pic.twitter.com/HgGgrLbdS8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kristin Livdahl (@klivdahl) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/klivdahl/status/1475220450598924297?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kh42SI"&gt;Amazon isn’t the only company to run into issues trying to parse the web for content. In October, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/soft/status/1449406390976409600"&gt;a user reported&lt;/a&gt; that Google displayed potentially dangerous advice in one of its featured snippets if you Googled “had a seizure now what” — the info it showed was from the section of a webpage describing what &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to do when someone was having a seizure. At the time, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; confirmed the user’s report, but it appears to have been fixed based on tests we did today (no snippet appears when Googling “had a seizure now what”). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DozykA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The Google search summary vs the actual page &lt;a href="https://t.co/OJxt1FrBqh"&gt;pic.twitter.com/OJxt1FrBqh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— ウィアブー リンデン (@soft) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/soft/status/1449406390976409600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OXtS70"&gt;Users have reported other similar problems, though, including &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/amyhoy/status/1445514300345307142/photo/1"&gt;one user who said&lt;/a&gt; Google gave results for orthostatic hyp&lt;strong&gt;o&lt;/strong&gt;tension when searching for orthostatic hyp&lt;strong&gt;er&lt;/strong&gt;tension, and another who &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lilsinnsitive/status/1472629416853389316"&gt;posted a screenshot&lt;/a&gt; of Google displaying terrible advice for consoling someone who’s grieving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6vUS4G"&gt;We’ve also seen warnings about dangerous behavior amplified to make the problem bigger than it originally was — earlier this month, some US school districts closed after self-perpetuating &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22840621/tiktok-december-17-school-threats-district-cancellations-alleged-shootings"&gt;reports about shooting threats being made on TikTok&lt;/a&gt;. It turned out that the social media firestorm was overwhelmingly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/17/22841370/why-tiktok-school-shooting-warnings-went-viral-december-17"&gt;caused by people talking about threats&lt;/a&gt;, far more than any threats that may have existed. In the case of Alexa, an algorithm picked out the descriptive part of a warning and amplified it without the original context. While the parent was there to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/klivdahl/status/1475609607724806150?s=20"&gt;immediately intervene&lt;/a&gt;, it’s easy to imagine a situation where that isn’t the case or where the answer shared by Alexa isn’t so obviously dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Hiogt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/klivdahl/status/1475594121163194376?s=20"&gt;Livdahl tweets&lt;/a&gt; that she used the opportunity to “go through internet safety and not trusting things you read without research and verification” with her child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vgTgnC"&gt;Amazon didn’t immediately reply to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Costco members can order the Xbox Series X right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7ohTgP-DwpZpBXY7H154tlsMe2Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70323487/acastro_210511_1777_xboxRestock_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N2yvOx"&gt;The Xbox Series X console has remained hard to come by, and with the holidays looming the window to get one in time is narrowing. Many retailers have turned to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22771984/ps5-restock-xbox-best-buy-walmart-amazon-subscription"&gt;charging for the chance&lt;/a&gt; just to buy a console via subscription-based memberships, which is a game that Costco has been playing from the beginning. The warehouse retailer has gotten its fair share of console restocks, and today it has Microsoft’s flagship console available for its members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EI1ZxG"&gt;You can order the &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/xbox-series-x-1tb-console-with-additional-controller.product.100691493.html"&gt;Xbox Series X from Costco&lt;/a&gt; right now, which is only sold as a bundle with an extra controller (if you’re signed in, then you can add it directly to your cart by clicking &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/OrderByItemsDisplayView?catalogId=10701&amp;amp;storeId=10301&amp;amp;langId=-1&amp;amp;krypto=AsPTBQRWKp4jSH6gFtKqg3xrRQicAEXbqVDBminWxLJK60ZbV2I4eYEGX9gvYtcpo%2FjiXzUmiJvE3aLeIBIt%2FRKylgQypTUVFv2l5xLMMme0QroSuU2wA1E00gqHxD4GtNIAf8JRN0nMogVRIpvrlw%3D%3D&amp;amp;ddkey=http%3AOrderByItemsAdd"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). You need a paid Costco membership to order this, which you can get &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/join-costco.html?redirectLogin=true"&gt;here at the retailer’s site&lt;/a&gt; for a minimum of $60 per year. While some video games and accessories can be purchased online from Costco by non-members at the cost of an additional fee, consoles are for members only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z86GFW"&gt;These restocks at Costco often sell out quickly, so if you don’t manage to get it this time around be sure to prep your account for success next time by saving your billing and shipping info into your account. Also, be sure to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/newsletters"&gt;subscribe to our &lt;em&gt;Verge Deals&lt;/em&gt; newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to get the latest tech deals from our team, direct to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Riot Games will pay $100 million to settle discrimination lawsuit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ph_1pgI5vN3-_H5BjW9Tk3P3Il4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70323449/acastro_190528_1777_riot_games_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustrations by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ahT0Rd"&gt;Riot Games has struck a $100 million settlement deal in a discrimination and harassment lawsuit brought by female employees. The &lt;em&gt;League of Legends &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Valorant &lt;/em&gt;publisher will pay at least $80 million to members of the settlement class and around $20 million in legal fees, and it will agree to workplace changes that include greater pay transparency and three years of third-party monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PEwLmr"&gt;The settlement covers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/6/18069714/league-of-legends-riot-games-sued-gender-discrimination"&gt;a 2018 class action lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; filed by current and former Riot employees in the wake of &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/inside-the-culture-of-sexism-at-riot-games-1828165483"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; detailing systemic sexism and unfair treatment. The suit described an environment where male employees made derogatory sexual comments about female colleagues and passed them over for promotion, creating a company-wide “unwritten policy and practice of preferring men to women in the hiring, promotion, and compensation of its employees.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hhfoyH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/2/20992317/riot-games-settlement-details-harassment-discrimination-lawsuit"&gt;Riot agreed to&lt;/a&gt; a $10 million settlement in 2019, but the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) and Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE) blocked the agreement, &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2020-01-21/riot-games-gender-discrimination-settlement"&gt;saying women at the company&lt;/a&gt; could be entitled to up to $400 million. The &lt;a href="https://www.dfeh.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/32/2021/12/RiotGamesPR12.27.21.pdf"&gt;DFEH endorsed&lt;/a&gt; the latest settlement in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kppglM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An earlier settlement would have provided $10 million&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QYOWjW"&gt;According to the DFEH, the suit covers approximately 1,065 female employees and 1,300 female contractors at Riot. Women who worked for Riot in either capacity since November of 2014 may be eligible for damages if a court approves the settlement. In a letter &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/12/27/riot-discrimination-100-million-settlement/"&gt;obtained by &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Riot leadership told employees that “the final details of the agreement came together quickly,” resulting in an unexpected end-of-year announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BPOBI9"&gt;“This is a great day for the women of Riot Games — and for women at all video game and tech companies — who deserve a workplace that is free of harassment and discrimination,” said attorney Genie Harrison, who began representing the plaintiffs in 2020. “We appreciate Riot’s introspection and work since 2018 toward becoming a more diverse and inclusive company, its willingness to take responsibility for its past, and its commitment to fairness and equality in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mQjDhV"&gt;The new Riot settlement comes shortly after a court stopped the DFEH from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22834691/judge-denies-california-dfeh-block-activision-blizzard-eeoc-lawsuit-settlement"&gt;intervening in a settlement&lt;/a&gt; over similar gender discrimination claims at games company Activision Blizzard. It doesn’t cover a separate 2021 complaint alleging that Riot’s CEO Nicolo Laurent harassed a former employee — a claim that Riot &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22334483/riot-games-ceo-nicolo-laurent-harassment-discrimination-investigation-closed"&gt;denied in March&lt;/a&gt; after conducting an internal investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s1hDNf"&gt;In a statement, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22856713/riot-games-lawsuit-gender-discrimination-settlement"&gt;Riot Games said&lt;/a&gt; it hoped the settlement “properly acknowledges those who had negative experiences at Riot and demonstrates our desire to lead by example in bringing more accountability and equality to the games industry.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Committed adult smokers who start vaping more likely to drop cigarettes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="e-cigarettes" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jI20HGmP67jVY5odQmKCt1eCGQM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70323421/acastro_190916_1777_vape_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VM7h9h"&gt;Adult smokers who say that they don’t plan to quit smoking but who start using e-cigarettes are more likely quit than those who don’t start vaping, according to a new study. People who say they’re not trying to quit often aren’t included in studies of the potential benefits of e-cigarettes for adult smokers, and the new data shows that the group should be considered during that type of analysis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DhA9Y9"&gt;In the &lt;a href="http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.40880?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_term=122821"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published Tuesday in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;, researchers evaluated data from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study, which is run by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Participants were interviewed about their tobacco use four times between 2014 and 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ac7xOU"&gt;Of the study group, 1,600 people said in initial interviews that they didn’t use e-cigarettes and didn’t plan to ever quit smoking cigarettes. By the next set of interviews, around 6 percent of that group had stopped smoking traditional cigarettes. Participants who’d started using e-cigarettes daily during that time were much more likely to be in that 6 percent than participants who hadn’t — 28 percent of the group using e-cigarettes had stopped smoking cigarettes, compared to just under 6 percent of the group not using e-cigarettes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tXhwFw"&gt;The relationship might be because smokers who start using e-cigarettes tend to shift toward planning to quit smoking, the authors suggest, a pattern seen in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306460321003099?via%3Dihub"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; from the PATH Study and in other experiments. The new analysis didn’t untangle whether people’s decisions to quit came after they started smoking e-cigarettes, so it can’t pinpoint the cause of the change. The switch, though, is likely beneficial — some &lt;a href="https://www.brown.edu/news/2020-11-18/e-cigs"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; shows e-cigarettes are less harmful than traditional cigarettes, even if they’re &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/5-truths-you-need-to-know-about-vaping"&gt;not harmless&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9e7NTo"&gt;The study was released while the FDA is still reviewing some e-cigarette related products, including those made by Juul. The agency has blown past its September deadline to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665333/fda-vaping-flavors-authorization-juul"&gt;evaluate applications&lt;/a&gt; from e-cigarette companies — after a yearlong period without enforcement, companies now need authorization before they can market their products. The only e-cigarettes the FDA has authorized so far are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723175/fda-first-vaping-authorization-vuse-tobacco-flavors"&gt;tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes&lt;/a&gt; from the RJ Reynolds Vapor Company. At the end of December, it had rejected &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HkAaRvI6xXZzhGhzeNMg9IYXeHOW-7TV-O5UJR3Zsoc/edit#gid=2126642116"&gt;260 applications&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jgwfUr"&gt;The FDA says its focus is on figuring out whether a vaping or e-cigarette product has benefits to adult smokers that outweigh the risks to kids and teenagers, who started vaping in huge numbers in 2018 and tend to be attracted to flavored products. The new research indicates that smokers who say they don’t plan to quit should be included in those risk-benefit calculations, the study authors note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hMULx3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope is about to transform into its final form</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/egtsT4oQvSLet_15jjQ6cwDeoxk=/0x138:2475x1788/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70323296/50489833002_107cb9e661_o.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A telescope in disguise&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="4B9ZEL"&gt;NASA’s incredibly powerful James Webb Space Telescope has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/25/22850167/james-webb-space-telescope-jwst-launch-mission-success"&gt;been in space for three days now&lt;/a&gt;, but perhaps the riskiest part of its journey to deep space is just getting underway. Soon, the telescope will initiate an intricately choreographed mechanical dance as it slowly contorts its shape and unfurls, in order to reach its final form &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22789561/nasa-jwst-james-webb-space-telescope-priorities-astronomy-astrophysics-exoplanets"&gt;for observing the distant cosmos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4rhfR"&gt;It’s a type of reverse space origami that’s never been performed before, but it’s absolutely necessary for the James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST, to fulfill its mission. The telescope was simply too massive to launch on any operational rocket while fully extended. So when it catapulted into space on top of a European Ariane 5 rocket on Christmas Day, it made the nail-biting trip folded in on itself like the world’s most expensive Swiss Army knife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="LkJW5h"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We sometimes call Webb the ‘Transformer Telescope.’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZkaeUA"&gt;Now over the course of the next two weeks, JWST will twist and reshape — deploying one beam here, a mirror there — until it is completely configured for peering into the deepest parts of the Universe. “We sometimes call Webb the ‘Transformer Telescope,’” Amy Lo, the JWST alignments engineer at the telescope’s primary contractor Northrop Grumman, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. It’s a daunting process with hundreds of moving parts that engineers have tested over and over again on the ground, as it has to be nothing short of flawless. But there are many points along the way where the failure of one small release mechanism or pulley could jeopardize the future of the entire JWST mission. While mission controllers on the ground have a few troubleshooting techniques they can employ if something gets stuck, ultimately the JWST spacecraft must do every deployment on its own to near perfection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;JWST completely folded up on top of the Ariane 5 rocket before launch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w1biZ4"&gt;JWST is heading to a final destination roughly 1 million miles from Earth, and there are no operational rockets or spaceships that can safely bring astronauts to such a distance to give the telescope a tuneup. And even if humans could reach it, JWST just isn’t designed to be serviceable. So if the telescope breaks in a fundamental way, that’s it for a mission that is running NASA a total of $9.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LzvuAQ"&gt;It may all sound like needless complexity for a mission of this magnitude, but there never was an easy path for JWST, according to NASA. “I actually strongly believe it’s not possible to make it simpler within the constraints that we have,” Thomas Zurbuchen, the associate administrator for the science mission directorate at NASA, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “This is what it is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ghoK4"&gt;Designers of JWST knew from the beginning that their creation would have to unfold while in space. In 1996, &lt;a href="https://www.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/www/files/home/news/newsletters/_documents/2016-volume033-issue01.pdf"&gt;when scientists first proposed making a telescope like this&lt;/a&gt;, NASA’s administrator at the time, Dan Goldin, challenged engineers to create the spacecraft with a primary mirror that was up to eight meters wide. Ultimately, designers settled on a mirror that was 6.5 meters, or 21 feet across, but that decree determined JWST’s folded fate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wKPdQS"&gt;That’s because the largest rockets currently flying aren’t wide enough to carry a mirror of that size. Whenever you launch something into space, the spacecraft has to fit inside a rocket’s payload fairing — the bulbous structure that sits on top of the rocket throughout the first part of flight. The fairing is critical, as it shrouds the spacecraft during launch, protecting the payload from the atmosphere until reaching space. However, the fairing’s width is a major limiting factor for a spacecraft’s design, since the vehicle &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; fit inside. It’s a problem that those in the space industry often refer to as the “tyranny of the fairing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="VzsPc7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10950698"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WD5kuK"&gt;The Ariane 5 rocket has one of the widest payload fairings currently on the market, spanning 5.4 meters, or nearly 18 feet wide. But that’s still too small to house JWST’s mirror fully extended. So from the start, JWST mission designers built the mirror in segments, with two flaps on either side that could swivel inward and outward. It was a major design challenge, as the segments need to come together to behave like a single, flat mirror in order to gather light from the distant cosmos. “Unfurling a primary mirror has never been done before on orbit in space,” says Lo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="VQdYzZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Unfurling a primary mirror has never been done before on orbit.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SC8EGa"&gt;JWST will deploy its mirror flaps around 12 to 13 days after launch. But before that happens, the observatory has an even more complex deployment that it must get through, one that will take up to six days to complete. It’s the deployment of JWST’s sunshield, an intricate apparatus designed to block heat from the Sun and keep the telescope extra cool while in space. While the deployment process is designed to be flexible and things could change, &lt;a href="https://jwst.nasa.gov/content/webbLaunch/whereIsWebb.html"&gt;the first step of the sunshield deployment is supposed to get started today&lt;/a&gt;, which means almost everyone associated with this mission will be holding their breath for the next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ocEW5z"&gt;“The sunshield itself is — of all of our deployments — that’s the one that is the most complex,” Lee Feinberg, the optical telescope element manager for JWST at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; “It has the most moving parts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VVHwte"&gt;The sunshield is a necessary feature because of how the JWST is designed. The telescope will be observing distant stars and galaxies in infrared, a type of light that is invisible to our eyes but is emitted by anything that holds heat. But in order to collect infrared photons, JWST must operate at an unbelievably cold temperature, as low as -370 degrees Fahrenheit. If it gets too warm, the telescope might emit too much of its &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; infrared light, which could interfere with the spacecraft’s observations of the Universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uvG0jV0klVJffiIx7BMW5H061SU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23129861/14492381330_f566d58ec2_o.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: NASA / Chris Gunn&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The layers of JWST’s sunshield extended and pulled taut.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m1uAbr"&gt;Enter the sunshield, which provides some impressive sunblock for JWST. The shield consists of five ultra-thin layers of a shiny material called Kapton, each layer the size of a tennis court. The outermost layer will always face the Sun and get most of its heat, operating at a scorching 230 degrees Fahrenheit. But each successive layer will be cooler and cooler, so that JWST’s instruments stay nice and cryogenic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C09apa"&gt;The shield’s heat-reflecting membranes are so delicate, that extra special care and engineering were needed in order to extend the layers outward in space and pull them taut without ripping. “There are systems that will spread the layers out and tension them,” Feinberg says. “It’s a little bit like a sail on a boat in terms of how you kind of wind it up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="RVI1ty"&gt;&lt;q&gt;there are moments when there really are no backup options&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="REfQXk"&gt;The entire process relies on hundreds of different moving parts, including up to 140 release mechanisms, 400 pulleys, 70 hinge assemblies, and 90 cables, according to NASA. There are also various contingency plans in place in case a deployment doesn’t perform as expected. NASA has the option to resend commands to the telescope, in case the first command does not trigger a move. Engineers have also built as many redundancies into the spacecraft as they could. There are areas with multiple circuits that can perform the same task, in case the primary circuit doesn’t fire properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ZdMGf"&gt;But there are moments when there really are no backup options. Throughout the deployment process, there are more than 300 events known as “single point failures.” Those are the deployments that &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to work as designed, because they can’t be built with redundancy. “Single point failures are funny little things. They’re used a lot,” says Lo. “And technically what they mean is, this thing &lt;em&gt;must &lt;/em&gt;happen.” JWST relies on them heavily throughout the deployment process. For instance, a total of 107 release devices are needed to release the sunshield membranes, allowing them to unfurl to their full shape. All 107 of those devices are single point failures, according to Lo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="4bhoCy"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RzGLKQ7_KZQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3KvJIP"&gt;NASA is no stranger to single point failures, though. When the space agency landed its Perseverance rover on Mars this February, the landing sequence had roughly 100 single point failures baked in, according to Zurbuchen. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289668/nasa-mars-perseverance-rover-success"&gt;The entire landing went flawlessly&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, NASA and Northrop Grumman have tested JWST’s various deployments on the ground for the past two to three years, intricately rehearsing them for the final show. Each component was tested individually on the ground dozens of times first, before being added to the spacecraft. And then the entire telescope was folded and unfolded multiple times as a cohesive unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KdBAGR"&gt;“So do we have confidence that we will deploy on orbit? Yes, we do,” says Lo. “And the reason is because we go through such rigorous testing from basically the ground level up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="GtFWGK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“do we have confidence that we will deploy on orbit? Yes, we do.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UQBhfe"&gt;JWST’s testing took many years longer on the ground than planned, but it had to be rigorous because of its inability to be repaired. It’s one of the biggest differences between JWST and its predecessor, the Hubble Space Telescope, which has been orbiting the Earth since 1990. Hubble was purposefully designed to get tuneups while in orbit by visiting astronauts; JWST doesn’t have that capability. Plus sending humans to the telescope would introduce too much heat anyway. “Even if you put a spacesuit around you or me, it’s still way warmer than the telescope environment,” says Zurbuchen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KaWt87"&gt;Though a human servicing mission is not feasible for JWST, NASA did make one small design tweak in case the agency wants to give the telescope a tuneup someday. Included on the back of JWST are stickers in the shapes of crosses. They’re meant to serve as targets, to help guide a potential robotic spacecraft visitor to JWST in the future. Over the last decade, various space companies have been working on “servicing satellites,” designed to catch up with satellites already in space and grab hold of them, either to refuel their tanks or to tweak aging components. It’s possible that one day, NASA may want to send a servicing satellite to JWST to add more propellant to the telescope’s tanks, extending its time in space. If that happens, the targets will provide a reference point for where the visiting spacecraft should attach to fill up JWST’s tank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="747DTB"&gt;However, no one at NASA is even thinking about such a refueling mission right now. Everyone associated with JWST is squarely focused on the deployments. And once the telescope is completely unfurled over the next two weeks, there is still plenty of work to be done as the observatory travels through deep space. NASA will continue to adjust JWST’s mirrors ever so slightly, ensuring that they all align as intended. And then about 29 days after launch, the telescope will execute one final burn of its thrusters, putting it into its final position in deep space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="krXI3E"&gt;At that point, the work is only beginning. Mission personnel will then test out and calibrate all of JWST’s instruments to make sure they work properly. That process will take months, with science operations scheduled to begin sometime this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aoBfqi"&gt;So even if JWST does deploy as intended after two weeks, the anxiety doesn’t really end. “That’s when I think a lot of us will breathe a sigh of relief, but of course, the instruments and the mirror phasing would have just begun,” Lo says. “A different group of folks — the instrument builders, designers, engineers, and the scientists — would only just start to be holding their breath.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CrUNyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ui2NpZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NGQPdI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gg9O5m"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UZSC51"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wZaER6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ipxs7T"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KY3lFn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oFVofi"&gt;Many Alexa-powered Amazon Echo speakers and displays are still enjoying Black Friday discounts. One of the most appealing deals is on the Amazon Echo Show 5 display, which is normally $84.99 but can be found at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J8FFJ8H?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=46f7e73c17de7f7932a352dfa95507a6&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9vIoa0cLs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $44.99. This smart display could be the perfect companion for your nightstand or kitchen counter, since it can handle alarm, recipe, and entertainment duties. While it shares a lot of functionality with Echo speakers, the Echo Show display is capable of more, like streaming video from Prime Video and Netflix, showing you the forecast, or displaying your agenda for the day. Additionally, the built-in camera lets you video chat with family and friends. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529891/amazon-echo-show-5-2nd-gen-alexa-smart-display-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Read our review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bypsgZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10873822"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c66tlk"&gt;You can also find the latest version (you can tell by its spherical design) of the Amazon Echo with upgraded speakers for just $59.99 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XKF75B8?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=c7211d3d6f00f76ea7b1b78a30f21d02&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgik84pPe5z" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. That’s a $40 discount off the regular price. While this model only offers iterative upgrades over its predecessor, Dan Seifert, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;who reviewed this latest model Echo&lt;/a&gt;, praised the sound quality and attentive mics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NMDhnS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10873864"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oZB0tW"&gt;The WF-1000XM3 wireless earbuds from Sony are currently discounted to $129.99, their lowest price yet at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WF-1000XM3-Industry-Canceling-Wireless/dp/B07T81554H/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747336499962657708" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. At launch, these earbuds retailed for $228.99. While XM3 may not share the same features as the newer XM4, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/5/20682334/sony-wf-1000xm3-wireless-earbuds-hands-on-preview-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our review by Chris Welch&lt;/a&gt; proves that there are several reasons to invest in a pair, including excellent sound quality and noise cancellation, as well as lengthy battery life. Consider whether its large case aligns with your taste, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Bjioox"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9563643"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9mNbxu"&gt;Samsung’s 8.7-inch Galaxy Tab A7 Lite Android tablet is currently available at its lowest price at Best Buy. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgio9klSpgA" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The base model with 32GB of storage has been reduced to $120&lt;/a&gt;, taking $40 off the regular price. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgaH7AMoAsX?u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22590360%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com%2Fauthors%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The model that doubles the storage to 64GB is $70 off, available for just $10 more at $130&lt;/a&gt;. This discount applies to both the dark gray and silver colorways, in case you were wondering. It’s also worth noting that Best Buy is offering 20 percent off on a qualifying accessory when purchased with the tablet, netting you additional savings on things like screen protectors and cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uU7fcF"&gt;Both tablets feature a 1340 x 800 resolution display and boast the Android 11 OS. And while the camera quality and performance aren’t going to win any awards, the Galaxy Tab A7 Lite seems like a step up in overall build quality and features offered versus other budget-friendly tablets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8YPoxb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10869140"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zb9vUp"&gt;Corsair has discounted a pair of its flagship keyboards, the K100 and K95 RGB Platinum XT, at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HR68MQZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgiljRYN0ZK" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Corsair’s K100 is currently discounted to $189.99 at Amazon and the official Corsair website, taking $40 off the regular MSRP. This full-sized keyboard bears a striking similarity to the Corsair K95 but also includes a multi-function scroll wheel that can be used to quickly switch applications or zoom in and out of windows. Just note that this discount is only available for the version equipped with the Cherry MX Speed key switches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7zkUd8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9735675"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cMsBud"&gt;The previous flagship keyboard for Corsair, the K95 RGB Platinum XT, upgraded the original K95 with PBT keycaps and integration with the Elgato Stream Deck hardware. Normally $200, the model with Cherry MX Speed switches has been discounted to $149.99 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-Platinum-Mechanical-Keyboard-Backlit/dp/B082GR814B?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9qRDjiluJ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. There are other models available with Cherry Blue and Brown switches available, but those currently don’t share the same discount. The K95 has many of the bells and whistles you’d want in a full-size keyboard, including dedicated media playback and macro keys, in addition to per-key RGB lighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7d8G4T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9740232"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YQzbFA"&gt;Logitech is branching out with its gaming accessories by offering its peripherals in a wide variety of outrageous color combinations. Currently, the Logitech G435 headset is available in three colorways at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Logitech-G435-LIGHTSPEED-Bluetooth-Wireless-Gaming-Headset-Lightweight-over-ear-headphones-built-in-mics-18h-battery-compatible-Dolby-Atmos-PC-PS4-PS/377935551&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDealRoundup120921&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22590360%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/authors%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf0Ap1jmugG?u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22590360%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com%2Fauthors%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-G435-Wireless-Gaming-Headset/dp/B08R8DT7X6?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=20&amp;amp;imprToken=38befe54-c7c1-45ab-2e1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22590360%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/authors%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $59.99, taking $20 off the regular price. To sweeten the deal, if you purchase this headset from Amazon, you’ll also get a free in-game weapon skin for &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ex6ge9"&gt;While you can always go with black, this universally compatible headset also comes in white with light blue accents, as well as a vivid pink and blue combo. The G435 can last up to 18 hours between charging and can pair with devices either through Bluetooth or with the included 2.4GHz wireless dongle. This model is currently our top pick if you’re looking for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549510/best-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wireless gaming headset&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6idgyH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10866389"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lXePzG"&gt;Lastly, we have a friendly public service announcement to take advantage of the Steam Winter Sale through January 5th. While there are plenty of titles that are, in fact, cheaper on the Epic Games Store thanks to the additional $10 coupon granted to all current users, there are a handful of Steam-exclusive games that are worth checking out. For example, the entire library of expansions for the &lt;em&gt;Sims 4&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Planet Zoo&lt;/em&gt; are on sale. Some other exclusives to Steam include &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt; for $53.99, &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect: Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt; for $29.99, and &lt;em&gt;Titanfall 2&lt;/em&gt; for just $4.79. If you’re deliberating on what games are worth your time this year, make sure to check out our guide to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22803171/gaming-pc-computer-best-games-2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best games for your new gaming PC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lego’s official Sonic the Hedgehog set recreates picture-perfect Green Hill Zone </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AKzmSy0OdduhDYAk0z1HJlYVZY0=/1726x1793:5301x4176/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70323019/21331_Lifestyle__015.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Lego&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DaMnDn"&gt;After months of waiting, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22264366/lego-sonic-mania-set-green-hill-zone-ideas"&gt;Lego’s official Sonic the Hedgehog set&lt;/a&gt; is finally here: a $69.99, 1,125-piece recreation of the iconic Green Hill Zone stage, complete with Lego-ized versions of the titular heroic hedgehog, a handful of classic Sonic villains, Dr. Eggman, and — of course — the Chaos Emeralds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U0kl33"&gt;Officially called the Lego Ideas Sonic the Hedgehog Green Hill Zone&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;set, the new kit’s origins are in a crowdsourced Lego Ideas set that was suggested by Lego and Sonic fan Viv Grannell in early 2019. After the set reached 10,000 votes through the Ideas program, Lego conducted an official review of the project in March 2020, and in February 2021, greenlit the proposal for development into a real set. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-VMSLnXPw0RlZlolksYnsb0n77A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23128527/21331_Lifestyle__002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lego&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“You mean the Chaos Emeralds?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gOniJD"&gt;And the final set looks great: the bright, blocky 8-bit design of the original set translates &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; well to the similar brick-based Lego design, and the details of the set (which include a checkpoint marker, a Technic-powered spring to launch Sonic, power-up crates, and a picture-perfect loop) all feel ripped right out of the Genesis original. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ixv2Af"&gt;The final set is taking a bit of a different direction from Grannell’s original proposed Idea set, which was more explicitly focused on &lt;em&gt;Sonic Mania&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;with Lego versions of that game’s villainous Hard Boiled Heavies, Egg Robot mech, and the Phantom Ruby. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UwnbTF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10949849"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h2YZWy"&gt;The retail set, however, takes a less title-specific approach to recreating Green Hill Zone in Lego form, with the stage’s Crabmeat and Moto Bug enemies and Dr. Eggman boss (all three of which are constructed out of bricks, instead of the more traditional minifigure design), along with Eggman’s Egg Mobile ship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KRkcEX"&gt;The new Sonic set isn’t technically the first time that Sonic has appeared in Lego form. The character was part of a &lt;a href="https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_Level_Pack_(Lego_Dimensions)"&gt;Lego Dimensions tie-in set in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, although the new minifigure version of Sonic has an updated design with additional details (like Sonic’s sneaker buckles printed on the minifigure’s feet). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fU9gDkDIjlTbSKBm_DDkCfoZF2s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23128514/21331_Lifestyle__008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lego&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multiple sets can be linked together thanks to its modular nature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9lSGic"&gt;It’s important to note that, unlike Lego’s other major recent video game partnership with Nintendo on its &lt;em&gt;Super Mario&lt;/em&gt; sets, the Sonic sets aren’t intended as an interactive play set. Sonic’s Lego debut is a purely brick-based creation, with no smart sensors or companion apps. That said, the set is intended to be somewhat modular, allowing fans to buy multiple copies (or perhaps one day, additional Sonic-themed sets) to extend the level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xXss6W"&gt;The Lego Ideas Sonic the Hedgehog Green Hill Zone&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;set will be available both in person at Lego stores and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flego.com%2FSonic&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F28%2F22855708%2Flego-sonic-the-hedgehog-green-hill-zone-set-sega-toy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at Lego’s website&lt;/a&gt; for $69.99 starting on New Year’s Day. But if you’re looking to snag a copy, you might want to take a cue from Sonic himself and go... fast. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Our predictions for the next year in audio</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FL8xg0wKPIizcdIxNXlt5a9Q20M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70322958/acastro_211217_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Rq4iTP"&gt;Hello, hello. I hope you all had a nice holiday and are ready for another one. Last week we looked back on 2021, and this week, we’re looking forward to 2022. We have a couple quick news hits from last week to get through first, but then Aria and I will offer our predictions for the year to come. Off we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qrbrX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project Brazen and Audiation ordered to release audio recorded for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fat Leonard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lG9TRU"&gt;In a troubling precedent for journalism, a judge in San Diego ruled the podcast companies behind&lt;em&gt; Fat Leonard&lt;/em&gt;, Project Brazen and Audiation, must share all recorded audio from their lead character, Leonard Glenn Francis — even audio that wasn’t included in the show’s final cut. The &lt;em&gt;San Diego Union-Tribune&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/courts/story/2021-12-22/fat-leonard-podcaster-recordings"&gt;has all the details&lt;/a&gt;, but essentially, the podcast tells the story of fraud and bribery within the US Navy. Six naval officers are currently accused of criminal bribery and are heading to trial in February. One of the officers’ legal team subpoenaed for the audio recordings, which they say might hold critical information for the defense, given that Francis is a key witness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K55kxd"&gt;Per the paper, the judge said the “naval officers’ Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to due process and confrontation ‘are paramount’ and overshadow the podcast producers’ First Amendment rights to protect their sources and unpublished materials.” Instead of quietly submitting the audio to the lawyers, the companies &lt;a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/nm7410pbdup7xcb/AACPYux3PjECh289CdLuQ2fSa?dl=0"&gt;instead released&lt;/a&gt; all 20 hours’ worth publicly on Dropbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ass413"&gt;“We disagree with this ruling and believe it sets a bad precedent for media freedom in the US,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwrightasia/status/1473864623866748931?s=21"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; Project Brazen co-founder Tom Wright. We here at &lt;em&gt;Hot Pod&lt;/em&gt; agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x3dLDL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twitter Spaces reaches 2 million users&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DMHhw0"&gt;Last week, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/21/technology/clubhouse-twitter-spaces.html"&gt;published a story&lt;/a&gt; about the ongoing war between Clubhouse and Twitter Spaces. Both are competing for show hosts and users, who have switched between the two platforms. The story also includes a couple number nuggets that are worth calling out: Spaces reached 2 million users in “recent months,” while Clubhouse says the app was downloaded 1.8 million times in November alone. The two apps are fighting and growing: that’s how we’re ending the year, and I’m sure it’s how we’ll continue to talk about the apps in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZLfnqL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automattic’s CEO wants to keep podcasting open&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JMtz18"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/matt-mullenweg"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; a great profile last week of Matt Mullenweg, CEO of Automattic, the company behind WordPress and Tumblr, as well as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580023/automattic-pocket-casts-podcast-app-tumble-wordpress"&gt;acquirer of&lt;/a&gt; Pocket Casts. The story mostly focuses on Mullenweg’s personal journey to this point and the ethos that drives him. For us, that also means the chance to piece together his vision for podcasting’s future, too, and how Pocket Casts fits into it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HGr8YH"&gt;“There is one thing that binds the many products under the Automattic umbrella together: a bet on and belief in the open web and open-source software,” writes David Pierce. “Most people will tell you it feels like the future of tech hangs in the balance. But the way Mullenweg sees it, open is still going to win. It’s not a matter of if, only when. And all he’s trying to do is help make it happen a little faster.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kqggkh"&gt;A win for all the folks rallying against the closed platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kdvNlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened to Dan Bongino’s threat to quit his radio show over a vaccine mandate?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zzSmNY"&gt;We wrote here about podcaster and radio host Dan Bongino threatening to quit his show over Cumulus Media’s vaccine mandate. That was months ago, however, and Bongino is still on the air. What happened? &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2021/12/20/bongino-ultimatum/"&gt;pointed&lt;/a&gt; at the obvious thing — the lack of Bongino actually doing anything — and provided an update. People in the story call the whole thing a “stunt” while Bongino says he’s in an “ongoing fight” with the company and hasn’t quit because he needs to protect his staff’s jobs. Who’s surprised? (If you want even more Bongino content, &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/01/03/dan-bongino-and-the-big-business-of-returning-trump-to-power"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; a profile of him yesterday.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;div id="VgSxYQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10776720"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rRkQTM"&gt;And now…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ciITe5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welcome to the prediction party&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="saXQ6H"&gt;Let’s get to the predictions. Both Aria and I wrote up what we expect to see and cover next year. We’re ready to be held accountable for these guesses, and I know we can count on you all to do so! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="idobax"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook will start hosting and monetizing podcasts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ojUsuN"&gt;Facebook got into podcasts this past year by allowing hosts to distribute their RSS feeds on Pages, and next year, I believe the company will start hosting and monetizing shows — no RSS feed required. Of course, saying this will happen in 2022 requires Facebook prioritizing and building the functionality, and it’s unclear how invested it is in actually doing it. But I do believe hosting and monetization is Facebook’s ultimate goal in the space, so I anticipate seeing it happen at some point.  -AC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LHhPjv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More headline-making podcast appearances&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OiP61i"&gt;While podcasts are increasingly a stop on celebrities’ press circuits, they remain the intimate medium they’ve always been: guards are lowered and conversations get real. Given this intersection, we’re likely to hear more and more high-profile people saying some pretty jarring things on tape. As a reminder, the next host of &lt;em&gt;Jeopardy!&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/mike-richards-jeopardy-host-fired-1235045394/"&gt;was ultimately fired&lt;/a&gt; from his role because of &lt;a href="https://www.theringer.com/tv/2021/8/18/22631299/mike-richards-jeopardy-host-search-process-past-comments"&gt;horrendous things&lt;/a&gt; he’d said on a podcast years before, ostensibly emboldened by the casual setting. Just months after he was let go, another person who’d once had the stamp of approval from the educational TV show — football player Aaron Rodgers — &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5BGBwqKka6JOWawexPm35V?si=EPJwPQzlT7uwTzM-zcP1YA&amp;amp;context=spotify%3Ashow%3A1ol0jP8hrNHydiAd38G6B1&amp;amp;t=1098"&gt;traded&lt;/a&gt; his squeaky-clean public persona for praise of ivermectin, all over the course of 45 minutes on the podcast &lt;em&gt;The Pat McAfee Show 2.0&lt;/em&gt;. We’re in for quite a ride as even more people try out the medium. -AB&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8aBM3e"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There will be fewer exclusive show deals and more windowing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJAdrQ"&gt;Spotify popularized the idea of shows going exclusive to one platform, but looking ahead, I foresee this trend fading out. If ad revenue is the primary goal for most of the big platforms, minimizing shows’ audiences by housing them in one place doesn’t make much sense. Instead, I expect to see more deals like the one between Amazon Music and &lt;em&gt;SmartLess&lt;/em&gt; with one week of exclusivity, or Amazon Music and &lt;em&gt;9/12&lt;/em&gt;, which offered the entire, bingeable show on the app with only one episode per week released elsewhere. Now, a two-for-one prediction: I also expect &lt;strong&gt;more Spotify-exclusive deals will not re-sign&lt;/strong&gt;. The big paycheck is nice, but it likely comes at the expense of reach and influence. -AC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LS1bsw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Salaries become standardized (through solidarity)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m5vndl"&gt;When hiring for one-off audio positions, people continue to reference the &lt;a href="https://airmedia.org/tools/all-our-rate-guides"&gt;rates&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://airmedia.org/tools/guide-to-fair-practice"&gt;best practices&lt;/a&gt; made publicly available by the organization AIR, and I have a feeling folks will soon realize they want (read: need) standards for staff positions, too — especially as more of those positions are created. There aren’t many places to turn to for that information, though. &lt;a href="https://airmedia.org/tools/salaries"&gt;I predict current salaried workers will soon act on that, and that at least part of it will be bold, public, and online, even if &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/meuceph/status/1412224182687911940?s=21"&gt;demystifying money&lt;/a&gt; by just talking about it has mostly been &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimHerrera/status/1456441667456839704"&gt;the domain of freelancers&lt;/a&gt;.  -AB &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7jb5c1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"podcasts"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BhKbA8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A more built-out Spotify Wrapped for podcasts &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HDz7c5"&gt;Still only two slides dedicated to podcasts? I’ve gotta say, I expected more from a company that spent this whole year trying to prove it did more than music. -AB&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zt0hBO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Podcasts become a way to sell products, especially by influencers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PewEe6"&gt;You can already argue that podcasts are an important sales channel because of promo codes and direct response advertisers, but I imagine we might see affiliate revenue play a bigger role in 2022. Influencers could still launch shows with the primary intention of using them as a way to connect with fans, but increasingly, they may just want to sell more stuff. It could be their own product line or an affiliate partnership with a larger company. I suspect this is why Amazon is taking an interest in the space — podcasts move product, and Amazon has a lot of product to move. Plus, it runs a huge affiliate revenue business. -AC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3eDV7n"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More pro gamers launch podcasts and reach huge numbers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zq7XQ"&gt;We talk a lot about Hollywood stars entering podcasting, but next year, I anticipate writing more about pro gamers hosting shows. We’re already seeing hints of this. QCODE’s Wood Elf Media produces &lt;em&gt;Distractible&lt;/em&gt; from streamer Mark Fischbach (aka Markiplier), which &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/markiplier-podcast-distractible-top-charts-1234978606/"&gt;apparently topped&lt;/a&gt; Joe Rogan on Spotify’s own charts. Gamers come with a built-in audience and, more so than influencers, are used to talking and having things to say, priming them for podcast fame. -AC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zILLIv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luminary gets bought or shuts down&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GMXIce"&gt;I had to make some kind of Luminary prediction, and I’m guessing the company either gets bought or shuts down. That’s it. Maybe it’ll thrive on its own, but it’s now entering its third year of existence, and something has to happen. -AC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gQ7dvl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Live social audio goes on-demand and becomes a hot zone for moderation discussions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uMJ90n"&gt;If 2021 was the year every platform built or invested in live audio, I believe 2022 will be the year they instead focus on on-demand content. Both Clubhouse and Twitter Spaces, as well as Spotify’s forgotten Greenroom, allow conversations to be recorded, and these replays will become essential to growing and maintaining the user bases. At the same time, I predict live audio’s reputation will tarnish as conversations run amok with misinformation, racism, threats of violence, and whatever else the internet is good at drumming up. -AC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="4WWTjk"&gt;
&lt;p id="RmMxYx"&gt;Thanks for sticking with us this year. Pop some bottles and manifest those dreams for 2022. We’ll be back Thursday for our insiders with a special Aria edition, and for the rest of y’all, we’re here Tuesday with our usually scheduled programming.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Load your phone with these recommendations, many of which are free&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="pcHiQ5"&gt;In addition to being a popular mobile OS, Android is one of the most bustling gaming platforms on Earth. If you have a recent Android phone or tablet, or even one that’s a couple of years old, you should be able to run a majority of the games available in the Google Play Store. That’s good because there are some stellar, console-quality games that you should be aware of, if you aren’t already in the know. Whether you just got a new Android phone, or you just want a few recommendations to use with your current phone, we’ve got you covered with the list below. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="5JP0bC"&gt;There’s a chance you’ve heard of &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; even if you aren’t that&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;tapped into gaming. It’s an online co-operative and competitive game where you work together with a team of space cadets, maintaining a space station — except one of you is an imposter whose goal it is to deceive everyone and eventually take over. As the imposter, it’s your job to be as sly and unassuming as possible, while everyone else is on edge that any of the others might be a back-stabber. It’s a simple game with a tense edge. Give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gaTSsL"&gt;If you’ve always wanted to experience something that’s similar to playing &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; on a console, definitely check out &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Mobile&lt;/em&gt;. In a sense, it’s a simpler version of the console experience since, by default (though it can be changed), guns automatically shoot when you hover over an enemy. Yet it’s visually impressive for a mobile port, and it offers several guns and other customizable traits that should satisfy that itch for a mobile first-person shooter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="5FOVuE"&gt;If you enjoy MOBA genre games on your PC, like &lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt; could scratch that itch while you’re on the go. While not as technically deep as either of those aforementioned games, &lt;em&gt;Unite&lt;/em&gt; delivers on the core fundamentals of the competitive genre, and of course it’s deeply entrenched in the world of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt;. This game’s free, and it offers cross-play and cross-progression with the Nintendo Switch version.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="T2299H"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;remains one of the most popular free games available on Android, even though it’s not so straightforward to install for a lot of people. If you want to download this battle royale game that pits you against up to 100 others in a huge, ever-changing map, non-Samsung users will need to head to &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/mobile/android/get-started"&gt;Epic Games’ site on your phone&lt;/a&gt;, then find the link to install its app, from which you can install &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. If you do have a Samsung phone, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is available exclusively within its &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgfOXqnUeqr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Store&lt;/a&gt;. All other phones from other brands will need to take the long route.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="raZnLO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dead Cells&lt;/em&gt; is yet another console-quality port made for Android phones. For those unfamiliar with the game, this is one of the better side-scrolling action games available today and is fun to play for hours on end. Developers are still supporting it with new content years after its original launch on PC. You start each run with a random set of weapons, and the levels are procedurally generated, meaning the items contained within levels (along with their layouts) are never exactly the same every time. So, despite the somewhat high difficulty curve, the more you play, the better the items you’ll get, which will help make the game a bit easier.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kxv0mZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Genshin Impact&lt;/em&gt; is a global phenomenon, combining the aesthetic of anime and &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; with the gameplay of an MMO. It’s free to play (with paid cosmetics available), but if you want a game that offers up gorgeous visuals and rich, varied gameplay, check this one out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eraRie"&gt;Impressively, this game supports cross-save progression if you have a miHoYo account. So, you can pick up on Android right where you left off on PC or console. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VpChuR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pikmin Bloom&lt;/em&gt; is one of Nintendo and Niantic’s latest mobile experiments. In this one, you grow little pikmin creatures from seeds as you walk. The game taps into your phone’s GPS location, and it’s designed to get you outside and moving around. While it’s less of a game than many of the entries on this list, with few objectives other than taking a certain amount of steps to develop seeds into pikmin, it can be a relaxing thing to play (especially if you’ve enjoyed previous &lt;em&gt;Pikmin &lt;/em&gt;games from Nintendo consoles). If anything, it makes the act of walking around a little more fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="ApFq0M"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sky: Children of the Light&lt;/em&gt; is the latest game from Thatgamecompany, responsible for relaxing games including &lt;em&gt;Journey&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Flower&lt;/em&gt;, and more. &lt;em&gt;Sky &lt;/em&gt;is similarly gorgeous and mysterious, and it’s a must-play if you enjoy playing a game that lets you take in the visuals instead of constantly demanding twitchy reflexes to win. The character movement and flight controls feel good to use, and there’s more than enough collectibles and engaging story to warrant a free download.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Mvt1UY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10922122" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Lvx04q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/em&gt; is an instant recommendation if you’ve played games like &lt;em&gt;The Sims&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Harvest Moon&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt;. It borrows elements from all of those games, like interpersonal relationships, growing crops, building out your dream home, but it adds plenty of its own gameplay mechanics in the mix. You can choose to live your days making sure to buy the perfect birthday present for your best friends, fish to your heart’s content, or dive into the mines to gather rare minerals (fighting some spooky baddies along the way). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>COVID-19 patients only need to isolate for five days as long as symptoms are gone, CDC says</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Health care workers prepare to test a man for COVID-19 at a..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JYv4uhtwjXahjkue4BuNHdWUtaA=/23x0:2977x1969/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70321541/1237390695.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A4UjtV"&gt;People who test positive for COVID-19 only need to isolate for five days as long as their symptoms have stopped, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1227-isolation-quarantine-guidance.html"&gt;said Monday&lt;/a&gt;. The change to isolation guidelines from 10 days to five is based on data showing people with COVID-19 are most likely to be contagious to others during the few days before and after they start showing symptoms, the agency said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9uXGCT"&gt;After leaving isolation, people should wear a mask around others for five additional days, the CDC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mFGU6U"&gt;The CDC also said Monday that people who haven’t received a booster dose of a COVID-19 vaccine but received their second dose of an mRNA vaccine six months ago, or who received a Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine two months ago, should quarantine for five days if they’re exposed to someone with COVID-19. That’s a change from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276905/covid-vaccine-quarantine-symptoms-test"&gt;previous guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, which said people who are fully vaccinated don’t need to quarantine if they have exposure to someone sick with the disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fq0ZhD"&gt;The changes to isolation guidelines for people sick with COVID-19 come only a few days after the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/23/health/cdc-covid-isolation-period-health-care-workers.html"&gt;said that health care workers&lt;/a&gt; only need to isolate for seven days if they test positive for the virus, as long as they’re asymptomatic and have a negative test on the seventh day. The United Kingdom also &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/22/uk-shortens-covid-19-isolation-period-to-7-days-in-england.html"&gt;shortened its recommended isolation period&lt;/a&gt; to seven days, as long as people have negative tests on the sixth and seventh days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ojefw6"&gt;Today’s new guidelines from the CDC for the general public in the United States do not include a recommendation to take a test at the end of the five-day isolation period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93NhBj"&gt;The highly contagious omicron variant is driving unprecedented surges in COVID-19 cases, and in many places, more people are testing positive for the virus each day than ever before. As a result, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/24/business/workers-covid-isolate.html"&gt;faced pressure&lt;/a&gt; from various industries, including airlines, to shorten the isolation period in order to reduce staffing shortages from people testing positive and missing ten days of work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FwWITX"&gt;Public health experts say a shorter isolation period is supported by research on the virus. However, people should be truly recovered if they’re going to return to everyday activities. “What I don’t want to see happen is for this to be used as an excuse to force people to come back while they are unwell,” Megan Ranney, an emergency physician and an associate dean at the School of Public Health at Brown University, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/24/business/workers-covid-isolate.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
