    <title>A ransomware attack took a New Mexico jail offline, leaving inmates in lockdown </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YRrncq"&gt;A ransomware attack last week has left an Albuquerque area jail without access to its camera feeds and rendered automatic door mechanisms unusable. Inmates have been confined to their cells as a result, while technicians struggled to bring systems back online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Ic2jk"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.abqjournal.com/2459954/cyber-attack-leads-to-jail-lockdown-settlement-violations.html"&gt;As first reported by the Albuquerque Journal&lt;/a&gt;, visitor access to the Metropolitan Detention Center was completely suspended as the jail was put into lockdown. All internet services at the jail were also knocked offline, leaving staff unable to look up inmate records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tgT7cp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;All county internet services at the jail were also knocked offline, leaving staff unable to look up inmate records&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s9jt6h"&gt;Based on the lack of camera coverage, all inmates within the facility were placed on lockdown from the morning of January 5th. Further, according to an &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21176926-bernalillo-county-notice-of-emergency"&gt;emergency notice&lt;/a&gt; filed by the county, the incident tracking database containing all reports of fighting, use of force, and allegations of sexual assault was not available and is believed to be corrupted by the attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qvwPiC"&gt;“In the early morning of January 5, 2022, the automatic door mechanisms at MDC were unusable, meaning that staff had to use keys to manually open facility doors,” wrote Taylor Rahn, an attorney for the county, in a court notice related to the lockdown. “One of the most concerning impacts of the cyber attack is that MDC is unable to access facility cameras. As of the evening of January 5th, there was no access to cameras within the facility.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8wDke9"&gt;The detention center was just one point of impact in a &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/albuquerque-impacted-by-ransomware-attack-on-bernalillo-county-government/"&gt;larger ransomware attack that struck Bernalillo County&lt;/a&gt;, the most populous county in New Mexico, on January 5th. County employees were left unable to access any local government databases, and all public offices were temporarily closed. A press release dated January 10th noted that county office headquarters were still &lt;a href="https://www.bernco.gov/blog/2022/01/10/alvarado-square-open-on-lobby-level-only/"&gt;only partially re-opened&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1uT7CW"&gt;The unexpected lockdown put the jail in potential violation of the terms of a settlement in a lawsuit over conditions of confinement, forcing Bernalillo County to file an emergency notice in federal court. &lt;a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-nmd-6_95-cv-00024/pdf/USCOURTS-nmd-6_95-cv-00024-15.pdf"&gt;A settlement agreement&lt;/a&gt; from a 1995 lawsuit required county jails to adopt new protocols in response to broader complaints about overcrowding and other conditions, including a guarantee that inmates are given regular access to telephones and other communications devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UPpdpb"&gt;But the total failure of the jail’s internal computer network could force the facility to violate that agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6okw6J"&gt;“[L]imited out of cell time may have an impact on inmates’ ability to access telephones and tablets,” the emergency filing says. “Further, depending on the length of the impact of the attack, County Defendant may be unable to gather data required by the Settlement Agreement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BtrUfy"&gt;Contacted by telephone, Rahn’s office said she was not immediately available for comment. Email and voicemail messages sent to Bernalillo County officials had not been answered at time of press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wzsabl"&gt;Ransomware is increasingly seen as one of the top threats facing both private businesses and government institutions across the US. Last year the Department of Justice &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22822884/us-government-department-of-justice-ransomware-digital-extortion-task-force-report-2021"&gt;created the Ransomware and Digital Extortion Task Force&lt;/a&gt; to coordinate information sharing between DOJ divisions and with outside agencies, signaling a new approach to tackling the problem. Nonetheless, reports from the US Treasure estimate that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728765/us-treasury-ransomware-payout-numbers-reports-2021-first-half-cybercrime"&gt;ransomware payouts for 2021&lt;/a&gt; will still top all previous records.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon will redo Bessemer union election on February 4th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eBbQjdt-8zaNK8TiXiWjfemG9C0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70375180/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The NLRB said Amazon broke labor laws in the original election.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4ob1ga"&gt;The second union election at an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama will begin on February 4th, according to a notice posted Tuesday by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which you can read below. The election is a redo of the one that was carried out in 2021, the results of which were declared invalid by the regulatory agency after reports that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22598004/nlrb-officer-new-election-amazon-bessemer-union-drive"&gt;Amazon had broken labor laws&lt;/a&gt; during the union drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yzk62X"&gt;The election will be carried out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272213/amazon-union-bhm1-alabama-rwdsu-vote-begins"&gt;almost a year after&lt;/a&gt; workers originally voted on whether to unionize Amazon’s BHM1 facility. The union &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22374540/amazon-union-vote-outcome-bessemer-alabama-rwdsu-bhm1"&gt;lost that election nearly two-to-one&lt;/a&gt; but disputed the results, taking issue with a mailbox that employees feared Amazon had access to. The mailbox was installed by the USPS, at Amazon’s request, and at one point had a “privacy tent” put up around it, which the NLRB says employees believed was monitored with video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6lGAQk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The redo is taking place because regulators found Amazon interfered in the first election&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5Cdllp"&gt;The NLRB cites the mailbox in its notice of the second election, saying that the results of the first are being set aside after the regulator “found the Employer interfered with the employees’ exercise of a free and reasoned choice by creating the appearance of irregularity in the election.” It also accuses Amazon of “improperly polling employees’ support during mandatory meetings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E83WXP"&gt;The redo will be carried out through the mail and supervised by the NLRB. In response to the notice, the Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Union (the organization behind the union drive in Bessemer) put out a statement saying that it’s “deeply concerned that the decision fails to adequately prevent Amazon from continuing its objectionable behavior in a new election.” The RWDSU says it “proposed to the NLRB a number of remedies that could have made the process fairer to workers, which were not taken up in the Notice of Election issued today,” and promises to “continue to hold [Amazon] accountable for [its] actions.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ElU4Tz"&gt;Amazon didn’t immediately reply to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AEzX5E"&gt;The NLRB says that it will start counting the ballots on March 28th, though ballots will have to reach its offices by March 25th to be counted. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/23/22851842/amazon-union-settlement-nlrb-email-electronic-post-rights"&gt;Due to a recent NLRB / Amazon settlement&lt;/a&gt;, organizers may have more opportunities this time around — the company has agreed to stop barring employees from being at their workplace more than 15 minutes before or after their shifts if they’re carrying out union activity and has promised to prominently post statements of workers’ rights in its facilities and employee apps.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peer-to-peer car-sharing service Turo files to go public </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gDwR-3rfIsYyv502krEArJBzxuk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70375154/akrales_180222_2325_0024.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pWkSHp"&gt;Turo, the peer-to-peer car-sharing service, has filed for its initial public offering, the latest transportation-related startup to sell its shares on a public stock exchange. The company proposes to sell $100 million of stock, but that figure could change as Turo gets closer to its public debut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y2jBdJ"&gt;Founded in 2010, the San Francisco-based company allows people to rent out their personal cars to other customers, much like Airbnb does for homes. In its &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1514587/000119312522005696/d145731ds1.htm#toc145731_4"&gt;S-1 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt;, Turo claims it has 85,000 active hosts (meaning vehicle owners), 161,000 active vehicles, and 1.3 million active guests over the period of 12 months ending September 30th, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="N0fyXm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;opting for an old-fashioned IPO rather than a SPAC&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0b4EAM"&gt;Unlike many transportation-related startups in recent years, the San Francisco-based company is opting for an old-fashioned IPO rather than merging with a special acquisition company, or SPAC. Turo also stands out because it’s not specifically tied to electric or autonomous vehicles, which have mostly fueled the recent SPAC and IPO craze. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="owru6h"&gt;Similar to other transportation startups, Turo has lost money every year its been in operation. As of September 30th, the company says it lost a cumulative $544 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lMRF2S"&gt;The company plans on offering some of its shares exclusively to its users, both renters and owners, in a move similar to what Uber did when it offered specially priced shares to some of its drivers. Turo says it plans to offer 5 percent of its stock to “eligible hosts and guests on our platform and certain individuals identified by our officers and directors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JfUAed"&gt;Turo claims it avoids the costs associated with owning large fleets, like its competitors in the rental car business like Avis, Hertz, and Enterprise, while also helping its hosts earn extra cash by renting out their unused vehicles. And Covid-19 has helped boost Turo’s business in relation to these legacy rental car services, the company says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KEFFUg"&gt;“Rental car companies reduced their fleet sizes in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic and have been unable to quickly rebuild their fleets due to constraints in automobile manufacturing capacity,” Turo says. “In light of these conditions, more consumers turned to peer-to-peer car sharing for their vehicle needs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uVUWs9"&gt;Turo has run into regulatory hurdles in the past. The company was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/23/17040276/turo-sfo-lawsuit-car-sharing-enterprise"&gt;sued by the city of San Francisco in 2018&lt;/a&gt; for failure to pay the fees required to operate legally at the SFO airport. The company counter-sued the city, claiming it shouldn’t be subject to the same regulations as legacy rental car companies. A judge eventually ruled in the city’s favor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I8kIfD"&gt;But there have also been some bright spots. Recently, New York State passed legislation legalizing peer-to-peer car-sharing, which is set to go into effect in the latter half of 2022. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GameStop and Best Buy have Xbox Series X consoles for order right now (update: sold out at Best Buy)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MYyML7jTlnEIS2cvCiHw3M6TywA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70374466/vpavic_201103_4275_0196.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The monolithic Xbox Series X console is still a bit tricky to get.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LfYRnO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 12:58PM ET, January 11th: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Best Buy has sold out of consoles for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZecdP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 12:30PM ET, January 11th:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; GameStop still has both bundles available, and now &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgoIQEe59VB" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; has restocked Xbox Series X consoles. They are available for the standard $499.99 without a bundle. As usual for Best Buy, it is based on local availability at stores in your area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nxxl53"&gt;Another week, another restock of Xbox Series X consoles at GameStop. Hopefully this is a trend that new console availability is opening up in 2022 to a point where soon anyone will be able to walk into a store and pick up their hardware of choice without any fuss. While we’re not quite there yet, the restocks are remaining fairly consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pJl8WL"&gt;GameStop has two Xbox Series X console bundles today, offered on its website for shipping to US addresses — as opposed to some of the recent in-store restocks we have seen. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergeconsolerestock&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fxbox-series-x%257Cs%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fxbox-series-x-far-cry-6-nba-2k22-accessories-and-system-bundle-with-a-50-gamestop-gift-card%2FB224745R.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The first bundle&lt;/a&gt; includes the Xbox Series X console, &lt;em&gt;Far Cry 6&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;NBA 2K22&lt;/em&gt;, a three-month subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, and a $50 GameStop gift card for a total of $749.95. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergeconsolerestock&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fxbox-series-x%257Cs%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fxbox-series-x-elite-controller-game-pass-ultimate-and-system-bundle-with-a-50-gamestop-gift-card%2FB224745S.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The second bundle&lt;/a&gt; has the Xbox Series X console paired with the Xbox Elite Series 2 controller, a three-month subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, and a $50 GameStop gift card for a total of $774.97.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jk2OQM"&gt;This restock is not limited to &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergeconsolerestock010321&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fpoweruprewards%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop Pro subscribers&lt;/a&gt;, but be sure to create a basic account or sign in to your existing account on GameStop’s site to streamline the process with your purchase info filled out, and always keep in mind that patience and persistence is key. You may get an error or a sold out notification when adding to your cart, but keep refreshing the listing and trying as long as that Add to Cart button is still there. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook contractors threaten to stop work over missing paychecks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="facebook stock art" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RvcMAJLVKldQNeKK0lAIVfHsuxA=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70374836/acastro_180928_1777_facebook_hack_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h0d8Nd"&gt;Facebook moderators at an Accenture site in Austin are facing a payroll disaster that has left many without their holiday paychecks. Workers at the site handle moderation, customer service, and other tasks for Facebook and WhatsApp — and a work stoppage has already been threatened if the situation is not resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2wObVO"&gt;The problems began as early as January 4th, when some workers noticed errors in the system that tracks paid time off (PTO), a clerical confusion that was attributed to a recent change in payroll providers at the site. Things got more serious when the January 6th round of paychecks failed to arrive. Internal pay stub systems showed many paychecks as zeroed out, and workers were left with no idea of when they might get their money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LkvxNg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Some employees have had to take out payday loans just so they could have enough money to buy food for their children.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RwkPaD"&gt;In an open letter to the CEOs of Facebook and Accenture, posted on an internal message board, a group of workers pledged to halt work at the site until the paychecks were issued in full. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PgDFI1"&gt;“If these issues are not resolved immediately a work stoppage will be enacted,” the letter promised. “The work stoppage will begin on January 7th, 2022 if nothing is resolved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3fqLpF"&gt;Several lump-sum payments were issued to affected workers shortly after the letter posted, and Accenture says the company has not seen any indication of coordinated work stoppage at the site in the days since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wZmUG7"&gt;In a call with employees Saturday, a managing director at the Accenture site said he was unsure when the issue would be resolved, but the company would cover any late fees or overdraft charges incurred as a result of the delay. “You will be paid the amounts that you are due,” he said on the call, “and we will get that to you as quickly as we possibly can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O7kXWO"&gt;Some workers have received lump-sum payments from the company, meant to tide them over until the full amount can be properly calculated. But employees at the site say not everyone has received those payments, and many are in desperate financial straits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mwGzaB"&gt;As of Monday night, one moderator at the Austin site said more than 50 people on his team still had not been paid. “I know many who are behind on bills, utilities, food, and rent,” he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “When you only get paid $16 an hour in a town like Austin, missing a check is like missing a leg.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PKNYok"&gt;The issue is particularly severe because of overtime pay and expenses incurred over the holidays, which have been lost in the shuffle between providers. “Some employees have had to take out payday loans just so they could have enough money to buy food for their children,” another employee told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cPpAtt"&gt;Reached for comment, Accenture representative Stacey Jones emphasized that the company was working to resolve the problem. “We recently switched payroll providers and experienced some unanticipated challenges during our first payroll run with the new provider,” Jones told The Verge. “Our number one priority since last week has been getting our people who have experienced issues paid – and, we continue encouraging our people who need assistance to reach out to their supervisor or HR, so we can help them resolve.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="przPZD"&gt;Meta (parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and Whatsapp) often subcontracts moderation and other personnel services to firms like Accenture, although the arrangement has been led to employee welfare in other instances. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/21021005/google-youtube-moderators-ptsd-accenture-violent-disturbing-content-interviews-video"&gt;A 2019 &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; investigation&lt;/a&gt; into an Accenture site in Austin moderating YouTube videos found managers often forced employees to work through breaks and forego vacations when facing high demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zciObw"&gt;Reached for comment, Facebook confirmed the disruption and emphasized Accenture’s efforts to address it. “Accenture has notified its employees of this issue,” said Meta representative Kadia Koroma, “and is working to resolve it as soon as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3oPvNZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 1:35PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Added new information from Accenture that the company has not seen evidence of work stoppage at the site.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lego delays Overwatch 2 set as company reevaluates relationship with Activision Blizzard</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Overwatch" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C631yWDY6zH4eA3xNjmlLOL3QNI=/365x0:1562x798/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70374832/Screen_Shot_2014-11-07_at_2.35.08_PM.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Blizzard&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0pR7jA"&gt;The name &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt; has become synonymous with delay. First reported by &lt;a href="https://www.thebrickfan.com/lego-overwatch-2-titan-76980-release-delayed"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Brick Fan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a Lego review site, the extremely popular toymaker is delaying the release of an &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt;-themed set as the company reviews its relationship with &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt; publisher Activision Blizzard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q0kCm0"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Alice Carter, Lego’s senior manager of corporate brand communication, said: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="v8tJzR"&gt;We are currently reviewing our partnership with Activision Blizzard given concerns about the progress being made to address continuing allegations regarding workplace culture, especially the treatment of female colleagues and creating a diverse and inclusive environment. While we complete the review we will pause the release of a LEGO Overwatch 2 product which was due to go on sale on February 1, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="77enOn"&gt;Activision Blizzard has been involved in an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597113/activision-blizzard-california-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-discrimination-employee-action"&gt;extensive legal battle&lt;/a&gt; with several government agencies over allegations that its employees fostered a work environment rife with discrimination, abuse, and sexual harassment. As companies like Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789881/microsoft-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-deeply-troubled-by-activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick"&gt;publicly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787848/playstation-boss-jim-ryan-calls-out-activision-blizzard-staff-memo"&gt;privately&lt;/a&gt; express concerns about Activision Blizzard, Lego seems to be the first gaming-adjacent company to take direct action. Last year, advertisers including Kellogg’s and Coca-Cola &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22613315/overwatch-league-sponsor-kelloggs-pulls-ads-activision-blizzard-lawsuit"&gt;pulled their sponsorships&lt;/a&gt; from the Overwatch League — Activision Blizzard’s &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; esports league — as the allegations first came to light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OSfhDb"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/10/opinion/sway-kara-swisher-phil-spencer.html"&gt;an interview on &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; podcast &lt;em&gt;Sway&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, head of Xbox Phil Spencer said that Xbox has changed how they do things with Activision Blizzard but declined to go into detail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJvfWi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDUzES"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AvdRsE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2YdZpo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku rolls out all-new Live TV Zone </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DQNYp7oq7zQh-U127bDprhUDYXk=/129x0:1071x628/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70374759/Live_TV_Zone_LHN.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c7Jyb6"&gt;Roku is making live TV even easier to find with its new Live TV Zone, a one-stop shop for all things live and linear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BCO67T"&gt;The Live TV Zone will be home to not only Roku’s own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628020/roku-live-tv-guide-17-new-channels"&gt;Live TV Channel Guide&lt;/a&gt;, which previously existed as a &lt;a href="https://channelstore.roku.com/details/1ac1f6c4b2a10445e55c6fca4f14d064/live-tv-on-the-roku-channel"&gt;standalone channel&lt;/a&gt;, but also third-party services like YouTube TV, Hulu with Live TV, and Sling, among other apps. Users will also find their recently watched content in this tab, in addition to entertainment programming, sports, and local and national news coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B3XfVP"&gt;The Live TV Zone can be found under the Live TV tab from the left-hand navigation menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I2dmRr"&gt;Roku has been leaning heavily into its live TV features. The company last year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22680133/roku-os-10-5-update"&gt;expanded voice command support&lt;/a&gt; for its live TV guide with the Roku OS 10.5 update. It also boosted its Live TV on The Roku Channel slate to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628020/roku-live-tv-guide-17-new-channels"&gt;more than 200 free channels&lt;/a&gt; last fall, effectively doubling the number of free-to-stream live channels available through the app in a little over a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKtP4H"&gt;Citing a survey of 2,852 US adults &lt;a href="https://roku-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Roku-Streaming-Report_FINAL_Sept-2021.pdf"&gt;conducted last year&lt;/a&gt;, Roku said that nearly 61 percent of individuals without traditional pay TV still stream live news multiple times per week. The survey also found that pay-TV users only marginally reported greater satisfaction over sports streamers (80 percent to 75 percent satisfaction).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google can’t cloak documents showing an ‘antiunion campaign,’ NLRB judge rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F9x85tLm0s4M53pNnByrMEmQ5Nc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70374728/acastro_210121_1777_google_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Judge rules Google has to turn over 180 documents in an NLRB case | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="J2zQlb"&gt;A judge appointed by the National Labor Relations Board has ruled that Google must turn over some 180 documents related to an internal campaign to fight union organizing efforts by employees. Dubbed Project Vivian, a Google attorney described the ongoing effort between 2018 and 2020 as a way to “engage employees more positively and convince them that unions suck,” according to one of the documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kJs7zB"&gt;The documents are part of a case the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22047383/google-spied-workers-before-firing-labor-complaint"&gt;NLRB brought against Google&lt;/a&gt; in December 2020, which alleged the internet giant violated US labor law by spying on and firing employees who were organizing protests and trying to unionize. Former Google employee Laurence Berland, fired in 2019, was organizing against the company’s hiring of IRI Consultants, a firm known for its union-busting efforts. He said he was fired for looking at other employees’ calendars, breaking a Google policy which the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421969/google-illegally-firing-three-workers-nlrb-president-biden"&gt;NLRB found to be unlawful&lt;/a&gt;. And former Google employee Kathryn Spiers said she was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/17/21024472/google-employee-fired-labor-rights-notification-tool"&gt;fired after she created a pop-up for Google employees&lt;/a&gt; who visited the IRI Consultants website. The company claimed Spiers had violated security policies, but the NLRB found that her firing was also unlawful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NGGcwc"&gt;Google tried to claim attorney-client privilege to shield some of the documents that were subpoenaed in the case. But administrative law Judge Paul Bogas said Google’s “broad assertion, is, to put it charitably, an overreach,” according to a January 7th order &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; received following a Freedom of Information Act request. Bogas wrote in his ruling that IRI provided Google with “antiunion messaging and message amplification strategies” that were tailored to Google’s workforce, but IRI didn’t give Google legal advice that would be protected by attorney-client privilege. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TVtGEb"&gt;He added that Google had CC’d its legal counsel on documents that would not be considered privileged otherwise, in what appeared to be an effort to try to keep the documents private. He said Google “cannot spin the mere fact of a nascent organizing effort among employees into ‘litigation’ — like straw spun into gold — that entitles it to cloak in privilege every aspect of its antiunion campaign.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="olbnYa"&gt;Google spokesperson Jennifer Rodstrom said in an email to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it considers the underlying case to be unrelated to unionization efforts, rather that “it’s about employees breaching clear security protocols to access confidential information and systems inappropriately.” She added that IRI was one of “dozens of outside consultants” Google works with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E9Vyo2"&gt;If Google loses the case, it may be forced to pay back wages to Berland and Spiers and rehire them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ROvIBm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gvgd37"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="McQ3T2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s new matte black Surface Go 3 launches with optional LTE connectivity</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LRRCY-kXCMbOSj_E7irMfKxfswE=/0x0:2640x1760/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70374630/surfacego3blacklte.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xWWkGA"&gt;Microsoft is announcing a new matte black option of its Surface Go 3 today, with optional LTE connectivity. The announcement comes just a day after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22876137/microsoft-surface-go-3-matte-black-leak-images"&gt;images of the new Surface Go 3 model leaked online&lt;/a&gt;, with a new matte black finish. The new color option and LTE connectivity are the only changes, as it’s identical to the regular Surface Go 3 otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M5YBnY"&gt;Microsoft first launched the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22684608/microsoft-surface-go-3-processor-specs-price-features"&gt;Surface Go 3 in September&lt;/a&gt;, with new Intel processor options. The Surface Go 3 can be configured with an Intel Pentium Gold 6500Y or Core i3-10100Y, upgrades over the Surface Go 2, which launched with a Pentium Gold 4425Y or a Core m3 chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pJPk2g"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Now in Matte Black, our most portable Surface touchscreen 2-in-1 is perfect for your everyday tasks, homework, and play.&lt;/p&gt;— Microsoft Surface (@surface) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/surface/status/1480932520006873088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 11, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QEA1pQ"&gt;The matte black version of the Surface Go 3 is now available starting at $549.99, with an Intel Pentium Gold 6500Y processor, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage. If you’re interested in the optional LTE, then you’ll need to step up to a Core i3 model that comes with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage and is priced at $729.99. A matching black Type Cover is also available for $99.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="85SrPo"&gt;The new matte black models are &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fstore%2Fconfigure%2FSurface-Go-3%2F904H27D0CBWN%3Fcrosssellid%3Dfbt-f4c%26selectedColor%3D000000%26preview%3D%26previewModes%3D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available immediately&lt;/a&gt; in the US, UK, and other Surface markets.

    <title>Sony Xperia 5 III now shipping in the US, almost nine months after initial announcement</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YoS7oZk0NVKgSCFSQhWYKCyGe-U=/87x0:1022x623/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70374527/image.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e3KHRc"&gt;Sony’s Xperia 5 III, the compact counterpart to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22580552/sony-xperia-1-iii-review-price-specs-screen-camera"&gt;Xperia 1 III&lt;/a&gt;, is &lt;a href="https://pressroom.pixelshift.studio/sony-electronics-highly-anticipated-xperiar-5-iii-smartphone-now-shipping-in-the-united-states"&gt;now on sale in the US&lt;/a&gt;, almost nine months after the company initially announced the device &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22382887/sony-announces-xperia-1-iii-xperia-5-iii"&gt;in April 2021&lt;/a&gt;. The phone retails for $999.99 and will be available in black or green, with the latter exclusive to Sony’s own online store. The phone went on sale in the second half of last year in the UK and Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ktKLs8"&gt;The phone has seen some internal upgrades compared to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514064/sony-xperia-5-ii-review"&gt;Xperia 1 II&lt;/a&gt;, which bring it more into line with mainstream handsets from 2021. It’s powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor, runs Android 11 out of the box, and should also be able to benefit from at least some 5G connectivity in the US. Elsewhere, battery capacity has been upped to 4,500mAh, and Sony advertises that this larger battery can be charged to 50 percent in half an hour, like its predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8e7JgyoV9gkitL48wARyEBuXEVk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23160681/auto.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A tall display paired with three rear cameras.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gjED2g"&gt;Externally the Xperia 5 III has a similar design to the Xperia 5 II. Its 120Hz 6.1-inch display maintains Sony’s trademark 21:9 aspect ratio, and there are still three rear 12-megapixel cameras, which handle main, ultrawide, and telephoto duties, respectively. There’s support for taking photos at up to 20fps, with focus / exposure readings happening at 60fps, as well as support for recording 120fps 4K footage in HDR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rvspRt"&gt;It’s a decent set of specs, and if the Xperia 1 III is anything to go by, the phone should have decent camera performance and a stunning screen. But $999 seems like a high price when, very soon, we’re going to start seeing phones releasing with Qualcomm’s newer Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xr8tB8"&gt;The Xperia 5 III is shipping now, and Sony says that orders placed before February 27th will come with a pair of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/5/20682334/sony-wf-1000xm3-wireless-earbuds-hands-on-preview-features"&gt;WF-1000XM3&lt;/a&gt; earbuds and 43,200 &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Mobile&lt;/em&gt; CP points for free. &lt;/p&gt;
