    <title>Vergecast: This week’s GameStop timeline</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="GameStop photo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y0x7xpLy3HXocKOvteRL-uFyo2M=/2x0:998x664/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68739650/gamestop-photo.1419973076.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;GameStop photo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5bHFUi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;had extensive coverage this week of how the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;subreddit r/WallStreetBets&lt;/a&gt; sent GameStop’s stock skyrocketing, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254102/robinhood-gamestop-bloc-stock-purchase-amc-reddit-wsb"&gt;the chaos that ensued thereafter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6PwMHi"&gt;For this week’s episode of &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Nilay Patel, Dieter Bohn, and Elizabeth Lopatto attempt to chronicle that chaos into a timeline of events, while also explaining the interweaving machinations of stock trading, short selling, and internet culture. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The ‘Snyder Cut’ of Justice League is coming to HBO Max on March 18th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/24z3zEtRSO9NmEaYZcR1XGah6-I=/94x0:1107x675/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68739550/unnamed.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PPJvXN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zack Snyder’s Justice League&lt;/em&gt; (aka “The Snyder Cut”) will hit &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;aff_sub=VergeSubscriberGoal012721&amp;amp;source=Verge"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; on March 18th, the director &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZackSnyder/status/1355152770408476677?s=20"&gt;announced on Twitter today&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k4kcQr"&gt;The original theatrical release of &lt;em&gt;Justice League&lt;/em&gt; debuted in November 2017 and, ahead of its release, endured a difficult production. Most notably, director Joss Whedon stepped in to finish the film during post-production after Snyder stepped away from the project for &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/zack-snyder-steps-down-justice-league-deal-family-tragedy-1006455?utm_source=twitter"&gt;personal reasons&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;em&gt;Justice League&lt;/em&gt; was released, fans criticized Whedon’s contributions to the film, which included a lighter tone. Fans started an internet campaign for Warner Bros. to &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/10/16873696/justice-league-zack-snyder-directors-cut-conspiracy-theory"&gt;“Release the Snyder Cut”&lt;/a&gt; in the years since. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TEEsIZ"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lvhb7N"&gt;Warner Bros. previously announced in May that the long-rumored extended cut was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/20/21263044/justice-league-snyder-cut-warnermedia-hbo-max-zack-ben-affleck-henry-cavill-gal-gaot-streaming"&gt;getting an official release&lt;/a&gt; but as an exclusive on WarnerMedia’s new streaming service, HBO Max. With a firm release date for &lt;em&gt;Zack Snyder’s Justice League &lt;/em&gt;finally set, the film is launching at a competitive time for superhero media as it will release one day before the debut of Marvel Studios’ newest miniseries, &lt;a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/tv-shows/exclusive-first-look-falcon-winter-soldier-disney-plus-march-2021"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which will stream exclusively on &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/977661/9358?sharedid=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="POMyoa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zack Snyder’s Justice League&lt;/em&gt; isn’t the only new film arriving on HBO Max this year. In December, Warner Bros. announced that every single one of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;films in 2021 would release simultaneously&lt;/a&gt; on HBO Max the same day they premiered in movie theaters. AT&amp;amp;T now credits the decision for helping &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252069/hbo-max-subscribers-wonder-woman-1984-att-earnings"&gt;boost HBO Max subscriber numbers&lt;/a&gt; in its latest earnings report. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Johnson and Johnson says single-shot COVID-19 vaccine is 66 percent effective </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="HEALTH-VIRUS-US-JOHNSON &amp;amp;amp; JOHNSON" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A0N7JaM4AcwJw0j2gFTN7fU1d28=/0x0:5497x3665/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68739492/1229653990.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by JUSTIN TALLIS/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4xMBQC"&gt;A single shot of the Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 vaccine can prevent 85 percent of severe cases of the disease, the company &lt;a href="https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-single-shot-janssen-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-met-primary-endpoints-in-interim-analysis-of-its-phase-3-ensemble-trial"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt;. Overall, it is 66 percent effective against both moderate and severe cases of disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GQFwzA"&gt;“We’re 85 perfect effective at preventing severe disease, which we define as disease that makes you feel particularly sick at home, or may go to the hospital, or worse,” Mathai Mammen, global head of research and development at Johnson and Johnson, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/29/health/johnson-coronavirus-vaccine-results/index.html"&gt;told CNN&lt;/a&gt;. The company plans to file for emergency authorization next week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cT0gi0"&gt;The efficacy is lower than that of the two COVID-19 vaccines already authorized for use in the United States, which prevent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21569345/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-coronavirus-efficacy-announcement"&gt;about 95&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573072/pfizer-vaccine-effective-authorization-fda-safe"&gt;percent&lt;/a&gt; of symptomatic cases of COVID-19. Those vaccines each require two doses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="95YptH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T8KDdx"&gt;Johnson and Johnson ran its trial in the United States, Latin America, and South Africa. In the United States, the vaccine was 72 percent effective against moderate and severe COVID-19. But in South Africa, where a variant form of the coronavirus is widely circulating, the vaccine was 57 percent effective. Experts have been concerned that the variant, called B.1.351, is different enough from the original virus that vaccines created against the original might not work as well against it. This week, the pharmaceutical company Novavax also announced that its vaccine was &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/01/28/novavax-says-its-covid-19-vaccine-is-90-effective-but-far-less-so-against-one-variant/"&gt;less effective&lt;/a&gt; against B.1.351 than against other forms of the virus. The first cases of the variant in the US were identified this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7i5IKl"&gt;Still, the data from the Johnson and Johnson trial meets early benchmarks that the Food and Drug Administration set for a COVID-19 vaccine — the agency said last June that it would sign off on vaccines as long as they were at least &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/139638/download"&gt;50 percent effective&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vZdeaU"&gt;The Johnson and Johnson vaccine is made by inserting the gene from a snippet of the coronavirus into a harmless, weakened form of an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21266897/coronavirus-vaccine-development-strategies-pros-cons"&gt;adenovirus&lt;/a&gt;, which usually causes symptoms like pink eye or diarrhea. Then, the body produces copies of that virus snippet, and develops antibodies against it. It’s a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21266897/coronavirus-vaccine-development-strategies-pros-cons"&gt;different strategy&lt;/a&gt; than used by Pfizer / BioNTech and Moderna, which insert the genetic snippet &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/health/pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine.html"&gt;into an oily bubble instead&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FVhVgH"&gt;Even though the vaccine does not appear to work as well as the Pfizer / BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, experts say it could still be useful in the fight against COVID-19, particularly while supplies of the more effective vaccines are still limited. The Johnson and Johnson vaccine offers less of a logistical challenge than the other two, which have to be stored at ultra-cold temperatures and require two shots. This vaccine only takes one shot and can be stored in regular refrigerators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3wnCk7"&gt;Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at the University of Pennsylvania, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/29/health/johnson-coronavirus-vaccine-results/index.html"&gt;told CNN&lt;/a&gt; that he would take a Johnson and Johnson vaccine if it was available before he could get access to either the Pfizer / BioNTech or Moderna shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yVAbWV"&gt;The company is also testing a two-shot regime of it’s vaccine, which might bump up its efficacy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t11J6q"&gt;Johnson and Johnson received funding to develop its vaccine from the US as part of &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/08/05/hhs-dod-collaborate-with-johnson-and-johnson-to-produce-millions-of-covid-19-investigational-vaccine-doses.html"&gt;Operation Warp Speed&lt;/a&gt; and has an agreement to deliver &lt;a href="https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-agreement-with-u-s-government-for-100-million-doses-of-investigational-covid-19-vaccine"&gt;100 million doses&lt;/a&gt;. The company could ship about &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/j-j-covid-vaccine-supply-to-start-at-2-million-doses-gao-says?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;2 million doses&lt;/a&gt; as soon as it secures authorization from the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9NCCZp"&gt;Over &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations"&gt;26 million doses&lt;/a&gt; of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in the US so far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f2JoxW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Now is the best time to play the Yakuza series (on Xbox)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/meO6rQTwzHa3Sw8Xgr6vHelli64=/110x0:1291x787/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68739394/apps_1.46310.14037151017640712.b7408538_4c5c_44fa_98d0_4a876ebf3064.e4d2a38e_d900_4ace_9bcd_7a2dd5f8b739.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JMRXJH"&gt;For almost a decade and a half, the &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; franchise was all but exclusive to Sony’s PlayStation consoles. Other than a Japan-only Wii U remaster of the first two games, every single mainline entry or spinoff was released solely on the PlayStation 2, PSP, PS3, or PS4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pFIjT0"&gt;Then Microsoft came along. Along with &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; has slowly become a flagship Japanese series for Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass service. It all started under a year ago with the addition of &lt;em&gt;Yakuza 0&lt;/em&gt;, and as of this week you can play almost every mainline &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; game on Game Pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rCAFxk"&gt;Couple this with the fact that the next-gen version of &lt;em&gt;Yakuza: Like A Dragon&lt;/em&gt; is still exclusive to Xbox Series consoles, with a PS5 version not set to arrive until March, and the improbable conclusion is clear: Xbox — including the PC branch of the ecosystem — is now the easiest and best way to get into the series.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ODsMdudxzPLlw0m_ZyaT153z4Xg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22267736/apps_1.46310.14037151017640712.b7408538_4c5c_44fa_98d0_4a876ebf3064.e4d2a38e_d900_4ace_9bcd_7a2dd5f8b739.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Gix0dm"&gt;What’s changed this week is the addition of three new mainline &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; games. Remastered versions of &lt;em&gt;Yakuza 3&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;4&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;5&lt;/em&gt; are all now on Game Pass for Xbox and PC after getting a bundled PS4 release in 2019. (You can also buy the trio for $39.99.) These games originally all came out on the PS3, meaning they wouldn’t otherwise have been playable on modern systems through backwards compatibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kfyfU9"&gt;These aren’t particularly impressive ports on a technical level. Like most other &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; games on the Xbox, they run at 1080p and 60fps with little apparent benefit for the more powerful Xbox consoles. But honestly, given the aging source material, that’s perfectly fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aY2SqB"&gt;What matters is that you’ll be able to play almost the entire mainline &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; series for the price of a Game Pass subscription. And I definitely think you should do that, because this series is incredibly good. There’s really nothing like the way &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; blends brutal violence, goofy comedy, and incredible pathos in the context of a crime drama action RPG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HrmvyF"&gt;Without spoiling anything, here’s how I’d recommend getting into it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Xvv0Az"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Start with &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yakuza 0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Normally you’d want to play the first game in a series before tackling its prequel, but &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; is different. &lt;em&gt;0&lt;/em&gt; is set decades before &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt;, in bubble-era ‘80s Japan, and it’s widely considered to be one of the best in the series. It’s the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/19/14323874/yakuza-0-ps4-review"&gt;perfect place to start&lt;/a&gt;, and it’ll tell you all you need to know about the background for what’s to come. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AXzESW"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Next, play &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yakuza Kiwami&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. This is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/29/16220662/yakuza-kiwami-ps4-review"&gt;a full-on remake of the original &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which was released for the PS2 in 2005. &lt;em&gt;Kiwami&lt;/em&gt; came out shortly after &lt;em&gt;0&lt;/em&gt; and is technically very similar, with a bunch of narrative callbacks to the prequel, which is why it makes sense to play &lt;em&gt;0&lt;/em&gt; first. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TgnNGd"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Up next, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yakuza Kiwami 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Like &lt;em&gt;Kiwami&lt;/em&gt;, this is a remake of a PS2 game, 2006’s &lt;em&gt;Yakuza 2&lt;/em&gt;. But it moves to the PS4-era Dragon Engine, first seen in &lt;em&gt;Yakuza 6&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s a much bigger and more accomplished game than &lt;em&gt;Kiwami&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XY1oEg"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Now play &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yakuza 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. At this point I’m guessing you’re pretty into the series, so the prospect of three straight-up PS3 remasters won’t seem intimidating at all. I think &lt;em&gt;4&lt;/em&gt; is the best of these three games, but you’re going to want to get through all of them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YlLWln"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Wait for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yakuza 6: The Song of Life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; to come to Game Pass&lt;/strong&gt;. That won’t be too long a wait — it’s happening on March 25th. Or you could just play it on a PS4 before then. But make sure you do play it, either way, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/16/17242280/yakuza-6-song-of-life-review-ps4"&gt;because it’s wonderful&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kBEaFl"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Now it’s time for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yakuza: Like a Dragon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Otherwise known as &lt;em&gt;Yakuza 7 &lt;/em&gt;in Japan, I actually think you could start with this one too if you really just wanted to play the newest game. It’s very different to the others, with an all-new cast and turn-based battle system, and right now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21558093/yakuza-like-a-dragon-review-xbox-series-x"&gt;it’s best on the Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;. But you will get a little more out of it if you’ve played the other games in the series, so I’d hold off if you can. It’s also not on Game Pass — you’ll have to buy it separately. And as a final warning, it’s two or three times longer than most of the other games. (But worth it!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="GmXlEC"&gt;You may also want to play &lt;em&gt;Judgment&lt;/em&gt;, which is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/25/18744110/judgment-game-review-ps4-yakuza"&gt;pretty good spinoff&lt;/a&gt; set in the &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; Cinematic Universe, but it’s not important to the overall story and is still only on PS4. I’d slot it in after &lt;em&gt;6&lt;/em&gt; if you have the chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rZPoIf"&gt;The other &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; spinoffs aren’t really worth worrying about. There’s &lt;em&gt;Kenzan&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ishin&lt;/em&gt;, two separate samurai-era games that were never localized into English. That was also the case for the PSP-exclusive &lt;em&gt;Kurohyo&lt;/em&gt; and its sequel. And while &lt;em&gt;Dead Souls&lt;/em&gt;, a PS3 zombie shooter set on the streets of Tokyo, did make it out in the West, you’re better off pretending it never happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s8GN6F"&gt;I’ve been playing the &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; series from day one on the PS2, but back then I never imagined it’d get so expansive or accessible. I’d recommend these games to anyone, and the barrier to entry is so low now for anyone with an Xbox or a PC and a lot of spare time on their hands. If you haven’t gotten into the series yet, it might be the single best reason to subscribe to Game Pass.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood restricts crypto trading as Dogecoin soars 300 percent</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Dogecoin logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sc0PJ9qPkQa5b64rWsFPQnqx2OM=/21x0:539x345/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68739310/Dogecoin_logo.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4tTtSv"&gt;Robinhood has started restricting trading in cryptocurrencies this morning, just as the price of joke cryptocurrency Dogecoin has soared more than 300 percent in 24 hours. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/robinhood-restricts-crypto-trading-as-bitcoin-dogecoin-surge.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Robinhood users started noticing instant deposits for cryptocurrencies were no longer working on Friday morning, and the company has confirmed it has put restrictions in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RFvEex"&gt;“Due to extraordinary market conditions, we’ve temporarily turned off Instant buying power for crypto,” says a Robinhood spokesperson in a statement to CNBC. “Customers can still use settled funds to buy crypto. We’ll keep monitoring market conditions and communicating with our customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K0a1PJ-0zwLYBLw_09VUqQtfaQg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22267815/RlMpjva.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dogecoin price on Friday morning.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2q5Rcl"&gt;Dogecoin &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/29/5665470/dogecoin-has-its-day-the-unlikely-success-of-a-joke-cryptocurrency"&gt;came to life in 2013&lt;/a&gt; off the back of a Twitter joke — a play on bitcoin and &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/31/5248762/doge-meme-rescue-dog-wow"&gt;the doge meme&lt;/a&gt;. Its price started soaring yesterday, and Dogecoin currently stands at a more than &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/dogecoin"&gt;$7 billion market cap&lt;/a&gt; thanks to a huge volume of transactions over the past 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SojMbQ"&gt;The market activity and restrictions over the past 24 hours have now made Dogecoin a popular meme among the r/WallStreetBets investors. Dogecoin has been consistently spammed in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253892/discord-wallstreetbets-server-virtual-trade-floor-reddit"&gt;WallStreetBets Discord server&lt;/a&gt; over the past couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TlRaU"&gt;Bitcoin is also on the move, up nearly 20 percent over the past 24 hours. Tesla CEO Elon Musk also changed his Twitter profile to include #bitcoin and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1355068728128516101"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; “in retrospect, it was inevitable.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pgCwEKSp556jgViV-DbCf4Hf-qo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22267812/T8rYdhy.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elon Musk’s Twitter profile now mentions bitcoin.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VUnOgO"&gt;Robinhood’s latest crypto restrictions come less than a day after the company moved to restrict its users from buying or trading any of the popular &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;Reddit r/WallStreetBets stocks&lt;/a&gt;, including GameStop ($GME), AMC ($AMC), BlackBerry ($BB), Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond ($BBBY), Nokia ($NOK), and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GhN74y"&gt;It’s a move that has been met with widespread criticism, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255245/google-deleting-bad-robinhood-reviews-play-store"&gt;Google was forced to salvage Robinhood’s one-star rating&lt;/a&gt; on the Google Play Store by deleting nearly 100,000 negative reviews after unhappy users review-bombed the app. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255031/robinhood-gamestop-stop-purchases-reddit-wsb-stock-market"&gt;Robinhood says &lt;/a&gt;it will now allow “limited buys” of stocks like GameStop starting Friday. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla Roadster production delayed to 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vFXEt7Uckst77IpvcvQSR8dePtM=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68738962/Roadster_Hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Tesla&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ukmjax"&gt;Tesla CEO &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1354869981146738693"&gt;Elon Musk says&lt;/a&gt; production for the company’s upcoming Roadster isn’t due to begin until “next year,” roughly two years after the car was initially set to enter production. Tesla announced its $200,000 Roadster &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/17/16669024/tesla-roadster-2017-fastest-car-world"&gt;back in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, when Musk said the car would start being built in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FZSLRl"&gt;In a tweet, Musk suggested that work on the car’s “Tri-motor drive system &amp;amp; advanced battery work” were to blame for the delay. Musk says that Tesla hopes to finish engineering this year, and to have a “release candidate design drivable in late summer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="b02spe"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Finishing engineering this year, production starts next year. Aiming to have release candidate design drivable late summer. Tri-motor drive system &amp;amp; advanced battery work were important precursors.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1354869981146738693?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z7VDUZ"&gt;The hope, however, is that whenever it does arrive, the Roadster will be a vehicle with formidable specs. When it was announced, Musk said that Roadster would be able to hit 620 miles on a single charge, and hinted at a top speed in excess of 250 mph. He also said that its triple-motor drive system (which includes one electric motor in the front and two at the rear) will allow the car to accelerate from 0 to 60 in just 1.9 seconds, and from 0 to 100 in 4.2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dB18Kw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook reportedly plans newsletter tools after explosion in popularity</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IXXL_7-6WkblSIbXTh4vxzPu_OM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68738832/acastro_180522_facebook_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bXjWLC"&gt;Facebook is planning to offer newsletter tools for independent journalists and writers, &lt;a href="https://nyti.ms/36hBCTB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. These are thought to include features for helping writers build a following using the social network, curate their email lists, and manage their paid subscriptions. Although work on the project is in its early stages, executives reportedly hope the features could launch as soon as this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1QhuRK"&gt;The news comes as interest in newsletters is booming. Newsletter service Substack boasted over 250,000 paying subscribers across its service &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/pandemic-spurs-journalists-to-go-it-alone-via-email-613ca2d5-e8d5-4235-9582-48cc028e9d8b.html"&gt;as of September last year&lt;/a&gt;, and just this week &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250156/twitter-revue-newsletter-acquisition-email-service"&gt;Twitter acquired newsletter rival Revue&lt;/a&gt;. A number of high-profile journalists have left traditional publications to start up independent newsletters, lured by the promise of complete editorial control over their work and the ability to profit more directly from the subscription revenue it brings in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MqLIOF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We want to do more to support the independent journalists and experts who are building businesses and audiences online”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hMKZI6"&gt;Facebook has been attempting to better highlight news sources on its platform. Its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/9/21285656/facebook-news-tab-section-launch-us-local-publishers-partnership"&gt;News Tab&lt;/a&gt; is a section of the service featuring content from partnering media organizations, some of which are paid for the inclusion of their articles. While the News Tab has seen Facebook improve its relationship with traditional publishers, the newsletter tools are thought to be an attempt to court individual writers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5pKaXI"&gt;In a statement given to the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;, a spokesperson for Facebook didn’t directly confirm the report, but said the company is working on ways to support independent journalists. “We want to do more to support the independent journalists and experts who are building businesses and audiences online,” Facebook’s vice president for global news partnerships Campbell Brown said. “We’re exploring ways to help them benefit from the news products we’ve built, like Facebook News and subscriptions, while also building new tools to complement what journalists already find useful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ga2AxE"&gt;Given the explosion in the popularity of newsletters, it was only a matter of time before Facebook started exploring the area. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg reportedly told his team to make the project a priority after noticing the trend. But jumping onto the bandwagon is unlikely to go down well with Facebook’s critics. As &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/karaswisher/status/1355044530278567938"&gt;Kara Swisher put it in a tweet&lt;/a&gt;, “Does Facebook have one fresh idea or do they need to swipe them all?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JCsYw1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Signal adds mainstream chat features to lure wider audience</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration the Signal logo seen in the background of a silhouette hand holding a mobile phone." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jcEQ4AyHaakar8q2gQvAHxBEqrU=/0x1:5000x3334/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68738816/1230608869.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DouYvU"&gt;The latest version of Signal for both iOS (5.3.1) and Android (5.3.7) brings a number of new additions to the increasingly popular encrypted messaging app. These include mainstream features like chat wallpapers, animated stickers, and an “About” section in your profile. The iOS app now handles data more efficiently, too, bringing it closer to feature parity with the Android app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pTogdR"&gt;Messaging apps like Signal and Telegram have seen a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226792/whatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification"&gt;surge in growth&lt;/a&gt; in recent weeks. Signal was helped by a recommendation from Tesla CEO Elon Musk, while both benefited from the backlash to Facebook’s confusing new privacy policy for WhatsApp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kYCe93"&gt;The new features were first announced &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/signalapp/status/1348785240819466242"&gt;on January 11th&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; reported on them rolling out in the beta version of Signal for Android &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/01/22/signal-starts-catching-up-to-whatsapp-by-adding-custom-wallpapers-and-animated-stickers-apk-download/"&gt;last week Friday&lt;/a&gt;. With chat wallpapers, you can pick from a number of presets or select a photo of your own, and you can also set a wallpaper for a specific conversation or all of them. The beta had 24 animated stickers, according to &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRqVo1"&gt;The iOS app, meanwhile, is also more efficient with data. iPhone users will see a new setting to lower data usage during calls, an option to automatically pause attachment downloads during calls, and improved image compression among other enhancements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eqbi3B"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here's a sneak peek at some new Signal features that will start rolling out in a few days:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Chat wallpapers!&lt;br&gt;• About field for your Signal profile&lt;br&gt;• Animated stickers&lt;br&gt;• For iOS: Media auto-download settings and full-screen profile photos (to match Android)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good morning   ! &lt;a href="https://t.co/KEAbhMswRI"&gt;pic.twitter.com/KEAbhMswRI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Signal (@signalapp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/signalapp/status/1348785240819466242?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mlkElX"&gt;Signal has long been a popular messaging option for those focused on the security of their communications — the European Commission told staff to switch to Signal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21150918/european-commission-signal-encrypted-messaging"&gt;in February 2020&lt;/a&gt;, for example — and Signal is still focused on releasing new security-focused features, such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22175923/signal-video-calls-new-groups-five-people-max"&gt;encrypted group video calls&lt;/a&gt;. But more consumer-focused features like wallpapers and stickers could make Signal feel more approachable for users coming to the app from WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger, and, ideally, keep them on Signal over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi says its ‘Air Charge’ technology works over several meters</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F-sAPh7Ly0LkMErzbgevFocGK60=/47x0:554x338/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68738358/Lark20210129_110714.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RArVhf"&gt;Xiaomi has &lt;a href="https://blog.mi.com/en/2021/01/29/forget-about-cables-and-charging-stands-with-revolutionary-mi-air-charge-technology/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; “Mi Air Charge Technology,” a wireless charging system that the company claims is able to charge devices “within a radius of several meters.” Multiple devices can be charged at 5W at the same time, according to Xiaomi, and physical obstacles apparently don’t reduce charging efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kX2fpH"&gt;Xiaomi says the technology will also work with smartwatches and fitness bracelets. Another goal is to make “living rooms truly wireless,” with speakers, lamps, and smart home devices all being powered by the same remote system. A Xiaomi representative confirms to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, however, that no commercial products will include the technology this year, and declined to provide a timeframe for release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzrwjL"&gt;Here’s how Mi Air Charge Technology works, in Xiaomi’s words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="J40LtW"&gt;The core technology of Xiaomi’s remote charging lies in space positioning and energy transmission. Xiaomi’s self-developed isolated charging pile has five phase interference antennas built in, which can accurately detect the location of the smartphone. A phase control array composed of 144 antennas transmits millimeter-wide waves directly to the phone through beamforming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QDIHy0"&gt;On the smartphone side, Xiaomi has also developed a miniaturized antenna array with built-in “beacon antenna” and “receiving antenna array”. Beacon antenna broadcasts position information with low power consumption. The receiving antenna array composed of 14 antennas converts the millimeter wave signal emitted by the charging pile into electric energy through the rectifier circuit, to turn the sci-fi charging experience into reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Z4vsiv"&gt;Needless to say, you should be skeptical about the prospects of this technology making it to market until evidence suggests otherwise. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/4/14124938/energous-truly-wireless-charging-apple-ces-2017"&gt;Companies like Energous&lt;/a&gt; have been making announcements about “truly wireless charging” at CES and beyond for several years, but the technology is yet to gain serious traction. Xiaomi has demonstrated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21522730/xiaomi-mi-80w-wireless-charging-technology-announced"&gt;wireless charging engineering breakthroughs&lt;/a&gt; in the past, however, and has the advantage of owning a huge hardware ecosystem that it could theoretically leverage.&lt;/p&gt;
