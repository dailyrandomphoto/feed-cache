    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy Tab S7 FE is like a Tab S7 Plus without the high-refresh screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cwm-U9YgqP0NKUNMDjRqcuObNPQ=/128x0:2399x1514/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69335427/Screen_Shot_2021_05_24_at_10.34.20_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sB9UIL"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 FE (Fan Edition) could be officially launching soon according to &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/de/tablets/galaxy-tab-s/galaxy-tab-s7-fe-5g-black-64gb-5g-sm-t736bzkaeub/#benefits" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a new German product page&lt;/a&gt; spotted by &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,123088.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The tablet appears to be a renamed version of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356129/samsung-tab-a7-lite-tablet-leak-camera-specs-display-s7"&gt;the previously leaked “Galaxy Tab S7 Plus Lite”&lt;/a&gt; that first made the rounds in March 2021. The Galaxy Tab S7 FE is the first Fan Edition of one of Samsung’s tablets, a tweaked version of the earlier &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21444688/samsung-galaxy-tab-s7-plus-review"&gt;iPad Pro-inspired 12.4-inch Tab S7 Plus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AA5fpw"&gt;While the Tab S7 FE shares the same 12.4-inch screen size as the older Tab S7 Plus, it appears to be using a TFT LCD display, like the 11-inch Tab S7, rather than the OLED found in the Tab S7 Plus. Another cost-saving measure is found in the processor: the Tab S7 FE has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21449747/qualcomm-snapdragon-750g-5g-faster-cpu-gpu-ai-engine-smartphone-processor"&gt;a Snapdragon 750G&lt;/a&gt; octa-core processor and 4GB of RAM. For storage, the tablet comes with 64GB of UFS memory, which is partially used by the device’s One UI skinned version of Android 11, and expandable with a microSD card. The Tab S7 FE hangs on to the optional 5G support of its more expensive siblings.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8iwJg0K1HsfvNb29-tamgYYxNE0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22536507/Screen_Shot_2021_05_24_at_11.16.22_AM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Tab S7 Fan Edition with optional S Pen stylus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nqsnFB"&gt;If you happen to be a tablet photographer, the Tab S7 FE includes an 8-megapixel back camera and a 5-megapixel front camera. In a plus for anyone who’s complained about camera orientation on the iPad Pro, the Tab S7 FE’s front-facing camera is in landscape orientation, perfect for long Zoom calls. To get the device through those long calls, the FE has a 10,090mAh battery, which Samsung claims should last up to 12 hours on LTE (oddly, no estimate is given for 5G), and 13 hours specifically for video playback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FPLR8a"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10516396"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IXFYNY"&gt;The FE can come with an optional S Pen for note-taking tricks like converting handwriting to text. The tablet also has Samsung DeX, which can add Windows-esque interface elements like a taskbar, window-ing, and a “Start menu” automatically when you attach a keyboard. Whether any of those tablet features can elevate the FE into a true productivity device for you is harder to say. We found the Tab S7 and S7 Plus to still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21444688/samsung-galaxy-tab-s7-plus-review"&gt;work best for simpler tablet tasks&lt;/a&gt; like video watching and web browsing rather a whole day of work. Nothing about the Fan Edition suggests that will be different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yk1uaE"&gt;The Galaxy Tab S7 Fan Edition currently isn’t for sale in Germany (you can sign up to be notified when it’s available) and is priced at €649 (approximately $792) for either the silver or black version. That’s less than the typical price of a base Galaxy Tab S7 in Germany (€698) and for the larger screen size of a €979 S7 Plus. Should the Tab S7 FE come to the US, it will likely cost less than the rough conversion of the German price to US dollars. We’ve reached out to Samsung and will update if we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qp7wMI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; says Samsung has other colors and models with different specs in the works as well. We’ll keep an eye out for an official announcement in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Photos finally stops pretending its compressed photos are ‘high quality’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 4A" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A1__CshYHMMXPuvqDCZhAkprx8M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69335370/vpavic_4113_20200724_0090.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d2uhBl"&gt;Are you planning to stick with Google Photos &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21560810/google-photos-unlimited-cap-free-uploads-15gb-ending"&gt;when its free unlimited storage disappears on June 1st&lt;/a&gt;? If you’re anything like me, you’re probably still struggling to figure out whether you can afford to procrastinate that decision a little bit longer — and today, Google has made that reckoning &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/photos/4-things-know-about-google-photos-storage-policy-change/"&gt;a little bit easier&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NwSFlt"&gt;First off, the company’s finally telling it like it is: Google will no longer pretend its compressed, lower-quality photos and videos are “High quality,” something that would have saved me a lengthy explanation just last week! (After June 1st, existing Google Pixel phone owners still get unlimited “High quality” photos, but if you’re on, say, a Samsung or iPhone instead, it’s not like there was ever a “Normal quality” photo that doesn’t count against the new 15GB limit.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9jQt3b"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Bye “high,” hello “saver”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gkhdhp"&gt;Soon, “Storage saver” will be the name for Google’s normal-quality photos, formerly known as “High quality.” You’ll be able to upload at either the “Storage saver” or “Original quality” tiers, both of which will count against your storage quota, with “Original quality” using more data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rDk8WC"&gt;What if you’ve already got 10GB worth of Gmail and 2GB of documents stored in a Google Drive like yours truly, leaving just 3GB left for photos before you’ll need to pay? First off, know that your existing “High quality” photos before June 1st don’t count against the quota — but also, Google has a new tool to help you find and delete blurry photos and large videos to help you free up even more space.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TeJnROAVvnRDz_DBC8U554V2iqU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22536518/GooglePhotos_Blog_GIF01.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TByuV3"&gt;You can find it in the “Manage storage” section of the app, as you can see in the GIF above. It’ll also help you find and delete screenshots, though that’s been a feature of Google Photos for a while now. Google also promises to notify users who are nearing their quota, and you can &lt;a href="https://photos.google.com/storage"&gt;click here for a storage estimate&lt;/a&gt; if you’re logged into your account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtuXV3"&gt;Still confused, perhaps? I wouldn’t blame you; it took a while for me to get it all straight in my head, particularly considering that Google offers different levels of grandfathered free storage &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/photos/answer/6220791?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;amp;hl=en#zippy=%2Coriginal-quality%2Cexpress-backup%2Chigh-quality%2Cpixel%2Cpixel-a-"&gt;depending on which Pixel phone you own&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s an attempt to condense that info for you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="atK09r"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Everyone, including non-Pixel owners&lt;/strong&gt;: Anything you upload before June 1st, 2021, won’t count against your 15GB quota&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="i96ckK"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Pixel 3A, Pixel 4, Pixel 4A, Pixel 5: &lt;/strong&gt;You also still get unlimited free “Storage saver,” aka “High quality” images going forward, but &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; “Original quality”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="raLh86"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Pixel 3&lt;/strong&gt;: You still get unlimited free “Original quality” photos and videos &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; you upload them before January 1st, 2022, after which you get unlimited “Storage saver” going forward&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DVmW7o"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Pixel 2: &lt;/strong&gt;You got (past tense) unlimited free “Original quality” photos and videos &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; you uploaded them before January 16th, 2021, and you get unlimited “Storage saver” going forward&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dl47Mt"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Pixel (2016): &lt;/strong&gt;You get unlimited free “Original quality” photos and videos until your phone kicks the bucket&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="50OHrG"&gt;Future Google phones won’t have these perks: existing Pixels will be the last to come with free unlimited “High quality” uploads, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562908/google-future-pixel-phone-no-unlimited-photos-storage-confirmed"&gt;Google confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in November&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to choose a photo storage service</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google Photos on the Google Pixel" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gYXwhBgMRaP0gsWNtPB0Z6ePB8k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67778301/google_photos_vlad_savov.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q9HfSI"&gt;Last November, Google — which until now has offered unlimited storage for what it called “high quality” (read: compressed) photos — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21560810/google-photos-unlimited-cap-free-uploads-15gb-ending"&gt;announced that “unlimited” is being changed&lt;/a&gt; to “up to 15GB on your Google account.” (Oh, and “high quality” is being renamed “storage saver.”) In other words, while photo and video storage currently does not count against your total of 15 free gigs on a Google account, it will as of this coming June 1st — along with your Gmail, Google Drive files, and other stored data. Once you hit that 15GB wall, you will have to buy into the Google One service to increase your storage capacity. (Unless you own a Pixel 5 or earlier device, in which case you still have no limits on “high quality” photos.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTbl7b"&gt;If you’re a Google Photos user who finds all of this a bit irritating, you may be thinking of leaving. But first, it’s a good idea to check out your alternatives. Below are some of the main photo storage services available to you, along with their basic fees, so you can figure out whether you want to switch. (Note: We’ve only included services that are specifically geared toward photos, not more general storage services such as OneDrive or Dropbox.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="chKhYl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://photos.google.com/"&gt;Google Photos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google Photos" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vXH35MCZPB-qOWTZMXZFKj3STjc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504078/Screen_Shot_2021_05_10_at_9.57.42_AM__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Photos&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qoZVjQ"&gt;Google provides each of its accounts with 15GB of free storage. However, for the last few years, photos have been treated differently: under its “high quality” plan, Google stored an unlimited number of photos for free as long as you allow them to be compressed to 16 megapixels. (According to Google, photos that size can be printed without issue up to 24 x 16 inches.) Videos were kept to a maximum of 1080p. (Data such as closed captions could be eliminated to save space.) “Original quality” photos — those that were not compressed — were not part of this unlimited plan but were counted as regular files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r5YwJy"&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/photos/4-things-know-about-google-photos-storage-policy-change/"&gt;all of that is changing&lt;/a&gt;. As mentioned above, starting on June 1st, 2021, Google will be including photos in its storage calculations. Once you hit that 15GB ceiling, you will have to buy into the &lt;a href="https://one.google.com/about"&gt;Google One service&lt;/a&gt; for additional storage space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DVXGQL"&gt;Google One currently starts at 100GB of storage for $1.99 a month ($19.99 a year) and proceeds to 200GB for $2.99 a month ($29.99 a year) or 2TB for $9.99 a month ($99.99 a year). The 2TB plan also comes with a VPN for Android phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LxaryX"&gt;Before you run to invest in Google One, be aware that there are several mitigating factors Google is offering its users. When the new plan goes into effect, that is when the clock starts; photos you uploaded before then won’t count toward your 15GB limit. Also, if you own a Pixel 5 or earlier model phone, then you can continue to upload “high-quality” / “storage saver” photos without affecting your 15GB limit. (Of course, Pixel owners used to get unlimited “original quality” photos for free. But hey, it’s something.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rtZGxP"&gt;Google is rolling out some tools to help confused users, including one that &lt;a href="https://photos.google.com/storage"&gt;estimates how much time you have left&lt;/a&gt; before you have to purchase more storage space (based on previous usage), and one that will help you discard blurry photos, too-large videos, and other items that may take up space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qTIED4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.icloud.com/photos"&gt;iCloud Photos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="iCloud Photos" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OhHlPR3hHSzYXLHM4BHWLPypgyw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22045506/Screen_Shot_2020_11_16_at_9.50.00_AM__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iCloud Photos&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gIMWLM"&gt;If you’re part of Apple’s ecosystem, then you have easy access to iCloud Photos, Apple’s equivalent to Google Photos. iCloud Photos is connected to the Phone app on your Mac or iOS device as a backup for your photos. You automatically get 5GB of storage space associated with your iCloud account; after that, it costs 99 cents per month for 50GB, $2.99 per month for 200GB, and $9.99 per month for 2TB. (This is for the US; &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201238"&gt;other countries have different fees&lt;/a&gt;.) Windows users can also access iCloud Photos via an &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204283"&gt;associated app&lt;/a&gt;; Android users will have to access it using a browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yZr3Oh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/"&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Flickr page" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rs5L-CTH_oyitP0u2yut9q5965c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13692625/flickr_interface.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flickr&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0WoADA"&gt;Flickr has a free plan as well, but it’s limited to 1,000 photos — within certain guidelines: photo files are limited to 200MB and video files to 1GB. For &lt;a href="https://help.flickr.com/pricing-faq-r1qHsTEbU"&gt;unlimited storage without ads&lt;/a&gt;, you pay either $6.99 a month or $59.99 annually (plus tax). Other advantages to a paid annual membership include stats about which of your photos are trending and a variety of discounts from several companies, including Adobe and SmugMug (which is now part of Flickr). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BrJgci"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.smugmug.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21561171%2Fphoto-storage-service-google-amazon-flickr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SmugMug&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Smugmug" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8w07DX4OmmluqYJWke4hyZfYgMg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22032766/smugmug.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: SmugMug&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SmugMug&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mH6JCv"&gt;Speaking of SmugMug, this long-lasting service is also available, offering storage, portfolios, and sales opportunities for professionals. For $55 a year or $7 a month, you get unlimited uploads and a customizable website. The Power plan ($85 a year or $11 monthly) adds site customization and your own domain name. If you’re looking to be a professional photographer, the Portfolio plan adds e-commerce features for $200 a year or $27 a month (you keep 85 percent of the markup). And finally, the Pro plan lets you create events, price lists, and branded orders, among other features, for $360 a year or $42 a month. If you’re interested in trying it out, you can get a two-week trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="m3pftc"&gt;&lt;a href="https://500px.com/"&gt;500px&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="500px" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OvSPHukZyZ_L03o3HavAkQfYvd8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22045546/500px_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: 500px&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;500px&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YKFo5I"&gt;Canadian company 500px is actually more for professional photographers than your average snap-and-save picture taker. It offers pros a place to store, exhibit, and license their work. So if you have ambitions to start peddling your photos, 500px may be worth checking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0oJbxb"&gt;The site offers two paid plans. The first, modestly named Awesome, offers unlimited uploads, priority support, no ads, a history of “liked” photos, gallery slideshows, and a profile badge for $59.88 a year or $4.99 monthly. The Pro plan adds a way to display your services and organization tools for $119.88 a year or $9.99 monthly. (You get a discount on your first year: Awesome costs $47.88 a year or $3.99 monthly, while Pro goes for $71.88 a year or $5.99 monthly.) And if you want to make a bit of money, you can submit your photos to be licensed for stock usage through 500px. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="67i7IV"&gt;There is a free ad-supported plan that gives you seven uploads a week. When you sign up, you can try out the Pro plan for two weeks before committing yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZgbkNT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://app.photobucket.com/explore"&gt;Photobucket&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Fui9Kk"&gt;Photobucket offers a limited free plan, allowing you to upload up to 250 photos for free — more a trial plan than anything else. If you like what you see, you can start with the Beginner plan at $5.99 per month or $64.68 annually, which gives you 25GB of storage, along with no ads, password-protected album sharing, and an image editor. For $7.99 per month or $86.28 annually, the Intermediate plan provides 250GB of storage and unlimited image hosting. Finally, for $12.99 per month or $140.28 annually, the Expert plan offers unlimited storage and no image compression, among other extras. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;DeviantArt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="z7uIFC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.deviantart.com/"&gt;DeviantArt&lt;/a&gt; calls itself “the world’s largest art community” with a social network for visual artists of all kinds. It offers visitors a wide range of artist galleries to view, divided into categories such as traditional, animation, and illustrations. DeviantArt (or DA for short) even has its own publishing platform called Sta.sh — emphasizing the fact that this site, like 500px, is less for simple storage and more for showing (and selling) your art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7YBRVT"&gt;With a free membership in DeviantArt, there are no restrictions on how much you upload for public access, and you get admission to DA’s community of artists and art lovers. &lt;a href="https://www.deviantart.com/core-membership/"&gt;Core Members enjoy additional perks&lt;/a&gt;. For $3.95 a month or $39.95 a year, you get to sell your art with no service fee (but a 20 percent fee on Premium Gallery &amp;amp; Premium download sales) and a $100 max price per digital item, along with 20GB of private storage space in Sta.sh. For $7.95 a month or $79.95 a year, you can charge up to $1,000 per item and pay a 12 percent fee on Premium Gallery &amp;amp; Premium download sales, along with 30GB of private storage. Finally, $14.95 a month or $149.95 a year lets you charge up to $10,000 per item, lowers your fee to 10 percent fee per sale, and gets you 50GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="iBQOi3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/photos/storage"&gt;Amazon Photos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Amazon Photos" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uyGvuT12uD0xtAZPBYAG3hjy6Tw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504092/Screen_Shot_2021_05_10_at_10.58.40_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon Photos&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FRZOow"&gt;Amazon provides its Prime members with a grab bag of extras along with the free shipping. In addition to the video offerings, music streaming, and other goodies, you get &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/photos"&gt;unlimited photo storage&lt;/a&gt; for $119 a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FzQzPt"&gt;A nice perk is that you can share that unlimited storage with five friends or family members in what is called the Family Vault. Everything there is accessible to everyone who shares the Vault. “Unlimited,” by the way, does not include videos or other files; for those, Prime members get 5GB of storage, and after that, there is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/photos/storage/plans"&gt;a long list of storage plans&lt;/a&gt; available starting from $1.99 a month for 100GB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jZJVY1"&gt;That’s something to keep in mind if you drop your Prime membership. In that case, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=201480950"&gt;according to the Amazon instructions&lt;/a&gt;, “the unlimited photo storage benefits associated with the membership end. All uploaded photos count toward your Amazon Drive storage limit.” The total storage for non-Prime members (stills and video) is 5GB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nIl4Rl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdegoo.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21561171%2Fphoto-storage-service-google-amazon-flickr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Degoo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bZluEe"&gt;Unlike 500px and DeviantArt, which are tailored more toward professional creators, Degoo is geared toward the everyday photographer who uses images to make memories. In fact, the site touts its AI engine, which it says will “show you the best moments of your life.” To that end, its free ad-based version provides 100GB of storage; you can view or download photos on an unlimited number of devices but only upload from three. You also have to access your account at least every 90 days to keep it active. Paid accounts include Pro ($2.99 / month), which removes the ads and time limit and gives you 500GB of storage, and Ultimate ($9.99 / month), which gives you a whopping 10TB.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk called lidar a ‘crutch,’ but now Tesla is reportedly testing Luminar’s laser sensors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x70vRVQhXl2DuRlKlGYm_xN0b4g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69335101/acastro_180524_1777_tesla_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MYDxVn"&gt;A Tesla Model Y was photographed in Florida sporting rooftop lidar sensors made by buzzy sensor manufacturer Luminar. The sighting caused a bit of a stir among Tesla watchers, given Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s well-established disdain for the laser sensors commonly used by autonomous vehicle companies to create 3D maps of their environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sjfeGd"&gt;Even more notably, Tesla has reportedly entered a partnership with Luminar to use lidar for “testing and developing,” &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-24/tesla-testing-luminar-laser-sensor-musk-called-fool-s-errand?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. What exactly this partnership entails we don’t know for sure — neither company is commenting. But it could point to some shortcomings in the technology Tesla is using to power its “Full Self-Driving” driver assist feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RB5XIZ"&gt;The vehicle was spotted last week in Palm Beach, Florida, by Grayson Brulte, a consultant for the AV industry who lives in the area. After Brulte tweeted the photos of the Model Y with a rooftop rack of lidar sensors on May 20th, Luminar’s stock surged to its highest level yet. (The Florida-based company recently went public after being acquired by a “blank check” special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TrxEnU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Spotted in Palm Beach, Florida. A &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Tesla?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Tesla&lt;/a&gt; Model Y with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LiDAR?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#LiDAR&lt;/a&gt; and CA Manufacturing (MFG) Plates. Can anyone offer details/insights? &lt;a href="https://t.co/5Uh4WU0U41"&gt;pic.twitter.com/5Uh4WU0U41&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Grayson Brulte (@gbrulte) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gbrulte/status/1395356317410287617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vfYLQL"&gt;Luminar sold the lidar to Tesla as part of an agreement between the two companies, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. Also, the Model Y was sporting a manufacturer’s license plate that is registered to Tesla in California. The same plate has been spotted on other Tesla vehicles, including a prototype of the Cybertruck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1JgYEV"&gt;It’s unlikely that Tesla will reverse its position on lidar based on a single vehicle. As Guidehouse’s Sam Abuelsamid told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, it’s more likely that Tesla is using Luminar’s lidar to validate its Full Self-Driving feature. But it’s still a noteworthy development given Musk’s vocal animosity toward the sensor. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/7/16988628/elon-musk-lidar-self-driving-car-tesla"&gt;In a 2018 earnings call&lt;/a&gt;, Musk said, “In my view, it’s a crutch that will drive companies to a local maximum that they will find very hard to get out of.” He added, “Perhaps I am wrong, and I will look like a fool. But I am quite certain that I am not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="z43CvF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Perhaps I am wrong, and I will look like a fool. But I am quite certain that I am not.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mP3y8d"&gt;Then a year later, he called lidar “a fool’s errand” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/24/18512580/elon-musk-tesla-driverless-cars-lidar-simulation-waymo"&gt;during a presentation on Tesla’s efforts to build fully autonomous vehicles&lt;/a&gt;. “[A]nyone relying on LIDAR is doomed,” he added. “Doomed. Expensive sensors that are unnecessary. It’s like having a whole bunch of expensive appendices... you’ll see.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3xWvu1"&gt;Musk said Tesla is trying to tackle a much bigger problem: passive optical recognition. This is why Tesla is banking on cameras as the key piece of hardware for autonomous vehicles. With their ever-increasing pixel resolution and the low price point, camera sensors are seen as indispensable for advanced driver assistance systems (like Tesla’s Autopilot) and fully autonomous systems. For Tesla, cameras are everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z9feS5"&gt;Musk also walked back some of those comments in recent months. In a chat on Clubhouse, Musk admitted to “talking smack” about lidar but noted that SpaceX — his other company — has developed its own versions of the laser sensors to assist the Dragon capsule. In a recent earnings call, Musk spoke about moving away from using radar, stating, “We believe that a vision-only system is ultimately all that is needed for full autonomy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UvzjKg"&gt;Luminar, which is based in Florida, went &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/24/21398974/luminar-lidar-startup-spac-ipo-reverse-merge-blank-check"&gt;public last year via a reverse merger&lt;/a&gt; with a SPAC. That merger valued the company at approximately $2.9 billion in “implied pro forma enterprise value,” with an equity value of $3.4 billion at closing. Luminar is also working with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22424726/pony-ai-luminar-lidar-robotaxi-california-china"&gt;Pony.ai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22399389/luminar-airbus-lidar-aviation-evtol-partnership"&gt;Airbus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21248415/volvo-luminar-lidar-self-driving-highway-pilot-spa2"&gt;Volvo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/18/18144506/audi-self-driving-car-volkswagen-luminar-lidar"&gt;Audi&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/27/16373058/toyota-research-institute-self-driving-car-luminar"&gt;Toyota Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton is planning a new $400 million factory in Ohio</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A runner trains on the Peloton Tread." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W0l8rUhF3RAbS8rLfExbZR9nCNk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69335093/akrales_190328_3240_0158.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zjp6Bh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/24/peloton-to-invest-400-million-on-first-us-production-facility-in-ohio.html"&gt;Peloton has announced plans&lt;/a&gt; to invest $400 million in a US factory to produce its connected bikes and treadmills, located in Troy Township, Ohio — about half an hour south of Toledo. The facility, which is planned to be approximately a million square feet, is called the Peloton Output Park. Peloton &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-24/peloton-to-open-ohio-factory-in-2023-to-build-bikes-treadmills?utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_content=tech&amp;amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-tech&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;hopes it will eventually lead to lower prices&lt;/a&gt; for its products, though its CEO John Foley admits that could take a few years to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NBd6m5"&gt;Currently, Peloton mainly manufactures its fitness equipment in Taiwan, while many of its customers are in the US. This caused &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266121/peloton-shipping-delays-earnings-q4-2020"&gt;expensive shipping delays&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year as the company ran into both &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/24/peloton-to-invest-400-million-on-first-us-production-facility-in-ohio.html"&gt;heightened demand&lt;/a&gt; and long shipping times resulting from the pandemic. The company’s factory announcement is also colored by the shadow of its safety struggles and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423745/peloton-recall-timeline-tread-plus-john-foley"&gt;subsequent recall of its treadmill&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421329/peloton-api-bug-customer-data-exposed"&gt;potential data leak&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XHNFtg"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y58nqXNrFH4?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BZYG4U"&gt;US-based manufacturing ventures are a reliable way for tech companies to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22241646/apple-tim-cook-gave-the-first-mac-pro-to-trump"&gt;generate positive press&lt;/a&gt;, and they can sometimes struggle to live up to the hype. Recent examples include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump"&gt;Foxconn’s infamous plant in Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/20/20974999/trump-is-lying-about-the-new-apple-factory"&gt;“new” “Apple” factory&lt;/a&gt;, which then-president Donald Trump bragged about, that was neither new, nor operated by Apple. For its part, Peloton is promising 2,000 new jobs coming to a reasonably rural area, but the proof will be in the actual Pelotons rolling out from the Ohio factory, which the company says is planned for 2023. According to &lt;a href="https://www.onepeloton.com/press/articles/peloton-pop-announcement"&gt;its announcement post&lt;/a&gt;, the company is currently working with local and state partners to finalize plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="By8KD2"&gt;The Ohio factory may not be the first producing Peloton equipment in the US: the company purchased fitness equipment maker Precor late last year, which has factories in Washington and North Carolina. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266121/peloton-shipping-delays-earnings-q4-2020"&gt;Peloton reportedly hopes&lt;/a&gt; to start building some equipment in those factories by the end of this year. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uFiP3s"&gt;Apple is releasing its latest iOS 14.6 update today, and it’s largely focused on audio improvements. This new OS update will allow Apple Music subscribers to enable lossless audio or Dolby Atmos &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440090/apple-music-lossless-audio-dolby-atmos-support-audio"&gt;once it’s available next month&lt;/a&gt;, and it also debuts Apple Podcasts subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wnw8CA"&gt;Podcasts users can now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22381980/apple-podcasts-app-subscriptions-new-design"&gt;subscribe to content&lt;/a&gt; in the app for extra perks like ad-free and bonus content, as well as early access. Apple is also improving the Podcasts app with the ability to mark all episodes as played, recover old episodes, and remove downloads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c6cqHT"&gt;iOS 14.6 includes a number of other quality-of-life improvements. If you’re an AirTag owner, iOS 14.6 includes the option to add an email address as a contact method for when the item tracker is in lost mode. There’s also Apple Card Family sharing, with support for up to five people to share an Apple Card for purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a8fYXO"&gt;As always, this latest version of iOS also includes some fixes and security improvements. Apple has fixed an issue with the Apple Watch not unlocking an iPhone correctly, problems with reminders as blank lines, call blocking extensions not appearing in settings, reduced iPhone performance during startup, and Bluetooth issues during calls.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q6vVoU"&gt;Qualcomm has announced a second-generation Snapdragon 7c Arm-powered processor that’s designed to be used inside entry-level Windows PCs and Chromebooks. The biggest change to the Snapdragon 7c Gen 2 (the official name) appears to be a clock speed bump, which &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16696/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-7c-gen-2-entrylevel-pc-and-chromebook-refresh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anandtech&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; is a jump from 2.4GHz to 2.55GHz. And like the original Snapdragon 7c, it offers integrated LTE connectivity so you can connect to cellular networks, and Qualcomm promises it will support “multi-day battery life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A9V1Sd"&gt;The first device with the chip is set to arrive “this summer,” &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2021/05/24/qualcomm-expands-compute-portfolio-snapdragon-7c-gen-2-compute-platform"&gt;Qualcomm said in a press release&lt;/a&gt;, and Lenovo has already promised to release new devices using the 7c Gen 2 “later this year.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vLwf7E"&gt;More chipmakers are increasingly making Arm-based chips, which promise better performance and power efficiency. The first Snapdragon 7c was only used in a handful of Chromebooks, so we’ll have to see if this new chip offers enough to get more device-makers on board, but Lenovo’s commitment to make devices with the chip this year is a promising sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MdacqQ"&gt;Qualcomm is also going up against Apple and its powerful M1 chip, which you can now find in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Airs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;Mac Minis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review"&gt;iMacs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;iPad Pros&lt;/a&gt;. Those devices are all more expensive than the type of machine the Snapdragon 7c Gen 2 is targeted for, however, and it’s possible Qualcomm’s new chip could bring some of the benefits of Arm-based processors to lower-cost (and non-Apple) devices.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Florida governor signs law to block ‘deplatforming’ of Florida politicians</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Florida Governor, Ron DeSantis speaks at a press conference..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JApTClDS6pnTN222tY0lBVll9nI=/0x169:4200x2969/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69334687/1231882337.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EKZG3K"&gt;Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill Monday that bars social media companies like Twitter and Facebook from “knowingly” deplatforming politicians. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aEBGKq"&gt;The bill, SB 7072, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22413934/florida-bill-restrict-social-media-politicians-twitter-facebook-disney-trump"&gt;was proposed in February&lt;/a&gt;, weeks after former President Donald Trump was banned from Facebook and Twitter after the deadly right-wing riot at the US Capitol. The law bars social media platforms from banning Floridian political candidates and authorizes the Florida Election Commission to impose fines if these candidates were to be deplatformed. The fines range from $250,000 per day for statewide office candidates and $25,000 per day for non-statewide offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FMVRQA"&gt;“This will lead to more speech, not less speech,” DeSantis said during a press conference at the Florida International University in Miami Monday. “Because speech that’s inconvenient to the narrative will be protected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JiwDeO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Many are already skeptical about the new law’s legality”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PZRc1o"&gt;Many are already skeptical about the new law’s legality, with the tech-friendly Chamber of Progress calling it “clearly unconstitutional.” As a state law, the measure could be overturned if courts find it conflicts with Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which broadly immunizes platforms from liability for good-faith moderation activity. It could also be subject to a constitutional challenge under the First Amendment, which has been interpreted to broadly prevent government interference to corporate speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jpWeRg"&gt;But regardless of its legal status, the measure will help establish DeSantis’ political bona-fides among the anti-tech wing of the Republican Party. For years, Republicans have pressured platforms like Facebook over their content moderation policies, accusing the companies of being biased against conservative speech online. DeSantis’ bill is one of the first major victories for populist Republicans in opposition to the power of Big Tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8F2GSU"&gt;Carl Szabo, the vice president and general counsel for NetChoice, a trade group representing large tech companies like Facebook and Amazon, argued that the law could be found to be unconstitutional. “The First Amendment prohibits the government from compelling or controlling speech on private websites,” said Szabo. “If this law could somehow be enforced, it would allow lawful but awful user posts including pornography, violence, and hate speech that will make it harder for families to safely navigate online.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bzI1sp"&gt;Earlier this month, Facebook’s Oversight Board &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22320329/facebook-oversight-board-trump-ban-decision"&gt;upheld the platform’s ban&lt;/a&gt; on Trump but called on the company to create new rules on imposing permanent suspensions. Facebook has six months to write this new policy and decide whether Trump should be allowed back on Facebook-owned social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XRgXTi"&gt;“This session, we took action to ensure that ‘We the People’ — real Floridians across the Sunshine State — are guaranteed protection against the Silicon Valley elites,” DeSantis said. “If Big Tech censors enforce rules inconsistently, to discriminate in favor of the dominant Silicon Valley ideology, they will now be held accountable.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Police in India raid Twitter offices in probe of tweets with ‘manipulated media’ label</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mtb9bjY1kU4otCZpaenkLAo6ZeE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69334612/acastro_180827_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZxMp64"&gt;Police in India raided the offices of Twitter India in Delhi and Gurgaon on Monday as part of an investigation into why tweets about a so-called “toolkit” of information about the coronavirus were labeled as manipulated media,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/twitter-india-delhi-police-raid-7328607/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Indian Express&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. An officer told the media outlet that police had sent a notice to Twitter demanding an explanation for the label on a ruling party member’s tweet, and that it was seeking “information Twitter has about the toolkit and why they chose to give the ‘manipulated media’ label.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="15Q5Vb"&gt;Twitter declined to comment Monday. &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/delhi-police-run-by-indias-central-government-raids-twitter-offices-over-manipulated-label/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that there were no Twitter employees in the offices at the time of the raid, which occurred late Monday evening India Standard Time. Journalist Aditya Raj Kaul tweeted that Twitter employees in India are currently working remotely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Johr7N"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Delhi Police Special Cell team returns from Gurgaon after they find the Twitter India offices shut. Apparently there is work from home at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterIndia?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TwitterIndia&lt;/a&gt; since March last year. Was this move by Government to send out a message? &lt;a href="https://t.co/aCBfjhb5CC"&gt;pic.twitter.com/aCBfjhb5CC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Aditya Raj Kaul (@AdityaRajKaul) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AdityaRajKaul/status/1396846575318495237?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="68PiW7"&gt;On Friday, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447379/twitter-india-covid19-politician-tweets-manipulated-media"&gt;Indian government sent a notice to Twitter&lt;/a&gt; two days after the social media platform &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1395714092837457931?s=20"&gt;applied the “manipulated media” label&lt;/a&gt; to a tweet by Sambit Patra, of India’s ruling BJP party. Patra said in the tweet, which appears to have been removed, that the opposition party Congress had used a “toolkit” in attempts to undermine the government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. The &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/india-twitter-politicians-tweets-manipulated/"&gt;government asked Twitter to remove the label&lt;/a&gt; out of “fairness and equity.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gKkB36"&gt;The BJP party says the Congress party created the toolkit to damage Prime Minister Narendra Modi, according to the &lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/what-is-the-congress-toolkit-controversy-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/82761578.cms"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Times of India&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but the Congress party claims the version of the toolkit the BJP shared was a falsified version of a research note about an unrelated project. &lt;a href="https://www.altnews.in/covid-toolkit-attributed-to-congress-created-on-forged-letterhead/"&gt;Indian fact-checking organization &lt;em&gt;Alt News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that the images of the so-called “COVID toolkit” that Patra and others tweeted about did have some falsified information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AmNwcM"&gt;Twitter &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/new-approach-to-synthetic-and-manipulated-media.html"&gt;introduced its manipulated media policy&lt;/a&gt; last February, which applies to media shared on its platform that has been “significantly and deceptively altered or fabricated.” Video clips or images that have been altered to change their meaning or context could get a label, and false content presented as true or content found to be “likely to impact public safety or cause serious harm” could be removed entirely under the rules. Twitter applied the label to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296518/twitter-trump-video-manipulated-media-deepfake-carpe-donktum"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/06/18/trump-tweet-label-video/"&gt;tweets&lt;/a&gt; by former US President Donald Trump, who has since been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;banned from the platform&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2RDUdx"&gt;India’s government has tried to keep tight control over information on social media concerning the spread of COVID-19. Last month, the government &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/24/22400976/twitter-removed-tweets-critical-india-censor-coronavirus"&gt;ordered Twitter to remove tweets&lt;/a&gt; and told &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/27/991343032/indias-government-is-telling-facebook-twitter-to-remove-critical-posts"&gt;Facebook and Instagram to take down posts&lt;/a&gt; that were critical of its handling of the pandemic. And in March, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/india-threatens-jail-for-facebook-whatsapp-and-twitter-employees-11614964542"&gt;India’s government threatened to jail&lt;/a&gt; Facebook, WhatsApp, and Twitter employees in the country if they failed to comply with its requests to take down content about protests by farmers. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/10/technology/india-twitter.html"&gt;Twitter ended up permanently blocking&lt;/a&gt; more than 500 accounts and removing others from being visible within the country following a notice of noncompliance from the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vGyO25"&gt;According to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, &lt;a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/region/india"&gt;India reported&lt;/a&gt; 222,315 new cases of COVID-19 and 4,454 new deaths on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s new tool will identify skin conditions — what will people do with that information? </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IsnxvL2Gqo42yZYLNTDn5Asp4X4=/162x0:1935x1182/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69334574/Copy_of_derm___hero_image_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nI94jm"&gt;Google announced last Tuesday that it developed a new artificial intelligence tool to help people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440754/google-health-ai-skin-condition-model-dermatology"&gt;identify skin conditions&lt;/a&gt;. Like any other symptom-checking tool, it’ll face questions over how accurately it can perform that task. But experts say it should also be scrutinized for how it influences people’s behavior: does it make them more likely to go to the doctor? Less likely?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="znOmzX"&gt;These types of symptom-checking tools — which usually clarify that they can’t diagnose health conditions but can give people a read on what might be wrong — have proliferated over the &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/351/bmj.h3480"&gt;past decade&lt;/a&gt;. Some have &lt;a href="https://ictandhealth.com/news/symptom-checkers-will-see-you-now-startups-race-to-create-a-perfect-health-concierge/"&gt;millions of users&lt;/a&gt; and are valued at &lt;a href="https://mercomcapital.com/your-md-raises-30-million-for-digital-symptom-checker-app/"&gt;tens of millions of dollars&lt;/a&gt;. Dozens popped up over the past year to help people check to see if they might have COVID-19 (including one &lt;a href="https://landing.google.com/screener/covid19?source=google"&gt;by Google&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nHLoaN"&gt;Despite their growth, there’s little information available about how symptom-checkers change the way people manage their health. It’s not the type of analysis companies usually do before launching a product, says Jac Dinnes, a senior researcher at the University of Birmingham’s Institute of Applied Health Research who has evaluated smartphone apps for skin conditions. They focus on the answers the symptom-checkers give, not the way people respond to those answers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fyOykc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You don’t know what the impact is going to be”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OBv7F2"&gt;“Without actually evaluating the tools as they’re intended to be used, you don’t know what the impact is going to be,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="vWdJ15"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Filling in a knowledge gap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Z9dcLw"&gt;Google’s dermatology tool is designed to let people upload three photos of a skin issue and answer questions about symptoms. Then, it offers a list of possible conditions that the artificial intelligence-driven system thinks are the best matches. It shows textbook images of the condition and prompts users to then search the condition in Google. Users have the option to save the case to review it later or delete it entirely. The company aims to launch a pilot version &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440754/google-health-ai-skin-condition-model-dermatology"&gt;later this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="irtb1z"&gt;It also may introduce ways for people to continue research on a potential problem outside the tool itself, a Google spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MXuvLE"&gt;When developing artificial intelligence tools like the new Google program, researchers tend to evaluate the accuracy of the machine learning program. They want to know exactly how well it can match an unknown thing, like an image of a strange rash someone uploads, with a known problem. Google hasn’t published data on the latest iteration of its dermatology tool, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440754/google-health-ai-skin-condition-model-dermatology"&gt;the company says&lt;/a&gt; it includes an accurate match to a skin problem in the top three suggested conditions 84 percent of the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9QXK7"&gt;There’s typically less focus on what users do with that information. This makes it hard to tell if a tool like this could actually meet one of its stated goals: to give people access to information that might take some of the load off dermatologists who are stretched thin all over the world. “There’s no doubt that there’s such a huge demand for dermatologists,” Dinnes says. “There’s a desire to use tools that are perceived as helping the situation, but we don’t actually know if they’re going to help.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="uYJOGP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s a desire to use tools that are perceived as helping the situation, but we don’t actually know if they’re going to help.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xvGR2U"&gt;It’s a big gap in our understanding, says Hamish Fraser, an associate professor of medical science at Brown University who studies symptom-checkers. “In addition to the basic problem of whether people can even interpret the systems correctly and use them correctly, there’s also this question about whether people will actually respond to anything that is fed back to them from the system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V5oCcB"&gt;Filling that gap is key as more and more of these tools come onto the market, Fraser says. “There are more and more emerging technologies.” Understanding how they could change people’s behavior is so important because their role in healthcare will likely grow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qo2omm"&gt;“People are already voting with their feet, in terms of using Google and other search engines to check symptoms and look up diseases,” Fraser says. “There’s obviously a need there.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="NVZRHA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do people do next? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="RnBfiN"&gt;Ideally, Fraser says, future&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;studies would ask people using a symptom-checker for permission to follow up and ask what they did next or ask for permission to contact their doctor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9RWPf"&gt;“You would start to very quickly get a sense as to whether a random sample of millions of people using it got something from the system that related to what was actually going on, or what their family doctor said, or whether they went to the emergency department,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4K1D3"&gt;One of the &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2757995"&gt;few studies&lt;/a&gt; that have asked some of these questions followed up with around 150,000 people who used a virtual medical chatbot called Buoy Health. Researchers checked how likely people said they were to go to the doctor before using the bot and how likely they were to go to the doctor after they saw what the bot had to say. Around a third of people said they would seek less urgent care — maybe wait to see a primary care doctor rather than go to the emergency room. Only 4 percent said they would take more urgent steps than before they used the chatbot. The rest stayed around the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CAcUWq"&gt;It’s only one study, and it evaluates a checker for general medical symptoms, like reproductive health issues and gastrointestinal pain. But the findings were, in some ways, counterintuitive: many doctors &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/05/18/google-dermatology-assist-skin-app/"&gt;worry&lt;/a&gt; that symptom-checkers lead to overuse of the health system and send people to get unnecessary treatment. This seemed to show the opposite, Fraser says. The findings also showed how important accuracy is: diverting people from treatment could be a big problem if done improperly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xBENoO"&gt;“If you’ve got something that you’re concerned about on your skin, and an app tells you it’s low risk or it doesn’t think it’s a problem, that could have serious consequences if it delays your decision to go and have a medical consultation,” Dinnes says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ADKOd"&gt;Still, that type of analysis tends to be uncommon. The company behind an existing app for checking skin symptoms, called Aysa, hasn’t yet explicitly surveyed users to find out what steps they took after using the tool. Based on anecdotal feedback, the company thinks many people use the tool as a second opinion to double-check information they got from a doctor, says Art Papier, the chief executive officer of VisualDx, the company behind Aysa. But he doesn’t have quantitative data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FR0EBj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We don’t ask them to come back to the app and tell us what the doctor said.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GZNw87"&gt;“We don’t know if they went somewhere else after,” he says. “We don’t ask them to come back to the app and tell us what the doctor said.” Papier says the company is working to build those types of feedback loops into the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CHTT79"&gt;Google has planned follow-up studies for its dermatology tool, including a partnership with Stanford University to test the tool in a health setting. The company will monitor how well the algorithm performs, Lily Peng a physician-scientist and product manager for Google, said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The team has not announced any plans to study what people do after they use the tool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WZJNa9"&gt;Understanding the way people tend to use the information from symptom-checkers could help ensure the tools are deployed in a way that will actually improve people’s experience with the healthcare system. Information on what steps groups of people take after using a checker also would give developers and doctors a more complete picture of the stakes of the tools that they’re building. People with the resources to see a specialist might be able to follow up on a concerning rash, Fraser says. “If things deteriorate they’ll probably take action,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TnRB4K"&gt;Others without that access might only have the symptom-checker. “That puts a lot of responsibility on us — people who are particularly vulnerable and less likely to get a formal medical opinion may well be relying most on these tools,” he says. “It’s especially important that we do our homework and make sure they’re safe.” &lt;/p&gt;
