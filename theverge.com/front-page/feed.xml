    <title>iPhone 13 deals are extra aggressive this year, here’s why</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone 13" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X3_zMQMnkK42DgY00r3QevGnIqA=/141x0:1640x999/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69882128/lcimg_78e65da1_4e90_4b7e_a300_6bce2342e8ea.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="px24Oy"&gt;“You get free iPhone upgrades for life!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GzwceT"&gt;“You get a $500 gift card for switching carriers!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="buZXND"&gt;I can almost hear Oprah shouting the many competing offers from all the carriers — AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile, and Verizon — as soon as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;Apple “California Streaming” event&lt;/a&gt; was over. They’re all offering huge incentives to entice you to trade-in an old device, switch carriers, then sign up for a top-shelf cellular plan. If you’re in the market for a new carrier and iPhone right now, you can probably land yourself a “free” iPhone 13 (or only pay a nominal fee for the flagship iPhone 13 Pro Max), even if you’re preordering before the phones hit stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UwjtSF"&gt;Many of these offers seem too good to be true and are a bit surprising to see on new iPhones that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407894/apple-q2-2021-earnings-iphone-ipad-mac"&gt;historically have sold themselves&lt;/a&gt;. Who can ignore Verizon for giving you a $500 prepaid MasterCard gift card, just for ditching your carrier? How about the sky-high trade-in offers that all the carriers are advertising, like the too-good-to-be-true offer of giving you $350 for a used Samsung A50, which retails about $180? Across the board, the carriers are particularly aggressive with their signup offers this year, as detailed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22665165/apple-iphone-13-preorder-how-to-buy-price-release-date"&gt;in our preorder guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D05T4he8paoSK__to_e-rJJhEN0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22858831/lcimg_17b9e15c_0998_429c_bb51_493611b203d6.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s pricing for the new iPhone 13 models isn’t out of the ordinary — but few people will actually pay that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="n0jSDK"&gt;Whether you choose T-Mobile, Verizon, or AT&amp;amp;T, all the offers fit the same basic premise. In exchange for a discount on the newest iPhone 13 device, after you trade-in an older device for whatever value, you’ll be paying for the balance of your device in monthly installments. You also must qualify and sign up for a typically more expensive unlimited plan that ties you to your phone and carrier for at least 24-months — or 36-months if you go with AT&amp;amp;T. The new plan will also likely control when and what device you can upgrade to next, which helps carriers and phone manufacturers better forecast the demand for devices and gives you that “free” upgrade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pMgu7z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“To some extent, we’re back to the subsidy model that existed a decade ago”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nulRvV"&gt;For those iPhone 13 shoppers who are already happy with their carriers or existing data plans, or just want the latest unlocked device on a pre-paid plan, the carriers won’t extend as generous offers to you. If you’re already an existing customer, at minimum, you have to be willing to upgrade to the premium plans like at Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T or take a lesser deal at T-Mobile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qopFGV"&gt;It is clear that carriers want to take back control over your upgrade cycle by offering scheduled upgrades and want to lock you into a bigger plan than you need by dangling an almost free phone. Sound familiar?   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rq5k6z"&gt;“The offers are more generous, but the big picture is that we’re seeing a shift from the EIP [Equipment Installment Plan] model to the subsidy model,” according to Wave7 Research’s principal analyst Jeffrey Moore. “To some extent, we’re back to the subsidy model that existed a decade ago, when people routinely got an iPhone for $200, but paid higher monthly rates.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fr8mjv"&gt;It also may seem like Apple is the one that is driving much of these promotions, as more iPhones sold is always beneficial for the company. But as much as Apple needs people to buy new iPhones every year, carriers need the sales even more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kkgz5V"&gt;According to Wave7 Research’s monthly surveys of retail wireless stores in the US, “more than 60% of smartphone activations at national carrier stores are of iPhones, with remaining activations being of Android devices, with Samsung having dominant Android share.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="svV2PO"&gt;Carriers also have an extra incentive to nudge customers toward iPhones this year: the on-going global chip shortage has really affected the supply of Android phones, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676054/t-mobile-cfo-peter-osvaldik-samsung-supply-no-note"&gt;Samsung phones in particular&lt;/a&gt;. In Wave7 Research’s August 2021 survey of retail stores, it found the “supply of the base Galaxy 21 has been particularly weak for Verizon in the U.S., with multiple Samsung models out of stock online.” With a new round of iPhone 13s flooding retail stores, it’s not hard to see why carriers have an incentive to sell iPhones rather than Androids right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="y57ghv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Chip shortages have made other phone models difficult to stock&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mxLTYe"&gt;It doesn’t hurt that service providers also need to shore up their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/12/21511946/5g-iphone-12-upgrade-speed-network-mmwave-hype"&gt;5G user base&lt;/a&gt;, as they continue to expand the (fractured) 5G network in America. If iPhones are the lures that can hook customers to upgrade to an all-inclusive, multi-year data plan, then the carriers are in for the kill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DTO7Sm"&gt;The truth is, Americans are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/17/18629003/us-phone-upgrades-apple-samsung-market"&gt;holding onto their phones longer&lt;/a&gt; than they used to (remember the annual upgrade days?), with each generation of phone being more iterative than innovative. While that’s great news for our wallets and the environment, this trend does carriers no favors — they don’t exactly make the most money when we buy unlocked phones and order pre-paid plans or hang on to our phones for three years or more. Now that new iPhones are on the market, this is the time for carriers to once again capture some new customers with shiny iPhone 13s and fancy plans with built-in upgrade cycles — hook, line, and sinker. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus says no 9T this year, 2022 flagship will run merged Oppo OS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ej-Aw0wIGriVZxekKUBKuHPgdzk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69881985/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0041_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;2021’s OnePlus 9.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KQLNEl"&gt;OnePlus CEO Pete Lau has confirmed that the company doesn’t plan to release its traditional T-series device in the second half of this year. He also announced that next year’s OnePlus flagship phone would run on a newly unified operating system, following the company’s integration with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538105/oneplus-oppo-merge-integration-ownership-bbk"&gt;fellow BBK Electronics subsidiary Oppo&lt;/a&gt;. OnePlus announced it would be merging the codebases of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560765/oneplus-oxygenos-coloros-oppo-android-updates"&gt;Android-based OxygenOS operating system with Oppo’s ColorOS&lt;/a&gt; in July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="piK8i5"&gt;This means we’re unlikely to see a OnePlus 9T following up this year’s OnePlus 9. Despite the similar names, the company’s T-series phones have offered significant upgrades over its flagships from earlier in the year. For example, the 8T had around double the charging speeds of the 8, while the 7T bumped the original 7 display to a higher 90Hz refresh rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XCVMSE"&gt;“This year we will not be launching a T-series product,” Lau said via a translator in a roundtable interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; and other journalists. This will be the first year without a T-series device since OnePlus adopted the release schedule with the OnePlus 3T in 2016. Since then, like clockwork, OnePlus has released a new T-series phone in the latter half of each year, culminating in last year’s OnePlus 8T.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qclhlz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This year we will not be launching a T-series product”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AL8dUt"&gt;In what is effectively a merger between OnePlus and Oppo, the two companies will be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560765/oneplus-oxygenos-coloros-oppo-android-updates"&gt;unifying the underlying codebases of OxygenOS and Oppo’s ColorOS&lt;/a&gt;. The two Android-based operating systems will continue to have their own branding and unique features, Lau said, but the code underpinning them will be the same, and they’ll be developed by a unified team. The way OnePlus describes it, the approach will result in an operating system that’s “fast and smooth” and “clean and lightweight” like OxygenOS, while also being “reliable” and “smart and feature-rich” like ColorOS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sa1Iiz"&gt;Lau said the codebase integration of the two operating systems was completed in June, and that it’s already helping to allow for more frequent software updates. But we’ll have to wait until next year to see the first OnePlus flagship launch with the newly integrated operating system. It won’t just be new OnePlus phones getting the new OS — it will also come to OnePlus’s older devices is they’re still scheduled to receive support. These support periods include three major updates for flagship phones, two for most Nord devices, and one for Nord N phones. Last week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22443128"&gt;Oppo announced&lt;/a&gt; that the OnePlus 9 series will receive a beta of the new software in October, followed by the OnePlus 8 series in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wUUm1X"&gt;OnePlus tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that integrating its operations with Oppo was necessary to make it more efficient, and would streamline its R&amp;amp;D resources “to support more products and work more efficiently.” As well as integrating the two company’s operating systems, OnePlus also said it would be integrating its Warp Charge fast charging standard with Oppo’s SuperVOOC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Twy7Da"&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-16/chinese-smartphone-giant-cuts-jobs-after-going-up-against-apple?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that Oppo’s merger with OnePlus is creating redundancies, including within its ColorOS development unit, as the two BBK subsidiaries pool resources. As many as 20 percent of staff across some software and device teams are reportedly being cut, according to the report. The cuts are reportedly the result of Oppo expanding too rapidly in recent years, moving aggressively into new countries and product categories with big bets that haven’t payed off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PmOB7c"&gt;During our briefing, however, which took place prior to the publication of &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s report, OnePlus’s Lau played down the possibility of merger-related layoffs. “[Redundancies haven’t] been something that’s come up during the merger,” Lau said via a translator, “We have a focus on bringing together the OnePlus and Oppo teams to be able to bring together the strengths of both sides into the merged entity.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon leaks new Kindle Paperwhite with larger 6.8-inch display</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UzxiHRwo7t1_vEY4SAlIz5FxpBA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69881921/akrales_181101_3056_0332.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon’s last Kindle Paperwhite, released in 2018.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hg3LVO"&gt;A new generation of Kindle devices appears to have leaked via a since-removed comparison chart on Amazon Canada, &lt;a href="https://goodereader.com/blog/electronic-readers/amazon-is-going-to-release-kindle-paperwhite-5-signature-edition-soon"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GoodEReader&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. Two new devices are shown in the chart, a CA$149.99 (around $117) Kindle Paperwhite, and a CA$209.99 (around $164) Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition. Both feature a larger 6.8-inch E ink display compared to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/7/18065960/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2018-review"&gt;current 6-inch Paperwhite&lt;/a&gt;, but only the more expensive model has the new wireless charging, alongside more storage and lights that adjust based on the brightness of the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3XrPBM"&gt;The basic Kindle Paperwhite appears to include 8GB of storage, while the Signature Edition has 32GB, the same as the two storage options available for the current Paperwhite. The 300ppi resolution is also unchanged. However, the amount of LEDs for the device’s front-light has increased from five with the current Paperwhite to 17, and their color temperature should also be adjustable like the current Kindle Oasis. The screens on both devices will be flush with the bezel, and they also have an IPX8 waterproof rating, same as the current Paperwhite. Wi-Fi connectivity is included, but there’s no mention of cellular models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IrV8QT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;With a much improved front light&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gibHbL"&gt;While the new Kindle Paperwhites have inherited some features from the Oasis, there’ll still be some exclusive features left for Amazon’s premium e-reader. These include its ergonomic design, auto-rotating page orientation, and physical page-turn buttons, according to the comparison table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vd9ZxG"&gt;Unfortunately, there’s no mention of which USB connector type the new Kindles will use, so it’s unclear if Amazon finally intends to upgrade them to USB-C after having stuck with Micro USB for an embarrassingly long time. Even Amazon’s premium &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707619/amazon-kindle-oasis-2019-e-reader-review-price-specs-features-display"&gt;Kindle Oasis&lt;/a&gt; continues to use the outdated USB connector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1e0BU"&gt;News of the two models follows the arrival of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671844/amazon-kindle-e-reader-interface-design-changes"&gt;new Kindle interface&lt;/a&gt; last week, which was released as an update for basically every Kindle produced since 2015. The new layout adds a navigation bar that makes it easier to jump between the device’s Home screen, library, and in-progress book. Presumably this new interface will come preloaded on the new Kindles upon release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zEqIsR"&gt;It’s unclear when Amazon might officially announce the new e-readers. It typically holds a fall hardware event at the end of September, so we might not be too far away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mAxMeo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="soK9tF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Surface Duo 2 passes through the FCC with 5G, NFC, and wireless charging support</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v15FBblav2V84_ph-rJRpXJ6ulc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69881905/vpavic_4176_20200905_0061.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The original Surface Duo.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VxwfzV"&gt;Microsoft is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671271/microsoft-surface-event-pro-8-surface-book-4-rumors"&gt;expected to announce&lt;/a&gt; its new Surface Duo 2 handset at a special Surface hardware event on Wednesday September 22nd. While rumors have so far pointed towards a triple-camera system, the device appears to have passed through FCC certification with 5G, NFC, and wireless charging support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8fR6fd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/surface-duo-2-fcc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows Central &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that the dual-screen Android device has been spotted in &lt;a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&amp;amp;RequestTimeout=500&amp;amp;calledFromFrame=N&amp;amp;application_id=ZBCqX0Z47t7zHHJi40AiWQ%3D%3D&amp;amp;fcc_id=C3K1995"&gt;FCC documents&lt;/a&gt; published last week. The documents mention “Wireless Power Transfer,” but it’s not entirely clear whether the Qi standard will be supported for wireless charging here. &lt;em&gt;Windows Central&lt;/em&gt; speculates that the Surface Duo 2 may include support for inductive charging for the Surface Pen instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8hBjRM"&gt;The FCC documents also confirm 5G and NFC support, both of which were missing from the original Surface Duo. There’s also a mention of ultra-wideband (UWB) support, which could mean the Surface Duo 2 will connect to accessories that support the standard.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/78nJzAewY4SnWAvHLnYtdij1miI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22740410/surfaceduo2.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The leaked Surface Duo 2 triple-camera system.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QklcUP"&gt;There are no hints at the new triple-camera system that we’re expecting to see on the Surface Duo 2, though. This new camera system is expected to add a camera bump to the rear of the device, as seen in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22593992/microsoft-surface-duo-2-triple-camera-leak-photos"&gt;leaked photos earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. The Surface Duo 2 should also ship with Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 888 processor, and include some other minor changes like moving the fingerprint reader into the power button and centering the USB-C port along the bottom on the right-hand side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="geQ3n6"&gt;Microsoft’s Surface event will kick off at 11AM ET / 8AM PT on September 22nd. We’re also expecting a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/19/22682271/surface-pro-8-120hz-display-thunderbolt-support-leak-rumors"&gt;Surface Pro 8 with a 120Hz display&lt;/a&gt; and Thunderbolt support, a newly designed Surface Book 4, a Surface Go 3, and an update to the Surface Pro X. We’ll be covering all the announcements live, so stay tuned to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;for all the latest Surface news.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google reportedly has a second foldable in the works</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dCt8oQ"&gt;Google appears to be internally testing a second foldable Pixel smartphone, according to &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/09/18/pixel-fold-jumbojack-android-12-1/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;’s sources&lt;/a&gt;. The device is said to be under development with the codename “Jumbojack,” that’s referenced in a future version of Android 12 which &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; identifies as “Android 12.1.” This is the latest foldable codename we’ve heard about at Google, following reports of another device called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22525271/google-pixel-fold-folding-phone-samsung-display-theelec"&gt;“Passport.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wZ5d9v"&gt;Not much is known about what form Jumbojack could take, but &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; has a couple of key details. It seems to have two screens, with one that deactivates when the device is folded. That suggests we’re looking at a similar design to Samsung’s foldables, which combine a small external screen with a larger internal folding display. There’s no word on screen sizes or internal specs, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AnrUvZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A “hamburger style” design?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cZTjcr"&gt;Interestingly, there’s speculation that the Jumbojack codename could be a reference to Jack in the Box’s Jumbo Jack cheeseburger, an implication that the phone will fold “&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nostalgia/comments/cgyc1v/folding_paper_hot_dog_and_hamburger_style/"&gt;hamburger style&lt;/a&gt;” like a Z Flip as opposed to “hotdog style” like a Z Fold. But, much like the foodstuffs, that speculation is best taken with a good pinch of salt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FnHDK5"&gt;Unlike Passport, which reliable leaker &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1439827216343474176"&gt;Evan Blass reported this morning&lt;/a&gt; is still scheduled to launch before the end of the year, there’s no indication about when or even if Jumbojack will see a commercial release. There’s a possibility it might just be an internal prototype, designed to help build foldable functionality like improved multitasking into Android itself. Regardless, its existence suggests Google is more serious about foldables that it initially appeared as the company gears up to produce its first true flagship competitor with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ywx2nC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 20th, 7:30AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added corroboration from Blass that Google’s “Passport” foldable is still expected to launch before the end of the year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZM9BaM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G3fuYu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XYdUUg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ix95hi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gIxf6u"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ikea’s $39.99 pad adds built-in wireless charging to almost any table</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YuZqhhPUgGbhSN3zWsSAxQ0ZSlA=/53x0:548x330/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69880306/ikea_qi_table.5.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ikea’s Sjömärke fits under a table to make it a charger. &lt;/em&gt; | GIF: Ikea&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7LUDsw"&gt;Ikea got in relatively early on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/1/8130119/ikea-wireless-power-consortium-qi-wireless-charging-furniture"&gt;selling furniture embedded with wireless charging coils&lt;/a&gt;, but what if you don’t have one of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/22/16349152/ikea-wireless-chargers-iphone-ad-campaign"&gt;powered-up desks or shelving units&lt;/a&gt;? If you want seamless Wireless Qi charging without redecorating, then next month, there will be a solution. Meet the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fsjoemaerke-wireless-charger-80512718%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F19%2F22677980%2Fikea-sjomarke-wireless-qi-charging-existing-furniture" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sjömärke&lt;/a&gt;, a $39.99 wireless charging pad made to work with furniture you already own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RN2U9B"&gt;This device isn’t like most Qi charging pads, where you’d put your phone or earbuds directly on the mat. Instead, the seven-inch by three-inch aluminum and plastic charger works through plastic or wood, so you can use its double-sided tape (or screws, not included) to put it on the underside of a table or shelf.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sjömärke" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kcJp3eCxNDKwYERn1WyUws1nZg0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22862358/sjoemaerke_wireless_charger__0987908_pe818216_s5_900.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ikea&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Ikea Sjömärke instructions" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fRE9yS8d_oCpbfveARVJ1-lhqGQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22862348/ikea_sjoemaerke_manual.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ikea&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Ikea Sjömärke instructions&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GmVOOd"&gt;As long as you’re mounting the device on something wood or plastic, it should safely send an electric charge through to your gadgets on the other side. It needs a minimum distance from the phone of about 8mm, and Ikea recommends using it with a surface between three-eighths and seven-eighths of an inch thick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="01cNzS"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fmanuals%2Fsjoemaerke-wireless-charger__AA-2281316-2_pub.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F19%2F22677980%2Fikea-sjomarke-wireless-qi-charging-existing-furniture" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ikea’s manual (pdf)&lt;/a&gt;, it’s “Perfect to mount on a desk, side table or bedside table when you want chargers and cables to blend into the decor to keep the room neat and tidy.” Other than the sticky tape, it comes with a six-foot power cable and stickers to mark the location of your new charging spot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PM1kIS"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K0IvUXG-8wQ?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=3&amp;amp;start=3" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mcueYA"&gt;The LED indicates charging status, and it has temperature and power monitoring for safety. It’s compatible with the latest Qi 1.2.4 baseline power profile, so you can expect it to perform within the range of standard 5W charging — no &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519292/samsung-galaxy-fit-2-trio-wireless-charger-price"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/23/18016492/google-pixel-3-fast-wireless-charging-approved-chargers-restriction-qi"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514850/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-wireless-charging-speed"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;-specific improvements here. Still, it’s impressive enough if you’d like to charge a phone by simply putting it on the desk where it already sits and not have to move anything else around. An Ikea spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the Sjömärke will be available in-stores and online in the US and other countries in October.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: Succession, You, Nightmare Alley, Hawkeye, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0hS2w7hodnxRlEtNpKzX5MPAOQ4=/0x0:1406x937/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69879850/kendall_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Kendall Roy, smiling because he is happy Succession is returning soon (probably) | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevqiiYNFrc&amp;amp;t=1s&amp;amp;ab_channel=HBO" target="_blank"&gt;HBO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KzOhz2"&gt;OK so the latest &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso &lt;/em&gt;spends almost the entire episode on Coach Beard in its most unusual, dream-like episode ever. I didn’t hate it (and I know it’s one of the two episodes added to the mix after &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2021-08-13/ted-lasso-christmas-episode-apple-tv"&gt;Apple said it wanted 12 episodes&lt;/a&gt; instead of the 10 the writers had already sketched out. The Christmas episode was the other), but I wish we had actually gotten to know Beard a little better. “I listen more than I talk” seems like a line that could be his mantra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fHLlsu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/em&gt; is back and honestly the first episode seemed rushed to get certain characters to do specific things we as the audience know they must do in order to have a show at all. I’ll stick with it for a bit, remembering that this was a show that took a little while to find its groove in season 1, but the first offering felt a little more chaotic than usual. Billy Crudup keeps me coming back, to be honest; he makes Cory such a likeable weasel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pak65O"&gt;This week’s trailers include a dysfunctional family, a serial killer, a carnival charlatan, and a classic musical. Never let it be said that I don’t try to add some variety to these roundups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YTLU6M"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="49czGb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kevqiiYNFrc?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=1&amp;amp;start=1" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mnB2Vq"&gt;Succession&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6bZCgQ"&gt;The squirmiest show on streaming about awful rich people (yes even more awful than you, &lt;em&gt;White Lotus&lt;/em&gt;) is returning for a third season and the Roy family has never looked more dysfunctional. The fallout from the bombshell Kendall delivered in last season’s finale appears to be a central plot line as the Roys decide which side they’re on and how to keep the family business— toxic as it may be— from going under. Cousin Greg is as awkward as ever in this trailer as he informs Kendall he is the “number one trending topic ahead of tater tots.” And Logan is as angry as ever, shouting that he’s ready to go “full fucking beast.” God I missed this show. Adrien Brody, as a billionaire activist investor, and Alexander Skarsgard, as a tech founder and CEO, have joined the show for the upcoming season. Jeremy Strong, Brian Cox, Sarah Snook, Kieran Culkin, Nicholas Braun, Matthew Macfadyen, and J. Smith Cameron return in the third season of &lt;em&gt;Succession, &lt;/em&gt;coming &lt;em&gt;to &lt;/em&gt;HBO Max October 17th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aVz2Dm"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5VYb3B1ETlk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="E200u0"&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="skY9Ro"&gt;So I was not aware this would be a Christmas show but sure, let’s roll with it. &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; picks up after the events of the &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt; movie, with Clint Barton just trying to enjoy the holidays in New York City with his family when he discovers there’s a new bow-wielding vigilante in town. The trailer has a decidedly jocular tone, which is kind of a new thing for this character. Jeremy Renner, Hailee Steinfeld, Vera Farmiga, Fra Fee, Tony Dalton, Zahn McClarnon, Brian d’Arcy James, and Alaqua Cox star in &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to Disney Plus on November 24th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="evFJSI"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xAN1ThhTWsE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2aNCuJ"&gt;You&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="j1A7lI"&gt;Netflix’s show about the serial killer/stalker next door who found his perfect match in season 2 returns for a third season, and Joe and Love are now parents which seems a little problematic? Joe of course has fixated on a new target for his obsession and Love is not super happy about it. Penn Badgley, Victoria Pedretti, and Saffron Burrows return for season 3, which adds Tati Gabrielle, Dylan Arnold, Shalita Grant, Travis Van Winkle, Scott Speedman, McManus, Shannon Chan-Kent, Ben Menhl, Chris O’Shea, and Christopher Sean to the cast. &lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt; comes back to Netflix October 15th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fSuU7c"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k-qVV8zyVmI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="BHaGHG"&gt;Nightmare Alley&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LJw9vW"&gt;Based on the 1946 novel by William Lindsay Gresham, Nightmare Alley is not a supernatural film, director Guillermo del Toro said in an &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2021/09/nightmare-alley-guillermo-del-toro-awards-insider"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Given his body of work, it’s not a surprise people might make that assumption. The story revolves around a con man and former carnival worker who convinces people he can read minds. The all-star cast includes Bradley Cooper, Cate Blanchett, Toni Collette, Willem Dafoe, Richard Jenkins, Rooney Mara, Ron Perlman, and David Straithairn. &lt;em&gt;Nightmare Alley&lt;/em&gt; comes to theaters December 17th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qi7mJI"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A5GJLwWiYSg?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="eEUcRK"&gt;West Side Story&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Vu72Ar"&gt;We got a teaser for Steven Spielberg’s adaptation of &lt;em&gt;West Side Story&lt;/em&gt; in May, but this is the first official trailer and I am a little perplexed that it focuses on the plot— of perhaps one of the most famous American movies based on a Shakespeare play which is itself very famous— instead of the songs? At least we get to see snippets of the dance numbers and some words of wisdom from Rita Moreno: Anita in the original 1961 film, who has a small role in this remake and served as a consultant to Spielberg. Ansel Elgort, Rachel Zegler, Ariana DeBose, David Alvarez, Mike Faist, Josh Andres Rivera, Ana Isabelle, Corey Stoll, Brian d’Arcy James also star in &lt;em&gt;West Side Story&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to theaters December 10th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5zadoU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gBR4e1"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tmv92GzD0pY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="EO2iMP"&gt;Bonus: Foundation first look trailer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="sgY6Re"&gt;With less than a week to go before this massive series hits Apple TV Plus, we get a first-look trailer with commentary from stars Jared Harris, Leah Harvey, Lee Pace, and Lou Llobell, and writer David S. Goyer, who calls Foundation (the book) “the greatest science fiction work of all time.” Adapted from the Isaac Asimov books, &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; drops its first episode on September 24th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jVqpRl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="R1NTTq"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PNgDXB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Emmys 2021: How to watch online, and who’s nominated</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="73rd Emmy Awards Cedric the Entertainer, executive producers Reginald Hudlin and Ian Stewart, left to right, on stage for a “Sneak Peek” behind-the scenes reveal of television’s biggest night" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2Tzs2dCUffjXNIfUiowZcq4TbPg=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69879266/1235302770.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The 73rd Emmy Awards will be held on September 19th. | Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oLFfcq"&gt;The 73rd annual Primetime Emmy Awards ceremony is tonight at 8PM ET (5PM PT), and streaming platforms like Apple TV Plus, Netflix and HBO Max are poised to win big. Cedric the Entertainer will host the show, which will be broadcast live from outside the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles, to accommodate social distancing, which also means the audience will be limited to nominees and their guests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bGoizX"&gt;Where DO I WATCH THE EMMYS?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FjlfJF"&gt;This year, CBS will broadcast the Emmys, so you can watch on your local CBS affiliate. The show will also stream live on CBS’ Paramount Plus streaming app. You can sign up for a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paramountplus.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F19%2F22680938%2Femmys-2021-watch-date-time-how-to-nominations-online-streaming-cbs-paramount-plus" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;free trial of Paramount Plus&lt;/a&gt; to check it out if you’re not already a subscriber. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2LGLzj"&gt;HOW DO I WATCH THE EMMYS ONLINE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="sEU6pt"&gt;There are plenty of options for watching the Emmys if you don’t have cable TV. You can watch in your internet browser, or through a streaming device (Apple TV, Google Chromecast, Amazon Fire TV, Roku) connected to your television using Hulu with Live TV, YouTube TV, or SlingTV. These are paid services but most offer a free trial period as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3Yu2la"&gt;WHO IS NOMINATED FOR AN EMMY?&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>NTSB official says Tesla should address “basic safety issues” before expanding full self-driving </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b1SXHECvmWOFRPitVIyoT5lm36g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69879164/acastro_180430_1777_tesla_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;NTSB chair says Tesla should address safety issues before expanding its so-called “full self-driving” mode. | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7KSds0"&gt;Jennifer Homendy, chair of the National Transportation Safety Board, told the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musks-push-to-expand-teslas-driver-assistance-to-cities-rankles-a-top-safety-authority-11632043803?mod=hp_lead_pos3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that Tesla should address “basic safety issues” before the carmaker expands its so-called “full self-driving” (FSD) mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cQFNl0"&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk said earlier this month that the company was&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22660692/tesla-full-self-driving-software-release-date-leak"&gt; aiming for a wider release of FSD&lt;/a&gt; by the end of September, making a “public beta button” available to more Tesla customers. As the&lt;em&gt; WSJ &lt;/em&gt;reports, an upgrade to the software— which was designed primarily for driving on highways— is expected, in order to make the vehicles ready for driving on city streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UuX7hm"&gt;Homendy had harsh words for Tesla’s use of the term “full self-driving,” which she called “misleading and irresponsible,” adding that Tesla “has clearly misled numerous people to misuse and abuse technology.” The NTSB can conduct investigations and make recommendations, but has no enforcement authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aO4ZtY"&gt;According to documents obtained by &lt;a href="https://www.plainsite.org/documents/28jcs0/california-dmv-tesla-robotaxi%E2%80%94fsd-notes/"&gt;legal transparency group PlainSite&lt;/a&gt; in May, Tesla’s director of Autopilot software had told the California Department of Motor Vehicles that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22424592/tesla-elon-musk-autopilot-dmv-fsd-exaggeration"&gt;Musk overstated&lt;/a&gt; the capabilities of the company’s advanced driver assist system, a precursor to FSD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8jX9hz"&gt;In February 2020, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21153320/tesla-autopilot-walter-huang-death-ntsb-probable-cause"&gt;NTSB found Tesla’s Autopilot driver assistance system&lt;/a&gt; was one of the possible causes in a fatal 2018 crash, stating that the driver, who was playing a mobile game while using Autopilot, was overly confident in Autopilot’s capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wr7D10"&gt;The NTSB has said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21152984/tesla-autopilot-safety-recommendations-ignored-ntsb-crash-hearing"&gt;Tesla ignored its 2017 safety recommendations about Autopilot&lt;/a&gt;. The agency told Tesla and five other automakers they should add safeguards to advanced driver assistance systems so that it’s more difficult to misuse them. It also recommended the automakers limit where and when such driver assistance systems can be used. Tesla was the only carmaker that did not officially respond to the NTSB recommendations, although it did increase the frequency of alerts if a driver takes their hands off the steering wheel when using Autopilot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uSXlu7"&gt;Tesla did not respond to an email seeking comment on Sunday; the company dissolved its press office and typically doesn’t respond to media inquiries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3B2jj5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S1ZsK3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Chevy Bolt recall is burning up what’s left of GM’s EV good will</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sI7HGxUE7lnVIjo3zGpULdMiu6w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69879060/akrales_170313_1481_A_0019.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2df0OL"&gt;General Motors plans to launch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536601/gm-ev-investment-increase-amount-electric-autonomous-vehicles"&gt;30 new electric vehicles around the world by 2025&lt;/a&gt;, and aspires to sell &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254116/general-motors-carbon-neutral-vow-2040-tailpipe-emissions-ev"&gt;only zero-emissions vehicles by 2035&lt;/a&gt;. But over the last few years, the United States’ biggest automaker has once again squandered the advantages it held in the still-burgeoning field of electric vehicles through bad politics, bad investments, and now most notably, a massive recall of the Bolt — currently its only all-electric vehicle — thanks to around a dozen reported fires. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxVzPj"&gt;On Thursday, GM announced that it is extending the Bolt’s production shutdown until mid-October, as it apparently hasn’t been able to get supplier LG to produce replacement batteries that are up to snuff. It will need a lot of them, too, as GM has recalled all Bolts made to date — nearly 150,000. (The company says some vehicles will only need certain modules replaced, while others will get the whole battery pack swapped.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sy4adJ"&gt;In the meantime, GM gave Bolt owners something else to worry about this week, as it advised them to park at least 50 feet away from other vehicles. That’s in addition to the previous guidance owners have received, including parking away from their homes, not charging overnight, not charging above 90 percent, or letting their vehicle’s battery drain below around 70 miles of range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kQVCEe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;GM’s early push into electric vehicles is looking more like a false start&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s4PNBN"&gt;All of this has made owning a Bolt a stressful and confusing affair, despite the apparently low odds of a fire. Some owners have tried to get GM to buy back their Bolts — which the company &lt;a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/40825/gm-is-buying-back-dozens-of-chevy-bolt-evs-that-pose-fire-risk-due-to-rare-manufacturing-defect"&gt;has done in some cases&lt;/a&gt; — only &lt;a href="https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2021/09/11/chevy-bolt-recall-battery-fire-risk/5683333001/"&gt;to be rejected&lt;/a&gt;. Updates from the company have been intermittent since the initial recall in November 2020. It took until May 2021 for the automaker to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417634/chevy-bolt-recall-fire-fix-software-update"&gt;announce its first attempted fix&lt;/a&gt; for the problem (which wound up not working), and it wasn’t until July of that year that GM finally admitted what the problem &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590210/chevy-bolt-new-recall-battery-defect-fire-risk-fix"&gt;was in the first place&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rvR6gz"&gt;“This has been a very complex recall, but we’ve been moving as quickly as possible to provide our customers with information as we learned new developments alongside our supplier, LG,” Kevin Kelly, who leads Chevy’s PR team, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email. “We understand and can certainly appreciate the frustration that our Bolt EV owners have experienced over the past few months, but we’re committed to doing the right thing for our customers and we know we have to get the recall repair right.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Fi4Oo"&gt;“We continue to make progress and will work as quickly possible and inform owners when we have new information to share,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="tndxGJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Bolt has been one of the most competent, capable, and affordable EVs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SEC1w0"&gt;The Bolt, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/13/12899752/chevy-bolt-driving-impressions-review"&gt;launched in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, was supposed to help GM accomplish two things: set up GM as the first automaker to match Tesla with a mass-market, long-range electric vehicle, and also help everyone forget GM had once briefly led in this category with the EV1 — before it so thoroughly gave up on its fledgling electric car that it literally crushed most of the &lt;a href="https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1131994_report-with-ev1-gm-sparked-the-era-of-the-electric-car-but-didn-t-follow-through"&gt;remaining units to pieces&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AVQoKl"&gt;For a while, it worked. The Bolt never did gangbusters but has been one of the most competent, capable, and affordable electric cars on the market across the last half-decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f7ixWs"&gt;But while GM was making modest progress on the road, it started working against that progress in Washington. When Donald Trump became president, GM was first in line with its Detroit peers when the White House opened for business. Just days after his inauguration, they &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/05/business/detroit-automakers-emissions-standards.html"&gt;reportedly lobbied the president to loosen&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the Obama-era clean car standards&lt;/a&gt; so it would be easier to sell more profitable (but more harmful) SUVs and pickup trucks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GBO2BW"&gt;Trump took that inch and stretched it a country mile. His administration spent the next few years slapping together a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201036/trump-epa-obama-fuel-economy-rule-rollback-emissions-consumer-cost"&gt;spiteful but shoddy attempt&lt;/a&gt; at a far more drastic rollback of one of his predecessor’s crowning climate achievements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fxiXFz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;GM then spent time and money encouraging Trump’s deregulatory tendencies&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZmSCPJ"&gt;Some of those automakers, like Ford, eventually wised up and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/20727261/trump-emissions-rollback-ford-volkswagon-honda-bmw-california-deal"&gt;struck a compromise deal with California regulators&lt;/a&gt;, as the legal objections mounted to Trump’s decision. But GM doubled down by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21026865/general-motors-ev-day-trump-emissions-rollback-climate-crisis"&gt;joining the Trump administration’s defense&lt;/a&gt;, and only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21611607/gm-trump-california-car-emission-pollution-biden-fuel-efficiency-standards"&gt;abandoned that position after Trump lost reelection&lt;/a&gt;. The company maintains it only sided with the Trump administration because it shared the belief that the federal government should have the sole right to set national standards for emissions or fuel economy, though California had a waiver to the Clean Air Act that said otherwise (which Trump fought to to revoke). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PVgxwA"&gt;While GM was risking its reputation for the sake of constitutional posturing, it started making similarly questionable moves with its checkbook. First, it &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/24/gm-wanted-too-much-from-ev-start-up-rivian-opening-door-for-ford.html"&gt;threw its weight around&lt;/a&gt; with buzzy EV startup Rivian. GM wanted exclusive rights to the technology that would power Rivian’s electric pickup truck and SUV in exchange for a sizable investment. Rivian politely declined and then immediately went on to raise &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590848/rivian-raise-amazon-ford-new-factory-ipo-electric-pickup"&gt;more than $10 billion&lt;/a&gt; from the likes of Ford and Amazon on its way to an IPO that could see its value skyrocket to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22644601/rivian-ipo-november-december-filing-amazon-ford"&gt;nearly $100 billion&lt;/a&gt; — all without an exclusive deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wUYosf"&gt;Then, under intense public pressure from the Trump administration, GM sold a recently-closed plant in Lordstown, Ohio to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18537225/gm-factory-workhorse-ev-electric-vehicle-startup-sale-trump-tweet"&gt;a brand new electric pickup truck startup&lt;/a&gt; called Lordstown Motors run by a guy who had recently left his post in charge of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18537225/gm-factory-workhorse-ev-electric-vehicle-startup-sale-trump-tweet"&gt;another unproven EV startup&lt;/a&gt; called Workhorse. GM also took a small stake in Lordstown Motors and participated in the investment portion of the startup’s merger with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352433/gm-lordstown-motors-electric-truck-startup-public-merger-spac"&gt;a special purpose acquisition company&lt;/a&gt;. GM even had the right to name a board member as part of that deal, but ultimately declined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="PsawDU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Spurned by Rivian, GM turned its attention to two far shakier startups&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dF3zyP"&gt;Shortly after that, GM announced a deal with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427009/gm-nikola-acquisition-electric-hydrogen-truck"&gt;hydrogen electric trucking startup Nikola&lt;/a&gt;, which had a pickup truck project of its own. But that soured quickly after Nikola’s founder and now former CEO was accused of (and later &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/29/us-prosecutors-charge-trevor-milton-founder-of-electric-carmaker-nikola-with-three-counts-of-fraud.html"&gt;indicted for&lt;/a&gt;) allegedly lying about a lot of what Nikola was capable of in late 2020. GM abruptly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726594/gm-nikola-deal-equity-badger-truck-hydrogen"&gt;backed out&lt;/a&gt;. This year, the Lordstown Motors founder faced similar allegations and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532976/lordstown-motors-ceo-steve-burns-resign-short-seller-investigation"&gt;was eventually pushed out&lt;/a&gt;. GM still holds a small stake in Lordstown Motors, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mgiBBC"&gt;GM is already back in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22610501/biden-2030-ev-goal-trump-emissions-rollback"&gt;good graces of the Biden administration&lt;/a&gt;. And in a few years, with electric &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/3/22362072/hummer-suv-electric-price-specs-release-date"&gt;Hummers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/6/22370058/gm-chevy-electric-silverado-pickup-truck"&gt;Silverados&lt;/a&gt; cruising the roads powered by the company’s next-generation battery pack, few will remember the company‘s involvement in two sketchy startups, or recall the automaker’s failed attempt at corralling one of the hottest electric vehicle companies to come to market of our time. After all, these were the kinds of metaphorical fires that tend to be easier to extinguish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="6QFN1n"&gt;The problems with the Bolt, however, could cast a lasting pall — because this time the flames are real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2NmkT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EFSfE6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
