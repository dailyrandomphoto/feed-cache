    <title>HBO Max’s cheaper ad-supported tier will reportedly cost $9.99 per month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c9C8jw"&gt;&lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;source=Verge&amp;amp;aff_sub=HBOMaxLoweringPrice042821"&gt;HBO Max’s&lt;/a&gt; upcoming ad-support tier will cost $9.99 per month, or $5 less than the standard $14.99 per month that the regular version of HBO Max costs, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/28/warnermedia-plans-to-charge-9point99-per-month-for-ad-supported-hbo-max.html"&gt;according to a new report from CNBC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wJHt8i"&gt;The upcoming ad-supported tier is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22327217/hbo-max-ad-supported-tier-launch-date-international-price-subscriber-growth"&gt;still set to launch in June&lt;/a&gt; and will feature a few major differences from the $15 per month plan — including access to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;WarnerMedia’s same-day theatrical release strategy&lt;/a&gt; for films like &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;The Matrix 4&lt;/em&gt;, which will be limited to subscribers to HBO Max’s more premium tier. WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar has also confirmed in a March analyst event that HBO original shows won’t get ads added in, so customers won’t have to worry about &lt;em&gt;Euphoria&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; The Sopranos&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones &lt;/em&gt;getting interrupted by commercials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5gQoxy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;HBO, for less&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m8nakF"&gt;The $9.99 price tag would mark a new low price for access to HBO’s content, undercutting the $14.99 per month that WarnerMedia has charged for the service for years (whether purchased through cable companies or as a standalone streaming service).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dRq298"&gt;It also would allow for HBO Max — which, at $14.99 per month, is currently one of the most expensive streaming services — to better compete with or even undercut competitors like Disney Plus ($7.99 per month) or Netflix (which starts at $8.99 per month but offers pricier $13.99 and $17.99 per month plans, too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uR10PM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NpY2yb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A fired Amazon worker is trying to unionize four NYC-area facilities</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kGHVD6YkLRw0dBd14-L-L5z3FDo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69201196/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GMMI60"&gt;Amazon workers at four different facilities near Staten Island have begun the process of unionizing with the &lt;a href="https://amazonlaborunion.org/"&gt;Amazon Labor Union&lt;/a&gt;. The organizing effort is being led by Christian Smalls, a former warehouse worker who was fired in March after organizing a walkout to protest unsafe working conditions during the pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/amazon-labor-union-staten-island"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5BWGEe"&gt;The company has responded by posting anti-union messages on TV screens at JFK8, the fulfillment center where Smalls used to work. “KNOW THE FACTS BEFORE YOU SIGN A UNION CARD,” reads one of the messages &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvzx7v/amazon-launches-another-union-busting-campaign"&gt;obtained by &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “If someone asks you to provide your personal information or sign a union card, do not release your personal information without knowing all the facts.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fojuUz"&gt;Several hundred workers at JFK8 have already signed cards in support of the union, Smalls told &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;. In total, the warehouse employs roughly 5,000 workers. The union could present the cards to Amazon as early as June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vpOjxz"&gt;The effort comes on the heels of a bitter defeat for Amazon organizers in Alabama. Earlier this month, warehouse workers in Bessemer voted against unionizing with the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), although the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/10/22377142/bessemer-amazon-labor-union-loss-warehouse-rwdsu"&gt;organization is currently contesting the results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3yVM9p"&gt;After Smalls was fired, he filed a class action lawsuit against Amazon (the case is ongoing). He also created the Congress of Essential Workers, which grew into the Amazon Labor Union, according to &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1tqp3"&gt;The Amazon Labor Union isn’t affiliated with a national group like the RWDSU, which could complicate the high-stakes unionizing effort. Typically, unions like RWDSU provide much-needed resources and experience to employees trying to organize their workplace. For now, most of that work is being done by Smalls and the various organizations he founded since leaving the company. The group has also &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-the-amazon-labor-union?utm_campaign=p_cp_url&amp;amp;utm_medium=os&amp;amp;utm_source=customer"&gt;set up a GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt; to cover organizing expenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tGVuYp"&gt;Smalls told &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; that he thinks independence will be helpful. “We have nothing to compare ourselves to,” he said. “That puts us at an advantage. Workers can’t say we already tried it and failed. When talking to workers, we can say this is us creating this together as workers of Amazon. We’re all in this together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vaLnrh"&gt;Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s who Apple and Epic are calling to testify in next week’s trial</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qHSF6qGdTTpPNsvPamHntQsTrj8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69201001/vpavic_190224_Tim_Sweeney_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MAAnYH"&gt;Next week, Epic Games and Apple will appear in court for a long-anticipated legal battle. Epic argues that Apple unfairly kicked its hit game &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; off the App Store last year, exercising an illegal monopoly over the ubiquitous iOS platform. Apple claims Epic is trying to break the iOS platform’s vaunted safety and security for its own gain. Both parties have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;laid out how&lt;/a&gt; they expect to win their respective cases, and this week, they’ve provided near-final lists of the people they expect to call for testimony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AeudKo"&gt;Apple and Epic both filed revised tentative witness lists on April 26th. The lists don’t guarantee every witness will be called, and crucially, they don’t tell us &lt;em&gt;when &lt;/em&gt;we’ll see a given person on the stand. But with the closely watched trial kicking off on Monday — and likely running until the last week of May — they offer a good picture of each party’s planned strategy and what we can expect to see throughout the trial. An Apple spokesperson described its list as being a fairly reliable indicator of who it would call in the trial, while Epic said it could vary its strategy based on how the trial proceeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXjt4o"&gt;Unsurprisingly, the lists are heavy on Apple and Epic executives and other employees. That includes Epic CEO Tim Sweeney (who appears on both witness lists), Apple CEO Tim Cook (who appears only on Apple’s list), and other big names like Craig Federighi, Eddy Cue, and Phil Schiller. Since these figures were deposed before the trial, court documents have already revealed a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406303/imessage-android-eddy-cue-emails-apple-epic-deposition"&gt;few interesting details&lt;/a&gt; about the companies’ businesses — and we’ll probably see more as they take the stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bCX8QX"&gt;Epic and Apple are also preparing to call on outside parties with a stake in the app and gaming world. Both lists include Microsoft Xbox executive Lori Wright, for instance, and Epic is calling Adrian Ong from Match Group, which &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/21/google-and-apple-scare-us-app-makers-tell-congress.html"&gt;recently criticized Apple&lt;/a&gt; in a congressional hearing. However, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-27/facebook-s-gaming-chief-no-longer-testifying-in-epic-apple-trial"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;, Epic withdrew a request for testimony from Facebook’s gaming head Vivek Sharma — whose name doesn’t appear in the latest filings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bh7ajS"&gt;Apple’s witness list&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xJ7Bww"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple employees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>General Motors has a solution for our crappy EV charging infrastructure</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jld3-uZAG3bfr1_U-yvnbJVdb84=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69200754/akrales_170405_1582_0603.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bc2evx"&gt;General Motors announced a “holistic charging approach” to electric vehicle charging that it’s calling the Ultium Charge 360. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CgX2nz"&gt;Much like Ford does with its FordPass network, the Ultium Charge 360 will integrate GM’s own vehicle apps and software with a variety of third-party charging services, such as Blink, ChargePoint, EVgo, Flo, Greenlots, and SemaConnect. The goal is to create a seamless experience in which an owner of a GM electric vehicle can drive up to a station, plug in, and start charging without having to juggle multiple apps or third-party memberships. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k7zRco"&gt;“There is a lot more to EV adoption than just buying the vehicle and just having a large connected network,” said Travis Hester, GM’s chief EV officer. “And our mission is to help every single person get over whatever anxiety they have, and help them into an EV in the most convenient way possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="n1fxUz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“our mission is to help every single person get over whatever anxiety they have”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4aknMk"&gt;Unlike Tesla or Volkswagen, GM does not own its own EV charging network. Owners of GM’s electric vehicles must instead rely on a patchwork of third-party chargers, each with their own software and membership requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yJqOIt"&gt;The challenge, though, will be to ensure that it all works as advertised. A lot will depend on the level of service provided by these various charging services, an aspect that GM will have little control over. EV charging in the US is a bit of a mess, with broken chargers, fraying cables, and unreliable maps. While GM can’t solve some of the more intractable problems, it says it’s doing what it can to make charging a little less of a headache. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bqc3kC"&gt;A good comparison is to the FordPass network, which the automaker first introduced in 2019. The automaker claimed that Ford EV owners would have access to 12,000 public chargers. But the branding made it seem as if Ford were launching its own version of Tesla’s Supercharger network, when it was actually tapping existing stations from companies like Electrify America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2BvgKu"&gt;Speaking of which, Volkswagen’s subsidiary is noticeably absent from GM’s list of participating charging networks. The automaker said it was seeking to add additional charging providers into its Ultium network in the future.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hxkxIX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;GM said it was making good progress on this partnership&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dxd4Pg"&gt;GM wouldn’t say whether its forthcoming EVs would include Plug and Charge capabilities, a new technology standard that allows a much simpler way to charge your car. “We’re not announcing specifics on some of those features,” said Alex Keros, lead architect for EV infrastructure at GM, “but you could certainly imagine Plug and Charge really enabling that seamless experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q5eQqV"&gt;The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349614/general-motors-evgo-fast-charging-network-investment"&gt;announced that it would collaborate with EVgo&lt;/a&gt; to create a constellation of 2,700 electric vehicle fast-charging stations in cities around the country. GM didn’t specify the size of its investment in the charging buildout, and the partnership won’t be exclusive, meaning GM’s vehicles won’t get special access to them. GM said it was making good progress on this partnership, with the first stations already up and running in Washington, California, and Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5n9tYz"&gt;GM, the largest automaker in North America, is in the midst of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220574/gm-new-logo-electric-vehicle-brand-ces-2021"&gt;historic rebranding&lt;/a&gt; as an electric vehicle company. It has committed to spending $27 billion on electric and autonomous vehicles through 2025 — up from the $20 billion it announced before the COVID-19 pandemic. GM has also said it will launch 30 new electric vehicles around the world by that date, more than two-thirds of which will be available in North America. And it has set a goal to phase out its gas-powered vehicles and be a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254116/general-motors-carbon-neutral-vow-2040-tailpipe-emissions-ev"&gt;completely carbon neutral company&lt;/a&gt; by 2040. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWwc3x"&gt;GM unveiled two new EVs in 2020: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357717/cadillac-lyriq-gm-ev-suv-touchscreen-size-specs-release-date"&gt;the Cadillac Lyriq SUV&lt;/a&gt;, expected to go into production in late 2022, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525290/hummer-ev-electric-truck-gmc-price-specs-range"&gt;GMC Hummer EV&lt;/a&gt;, slated for late 2021. This year, it has revealed more details about an electric &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/3/22362072/hummer-suv-electric-price-specs-release-date"&gt;Hummer SUV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/14/22280449/chevy-bolt-ev-euv-super-cruise-range-price-specs"&gt;two new versions of the Chevy Bolt&lt;/a&gt;. And GM has also said it would release an electric Chevy pickup truck with 400 miles of range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="63I0z0"&gt;Hester said the “major functions” of Ultium Charge 360 will be available by September 2021. He described the new features as “single click, one click to activate” an EV charger, as well as some “gamiefied activity” tied to a specific electric vehicle, adding, “I don’t want to spoil the vehicle news.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RjUYlm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite’s cash cow is PlayStation, not iOS, court documents reveal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XUz2pyjDWF8WgguKqTWOmjJpgXA=/417x138:1448x825/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69200693/Screen_Shot_2021_04_28_at_10.35.29_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lara Croft in &lt;/em&gt;Fortnite&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lKGtNM"&gt;Earlier this month, we learned that the iOS version of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; was a huge revenue driver for Epic Games — the game earned more than $700 million from iOS customers over the two years before it was pulled by Apple, according to &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.405.0.pdf"&gt;court documents (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; released ahead of Epic’s trial against the iPhone maker. But even though iOS &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; players brought in a staggering amount of money for Epic, iOS isn’t the biggest platform in terms of revenue for the game — apparently, it might even be &lt;em&gt;among the smallest.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9AyB3"&gt;Court documents reveal that PlayStation 4 generated 46.8 percent of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s total revenues from March 2018 through July 2020, while Xbox One, the second-highest platform, generated 27.5 percent. iOS ranked fifth, with just 7 percent of total revenue. The remaining 18.7 percent would have been split between Android, Nintendo Switch, and PCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NJ5beq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;iPhone and iPad accounted for just 5 to 7 percent of Epic’s Fortnite revenue&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0H0PPO"&gt;In 2020, iOS revenues were projected to be an even smaller piece of the pie: just 5.8 percent, compared to 24 percent for Xbox One and “almost 40 percent” for PlayStation 4, according to &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.495.0.pdf"&gt;a new deposition (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; of Epic Games’ David Nikdel, a senior programmer who works on the backend services for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="62mPE3"&gt;“iOS was always the lowest or second lowest if Android was listed, correct?” lawyers asked Joe Babcock, Epic’s CFO until March 2020, in a separate deposition. The answer was yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="24QQvj"&gt;Babcock explicitly confirmed that the iOS version of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; earned less revenue, month to month, than: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Pi5iD0"&gt;PlayStation 4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="C0aJSN"&gt;Xbox (presumably Xbox One)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="R4ma3j"&gt;Nintendo Switch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GOr3kk"&gt;PCs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="s46b3V"&gt;iOS’s low revenues compared to other platforms may not be entirely surprising, based on past comments from Epic CEO Tim Sweeney. &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.65.0.pdf"&gt;He said in a declaration&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on iOS represented 10 percent of the game’s total average daily players in the two years from when the game launched to when it was pulled from the App Store in August. And &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is considered to be a billion-dollar business all on its own: in 2019, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/2/21046920/fortnite-revenue-drop-superdata-nielsen-2019-earnings"&gt;reportedly brought in $1.8 billion in revenue&lt;/a&gt; all by itself. (Epic projected company-wide revenue of $3.85 billion in 2020, to give you some idea of how big &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is compared to, well, everything else Epic does.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q4Nq3g"&gt;Thanks to these court documents being released ahead of the trial, we now have a better idea of where &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; makes most of its money — and despite the huge amount of dollars flying around mobile games right now, PlayStation and Xbox seem to account for the bulk of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s earnings. They could make Epic’s choice to fight Apple and Google make a bit more sense — even if they alienate the app store companies, Epic can bank on Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo consoles continuing to rake in cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WgUrAn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VV5Lkh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s official Vtuber is part sheep and promotes anime</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A screenshot of Netflix’s video introducing N-Ko. It includes a picture of N-Ko and a description reading: “What is she? Sheep-human lifeform”" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e7lBgcBzpBJiYVSTVd7_k-7HUNg=/184x0:2134x1300/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69200679/n_ko.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Netflix’s Vtuber, N-Ko. | Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ECFRde"&gt;Netflix has joined the Vtuber trend, &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/n-ko-mei-kurono"&gt;unveiling a virtual streamer&lt;/a&gt; this week who will host a weekly show on the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBSs9x2KzSLhyyA9IKyt4YA"&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; to promote its original anime series. The character is named N-ko Mei Kurono, and Netflix describes her as the company’s “anime ambassador.” She also happens to be a “sheep-human lifeform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WV6Lgh"&gt; Vtubers, or “virtual YouTubers,” are animated hosts who often vlog on YouTube or stream on Twitch. In general, these characters are operated by a single human, who will use motion capture software (and sometimes a motion-capture outfit) to transform themselves into a cartoony character on-screen. Some Vtubers have become hugely popular over the past year, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21591488/projekt-melody-twitch-ban-copyright-strike-digitrevx-vtuber"&gt;Projekt Melody&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22370260/codemiko-twitch-interview-stream-technician"&gt;CodeMiko&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0aO27U"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rE0-583WBcw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xPLCAk"&gt;Netflix is using the trend as a way to promote its growing interest in anime. The company said recently that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/27/22353848/netflix-launch-anime-ragnarok-zeus-resident-evil-streaming"&gt;plans to launch 40 anime series&lt;/a&gt; in 2021, following a year in which “the amount of Anime watched” on its service doubled in the US. Netflix is about to debut &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22373405/yasuke-netflix-flying-lotus-interview"&gt;a new anime from Flying Lotus&lt;/a&gt;; a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406600/netflix-pretty-guardian-sailor-moon-eternal-the-movie"&gt;new &lt;em&gt;Sailor Moon &lt;/em&gt;movie&lt;/a&gt; is coming to the service in June; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22303713/netflix-terminator-anime-production-ig-announced-tv-series"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Terminator &lt;/em&gt;anime&lt;/a&gt; is now in the works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="luJjkg"&gt;N-ko, the Vtuber, is played by a Netflix employee who works on their anime lineup. Though her primary purpose is promoting Netflix series, she’s also trying to fit in with the rest of the Vtuber community and become a figure viewers might want to watch for herself. “I love singing, dancing, and getting a massage,” N-ko says, “but I don’t like writing kanji or anything that contains elements of horror.” She plans to upload videos highlighting new shows, collaborate with other Vtubers, and maybe sing songs and do video game commentary, too.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="o4yCkB"&gt;Many Verizon customers in Southern California reported difficulties making calls on Tuesday afternoon, and the company confirmed to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; at the time that was a “network issue” affecting voice services in parts of the region. That issue was resolved overnight, a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Wednesday morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y4u39G"&gt;During the outage, if you were having trouble making calls, the spokesperson recommended putting your device in airplane mode or restarting your phone, which they said should fix the issues. And in response to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VZWSupport/status/1387143438316064784"&gt;one person on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, Verizon’s support account recommended using Wi-Fi “if possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jrHKmG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We do apologize, Verizon is currently experiencing a wireless network issue in your area. Our technicians are aware of this issue and are working to resolve it quickly. It is best to use Wi-Fi if possible. Please also enable Data Roaming. *AOR&lt;/p&gt;— Verizon Wireless CS (@VZWSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VZWSupport/status/1387143438316064784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qx0gQT"&gt;On Tuesday, I found &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/carlisleshelley/status/1387139550410010627"&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GeorgeGoff20/status/1387140510335205377"&gt;examples&lt;/a&gt; of people &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RickyJimenez/status/1387140515435466752"&gt;reporting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tscarrithers/status/1387140551258951681"&gt;problems&lt;/a&gt; making phone calls in Southern California, but it wasn’t clear exactly how far the outage extended or exactly which areas might have been affected. Downdetector’s &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/verizon/map/"&gt;map of user reports&lt;/a&gt; strongly indicated that the outage is affected Los Angeles, San Diego, and the surrounding areas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="PSbVCq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 28th, 2:29PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added confirmation from Verizon that the outage was fixed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You’ll soon be able to teach Google Assistant how to pronounce names</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DnxwiJEmRj9DxUcb85nclwy_mmc=/0x0:2352x1568/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69200487/Screen_Shot_2021_04_28_at_11.01.22_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gXDpl6"&gt;Google Assistant is getting a better way to correct its name pronunciation, as well as improved contextual awareness when it comes to setting and changing timers with your voice. &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/assistant/loud-and-clear-ai-improving-assistant-conversations/"&gt;In the blog post announcing the changes&lt;/a&gt;, Google says they should be rolling out in the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n7nDBb"&gt;If Assistant has been pronouncing your name wrong, the new way to try to fix that is pretty simple: you can just say your name out loud, and Google will try to learn the pronunciation. The old way, which is still available for those who wanted it, required you to spell out the way you wanted your name pronounced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ysRHol"&gt;If you’re looking to try it for yourself, you can go to the Google Assistant settings, then Basic Info, then Nickname. It is worth noting that you can’t completely divorce your text name from the pronunciation — telling it to call me “Jennifer” while having my nickname as Mitchell resulted in it saying “Mithl” (like &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/LNzFqI6LfNw?t=119"&gt;Mithril&lt;/a&gt;, without the ri).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8uirJo"&gt;The blog post and video also show that this will work for other contacts, too — great if you have friends whose names the Assistant constantly mispronounces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rbWBvE"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Hw6sywPYY0?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KWT9vM"&gt;Google’s also adding more contextual awareness to timers, using its language understanding tech known as “BERT.” Practically, this should unlock all sorts of functionality: the ability to say things like “cancel my second timer,” and canceling named timers without having to use the exact name that you gave (the example Google uses in its video is canceling a timer called “boiled potatoes” by saying “cancel my boiling potato timer”). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KckUuH"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b9xXeXxxckc?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eNyhQ2"&gt;It should also fix a problem I’ve often run into: When you create an alarm, and then tell the Assistant to add an hour to it, it’ll most likely just create an alarm for an hour in the future. With the new language processing, it should understand that you actually want your alarm to go off an hour later than it was originally set for. It should also handle flubs better, like if you were to say “set a timer for five, no wait, nine minutes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qMcRMw"&gt;Google says that this sort of natural conversation should be coming to more areas of the Assistant soon. For now, it seems that most of the work is being done around timers, but who knows where it’ll come to next? Google Assistant has done a pretty good job of being conversational in web searches for a while now, but the BERT tech could make it even more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is finally fixing Windows 10 rearranging apps on multiple monitors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XeNHyi9Pmy-wc8G8XvauhLRkKU8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69200281/VRG_ILLO_4030_Windows_10_Guide_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vDGjU6"&gt;If you’re a Windows user and you use multiple monitors, you’ve probably experienced the headache of apps randomly rearranging when you resume from sleep. There have been a variety of ways to work around this over the years, but Microsoft is finally addressing it and fixing it in a future Windows 10 update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ArTIVM"&gt;“The technical terminology we use to describe this problem is known as Rapid Hot Plug Detect (Rapid HPD),” &lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/avoid-unexpected-app-rearrangement/"&gt;explains Michelle Xiong&lt;/a&gt;, a program manager on the graphics team at Microsoft. “This behavior impacts DisplayPort multi-monitor setups which results in unwanted desktop rearrangements.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KE9Cpx"&gt;This problem is particularly troublesome if you’re using a laptop with a secondary screen or an additional monitor goes into deep sleep and Windows thinks it has been unplugged. Windows will then go ahead and move all of your apps onto another screen, and you have to drag them all back manually. It’s a giant headache if you experience the issue daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hhPt8Y"&gt;Microsoft has been working on preventing Rapid HPD from rearranging Windows apps, and a fix is coming in the big Windows 10 update that’s due later this year. Windows Insiders can currently get access to this with build 21287 or above, but it does mean running a beta version of the OS on a device. Microsoft is expected to ship this final update in October, but if you can’t wait then you can go ahead and try it right now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to stream President Joe Biden’s first joint address to Congress</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-SUMMIT-CLIMATE-DIPLOMACY" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T8lzSlfosZ9pD8MZvhyVPmhephA=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69200123/1232457998.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9xeT4j"&gt;President Biden will deliver his first joint address to Congress on Wednesday. There will be an unusually small crowd in the House chamber due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, but the event will be streamed on social media platforms for viewers across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FdbH4N"&gt;Biden’s speech is expected to touch on a series of administration priorities, including the pandemic, immigration, and tax reform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BRyqC2"&gt;Here’s how to watch the address:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MNJuVw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW DO I WATCH THE ADDRESS?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Nr2GMa"&gt;Biden’s address will be broadcast across major networks such as CNN, Fox, NBC, PBS, and C-SPAN. The White House will also be streaming the event on its &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh87V3f0FaA"&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh87V3f0FaA"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;, and on Twitter from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/whitehouse"&gt;@WhiteHouse&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/potus"&gt;@POTUS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zcFqmR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/whitehouse"&gt;The Twitter stream&lt;/a&gt; will be accompanied by live on-screen “commentary” from administration officials and cabinet members, according to Rob Flaherty, White House director of digital strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oKbZV4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHEN DOES THE ADDRESS START?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0u6DF"&gt;Biden’s first joint address at the US Capitol will begin at 9PM ET on Wednesday, April 28th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="T7t3Bu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT FROM THE STATE OF THE UNION?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VFnUGN"&gt;It’s traditional for a president’s first address to Congress to be called a “joint address” rather than the State of the Union. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HuaXQK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
