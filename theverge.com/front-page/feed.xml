    <title>Canoo reveals a new electric delivery vehicle ahead of stock exchange debut</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i42TD1uioD1qsZz_GtbcLBNam2g=/318x0:2040x1148/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68528429/Canoo_MPDV_Exterior__14_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Canoo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xkrzpp"&gt;California EV startup Canoo has announced a new multipurpose electric vehicle aimed at last-mile deliveries and other small businesses, which starts at $33,000 but scales up in size and cost. Due in 2022, the vehicle is the centerpiece of what new executive chairman Tony Aquila told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;amounts to a “re-founding of the company” ahead of its debut on the NASDAQ stock exchange at the end of next week, thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/18/21374272/canoo-ev-startup-spac-ipo-reverse-merger"&gt;a reverse merger with a so-called blank check company&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xTJT4A"&gt;It’s Canoo’s second vehicle, following the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/24/20882538/canoo-evelozcity-ev-subsicrption-electric-vehicle"&gt;subscription-only van it debuted last year&lt;/a&gt;. Canoo still plans to make that EV — in fact, the new multipurpose vehicle is built on the same technological platform that Canoo developed for the van, and they share similar design features — but Aquila told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; the company’s immediate focus has changed. “When I invested in [Canoo], I didn’t invest in it for the lifestyle vehicle. To me, I saw that as a derivative, but that the real asset was this multipurpose delivery platform,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zysYWi"&gt;“The way I would look at it is this is a re-founding of the company, just kind of like Elon did to Tesla,” Aquila said, referring to how &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-the-origin-story-2014-10"&gt;Elon Musk got involved with the now-famous electric vehicle company shortly after its founding and changed its trajectory&lt;/a&gt;. Aquila, who comes from a finance and software background, invested $35 million in Canoo this summer through his firm before the merger and before he was elevated to chairman. “He put money in [Tesla], just like I did, became the chair, had a different vision, comes out of the tech world. So I can completely relate and appreciate what he’s done for the industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JZ1Ksp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Two models — small and big — with different battery pack options&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EdXnW4"&gt;The new vehicle will initially be sold in two variants, though Canoo says more will eventually be offered. The smaller one (which is the one that starts at $33,000) is 14.4 feet long, 6.4 feet wide, and 6.2 feet tall, and has 230 cubic feet of cargo space. Canoo will offer three different battery pack options, too: 40kWh (with an estimated 130 miles of range), 60kWh (190 miles), and 80kWh (230 miles). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DmBLZv"&gt;The company will also make a larger version that is 17.1 feet long, 7.2 feet wide, and 8.4 feet tall, with 500 cubic feet of cargo space, which Aquila said is “unheard of for this industry.” The same battery pack options will be available, though the range estimates drop to 90 miles, 140 miles, and 190 miles, respectively, thanks to the extra weight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="leNehU"&gt;The vehicle can be further customized from there, according to Canoo, which suggests options like storage lockers, a roll-up door, or ramps in its press release. Aquila said this kind of customization presents a “real gold opportunity ... to go after and bring EVs to the middle of America” by targeting small business owners who will want to switch to electric vehicles. He also claims it will help “return capital” to these vehicle owners (thanks to things like the low to no maintenance of EVs), to the tune of as much as $50,000 to $80,000 over seven years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I5zUPr"&gt;Canoo didn’t share details on pricing above the $33,000 base model. Limited deliveries will start in 2022 with wider production in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eoaubB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10232356"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CH6fvb"&gt;Debuting a second vehicle, spinning up a new business model, and evolving into a publicly traded company are major milestones for Canoo, which is only three years old. That said, the public listing comes as no surprise, as multiple EV startups (as well as other companies, including suppliers in the broader electric vehicle space) have been either prepping public listings or have already gone public during what’s become a bona fide gold rush — one fueled by Tesla’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/10/21286562/tesla-stock-most-valuable-automaker-slot-as-more-workers-contract-covid-19"&gt;soaring valuation&lt;/a&gt; as well as the sudden popularity of startups merging with these “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;special purpose acquisition companies&lt;/a&gt;,” or SPACs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="fWj3U0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Canoo has come a long way in just three years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="91H6Ji"&gt;Few startups have been able to follow Tesla into the electric vehicle space over the last decade. Most that have came from China and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/5/21274457/nio-q1-earnings-deliveries-chinese-government-investment-bailout"&gt;still have limited track records to boot&lt;/a&gt;. But this new wave of attention and funding could unlock the kind of money required for companies like Canoo to try their hand at the cash-hungry affair of vehicle design and manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PRgvdu"&gt;Canoo was founded in late 2017 by a few former BMW executives who had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/13/17111026/evelozcity-stefan-krause-interview-electric-cars"&gt;tried to pull buzzy but troubled EV startup Faraday Future&lt;/a&gt; out of a financial nosedive. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2017/12/12/16651026/faraday-future-investigation-money-debt-finances-yueting"&gt;Thwarted&lt;/a&gt; by Faraday Future’s founder, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2019/10/30/20879811/faraday-future-ceo-founder-jia-yueting-carsten-breitfeld-bankruptcy"&gt;stubborn Chinese tycoon Jia Yueting&lt;/a&gt;, those executives split off and created Evelozcity, which they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/25/18279906/new-ev-startup-canoo-will-only-sell-cars-on-a-subscription-basis"&gt;eventually rebranded to Canoo&lt;/a&gt;. Boosted by money from a touchscreen magnate in Taiwan, a financier with CCP ties in China, and a businessman in the UK close to Prince Andrew, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/8/20899436/discrimination-lawsuit-canoo-foreign-backers-ev-startup-british-chinese-government"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;first reported&lt;/a&gt;, Canoo assembled a team of around 300 people in Los Angeles to develop the electric van and its underlying technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Z1MdKY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Canoo’s first subscription-only EV is a refreshing rethink of the VW Microbus","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/24/20882538/canoo-evelozcity-ev-subsicrption-electric-vehicle"},{"title":"SPACs, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="zxtjxi"&gt;In August, Canoo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/18/21374272/canoo-ev-startup-spac-ipo-reverse-merger"&gt;announced the merger with the blank check company&lt;/a&gt;, Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp IV. The deal is expected to close next week, with Canoo becoming a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ under the ticker “CNOO.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zr8CQL"&gt;Canoo’s founders always intended to use the van’s modular platform to power other vehicles, but Aquila is supercharging that vision by accelerating those plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kqo1b0"&gt;With that in mind, there are changes being made to Canoo’s corporate structure. Ulrich Kranz, one of the BMW executives who co-founded Canoo and the current CEO, is no longer on the company’s board of directors. He’ll instead be a “special adviser” to Aquila, and while he’ll remain CEO, his contract was renegotiated and now includes language that accounts for the possibility of him being replaced, &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000121390020041124/f424b31220_hennessycapacq4.htm"&gt;according to filings&lt;/a&gt; with the Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pTm9WA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s like a baseball team. Everybody’s got to play their position.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PhfOzT"&gt;“I want to build a world class company here, and what I’ve said to everyone is, look, you’re going to go as far in this company and as big as this company as we all collectively do. But it’s like a baseball team. Everybody’s got to play their position and they’ve got to play it really well for every season, and those positions can change over time,” Aquila told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;when asked about Kranz’s new contract. “There’s definitely a role [for Kranz]. There’s definitely advice that can happen. But to scale an organization at this level, I mean, that’s a different experience than he has.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z723Qh"&gt;(For what it’s worth, if Kranz is removed as CEO but remains as Aquila’s adviser, his salary will more than triple from $648,000 to $2.5 million, per the agreement filed with the SEC.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E4cPaQ"&gt;Aquila also told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that one of Canoo’s founding investors, Pak Tam Li, will not be on the board despite owning between 32 and 36 percent of the company after the merger is complete, per SEC filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lO4kHS"&gt;Li, who also goes by Li Botan, heads up a &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/1940984/son-law-ex-senior-chinese-leader-jia-qinglin-named"&gt;massive investment firm in China&lt;/a&gt; and is the son-in-law of Jia Qinglin who was the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/29/world/asia/wang-jianlin-abillionaire-at-the-intersection-of-business-and-power-in-china.html"&gt;fourth-most senior leader in China&lt;/a&gt; before retiring in 2013. Aquila told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that this choice was made to avoid any trouble with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which has authority over deals that could be problematic from a national security standpoint. (Li’s involvement in Canoo was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/8/20899436/discrimination-lawsuit-canoo-foreign-backers-ev-startup-british-chinese-government"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last year&lt;/a&gt;.) “It’s best to be ahead of things rather than try to deal with them [after],” Aquila said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>We tested Harley-Davidson’s new Serial 1 electric bikes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mi2XNuXyXBcvqrAUYHFl9250uQA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68528385/ahawkins_201210_4346_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qnpg3e"&gt;After years in development, Harley-Davidson finally pulled back the curtain on its new lineup of electric bikes last month. The Serial 1 bikes won’t go on sale until spring 2021, but I got the chance to test-ride a few of them on a recent chilly afternoon in Brooklyn. And my initial impression is they totally live up to the hype. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mfcF43"&gt;A quick refresher for those who missed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21564315/harley-davidson-ebikes-serial-1-price-specs-date"&gt;the initial announcement&lt;/a&gt;: Serial 1 is a standalone electric bike company that spun out from Harley-Davidson last October. Initially, Serial 1 will sell four bikes, ranging in price from $3,399 to $4,999. The brand names are Mosh/Cty, a city bike, and the commuter Rush/Cty, which comes in three variants (regular, Step-Thru, and Speed). Each comes with a mid-drive motor capable of generating 250W of continuous power and hitting top speeds of 20mph — except for the Rush/Cty Speed, which can go faster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Eyq9ZT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I’ll admit, I was a little skeptical that Harley-Davidson could pull this off&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mFsFHu"&gt;I’ll admit, I was a little skeptical that Harley-Davidson could pull this off.  When you hear about companies that specialize in combustion engine vehicles releasing their own electric bikes, most of the time, it’s just a brand licensing deal. (Think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161230/jeep-ebike-electric-bike-quietkat-manufacturer-preorder-price-specs-date"&gt;Jeep’s e-bike&lt;/a&gt; or those &lt;a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/news030317-humbike/"&gt;Hummer bikes&lt;/a&gt; from last decade.) Other times, it’s a much-hyped project that ends up falling victim to larger corporate forces, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/12/21256722/gm-ariv-shuts-down-ebike-production-covid"&gt;General Motors’ Ariv e-bikes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ABZ3a5"&gt;But this is not that. These are e-bikes designed and crafted by a dedicated team of bike enthusiasts inside Harley-Davidson’s product development skunkworks. And that dedication and craftsmanship shine through in the final products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CJwDzU"&gt;Simply put, these are gorgeous bikes, with a clean design that threads all the wiring internally through the frame. The mid-drive Brose Mag S brushless internal motor was powerful and whisper-quiet. Both the motor and the battery are situated very low on the bike, much lower than normal. According to Serial 1’s product manager Aaron Frank, this creates an extra low center of gravity, which improves the handling and cornering.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9DvOcUfmGIm0dDRbUzQJtBOKSgI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22177007/ahawkins_201210_4346_0002.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aGdwin"&gt;“Harley-Davidson knows as much or more than anyone about designing and engineering a great-handling, very naturally responsive two-wheeled vehicle,” Frank told me. “And all of those lessons — from designing motorcycles about mass centralization, about consistent geometry, about ride handling — [were] applied to this vehicle, both at the design stage and in the testing stage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9gtimZ"&gt;I did most of my testing with the Rush/Cty Speed, which is the only Class 3 bike in the lineup. That meant a top speed of 28 mph, which had me frequently leaving &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; video team in the dust. (Sorry, Becca and Alix!) Thanks to the Enviolo automatic gear shifter, getting up to that top speed felt effortless. I hardly realized how fast I was going before glancing at the modestly sized Brose digital display. (I really liked the petite Brose display; too many drivetrain makers opt for oversized displays that are mostly unnecessary. Less is more, in my opinion.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NOum4srzo5YF7D1-TSgc4V4YRAo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22177010/ahawkins_201210_4346_0012.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k9liPP"&gt;I only had the bikes for a couple of hours, but it was my first experience with a CVT (continuous variable transmission) shifter. The rear hub Enviolo transmission is fully enclosed, electronically powered, and never needs maintenance. Using an app that connects to the bike via Bluetooth, you can set your ideal cadence so the bike always feels like it’s in the perfect gear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GEHYs8"&gt;I didn’t get a chance to futz with the settings, which was a little bit of a bummer because there were times I felt like I was spinning my legs like a pinwheel. Given more time with the bike, I would have loved to play around with that feature a little more and find the right setting for my riding style. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gkXI7w"&gt;The Mosh/Cty and Rush/Cty Step-Thru come with 529Wh battery packs, while the Rush/Cty and Rush/Cty Speed come with the more powerful 706Wh packs. The same team that developed the batteries for Harley-Davidson &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/14/20692388/harley-davidson-livewire-electric-motorcycle-test-drive"&gt;electric LiveWire motorcycles&lt;/a&gt; also developed these batteries. The integrated batteries are mounted very low on the frame, which helps with the mass centralization and improved handling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fKeSf9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One of the things that really surprised me was how well the bikes handled off-road&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dMaIcM"&gt;I can’t comment on the Serial 1’s charging time or range estimates, as I didn’t have long enough with the bikes to go the necessary limits. Depending on the power level, the Mosh/Cty is supposed to get 35–105 miles of range, while the Rush/Cty variants each get about 25–115 miles of range. That’s a pretty huge disparity, but a lot will depend on what power level you’re using. The higher the level, the less range you can expect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CeOr8P"&gt;One of the things that really surprised me was how well the bikes handled off-road, especially considering Serial 1 is marketing them (specifically the Mosh/Cty) as “the ultimate urban playbike.” Granted, this is only based on a few minutes riding over tree roots and wet leaves in Prospect Park, but the Rush/Cty Speed was nimble and handled better than expected. That said, I don’t expect to be popping wheelies anytime soon like &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzP-fwPJNxs"&gt;the actor in the Serial 1-produced promo video&lt;/a&gt; — at least not right away.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wes6fT"&gt;The tires are Schwalbe Super Moto-X, and they come in two sizes: 27.5 x 2.4-inch and 27.5 x 2.8-inch. But one of the bike’s best features is a built-in 620 cubic-centimeter storage space at the base of the downtube, which should be enough room to store &lt;a href="https://mobil.abus.com/uk/on-road/Locks/Folding-Locks"&gt;an Abus folding lock&lt;/a&gt;. Think of it as your bike’s glove compartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JdVHwd"&gt;But forget all of that for a minute: are they worth $3,000 to $5,000? That’s the real question. There are plenty of e-bikes — really good ones, too — that can be had for much cheaper. And those bikes don’t come with all of the baggage of having the Harley-Davidson name on the chainstay. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nUlJ73NupdFkfayE-o9Co4BDO_g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22177009/ahawkins_201210_4346_0009.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ik9xW426fAHkl-juktaZnKgVSqo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22177008/ahawkins_201210_4346_0007.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kG3T3b"&gt;Serial 1 won’t be competing with budget e-bikes from Swagtron or Lectric or modestly priced e-bikes from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21299601/rad-power-bike-radmission-electric-bike-ebike-price-specs"&gt;Rad Power Bikes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21227976/vanmoof-s3-electric-bike-review-price-specs"&gt;VanMoof&lt;/a&gt;, or Blix. Rather, the company is taking aim at major manufacturers like Giant, Trek, and Specialized, which sell premium e-bikes for high-end customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wpncOU"&gt;Bikes from those companies sporting similar parts cost about the same as Serial 1’s bikes. If Harley-Davidson wants to go helmet to helmet with those major manufacturers, it has the name recognition and cultural capital to do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C06Gd8"&gt;“This isn’t just about a short-term, opportunistic grab at a moment in marketing or something,” Frank told me. “We’re very, very dedicated to building a permanent place for Serial 1 in this bicycle business.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now try on makeup from your home with the power of AR</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Image of the new model view and the Try it on button" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P4CNzH9Xk4Z04G3odXu1YowZqe8=/0x477:1125x1227/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68528357/IMG_0322.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gGKckP"&gt;Google’s new shopping feature will let people virtually try on makeup, the company announced in a blog post. Another feature will show the products on various models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3zYwjH"&gt;Only lipstick and eyeshadow are part of the feature. It is also limited to a few brands, such as L’Oreal, MAC Cosmetics, Black Opal, and Charlotte Tilbury.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Gif of a user swiping through various models and seeing what different shades of eye shadow look like on them" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4XofV9dW0JxlwJqNUNERs5WukHo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22176470/E814_AR_Beauty_Gifs_Eyes_v03.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can see what various shades look like on various skin tones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NhnEt5"&gt;To try it out, you can search for the line you’re eying. If it’s a supported brand, you’ll see a new card that shows a model, and the specific shade that they’re wearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KguuBW"&gt;To change the shade, you use a list at the bottom; to change the model, you use the list at the top. It looks like Google and their partners have included models with a pretty wide range of skin tones to make it easier to find someone who matches you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AlnjZx"&gt;If you want to see what it would look like on &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, there’s be a “Try it on” button. Clicking that will launch the camera, and then digitally apply the makeup. As with the models, you can change shades.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Photo of someone with digitally added makeup" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QXYdllHBeJZD3FgInSgaNhF_GsE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22176522/IMG_0321.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The interface lets you choose which color you’d like to “try on”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A comparison of the same makeup using Google’s AR preview and the real thing " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MzOcw9UFd3GY5ULSHRSfV5cxZQM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22177041/IMG_0324.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Mitchell Clark&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the left is the AR preview of NYX’s Vivid Brights Sugar Rush eye shadow, and on the right is me actually wearing NYX’s Vivid Brights Sugar Rush.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zO2ZW8"&gt;(It’s worth noting that my makeup skills are a bit rusty, but you can get the idea of how well the shade maps into real life.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vpTmtq"&gt;The facial tracking works about the same as a Snapchat filter, which is to say pretty well, but not perfectly. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Picture of the app where it was trying to add eye shadow to my upper lip" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aa_7DebHjTtPol4cgSQcv4ZMvFk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22176511/IMG_0319.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like any AR, it’s not perfect.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4NWmEy"&gt;This feature is rolling out when people may be hesitant to go to a physical store and use a communal tester. I didn’t order the products, so I can’t say how true the AR is to real life, but it should at least give you a better idea of how the shade will work with whatever look you’re going for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jV4FA7"&gt;Google has some examples in their blog posts of what you can try on. Some of the ones I found the most striking were the Stila Glitter and Glow and NYX Vivid Brights Creme eyeshadows, and the Revlon Lip Polish Vinyl Ultra HD lipstick  — talk about a name that appeals to tech enthusiasts.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GoPro Remote launches alongside camera updates for faster data transfer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xc9i9DJwucjs-R6w_e0jGfjDCUI=/0x1318:7680x6438/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68528424/The_Remote_Product_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new GoPro Remote costs $79.99.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: GoPro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="09K8E9"&gt;GoPro just announced a new $79.99 wireless remote control alongside free firmware updates that bring performance and feature improvements to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437419/gopro-hero-9-review"&gt;Hero 9 Black&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20891984/gopro-hero8-black-review-action-camera-image-stabilization-price-specs-features"&gt;Hero 8 Black&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/22/20921641/gopro-max-review-360-camera-specs-price-features-test-video"&gt;Max&lt;/a&gt; cameras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OJFHHa"&gt;The miniature Remote, as it’s called, is both rugged and waterproof to a depth of 16 feet. It features large glove-friendly buttons and a status display to see what mode your camera is in. One Remote can control common camera features like on / off, shutter button control, and mode changing for up to five cameras within a distance of about 200 feet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YV4OZNVWUnfLc7DlJGSuhff3LQM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22177156/The_Remote_Bike.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: GoPro&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Remote makes it easy to control your GoPro camera when mounted on a helmet, for example.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="u5Izga"&gt;The Remote can be attached to your wrist, control bar, or steering wheel, for example, offering remote control of GoPro’s Hero 9 Black, Hero 8 Black, or Max mounted to your helmet, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BvPoFk0lFFH/"&gt;kite lines&lt;/a&gt;, or roll bar — anywhere you want just so long as the camera is within range of the Bluetooth LE signal. Older GoPro cameras are not compatible with the new Remote which supplants GoPro’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgopro.com%2Fen%2Fus%2Fshop%2Fmounts-accessories%2Fsmart-remote%2FARMTE-002.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F17%2F22180159%2Fgopro-remote-firmware-1-5-faster-content-trasfer#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Smart Remote&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7mhz4p"&gt;GoPro is also rolling out firmware updates for the Hero 9 Black, Hero 8 Black, and Max cameras today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EmDJzm"&gt;Hero 9 Black owners will see the most dramatic improvements after installing the version 1.5 update. Changes include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ANqI0H"&gt;Up to 30 percent faster wireless data transfer from the camera to the GoPro app on phones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xNaOXd"&gt;Compatibility with new Remote&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="J150hZ"&gt;Improved HyperSmooth 3.0 cold-weather performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KGF67S"&gt;A shortcut slider button for slow-motion capture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qHyNIJ"&gt;Improved GPS accuracy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Lwblnp"&gt;Improved live streaming with the Max Lens Mod&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LcSGzY"&gt;Pro 3.5mm Mic Adapter support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="zRJz2p"&gt;In addition to adding support for the new Remote, GoPro says the new Hero 8 Black firmware can boost wireless transfer speeds by up to 15 percent, while Max data transfers are improved by up to 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="11WhnR"&gt;The firmware updates are available now at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gopro.com&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F17%2F22180159%2Fgopro-remote-firmware-1-5-faster-content-trasfer#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GoPro’s website&lt;/a&gt; or via its app. The $79.99 Remote is available to buy in North America starting today, but won’t be available elsewhere until February.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why Hades is my game of the year </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YUp0gw7JXV3BkHpKKnwIFHYkAEc=/200x0:1280x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68528301/hades_switch_screenshot06.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pek01f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;One more try. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KISPlX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496904/hades-supergiant-games-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a game that does so many things so well, it’s hard to describe them all. It’s a fine-tuned isometric action game that takes the elaborate interweaving systems and combat of Supergiant’s previous titles to soaring new heights. It’s a roguelike that transcends the limitations of the genre with great &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21507969/hades-supergiant-endgame-storytelling-narrative-rewards"&gt;storytelling&lt;/a&gt;. It’s one of the most compelling personal dramas told in a video game this year — all of it polished to a dazzling, mirror-like shine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="A3fWmo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Hades is a roguelike with hot gods to kiss and kill","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496904/hades-supergiant-games-review-nintendo-switch"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="s9kekO"&gt;If &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt; had only done one of these things well, it would have been a great game. The fact that it manages to do all of them, though, without missing a single beat, makes it the best game I’ve played this year. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OAG-DGboBub0jbvPkQMHhujK8xk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22151708/hades_switch_screenshot03.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="m3OUA6"&gt;In many ways, &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt; feels like the culmination of developer Supergiant’s previous titles. It merges them into a cohesive whole: the fast-paced isometric action and omnipresent narration that were the hallmarks of &lt;em&gt;Bastion&lt;/em&gt;, the customization of &lt;em&gt;Transistor&lt;/em&gt;, and the emphasis on worldbuilding and storytelling that’s been the throughline throughout all its titles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0pd3mO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;In ‘Hades,’ death isn’t failure&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UULITJ"&gt;But the core idea is “one more try.” One more attempt to clear another room. To beat the next boss. To reach the next zone. To unlock a new weapon, skill, or ability that will help you on the next one. To hear a new story from a friend or loved one. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21502405/hades-death-try-something-new-supergiant-games"&gt;And on and on and on&lt;/a&gt;, until “one more try” has turned into 10, it's two in the morning, and you’re still dueling with the denizens of the underworld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xficI7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt; doles out its story in generous doses as players are regaled by their relatives on Mount Olympus and through interactions back at the starting hub on each run. It makes you &lt;em&gt;care&lt;/em&gt; about the other denizens of the underworld. I wanted to help my weary mentor Achilles reunite with his lost lover; I plied my fluffy dog Cerberus with gifts and pets because they are such a good boy. Death isn’t failure; it’s a chance to spend time with the friends (and frenemies) that populate the House of Hades, too. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/inE0ybo2kyR2SoSipBpKVUCA9tk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22151710/hades_switch_screenshot05.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ppeODQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt; is a great action roguelike on its own. The hack-and-slash combat, the variety of weapons (there are six, each with four different forms that radically change how you can play), and the dizzying amount of abilities and modifiers that are gifted by the gods of Olympus ensure that no two runs are quite the same. The game also cleverly incentivizes players to try new weapons and abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7u7Ym8"&gt;Those abilities play off each other in delightful ways, and there’s no “right” combination. Some of my earliest successes were with builds that at first seemed like they would be utterly useless, like abilities that only activate when I take damage, but then a later boon activates them automatically every few seconds, turning me into a passive damage powerhouse. Even dozens of hours in, I still am surprised when the game will toss out strange combinations that result in powerful synergies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kt9WDj"&gt;The magic of &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt; isn’t just the variety of its gameplay or the satisfaction of perfectly clearing a room or boss battle. It’s how the game pushes you to try just one more loop, promising more information on the family drama of Zagreus, Hades, and the rest of the Olympians or the tantalizing chance of finally breaking out of the underworld this time. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j4okqAxTwJXFiETreDF7XALEDJY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22151711/hades_switch_screenshot01.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="b3Xd7K"&gt;Just one more run. One more line of dialogue. One more try. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CXV7fk"&gt;(It helps, of course, that every inch of &lt;em&gt;Hades’&lt;/em&gt; artwork is lush and detailed, with gorgeous characters that make spending hours battling through the underworld a delight.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KsPIlP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Just one more run, one more line of dialogue, one more try&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g2QEL2"&gt;And much like the ritual lord of the underworld himself, the game is hard — but fair. In my dozens of runs throughout hell, I’ve rarely felt like I was unfairly cheated with bad boons or cheap deaths. &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt; rewards players for learning how each enemy and boss fights, how its abilities can combine, but it doesn’t punish players for not mastering the twitch-fast dashes and dodges. In fact, in a welcome move, &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt; offers a God Mode setting that buffs player’s damage resistance and makes sure the entire game is more accessible to all players. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PhiIAl"&gt;“One more time,” Zagreus mutters when he starts his next attempt to battle his way out of hell. &lt;em&gt;One more run&lt;/em&gt;, I think to myself in response, knowing that it’ll absolutely not be the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zheuSu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TR6cJn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hollywood wasn’t built for a year without theaters</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6_1dnevn7xUNyzc8Q83eILWJX8A=/66x0:1400x889/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68528243/tenet.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Warner Bros.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XTmWub"&gt;Hollywood scheduling has always run like a finely tuned watch: a delicate dance of release dates as studios try to optimize movies for the most money, avoiding other massive blockbusters, while juggling the shifting demands of film editing, reshoots, and special effects work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NSORVQ"&gt;But the shuttering of theaters by the pandemic has thrown all of that into disarray, forcing studios to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/12/21176895/fast-and-furious-f9-delay-universal-coronavirus-vin-diesel"&gt;shift release dates&lt;/a&gt; in a chaotic cascade. Each change has ripple effects due to that strict schedule: when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21437889/black-widow-delayed-release-date-marvel-cinematic-universe-disney-streaming-mulan"&gt;one massive superhero film moves dates&lt;/a&gt;, it trickles down the line, forcing both movies from within the studio and from competitors to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21503618/the-batman-matrix-4-release-dates-warner-bros"&gt;shuffle their dates&lt;/a&gt; to avoid risking splitting their audiences (and box office takes). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5JDav1"&gt;Small delays turned into large ones; films that were scheduled for 2020 jumped to 2021. And yet, in all the uncertainty, it seemed that studios were extremely reluctant to turn to what might have seemed like an obvious solution: just releasing their biggest films on any of the newly minted streaming services or digital video storefronts in lieu of a theatrical release. The current model of Hollywood just wasn’t built to survive without theaters. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zxT0YlLT9Cw718R8-sS0W2KDitc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16199970/AvengersEndgame5cbe860b2f312.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Film Frame / Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TFiFwA"&gt;There’s a simple explanation for Hollywood’s hesitation to embrace streaming: theaters are &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/is-netflix-killing-the-movie-theater-not-so-fast/2018/12/24/7a16dbf8-037a-11e9-8186-4ec26a485713_story.html"&gt;where the money&lt;/a&gt; is, and &lt;a href="https://medium.com/swlh/one-clear-casualty-of-the-streaming-wars-profit-683304b3055d"&gt;streaming&lt;/a&gt; — at least in today’s world — &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/23/why-hollywood-is-sticking-with-movie-theaters-and-not-streaming.html"&gt;can’t match that revenue&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJCvPo"&gt;Traditional theater chains like AMC and Regal Cinemas still wield immense power over the current movie landscape. The amount of money they bring in to studios is great enough that companies like Disney and Warner Bros. are willing to forgo close to half of their revenue (theaters typically keep roughly 45 percent of the box office). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QngZzN"&gt;When Universal began to even mutter about the idea of releasing some of its films on streaming alongside theaters, AMC CEO Adam Aron went to near total war, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21240637/amc-theaters-universal-trolls-world-tour-disney-warnermedia-digital-streaming"&gt;threatening to no longer play any of its films&lt;/a&gt;. The two companies have since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21345713/amc-universal-movies-theaters-digital-rentals-pvod-streaming-agreement"&gt;reached a new deal&lt;/a&gt; to allow for Universal’s films to debut on streaming services just 17 days after they debut in theaters — an unprecedented time frame for major films — in exchange for giving AMC a cut of the digital take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v1IVf6"&gt;There’s also the prestige of being a “theatrical” movie, one that remains a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21240422/oscars-streaming-theaters-rules-2021-netflix-digital-release-academy"&gt;requirement for eligibility&lt;/a&gt; for major awards like the Oscars. Years on, companies like Netflix and Amazon are still trying to work their way out of the reputation that streaming is somehow a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/18/18229794/steven-spielberg-streaming-theatrical-films-netflix-roma"&gt;lesser form of entertainment&lt;/a&gt;. Smaller movies have done well in the chaos — some, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21239703/trolls-world-tour-amc-digital-streaming-theaters-nbcuniversal-disney-warnerbros"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trolls: World Tour&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, have even defied expectations. But barring a few notable exceptions, major studios haven’t been willing to risk their billion-dollar films on the unproven marketplace of direct-to-consumer sales or streaming. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/brLHsvJc8MeS64QD43qRKhk5GYE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19932674/trolls_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fHTH9i"&gt;Because it’s true: today’s biggest blockbusters rake in more — like last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18513309/avengers-endgame-spoiler-free-review-marvel-cinematic-universe-iron-man-thor-captain-america-phase-4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which smashed through the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/21/20702651/avengers-endgame-avatar-biggest-movie-box-office-comic-con-phase-4"&gt;all-time box office record&lt;/a&gt; and made an astronomical $2.79 billion. But these massive films also bring with them eye-watering costs: &lt;em&gt;Endgame&lt;/em&gt; is estimated to have cost roughly $400 million when factoring in the production budget, multimillion-dollar salaries for stars like Robert Downey Jr., and the &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2019/04/avengers-endgame-mcdonalds-google-coca-cola-ultra-beauty-audi-all-time-record-marketing-campaign-videos-1202595738/"&gt;massive marketing campaign&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mmym67"&gt;But the shuttering of theaters has effectively frozen the entire business in stasis as studios struggle to figure out what exactly to do with their multimillion-dollar investments that have no clear release strategy anymore. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x9KLnkBPzqvZK_uPwucXyWhGeGs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19954729/tenet_1.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PHsaFo"&gt;Take Warner Bros.’ &lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt;, for example. The blockbuster Christopher Nolan film was supposed to be one of the studio’s biggest movies of the year, an event that — in a normal world — would have brought huge crowds to theaters and was projected to rake in $1 billion at the box office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jou6XT"&gt;Instead, &lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt; was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/26/21304259/warner-bros-tenet-delay-date-disney-mulan-theaters-reopening#:~:text=Warner%20Bros.%20has%20announced%20that,spike%20around%20the%20United%20States."&gt;delayed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/12/21250529/tenet-movie-delay-release-date-christopher-nolan-robert-pattinson-disney-universal-warner-bros"&gt;delayed&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/20/21331356/tenet-delayed-warner-bros-christopher-nolan-international-disney"&gt;delayed again&lt;/a&gt; before it finally attempted to release while coping with the severe limitations of COVID. But even then, theater capacities (and therefore, ticket prices) were cut down a fraction of their usual numbers for safety purposes, some of the biggest theater marketplaces in the world, like New York City or Los Angeles, never saw it on the big screen at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Gr9aZ"&gt;The results are staggering: while &lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt; grossed a more than respectable $300 million in international markets, &lt;a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl1442940417/weekend/"&gt;it’s made just $57 million in the US&lt;/a&gt; — a considerable decrease, given the &lt;a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2020/01/tenet-budget-205-million-christopher-nolan-plan-1202202123/"&gt;estimated $205 million production budget&lt;/a&gt; that Warner Bros. invested in the film (a figure that doesn’t even include the film’s marketing spend).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x5qWwk"&gt;With results like that, it’s no wonder that most of 2020’s biggest films have elected to punt on their releases and rescheduled for 2021 and beyond. When gambling hundreds of millions of dollars on a single release, studios can’t afford to risk another theatrical flop in the United States from 2020’s anemic audiences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iea48K"&gt;But simply stockpiling movies isn’t the answer, either. Each of these films is an investment of tens, if not hundreds of millions of dollars that studios need to at least recoup at some point and which theaters need to stay open. It’s a delicate balance: the movie industry &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514822/amc-theaters-cash-movies-delays-closing-pandemic-debt-regal"&gt;needs money in the short term to survive&lt;/a&gt;, but it is also designed to run on hundreds of millions in revenue, which theatrical releases in 2020 just haven’t been able to provide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pKmEJO"&gt;The model is already changing, and studios and theaters alike are starting to experiment with new ways of doing things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dVuvTG"&gt;Disney shifted the release of major films like &lt;em&gt;Hamilton&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Soul&lt;/em&gt; to Disney Plus, and it’s experimenting with a new Premiere Access for releasing big films for higher digital price tags instead of traditional theatrical releases. Though, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2020/11/mulan-pvod-bob-chapek-revenue-viewership-1234613878/#:~:text=Disney%2B%20reported%2073.7%20million%20subscribers,with%20525%20million%20minutes%20viewed."&gt;it’s not clear&lt;/a&gt; how well (or poorly) the live-action &lt;em&gt;Mulan&lt;/em&gt; actually did in terms of revenue for the company. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rzNnVZFzGddRF5dcdBUvKzpDNvs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21874479/wonder_woman.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GMtCmq"&gt;Warner Bros. appears to have learned from its lackluster &lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt; strategy and is trying a different approach for both the highly anticipated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21504152/wonder-woman-1984-release-delay-new-date-warner-bros-disney-black-widow-dune-tenet"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;&lt;em&gt;every single one of its 2021 films&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Starting this December, and going through the end of 2021, Warner Bros. will release its movies both in theaters (where possible) and on the company’s streaming service HBO Max. It’s a move that theoretically will give the studio the best of both worlds, capitalizing on the high ticket revenue of traditional theaters while still letting it reach audiences that can’t, or simply won’t, go to a theater during a pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="B5ULzG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Warner Bros. will release all of its new 2021 movies simultaneously on HBO Max","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="cwjuK4"&gt;All of these approaches are still largely untested, mainly because of the huge risk involved: no one wanted to gamble their possible billion-dollar movie, at least not until absolutely necessary. And it’s not clear whether any of them will be able to offer results on par with traditional theaters. In 2019, the global box office hit an &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8547827/2019-global-box-office-revenue-hit-record-425b-despite-4-percent-dip-in-us"&gt;astonishing $42.5 billion worldwide&lt;/a&gt; — big shoes that these new methods will have to fill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1jvF5"&gt;2020 has shown that Hollywood wasn’t designed for a world without theaters. But 2021 might show us the first glimpse at a world of movies that extends far beyond the walls of a traditional movie theater. But one thing’s for sure: however we watch the movies of the future, it’ll look very different from the last century of film.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>In 2021, we need to fix America’s internet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6J_fP3a461Ah3Z-rAteG9fJUMOk=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68528179/VRG_ILLO_4341_American_Ethernet.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;We pay twice as much as Europe for high speeds, assuming we can even get them&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="2PG4GB"&gt;Every few months it’ll send me a postcard. Once, in the midst of the pandemic, it even sent salespeople to my door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zsCNQ9"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T wants to sell me 1,000Mbps fiber-optic internet, and I’m beyond ready to pay for it. In fact, I’ve already signed the contract at least nine times now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PVo94Z"&gt;But like tens of millions of my fellow citizens across the United States, I don’t actually have the ability to switch. Across the country, the FCC and internet service providers are pretending there’s competition in an unimaginable number of places where it doesn’t actually exist. It’s a nationwide problem, but one that I’m experiencing even in the Silicon Valley — where you’d think the internet might be better.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Nine Gmail subject lines that say “Hello, review your AT&amp;amp;amp;T order”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RKIwBfUbMUmD1Ck9ere_omo4i-Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22173217/att_order_fiber_optic.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I ordered AT&amp;amp;T Fiber at least nine times. It never rejected me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lCHBBU"&gt;Today, I pay $100 a month for Comcast internet, and the cable company’s speeds leave something to be desired. My wife, a video producer, can’t reliably upload her company’s videos to its FTP servers. The family videos we shoot on our smartphones take hours to appear in Google Photos, and there’s no point in me even trying to stream games to YouTube or Twitch. While my download speed is decent at 200Mbps, the uploads are absolutely atrocious at just 5Mbps up, and I’d have to pay Comcast even more to change that. And my bill has already gone up: I paid $70 until the pandemic hit and we started running into Comcast’s completely arbitrary 1.2TB data cap. Now, I have to pay extra for unlimited so I don’t rack up overage fees every single month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G5BOht"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T seems like the obvious answer. The company’s fiber network offers 1,000Mbps downloads &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; 1,000Mbps uploads for $70 a month, no data cap whatsoever. Competition is good, eh? The only problem is that AT&amp;amp;T doesn’t actually serve my address... even though it continues to insist it does. The company’s field technicians have visited my home easily a dozen times now, but their conclusion is always the same: AT&amp;amp;T buried its fiber in the wrong place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6mJnjH"&gt;A few houses down from me, there’s a concrete cover embedded in the pavement. If you look underneath, you’ll find a fiber-optic node labeled with my exact street address. It’s supposed to be in front of my home; AT&amp;amp;T’s service maps say it’s in front of my home, but those maps are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Walking down the sidewalk, you can see chalk arrows pointing from one box to another." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ypZNpnDiFScppZzx9FgSLTgd3GI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22173278/sidewalk_run_3.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF by Sean Hollister/The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where AT&amp;amp;T’s fiber should be vs. where it actually is. One day, I walked outside to find these chalk arrows connecting the two — false hope, sadly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JmFbO9"&gt;The more grizzled AT&amp;amp;T vets warned me I’d get no satisfaction from AT&amp;amp;T. They told me it was illegal to run wires over my particular street — and that there was little to no chance AT&amp;amp;T would spend $10,000+ to dig up the sidewalk just to serve more houses on my side of the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kQQ4C4"&gt;Some friendly techs filed dig tickets anyhow! I was told at least twice it was actually going to happen. (AT&amp;amp;T sales reps told me it had &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; happened according to their records.) Once, I even got an actual notice from AT&amp;amp;T than my order had been canceled. But every other time, I’d call weeks later to find out my order had simply, quietly vanished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="suBfFz"&gt;If the company wasn’t going to give me internet, why couldn’t it remove me from its marketing lists? Why couldn’t it simply update its maps? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M1TO0q"&gt;That last question, it turns out, is far bigger than I imagined. It may help explain why America’s internet is so broken to begin with, and get us on the path to fixing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NIKe2F"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21183589/fcc-commissioner-jessica-rosenworcel-homework-gap-editorial-wifi-hotspots-coronavirus"&gt;As FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel wrote&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last March, as many as one in three US households doesn’t have broadband internet access, currently defined as just 25Mbps down and 3Mbps up — which feels like the bare minimum for a remote learning family these days. Even before the pandemic, that statistic might have been shocking; now, it’s the difference between whether millions of schoolchildren can attend classes and do their homework or not. Nearly 12 million children don’t have a broadband connection at home, &lt;a href="https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/democrats/2018/12/axios-the-homework-gap-12-million-schoolchildren-lack-internet"&gt;the Senate Joint Economic Committee reported&lt;/a&gt; in 2017. And the “homework gap” hits harder if you’re poor, of course: only 56 percent of households with incomes under $30,000 had broadband as of last February, &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/internet-broadband/"&gt;according to the Pew Research Center&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kLOPv9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"America’s internet wasn’t prepared for online school","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21504476/online-school-covid-pandemic-rural-low-income-internet-broadband"},{"title":"As classes move online, many students aren’t coming with them","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21239567/remote-school-distance-learning-digital-internet-tech-gap-devices-access"},{"title":"Both parties want rural broadband.

&lt;p id="YuxVdB"&gt;In 2009, the US spent $350 million on a “National Broadband Map” that turned out to be nothing more &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/24/17882842/us-internet-broadband-map-isp-fcc-wireless-competition"&gt;than a chance for the wolves to guard the hens&lt;/a&gt;: it relied on ISPs like Comcast and AT&amp;amp;T to &lt;em&gt;submit their own data&lt;/em&gt;, which the FCC &lt;em&gt;does not audit.&lt;/em&gt; According to the FCC’s map, I have 11 different broadband providers at my address! But if you break it down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="flJ88y"&gt;Two of them are “fixed wireless” that cater to businesses, not homes, one of which starts at $99 a month for 3Mbps (not a typo)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kznsJ7"&gt;Two of them are slow, data-capped satellite internet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eGKJZk"&gt;Four of them are duplicates of the same providers (including three different tiers of AT&amp;amp;T DSL)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bhGTq0"&gt;Two of them don’t offer service at my address at all&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Cf7ysq"&gt;That leaves me with just Comcast — and you with the reason why the United States and its ISP lobbyists get to &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/new-report-suggests-fcc-massively-overstated-gigabit-co-1845842681/amp?__twitter_impression=true"&gt;pretend they’re doing a decent job&lt;/a&gt;, even when there’s no meaningful competition. About 88.3 million Americans only have a single choice of broadband provider, &lt;a href="https://ilsr.org/report-most-americans-have-no-real-choice-in-internet-providers/"&gt;according to the Institute for Local Self-Reliance&lt;/a&gt;, because their other choice is DSL that doesn’t even meet the FCC’s own definition of broadband at 25Mbps down / 3Mbps up. That’s effectively a monopoly, and the report claims 22 million of them are dependent on Comcast alone. And those are *low* estimates, by the way, because they’re based on the same faulty, self-reported data as the FCC’s terrible maps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XKaoeP"&gt;When Comcast knows you have no other alternative, it can get away with things you’d never see anywhere else. Exhibit A: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21591420/comcast-cap-data-1-2tb-home-users-internet-xfinity#:~:text=Next%2520year%252C%2520Comcast%2520plans%2520to%2Cother%2520parts%2520of%2520the%2520country.&amp;amp;text=Customers%2520will%2520be%2520notified%2520as%2520they%2520approach%2520the%25201.2TB%2520threshold."&gt;the 1.2TB home internet data caps&lt;/a&gt; it’s about to erect in a dozen additional states next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wxzCr4ydQnWeWDz6KzcGC8Tp_I4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13070431/DSCF0919.0.1482423018.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dAvi7k"&gt;Forget for a moment that Comcast itself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/smart-home/2015/11/7/9687976/comcast-data-caps-are-not-about-fixing-network-congestion"&gt;was caught red-handed&lt;/a&gt; explaining that data caps have nothing to do with network congestion. Forget that the CEOs of several smaller ISPs &lt;a href="https://money.com/internet-data-caps-bogus-ploys/"&gt;have admitted that internet capacity is anything but scarce&lt;/a&gt;. Forget that Comcast &lt;em&gt;disabled its own congestion management system&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/06/comcast-says-it-doesnt-throttle-heaviest-internet-users-anymore/"&gt;because it found it was unnecessary&lt;/a&gt;. Forget even that Comcast is a wildly profitable company whose cable division spends &lt;a href="https://www.cmcsa.com/news-releases/news-release-details/comcast-reports-4th-quarter-and-full-year-2019-results"&gt;&lt;em&gt;only a tenth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of its yearly revenues on keeping that network strong. The proof that data caps are a swindle is something you probably witnessed yourself earlier this year: Comcast, AT&amp;amp;T, and T-Mobile all &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21179330/comcast-t-mobile-coronavirus-data-caps-hotspots-fcc"&gt;suspended their data caps&lt;/a&gt; when the pandemic hit, and the internet kept on working without a hitch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e7rbGk"&gt;But Comcast’s generosity didn’t last for long. Now, with cases and deaths repeatedly hitting record highs in the United States, tens of millions of Americans out of work, and many of them &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/12/07/unemployed-debt-rent-utilities/"&gt;thousands of dollars behind on rent&lt;/a&gt;, the ISP is so unconcerned about angry customers that it’s bringing those data caps to even more states. AT&amp;amp;T, to its credit, extended its initial data cap waiver through the end of the year — but that wasn’t enough to pressure Comcast to do the same. Comcast’s waiver expired on July 1st, alongside most other ISPs, and now it’s back to extracting money hand over fist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZr8DU"&gt;Exhibit B: Though the United States once led development of the world’s internet, we now pay more than the rest of the developed world on average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="qH0RSN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;We pay twice as much as Europe for high-speed internet — before you even count caps and fees&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W4Aq7i"&gt;We consistently pay more than Europe regardless of speed, according to a fascinating, approachable &lt;a href="https://www.newamerica.org/oti/reports/cost-connectivity-2020/global-findings"&gt;study you should read from&lt;/a&gt; the New America think tank. In fact, we pay &lt;em&gt;roughly double &lt;/em&gt;that of Europe at the 100Mbps and 1,000Mbps tiers, and eight to 17 times more to rent a modem on average than Asia and Europe do, respectively. Only one US city cracked the top ten in affordability but only because it had &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90416863/the-city-with-the-best-fiber-optic-network-in-america-might-surprise-you"&gt;an ace up its sleeve&lt;/a&gt;: a municipal fiber-optic network erected by the city itself, where ISPs provide their services across fiber that the residents themselves own. Those sorts of municipal networks create competition that simply doesn’t exist in many places in the US &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/1/8321437/maps-show-why-internet-is-more-expensive-us-europe-competition"&gt;because it wasn’t designed to exist&lt;/a&gt;. In places that do erect municipal networks, New America shows that both speed and affordability far outpace the rest of the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IhEkOd"&gt;That’s why it’s a real shame many states (and telecom lobbyists) &lt;a href="https://broadbandnow.com/report/municipal-broadband-roadblocks/"&gt;have erected roadblocks&lt;/a&gt; to keep those municipal networks from spreading. In one particularly egregious example, Comcast &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/1/8530403/chattanooga-comcast-fcc-high-speed-internet-gigabit"&gt;sued the city of Chattanooga, Tennessee&lt;/a&gt; to try to block its municipal network in 2015, lobbied for a law to prevent its award-winning network from expanding to rural areas, then finally convinced the state &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3d98mw/tennessee-could-give-taxpayers-americas-fastest-internet-for-free-but-it-will-give-comcast-and-atandt-dollar45-million-instead"&gt;to spend $45 million of taxpayer money&lt;/a&gt; to subsidize the big ISPs instead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kzuHvO"&gt;We need competition. We need accurate maps to clearly see just how little competition there actually is, and we need to change the laws to let citizens fed up with being unserved and underserved build their own networks instead. We need those maps to show how much people actually pay. We need to stop pouring taxpayer money into hugely profitable telecoms that claim they’ll build out internet access, since they’ve found they can often &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/10/att-took-283-million-but-didnt-deploy-required-broadband-mississippi-says/"&gt;just straight-up lie&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20201125/10263845770/verizon-nyc-settle-lawsuit-over-verizons-empty-fiber-promises.shtml"&gt;wait to be sued&lt;/a&gt; instead of fulfilling their obligations. (If you want to be infuriated, follow that last link and keep on clicking through the examples.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7GDcbv"&gt;At least in 2020, the US is finally making some progress. This year, &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/1822"&gt;Congress finally passed a bill&lt;/a&gt; that requires the FCC to actually audit its broadband map data and create a “user-friendly challenge process” so people like me can point out that no, AT&amp;amp;T doesn’t actually offer fiber (or even fast DSL) at my address. And earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22159791/fcc-awards-spacex-886-million-satellite-internet-broadband-rural"&gt;the FCC already awarded $9.2 billion&lt;/a&gt; to 180 different companies to bring broadband to 5.2 million rural Americans over the next ten years — though big companies like Charter, CenturyLink, Frontier, and Windstream still account for at least $2.4 billion of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kqSB8L"&gt;But another way of looking at things is that we’re already too late: the FCC just awarded a decade’s worth of money to bring broadband to &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; five million additional addresses, without knowing whether it was awarding those contracts to communities that will now see competition — or just erecting more pockets of monopoly on the fringe. What is the rest of America supposed to do, wait another decade? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EoT6f5"&gt;We need to go much, much further than fixing our maps. If the best we can do during the pandemic is ask ISPs to “pretty please make the internet work better for 60 days,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reckless/status/1330935922528034817"&gt;to borrow a phrase&lt;/a&gt;, it’s time for more regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ob2rBv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The internet is more important than the telephone ever was; let’s regulate it that way&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pX92cR"&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic has shown, perhaps for the first time, how essential the internet is. The internet was already a powerful tool for learning, but now it’s a critical one for kids to attend school. Many millions are jobless but could maybe find a new job that lets them work from home. Many are already working from home because — with no other choice — companies are learning to adapt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KnX3JM"&gt;This all means there might finally be enough political will to declare the internet should be delivered to homes like a utility, the way water and electricity are delivered today, the way landline telephones were under the Communications Act of 1934 that originally created the FCC. The last time it was truly overhauled was 1996 — back when the internet was delivered one digital screech at a time over standard phone lines, after all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="kqMuoj"&gt;That’s how we’ve always dealt with necessary monopolies, the ones that own the pipes and wires that feed your house. We put them on a tight leash and make them serve everyone, not just the homes they deem most profitable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hc1drm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGcIPn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is temporarily disabling some Messenger and Instagram features in Europe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W749SlkRh1Vh_FDI1T74agmEaWs=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68527717/facebookeumessage.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some Messenger and Instagram features aren’t available in Europe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3wfv3x"&gt;Facebook is notifying Messenger and Instagram users in Europe that some features are temporarily unavailable. A small message has appeared in both the Facebook Messenger and Instagram apps for European users this week, noting that some features aren’t available to “respect new rules for messaging services in Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gmKitz"&gt;Facebook doesn’t outline exactly what features will be missing, but the company does reveal on its support pages that &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/627307411210372?locale=en_US&amp;amp;draft=627307411210372"&gt;polls&lt;/a&gt; on both Messenger and Instagram are currently unavailable in Europe, alongside a lack of &lt;a href="https://help.instagram.com/151273688993748"&gt;stickers&lt;/a&gt; in Instagram and no &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/android/1406970902944033?helpref=typeahead_suggestions&amp;amp;rdrhc"&gt;personalized replies&lt;/a&gt; on Messenger. Other missing features may include a lack of certain file sends on Messenger, missing nicknames, or the ability to share AR effects in DMs on Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WsrJ7-CGmFEubG5gq4d00JmHKxs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22177113/IMG_8479.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook’s warning in Instagram DMs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bvRD6b"&gt;Facebook has temporarily disabled some of these features to comply with new rules on data usage in EU countries. It’s part of the national implementations that are taking place of the 2002 Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive (&lt;a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:2002L0058:20091219:EN:HTML"&gt;ePrivacy Directive&lt;/a&gt;). This directive imposes stricter rules on data use across communications services that operate in countries that are part of the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aaSbbm"&gt;It’s not clear when Facebook will reinstate these features for European users, but a spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that most will return “very soon.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s the best look yet at Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Pro wireless earbuds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mNSFHLiWyX16nc0VH5EuYug4dTA=/0x100:600x500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68527715/5b3350892c99cf2b185d8a749d4497def948c0d6ca01c32c78604a1bd092babb.0.gif" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ClFrDT"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Pro have leaked again, this time in a full 360-degree animation courtesy of Evan Blass. The latest &lt;a href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-360degree-look-1608168459-1380650881"&gt;@Evleaks drop&lt;/a&gt; gives us our best look yet at how Samsung’s latest true wireless earbuds will look from every angle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p8wb3E"&gt;Rumored to arrive alongside the Galaxy S21 in January, Samsung’s followup to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price"&gt;Galaxy Buds Live&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147654/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review-wireless-earbuds-sound-quality-battery-life"&gt;Galaxy Buds Plus&lt;/a&gt; has already leaked in three different colors: black, violet, and silver, again courtesy of &lt;a href="https://www.voice.com/profile/evan"&gt;Blass&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All three Galaxy Buds Pro color options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FYBoeM"&gt;The Galaxy Buds Pro are expected to feature active noise cancellation, that should be much improved over the open-ear design of the Galaxy Buds Live. The Pros will also feature a beefier 500mAh battery according to an FCC filing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vZhk5b"&gt;Samsung is rumored to be hosting an Galaxy S21 launch event on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167208/samsung-galaxy-s21-january-14th-launch-india-plus-ultra-s-pen"&gt;January 14th&lt;/a&gt; where we should learn more about Galaxy Buds Pro.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook hits back at Apple with second critical newspaper ad</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jA6SMOOBNT1JjSdmhNArjUS-Vog=/0x0:2640x1760/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68527690/facebooknewspaperad2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook’s second newspaper ad.&lt;/em&gt; | Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CNoEI3"&gt;Facebook is stepping up its campaign against Apple’s privacy changes with a second full-page newspaper ad today. This new ad claims Apple’s iOS 14 privacy changes “will change the internet as we know it,” and force websites and blogs “to start charging you subscription fees” or add in-app purchases due to a lack of personalized ads. It follows a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178068/facebook-apple-newspaper-ads-ios-privacy-changes"&gt;similar full-page newspaper ad&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, and the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ag8glr"&gt;Apple is planning to make changes to iOS 14 early next year that will require developers to ask for permission to gather data and track users across mobile apps and websites on an iPhone or iPad. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22179721/apple-defends-upcoming-privacy-changes-standing-up-for-users-facebook-data"&gt;Apple revealed&lt;/a&gt; how iOS 14 users will be prompted to opt into tracking in apps this week, noting that developers like Facebook can explain to users why they should allow tracking within the prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/427F9SagLFMdWvLHnnL25eM5sTY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22176650/FB_ATT_Prompt.001.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s upcoming iOS 14 privacy prompt.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BMjwm4"&gt;These changes will impact Facebook’s lucrative ad business, but the social networking giant is framing them as something far larger that could impact small businesses. Unsurprisingly, Apple doesn’t agree. “We believe that this is a simple matter of standing up for our users,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22179721/apple-defends-upcoming-privacy-changes-standing-up-for-users-facebook-data"&gt;said an Apple spokesperson&lt;/a&gt; in response to Facebook’s first full-page newspaper ad yesterday. “Users should know when their data is being collected and shared across other apps and websites — and they should have the choice to allow that or not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VYDTCA"&gt;Facebook clearly isn’t holding back on its PR campaign, with this latest newspaper ad trying to sway readers that Apple’s changes are more about moving websites and apps into a paid model where Apple stands to benefit from in-app purchases and subscriptions. With full-page ads in &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, and the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, Facebook is also very clearly trying to convince regulators (i.e. people that still read paper newspapers) to look at Apple’s privacy changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eQtPva"&gt;This is just the latest in an ongoing public spat between Apple and Facebook over iOS 14 privacy and policy changes, and follows &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174017/apple-app-store-new-privacy-labels-ios-apps-public"&gt;Apple’s new App Store privacy labels&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook also hit out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/7/21358355/facebook-apple-app-store-policies-comments-facebook-gaming-ios"&gt;against Apple’s App Store policies&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, adding to the growing industry pressure against Apple’s cloud gaming restrictions. Facebook also welcomed the EU’s new Digital Markets Act (DMA) and the Digital Services Act (DSA) this week, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/16/facebook-criticizes-apple-as-it-welcomes-europes-new-tech-rules.html"&gt;hoping that the DMA&lt;/a&gt; “will also set boundaries for Apple.”&lt;/p&gt;
