    <title>The delightful Ratatouille TikTok musical has already sold more than $1 million in tickets</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gUsqrc"&gt;The TikTok &lt;em&gt;Ratatouille&lt;/em&gt; musical— aka the &lt;em&gt;Ratatousical&lt;/em&gt;— debuted online on New Year’s Day and has already sold more than $1 million in tickets, in quite the feel-good start to 2021. A portion of the ticket sales will benefit The Actors Fund, which supports performers and workers in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FB21CY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;You did it! You raised over $1 million to benefit &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheActorsFund?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TheActorsFund&lt;/a&gt;! But we aren’t done yet. Tickets are still on sale all weekend long on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TodayTix?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TodayTix&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href="https://t.co/3YxozrE7Hd"&gt;https://t.co/3YxozrE7Hd&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/QqUu6uzM0D"&gt;pic.twitter.com/QqUu6uzM0D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ratatouille Musical (@ratatousical) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ratatousical/status/1345197450458501124?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NnB7jp"&gt;The musical &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166215/ratatouille-the-tiktok-musical-broadway-show-todaytix-streaming-one-night-date-viral-disney"&gt;came together on TikTok&lt;/a&gt; over several months, with creators including composers, fans, set designers, costumers, and choreographers devising musical numbers, songs, and even a fake Playbill for the fictional “show” based on the 2007 Disney/Pixar animated film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zYBMX6"&gt;Then suddenly it was actually happening: &lt;a href="https://seaviewprods.com/work/ratatouille-the-tiktok-musical/"&gt;Seaview Productions announced&lt;/a&gt; it was producing the show in association with TikTok, and even Disney/Pixar gave its blessing. The show got some big name Broadway stars to perform the crowdsourced songs, including Wayne Brady going all in with rat makeup as Django, Andrew Barth Feldman as Linguini, Ashley Park as Colette, Kevin Chamberlin as Auguste Gusteau, Andre de Shields as Anton Ego, Adam Lambert as Emile, and Tituss Burgess playing Remy, the rat who loves to cook. The 20-piece Broadway Sinfonietta orchestra was on board as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="io1cd0"&gt; “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjU_p3uvlkU"&gt;The Rat’s Way of Life&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvI0Lg8JmPQ"&gt;Ratatouille Tango&lt;/a&gt;” created by TikToker &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@blakeyrouse?lang=en"&gt;Blake Rouse&lt;/a&gt; are featured in the musical, along with “Anyone Can Cook” and the song that started it all, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/danieljmertz/status/1336765015911768069"&gt;“Remy the Ratatouille.”&lt;/a&gt; It did not have all the glitz and glamour of a high-end Broadway production, but the caliber of the performances given from their homes by the actors, musicians, and dancers (yes, even a kick line!) are top-notch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bDajsN"&gt;Feldman summed it up after the debut: “fantastic.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="t0gJKS"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Holy. Shit. That was fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;— Andrew Barth Feldman (@andrewbfeldman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/andrewbfeldman/status/1345172987062988800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W6iaIb"&gt;Near the end of the show, we also get to see many of the TikTok creators who helped bring it all together. I’m not a theater critic by any stretch of the imagination but I love musicals, and I found the &lt;em&gt;Ratatousical&lt;/em&gt; to be a creative triumph, sorely needed at a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/12/21177162/new-york-coronavirus-ban-public-gathering-broadway-concerts-museums"&gt;time when Broadway&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of the world have been disrupted by the pandemic. And I agree with the &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2021-01-02/tiktok-ratatouille-musical-theater"&gt;critic from &lt;em&gt;The Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; who says the show may signal a new way forward for musical theater, one without gatekeepers preventing new talent from having their chance to shine. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ywo0FKUmBD2jEPlRqqQ3PojD81w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22209673/ratatouille_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ratatouille: The TikTok Musical&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WXGfYV"&gt;I won’t spoil the plot, but it sticks pretty closely to the original movie’s storyline. You can still get &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.todaytix.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F2%2F22210416%2Fratatouille-tiktok-musical-1-million-actors-fund-disney-pixar-broadway#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;tickets for the one-time only streaming performance&lt;/a&gt;, which will be available until 7PM ET on January 4th. I highly recommend you check it out. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will let Amphetamine app stay in the App Store after wrongly telling developer it violated App Store rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Ph2yeuD9W7VLUTasBEqQ1R6nDY=/0x0:1452x968/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68609629/Screen_Shot_2021_01_02_at_11.46.06_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amphetamine’s developer says Apple told him to change the app’s name and remove the pill from its logo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HgpyKh"&gt;The developer of Amphetamine, an app that prevents Macs from going into sleep mode, says Apple told him it violated App Store guidelines, even though it’s been in the App Store since 2014, and has nothing to do with drug use. Not long after &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;reached out to Apple for comment on Saturday however, the company reversed its decision, and the app will be able to stay up with its current name and logo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="58AFnz"&gt;William C. Gustafson said in January 1st posts on &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/koeyok/will_you_help_save_amphetamine/"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/x74353/SaveAmphetamine"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; that Apple had informed him he had two weeks to “remove all references to the word ‘amphetamine’ and remove the pill from the icon.” If he failed to do so, Gustafson wrote, Apple said it would remove the app from the App Store on January 12th. The logo features a cartoon image of a pill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNXbti"&gt;Gustafson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; he got a call Saturday from Apple granting his appeal— but he didn’t have insight into how the app was flagged in the first place. “I specifically asked Apple on the phone if this was a result of customer complaints and Apple’s response was ‘I don’t think so,’” he said. “I found it odd that this issue came up out of nowhere. I wasn’t in the middle of trying to update Amphetamine or anything. Just sitting at home with my kids enjoying our holiday and got the violation/rejection email from Apple.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0sgsld"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Just got off a call with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Apple&lt;/a&gt;. Appeal accepted and Amphetamine will remain on the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppStore?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AppStore&lt;/a&gt;. Thank you all for your comments, opinions, and action. We may not all agree, but I am happy we all still have the freedom to express ourselves today. ❤️ &lt;a href="https://t.co/PV7eB9aUfn"&gt;pic.twitter.com/PV7eB9aUfn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— William C. Gustafson (@x74353) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/x74353/status/1345421211677949957?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BAe1qX"&gt;Gustafson says Apple contacted him on December 29th and told him Amphetamine “appears to promote inappropriate use of controlled substances. Specifically, your app name and icon include references to controlled substances, pills.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9jU5tv"&gt;The free macOS app has been downloaded more than 432,000 times, with a 4.8 rating, Gustafson said, noting that Apple even featured &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/story/id1470456860"&gt;Amphetamine in an Mac App Store story&lt;/a&gt;. He said he had numerous interactions with Apple employees for updates to the app since its launch, with no one objecting to the name or logo until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fJQCs3"&gt;The specific App Store guideline Gustafson was accused of violating is &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#safety"&gt;this one, which states&lt;/a&gt; “Apps that encourage consumption of tobacco or vape products, illegal drugs, or excessive amounts of alcohol are not permitted on the App Store. Apps that encourage minors to consume any of these substances will be rejected. Facilitating the sale of marijuana, tobacco, or controlled substances (except for licensed pharmacies) isn’t allowed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jv9a5Q"&gt;Gustafson says Amphetamine does none of these things, and said changing the name of the app would have wrecked its brand recognition and potentially made it harder for users to find future updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mcu5HS"&gt;Gustafson initially said he didn’t expect his appeal to be successful, and indeed, Apple typically hews pretty closely to its App Store rules in most cases. The company has faced pushback from developers on several fronts in recent months, with big industry companies including Spotify, Tile, and Epic Games forming a group called the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21453745/spotify-epic-tile-match-coalition-for-app-fairness-apple-app-store-policies-protest"&gt;Coalition for App Fairness&lt;/a&gt;. It says Apple’s rules create an uneven playing field in its App Stores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W5nGl1"&gt;Basecamp co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298552/apple-hey-email-app-approval-rules-basecamp-launch"&gt;battled with Apple last summer&lt;/a&gt; over the mobile app design of his company’s email client, Hey. And Epic Games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367963/epic-fortnite-legal-complaint-apple-ios-app-store-removal-injunctive-relief"&gt;filed a lawsuit against Apple&lt;/a&gt; in August after the&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt; iOS version of its battle royale game &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was removed&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;from the App Store. Epic had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366259/epic-fortnite-vbucks-mega-drop-discount-iphone-android"&gt;implemented its own payment processing system&lt;/a&gt; into the iOS version of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, which goes against App Store rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UjkrPb"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately comment on Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E0FkpL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2qgdzr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5KlfD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla fell just short of delivering 500,000 vehicles in 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gRcgOKOJsEehix3Qs8o0Ad3kJKs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68609206/acastro_180430_1777_tesla_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pAn996"&gt;Tesla fell just shy of hitting CEO Elon Musk’s goal of delivering 500,000 vehicles in 2020, the &lt;a href="https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-q4-2020-vehicle-production-deliveries"&gt;company announced Saturday&lt;/a&gt;, having shipped a record 499,550 throughout the year — or 99.91 percent. Tesla said the final tally could vary by as much as 0.5 percent, though, so it’s possible that it will eclipse the 500,000 mark by the time it reveals the ultimate figures in its full year results, due out at the end of January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R5Z4XR"&gt;Either way, that’s &lt;a href="https://insideevs.com/news/463741/global-plugin-car-sales-november-2020/"&gt;more than double what the next-largest sellers of electric vehicles did in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, like China’s BYD or Germany’s Volkswagen. And it’s a remarkable recovery for Tesla considering the impact the coronavirus pandemic had on its operations during the first half of the year. While Tesla &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21113987/tesla-q4-2019-earnings-results-profit-revenue-model-3"&gt;said in January 2020&lt;/a&gt; that it expected to “comfortably exceed” Musk’s goal of shipping 500,000 cars worldwide by the end of the year, the company had to close its new factory in China as well as its vehicle plant in Fremont, California for several weeks as the virus spread. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="y5HNfD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So proud of the Tesla team for achieving this major milestone! At the start of Tesla, I thought we had (optimistically) a 10% chance of surviving at all. &lt;a href="https://t.co/xCqTL5TGlE"&gt;https://t.co/xCqTL5TGlE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1345382294966571008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FX27u2"&gt;Musk &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21241728/tesla-q1-earnings-financial-results-elon-musk-coronavirus-profit"&gt;maintained that Tesla would still be able to reach his goal&lt;/a&gt;, and the company followed suit, especially after it launched the Model Y SUV ahead of schedule in March. Tesla delivered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21205932/tesla-q1-sales-deliveries-production-china-factory-coronavirus"&gt;88,400 vehicles&lt;/a&gt; in Q1, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/2/21311128/tesla-q2-2020-vehicle-delivery-numbers-factory-shutdown"&gt;90,650 vehicles in Q2&lt;/a&gt;. In October, Tesla said it delivered &lt;a href="https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-q3-2020-vehicle-production-deliveries"&gt;139,300 vehicles&lt;/a&gt; during the third quarter, slightly better than the 137,000 Wall Street had expected. It also had its fifth consecutive profitable quarter in Q3. All of this helped send the company’s stock price into the stratosphere, making it the most valuable automaker on the planet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wgxYYx"&gt;Tesla ostensibly met the 500,000-car goal with another classic end-of-quarter push, one that even saw the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/woodhaus2/status/1344804566827638786?s=21"&gt;company’s chief designer Franz von Holzhausen out delivering cars&lt;/a&gt;. Musk himself &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/12/26/tesla-achieve-milestone-500000-cars-in-2020-elon-musk-email-go-all-out/"&gt;prodded Tesla workers last week&lt;/a&gt; to go “all out” to hit the mark. “This is a great milestone to rally the company around achieving,” he wrote. “All the critics who, as recently as two years ago said that we’d never make it, also called our target of half a million in 2020 ‘impossible.’ The heck with them, we are doing it!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IxxqW1"&gt;Tesla said Saturday that it ultimately produced 179,757 vehicles in the fourth quarter and delivered 180,570, bringing its totals to 509,747 and 499,550 for the year, respectively. The company wound up selling around 130,000 more vehicles than it did in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cOLhTb"&gt;The self-imposed 500,000-car sales goal is part of Musk’s attempt to drag the auto industry into the clean energy age, though it is more modest a bar than he once set. Musk had once predicted Tesla would deliver 1 million vehicles in 2020. But he &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-hedges-on-tesla-making-1-million-cars-by-2020-2018-8"&gt;later backed away&lt;/a&gt; from that number after the company ran into trouble ramping up production of its first mass-market electric car, the Model 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bXPxh7"&gt;“So proud of the Tesla team for achieving this major milestone! At the start of Tesla, I thought we had (optimistically) a 10% chance of surviving at all,” Musk tweeted Saturday. “Tesla is responsible for 2/3 of all the personal &amp;amp; professional pain in my life combined. But it was worth it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SuTTlu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yWNG9V"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DUmVbZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Refunds were made widely available, and despite that refund option, the game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195728/cyberpunk-2077-sales-copies-sold-launch-refunds"&gt;sold 13 million copies in just two weeks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jhO6QP"&gt;But publisher CD Projekt still has &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22178913/cyberpunk-2077-launch-controversy-cd-projekt"&gt;a broken reputation to fix&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/25/22199768/cdprojekt-cyberpunk-2077-lawsuit-launch"&gt;an investor lawsuit to fight&lt;/a&gt;, so I wouldn’t put too much stock in the headline you might have read today: that we’re all getting free DLC for the game in early 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1mlv7V"&gt;It’s possible! And it’s totally what &lt;a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/dlc"&gt;this official website promises&lt;/a&gt;. But that promise may be out of date. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K-SkcBCgkJknCDyiLo1-m82-hPc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22208798/cyberpunk_dlc_free.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HpoQ5s"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/cyberpunk-2077-dlc-211442122.html"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Engadget &lt;/em&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt;, the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine shows that this promise may have been live on the internet the same day the game launched — before the outcry began, and definitely before CD Projekt held an emergency conference call on December 15th to discuss how the company would react. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JJ71WV"&gt;On that call (&lt;a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2020/12/call-transcript_en.pdf"&gt;PDF transcript&lt;/a&gt;), CD Projekt president and co-CEO Adam Kiciński told investors that it was “too early to judge” when the company might be able to release DLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4MPVBy"&gt;Specifically, he was asked: “How do you feel about your ability to release a couple of DLCs next year, and, obviously, multiplayer in 2022?” (CD Projekt had previously said &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/1/16/21069351/cyberpunk-2077-developer-multiplayer-release-date-2021"&gt;that multiplayer would miss 2021&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmGcW6"&gt;The full answer: “To be honest, it’s too early to judge. At the moment please let us handle the situation, and please let us make some more assessments – that’s still ahead of us; we don’t know yet, and we’re now focused on improving Cyberpunk. We’ll discuss this early next year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="23RGse"&gt;Currently, we’re expecting two major patches for the game in January and February respectively, like the company promised &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1338390123373801472"&gt;on December 13th in its apology post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XLG3MT"&gt;Beyond that, some free DLC would of course be nice. Personally, I just want NPCs that know how to drive.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Wing warns new drone laws ‘may have unintended consequences’ for privacy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RZYBRs_cSUw6q_Guz5iQ4c8_vB8=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68607707/10_18_Service_Launch_Walgreens_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Wing&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oClRBf"&gt;This past week, the US government &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22203398/faa-remote-id-rules-location-night-over-people"&gt;made the single biggest, most impactful set of changes to drone law we’ve yet seen&lt;/a&gt; — ruling that almost every drone in US airspace will need to broadcast their locations, as well as the location of their pilots, in order to “address safety, national security, and law enforcement concerns regarding the further integration of these aircraft into the airspace of the United States”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bk53fJ"&gt;Google (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/12/5/20995520/alphabet-obsolete-sundar-pichai-ceo-page-brin"&gt;technically, Alphabet&lt;/a&gt;) isn’t too happy about those new rules, as it turns out. The company’s drone delivery subsidiary Wing &lt;a href="https://wing.com/resource-hub/articles/remote-id-rule/"&gt;wrote a somewhat fearmongering post&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-drones-faa-alphabet-idUSKBN2951T3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) titled “Broadcast-Only Remote Identification of Drones May Have Unintended Consequences for American Consumers,” which argues that the FAA’s decision to have drones broadcast their location might let observers track your movements, figuring out where you go, where you live, and where and when you receive packages, among other examples. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYZHgs"&gt;“American communities would not accept this type of surveillance of their deliveries or taxi trips on the road. They should not accept it in the sky,” Wing argues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xxFHdv"&gt;With that kind of language, you might think Wing is arguing that drones shouldn’t broadcast their location, yes? Amusingly, no: the Alphabet subsidiary just wishes they’d send it through the internet instead of broadcasting it locally. I think my former &lt;em&gt;CNET &lt;/em&gt;colleague Ian Sherr’s tweet is apt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="F9dj3U"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I am shocked — shocked — that a company being investigated for antitrust concerns over abusing its power on the internet would recommend the FAA ditch its newest radio-frequency ID program for internet-based tracking. &lt;a href="https://t.co/d6VNMPapth"&gt;https://t.co/d6VNMPapth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ian Sherr (@iansherr) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/iansherr/status/1344795377522892801?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 31, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rKr8S1"&gt;Internet-based tracking is exactly what the FAA had originally intended to do when it first proposed the Remote ID rules back in December 2019, by the way — before it received a laundry list of reasons from commenters why internet-based tracking might be problematic and decided to abandon it. Here are just a few of the ones mentioned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="vDXgO4"&gt;The cost of adding a cellular modem to a drone to begin with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="L1fB3n"&gt;The cost of paying for a monthly cellular data plan just to fly a drone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gV55WZ"&gt;The lack of reliable cellular coverage across the entirety of the US&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="loNRhS"&gt;The cost of paying a third-party data broker to track and store that data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PLAlAI"&gt;The possibility of that third-party data broker getting breached&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kAbAFm"&gt;The possibility of that data broker or network getting DDoS’d, grounding drones in the US&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="3axAsi"&gt;If you want to read the whole argument for yourself, the FAA spends 15 pages laying out and contemplating all the objections to internet-based Remote ID &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/news/media/attachments/RemoteID_Final_Rule.pdf"&gt;in its full rule (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; starting at page 60. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fhfkmt"&gt;Personally, I think it’s pretty ridiculous that the FAA felt it had to choose between “everyone has to broadcast their location to everyone within earshot” and “everyone has to pay gobs of money to private industry and trust some data broker with their location,” but the reasons why we aren’t going with internet-based tracking make some sense to me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lldLM7"&gt;Most proponents of Remote ID technology, including Wing, like to explain that it’s merely a “license plate” for the skies, perhaps nothing more intrusive than you’d already have on your car. Here’s Wing on that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="iYfuif"&gt;This allows a drone to be identified as it flies over without necessarily sharing that drone’s complete flight path or flight history, and that information, which can be more sensitive, is not displayed to the public and only available to law enforcement if they have proper credentials and a reason to need that information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="aNEOAW"&gt;But the thing about license plates is, traditionally, you have to be within eyeshot to see them. You’d have to be physically following a car to track it. That’s not necessarily true of a broadcasting transmitter, and it’s potentially &lt;em&gt;far &lt;/em&gt;less true of a internet-based solution like the one Wing seems to wish the FAA had offered instead. Naturally, it depends on who owns the internet-based solution and how much you trust them and their security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RrhLjd"&gt;Either way, it’s going to be a while before we find out how secure or vulnerable, how broad or narrow these Remote ID broadcasts are truly going to be. That’s because the FAA’s final rule doesn’t actually mandate what kind of broadcasting tech drones will be required to use: companies have the next year and half to figure that out, and they have to submit it to the FAA for approval. The FAA is also clear that broadcast Remote ID is just a first step, an “initial framework,” suggesting that internet-based Remote ID might still be an option in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How we exercised during quarantine</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ygQnByuVRmko4B_8QWm0790mveA=/193x210:1918x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68607225/akrales_191008_3706_0141.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U1QDtx"&gt;With all the mental burdens that came with living in 2020 — including gyms closing their doors — many have found it tough to get in their normal level of exercise. Here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, we coped with this as you might expect: with tech that could enable or motivate us to get some activity in. These are the gadgets, apps, games, and services we used to work up a sweat while still staying safe, and which might prove useful if your New Year’s resolution involves exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kY3jd9"&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="UYA8e2"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vL39Sg2AqWg?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LxS97d"&gt;I named &lt;em&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/em&gt; my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/18/18145103/beat-saber-game-of-the-year-psvr-oculus-vive"&gt;favorite game of 2018&lt;/a&gt;, but I lapsed hard since, until Oculus released the Quest 2 in October. It’s the first VR headset I &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;like wearing&lt;/a&gt;, and I used &lt;a href="https://sidequestvr.com/setup-howto"&gt;SideQuest&lt;/a&gt; to add bootleg custom tracks that support my embarrassingly narrow musical taste, turning my Quest into a nearly single-purpose beat sabering machine. (I probably owe Muse and the New Pornographers royalties or something? Look, I just really like the unofficial Expert beatmap of “The Mary Martin Show.”) Pro: I remember I have a body again. Con: I get &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgmxMuW6Fsc"&gt;OK Go&lt;/a&gt; stuck in my head every morning. — &lt;em&gt;Adi Robertson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IM3jHl"&gt;Nike Training Club and Reddit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="gnQ9ps"&gt;I’ve been a &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.nike.com/ntc-app" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nike Training Club&lt;/a&gt; user for a while now, but this year I needed it more than ever as my cycle commute disappeared and my step-count plummeted. Nike’s app offers a collection of workouts you can filter based on how much equipment you have available, how much time you have, whether you’re after a strength or a cardio workout, and so on. This year, my filters were “none,” “all the time in the world,” and “I’ll take what I can get,” respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YMssbp"&gt;What I like most is how simple most of the workouts are, which leaves me free to alleviate the boredom of exercise by listening to podcasts while I work out. Instead of having to listen to a personal trainer’s motivational tidbits alongside their instructions, Nike’s app mainly shows simple looping videos of each exercise and leaves my mind free to wander. (The app also includes more traditional workout videos, but they’ve never clicked with me.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7IK1mD"&gt;Early in the year, I also got a lot out of working out as a group with my flatmates. Here, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine"&gt;the routine&lt;/a&gt; devised by Reddit’s &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/"&gt;Bodyweight Fitness community&lt;/a&gt; was invaluable. It includes strength exercises you can do with minimal equipment, and different variants of each to let you adjust their difficulty. While you don’t need much to get started, we found adding a pullup bar, gymnastics rings, and resistance bands was a relatively affordable way to give us a lot more exercise options. — &lt;em&gt;Jon Porter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uYMOKd"&gt;Instagram&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Oqvhzl"&gt;While I typically keep my social media habit limited to Twitter, one of my early strategies for staying active while staying home was collecting posts of at-home exercises with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/17/15325040/instagram-saved-post-collections-pinterest"&gt;Instagram’s Saved Posts feature&lt;/a&gt;. Fitness instructors have always shared some content on Instagram, but the closing of gyms and fitness studios brought a wealth of free guided workouts to the app.  It’s no Pinterest, but my collection in Saved Posts lets me keep easy exercises on hand, and eliminates one of my many excuses for not moving: I rarely know what I’m doing when it comes to working out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9HsHwq"&gt;As the year has dragged on, I’ve fallen off my Instagram health kick, but I still collect and sort exercise posts. Obviously there are fewer physical benefits, but I still find it very soothing. — &lt;em&gt;Ian Campbell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wu2Ihb"&gt;The Garmin Fenix 6X&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YrHPZ_n5Vg7dfVY0Az_0WDLlvOU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19128333/fenix6_Hero_HR_4000.jpg"&gt;

&lt;em&gt;The Fenix 6 series of multi-sport GPS watches.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="szaCQu"&gt;I know I’m tempting fate by saying this, but my fitness improved dramatically during the pandemic. I was motivated by boredom and, frankly, a fear of dying, but also by Garmin’s do-it-all &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbuy.garmin.com%2Fen-US%2FUS%2Fp%2F641375&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020-roundup%2F22206745%2F2020-home-exercise-tech-games-apps-vr-apple-watch-covid-quarantine-pandemic-shelter-in-place#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fenix 6X Pro smartwatch&lt;/a&gt; with ten-day battery and giant outdoor-readable display. It helps that my local government has promoted safe, socially-distanced outdoor activities instead of issuing strict stay-at-home orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LmPx1e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I was motivated to run faster and longer using Garmin’s PacePro feature&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s8Qiux"&gt;Prior to the depletion of fitness gadgets on Amazon and beyond, I managed to amass a set of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-resistance-bands/"&gt;adjustable resistance bands&lt;/a&gt; I had read about on &lt;em&gt;Wirecutter&lt;/em&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.crossrope.com%2Fproducts%2Fget-lean-jump-rope-set-eu&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020-roundup%2F22206745%2F2020-home-exercise-tech-games-apps-vr-apple-watch-covid-quarantine-pandemic-shelter-in-place#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;luxurious pair of weighted jump ropes from Crossrope&lt;/a&gt;. In March and April, I worked out with these items pretty much every day while sequestered at home. The Garmin watch did a fair job of automatically tracking my chest and shoulder presses and bicep curls, but it was far less capable of detecting other movements, failing miserably at tracking my Crossrope sessions, for example. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.crossrope.com%2Fpages%2Fmembership&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020-roundup%2F22206745%2F2020-home-exercise-tech-games-apps-vr-apple-watch-covid-quarantine-pandemic-shelter-in-place#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Crossrope makes an app&lt;/a&gt; with paid membership tiers, but I found it superfluous to my needs. While I’m not quite at the level of a pro boxer, I’ve managed to perfect several jumping skills like crossovers, doubles, and a variety of skips to keep the repetition interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A14dy9"&gt;I also took up yoga at this time to help maintain my sanity and increase flexibility. While the Fenix 6 can guide you through animated yoga sessions, as an absolute beginner I found it impractical and disruptive to keep peeking at my wrist to study pose mechanics. YouTube is a much better living room coach. I completed &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeEMs38YaBY&amp;amp;list=PLW0v0k7UCVrlLpvX-rz-mrGCoElFpj44D"&gt;Kassandra’s 30-day challenge&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene"&gt;Adriene&lt;/a&gt; is too chatty for me) and yoga is now part of my regular routine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aFAyWgwbejyjGEHimEWPbs7_MBI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22205242/2204_7.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KQOmCS"&gt;As spring sprung, I took to running outside through the glorious tourist-free Amsterdam city streets and parks. Here the Garmin watch excelled. I was motivated to run faster and longer using Garmin’s PacePro feature to inject my Spotify playlist, real-time coaching, and turn-by-turn navigation into my AirPods Pro earbuds. I soon became addicted to setting new personal records and lowering my fitness age in virtual competition with my running friends who prefer Garmin watches over anything else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ExkGpH"&gt;By summer, I was using the Garmin Fenix 6 to track my kitesurfing sessions, all-day bike rides, and open-water swims in the ocean. By fall, I took up golfing, motivated by Garmin’s super impressive ability to track each shot played on hundreds of golf courses around the world. The Fenix 6 isn’t accurate enough to track putts, but it does an amazing job of tracking each shot from the tee to the green allowing you to measure club performance, keep score, and see trends after each round. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1C445b"&gt;The Fenix 6 has proven to be a jack of all trades and master of some, while motivating me to try new activities like mountain biking to see how it adapts. After nine months of intense and uninterrupted usage, the Garmin Fenix 6 now says that my fitness age is 20, something I’m proud of as a 53-year-old gadget-obsessed human trying to outlive a virus. — &lt;em&gt;Thomas Ricker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Watch Series 6.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iiZw6f"&gt;When I got an Apple Watch in November 2019, there were two things I didn’t expect: the upcoming pandemic that would make going to the gym impossible, and just how well the gamified rings system would work on me. The desire to fill every ring every day (which I have done, thank you) has made it so, at the very least, I get up and speed-walk around my apartment every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F6XPzv"&gt;I also managed to find a copy of Wii Sports Resort at a local game store, so I didn’t have to pay the eBay scalper prices that started popping up around March (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay"&gt;hardcore gamers weren’t the only ones dealing with those&lt;/a&gt;). It’s not really what I would call a workout, but it’s fun and it gets my wife and I off the couch. Would I rather be playing &lt;em&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/em&gt;? Yes, but I couldn’t get my hands on the VR rig I wanted this year. That’s on the list for 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21443901/nvidia-rtx-3080-ebay-reselling-sold-out-shortages"&gt;once we can find PC hardware again&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot of the fitness app with a month full of closed rings" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SZbOnTVnzNkWHkPdBBSIjRwZxSE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22205254/IMG_0448.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proof. There’s more where that came from.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GNZFAR"&gt;For a Nintendo game that &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; provides a workout I turned to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/17/20917908/nintendo-switch-ring-fit-adventure-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ring Fit Adventure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I cranked it up to the highest difficulty, and immediately regretted it… but pushing through has been rewarding, and I feel like I’ve actually gotten a workout in. It’s not the heart-pounding, sweating everywhere workout I’ve gotten from YouTube workout videos or Apple Fitness Plus, but I’m usually sore the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mLJKUu"&gt;Finally, while I wouldn’t call adjustable dumbbells “tech,” I paired mine with the app Fitbod, which tracks your exercises and builds sets based on which muscle groups are fresh. Combined with the fact I now have a full set of weights that can actually fit in a small apartment, I do more strength training now than I ever did at the gym. — &lt;em&gt;Mitchell Clark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="G2v6At"&gt;What exercise?&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LejKsBRPrpqegre7gd1Si5WTmwM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22026724/shollister_201030_42850003.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Lifting &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/21590961/samsung-odyssey-g9-review-ultrawide-monitor-price-specs" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;this monitor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; onto my desk was perhaps my most strenuous task in 2020.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QY8afI"&gt;I went into the pandemic with the best of intentions and an array of gadgetry at my disposal: a VR headset with exercise games, a motorized standing desk, a genuinely good road bicycle, a smartwatch, even an array of relatively new power tools (leaf blower, hedge trimmer, pressure washer) then I bought intending to clean up the yard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bNvvGw"&gt;Instead, I proceeded to become an utter couch potato for the duration of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GtdF1L"&gt;I might have used the standing desk’s standing feature... twice? I had a few intense VR sessions of &lt;em&gt;Pistol Whip&lt;/em&gt;, sure, but the staying power wasn’t there, and I’m not sure playing through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22167726/half-life-alyx-valve-vr-game-of-the-year-2020"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;ever saw me break a sweat. Heck, I used an automatic tire inflator the one-and-only time I hit the park with my bike to test &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/10/19/21522620/peak-design-mobile-phone-case-bike-car-mount-tripod-hands-on-kickstarter"&gt;an awesome new phone mount&lt;/a&gt;. I did rake all the leaves in the backyard twice, I suppose. But if I’m telling the truth, I probably burned more calories breaking down a mountain of Amazon cardboard boxes than any other activity this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UID7rR"&gt;There was one good reason I didn’t feel all that motivated, though: after years of failed diets, I finally lost some weight during shelter-in-place. Using a Wi-Fi-equipped smart scale and the MyFitnessPal app, I mentally berated myself to weigh in and log calories almost every single day for several months at a stretch, limiting myself to 1,600 a day. I lost 25 pounds, and I don’t get as hungry anymore!  Imagine if I’d exercised, too. — &lt;em&gt;Sean Hollister&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung appears to have a new Tile competitor on the way</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P2XDK832N23pOSPeB-RRePgxEJ8=/1x0:639x425/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68606651/smarttagleak.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photos: Samsung / &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-smart-tag-live-images-ncc/" target="_blank"&gt;91mobiles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="510avH"&gt;Samsung seems to be close to launching a new Tile-like device for tracking lost items. The tracker, likely called the &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-smart-tag-launch-soon-possible-certification/"&gt;Galaxy SmartTag&lt;/a&gt;, has been leaking out over the past month, and there’s some speculation it could be announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167208/samsung-galaxy-s21-january-14th-launch-india-plus-ultra-s-pen"&gt;alongside the Galaxy S21&lt;/a&gt; later in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6hvLm"&gt;The Galaxy SmartTag would use Bluetooth to connect with nearby devices and broadcast its location, so owners could find it later if they misplace whatever it’s attached to. It’ll be powered by a replaceable button cell battery, according to a regulatory filing &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_smart_tag_bluetooth_tracker_details_surface-news-46721.php"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;GSMArena&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so you won’t have to throw it out and buy a new one when the battery dies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZnZmq"&gt;Samsung’s tracker sounds &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/2/17924312/tile-mate-pro-premium-subscription-launch-battery-range-price"&gt;a lot like a Tile&lt;/a&gt;, and it’ll apparently look a lot like one, too. Leaks show the SmartTag as a small square with rounded corners and a hole at one edge for slipping a keychain or lanyard through. Photos of the device filed with Taiwan’s telecom regulator were &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-smart-tag-live-images-ncc/"&gt;publicized by &lt;em&gt;91mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and they line up with &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-smart-tag-design-exclusive/"&gt;an illustration&lt;/a&gt; of the gadget that was leaked from Samsung’s SmartThings app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lhHVmH"&gt;So far, it’s not clear that Samsung is doing anything out of the ordinary here — this seems to be a pretty standard fare item tracker. Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/10/17841570/samsung-smartthings-tracker-gps-lte-m"&gt;released a tracker&lt;/a&gt; back in 2018 that connected to cell phone networks for continual tracking. More recently, in October, Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21541567/samsung-find-my-smartthings-find-service-locate-missing-smartphone-tablet-smartwatch-earbud-galaxy"&gt;launched an app&lt;/a&gt; that helps owners of its gadgets locate their existing devices using Bluetooth, which seems like groundwork for the upcoming SmartTag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YqYJgD"&gt;Mostly, this seems like more bad news for Tile, since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427380/apple-airtags-tile-competitor-production"&gt;Apple is rumored&lt;/a&gt; to have an item tracker in the works, too. That could mean two major new competitors in one year, if both of these devices actually ship.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New York City subway now supports tap-to-pay at all stations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Up1VahQU-U6EpRVd36KydmBzRVs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68606406/akrales_190528_3453_0028.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hsq4TQ"&gt;You can now gain entry to any station of the New York City Subway with the tap of a phone, instead of the (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chayesmatthew/status/1081246829818363906"&gt;famously finicky&lt;/a&gt;) swipe of a MetroCard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5WED4t"&gt;The Metropolitan Transportation Authority &lt;a href="https://www.mta.info/press-release/nyc-transit/its-omny-time-everywhere"&gt;announced Thursday&lt;/a&gt; that it had completed the rollout of tap-to-pay scanners at all subway stations and on all of its buses throughout the city. The MTA has been installing the system, called OMNY, since May 2019 as part of a modernization effort to phase out the plastic MetroCards that have been in use since the ’90s. The new tap-to-pay system is available at 472 stations and on 5,800 buses in total, the MTA said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WEEUuI"&gt;Tap-to-pay is supposed to speed up entry into buses and subways and reduce costs throughout the transit system, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/30/nyregion/metrocard-mta-subway-discontinued.html"&gt;officials have said&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also just meant to be simpler and more modern. Other cities have had tap-to-pay transit systems for years or decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aL7pBy"&gt;For now, you need a phone that supports NFC-based mobile payments in order to use the OMNY system. Later in 2021, the MTA will begin selling tap-to-pay cards that can be used in place of a phone — an important addition since not all riders own a smartphone. Support for reduced fares for senior riders and riders with disabilities will come at some point this year, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y6tX4y"&gt;MetroCards are supposed to be “phased out entirely” by 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft says hackers were able to see some of its source code</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rju3DQOwEJwbHDc9NI8XjSKZ4CI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68604189/microsoft_surface_book_3_13_5_dbohn_04.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n5crqX"&gt;As Microsoft continues to investigate the massive SolarWinds attack, the company says it has discovered that its systems were infiltrated “beyond just the presence of malicious SolarWinds code.” In &lt;a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/12/31/microsoft-internal-solorigate-investigation-update/"&gt;an update from its Security Response Center&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft says that hackers were able to “view source code in a number of source code repositories,” but that the hacked account granting such access didn’t have permission to modify any code or systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0w36QN"&gt;While Microsoft points to “a very sophisticated nation-state actor” as the culprit, the US government and cybersecurity officials have implicated Russia as the architects of the overall SolarWinds attack. The attack &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176053/solarwinds-hack-client-list-russia-orion-it-compromised"&gt;exposed an extensive list of sensitive organizations&lt;/a&gt;, and today’s disclosure from Microsoft shows we’ll still be unraveling the attack’s implications for weeks and months to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X4aUeX"&gt;Fortunately, Microsoft says that while hackers went deeper than previously known, it found “no evidence of access to production services or customer data,” and “no indications that our systems were used to attack others.” Additionally, the company says that it regularly assumes adversaries are able to view its source code, and does not rely on the secrecy of source code to keep its products secure. Microsoft did not disclose how much code was viewed or what the exposed code is used for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="854pfp"&gt;Earlier this month, Microsoft President Brad Smith &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188060/microsoft-president-solarwinds-orion-hack-breach-brad-smith"&gt;said the attack&lt;/a&gt; was a “moment of reckoning” and warned about its danger. “This is not ‘espionage as usual,’ Smith said. “In effect, this is not just an attack on specific targets, but on the trust and reliability of the world’s critical infrastructure in order to advance one nation’s intelligence agency.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Adobe Flash rides off into the sunset</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Adobe Flash Logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rjBAkOFCA0b9huDqMyHcr2cMP5o=/0x23:600x423/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68603538/adobe-flash-logo.1419969978.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Adobe Flash Logo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UIkf8V"&gt;Adobe scheduled the end of support for its famous Flash software on December 31st, 2020, and today is the day. While Adobe won’t start blocking Flash content until January 12th, major browsers will shut it all down tomorrow and Microsoft will block it in most versions of Windows. It’s over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8XGkk"&gt;Flash enjoyed huge cultural relevance and looms large in web history, which might be why its funeral procession has lasted for years. Browsers started showing Flash the door early in the last decade, and in 2015 Adobe asked developers to move on to HTML5. Things became official in 2017, when Adobe announced it would end support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AtpoFm"&gt;While Adobe is finally (mercifully) letting Flash go, it will live on in many historical artifacts. The Internet Archive is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21578616/internet-archive-preservation-flash-animations-games-adobe"&gt;preserving Flash games and animations&lt;/a&gt;, including well-known hits like “Peanut Butter Jelly Time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HIPuCw"&gt;I personally loved making stuff in Flash as a high school student with a totally-legitimate copy of the Adobe software on my generic HP desktop PC. Years later, any time I see some fancy words slide into a corporate presentation, I recall struggling to figure out how to animate motion tweens in the Flash editor. Ah, memories.&lt;/p&gt;
