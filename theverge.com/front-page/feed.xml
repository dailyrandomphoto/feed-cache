    <title>Swiss Army drops WhatsApp for homegrown messaging service, citing privacy concerns </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A picture of the Swiss flag" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OhuKDk_XlnceKx98nH6_O-GYLn0=/0x151:2048x1516/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70359418/2346228148_28b0bacd6b_k.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://flickr.com/photos/jamescridland/2346228148/in/photolist-4zk2Ts-YFyXYj-5PyiGh-4UTMTp-ee5Kqj-wctj-bdfPTD-6H1nC5-XTC62M-9EnAV4-9dX9aG-df4Sv9-df4Sis-df4S86-8LMXY2-Grqrf-ACBYKP-2inhX8t-fjJqdd-C16UYo-B2wjBx-kfGuN-B2uciD-2jQA65h-2k7Si9A-C16tKY-4JZNiE-qHFJaq-4jEwh2-2mFKTu9-2iYUPmR-2jtQWSC-5KdrW9-WHvEVu-ceZfKj-ePcd4N-5jGKWU-5Aca3X-aDc1Wz-4JxkGu-2hG8fKh-2m6xrJg-2k4hXpi-4tMNHV-t8tab-gzdxv-gzd9j-nZh5XT-76kMDS-p3Q7gk" target="_blank"&gt;James Cridland / Flickr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xurKRk"&gt;The Swiss army has banned the use of WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, and other foreign encrypted messaging services by army personnel, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-europe-army-instant-messaging-d3c7c8fd54a78e8cc17fe930014d92d2"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, and instructed staff to use the Swiss-made Threema app instead. The announcement was made in a letter sent to top army staff in December, citing privacy concerns based on US authorities’ ability to access data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LX3EB0"&gt;The original letter reportedly told army chiefs that “no other messaging service will be authorized,” although a spokesperson subsequently seemed to tone down the strength of the decree, describing it to the &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; as a “recommendation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0YfzNH"&gt;The primary concern seems to be the ability of authorities in Washington to access data stored by companies that fall under US jurisdiction, as &lt;a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/questions-to-ask-for-compliance-with-the-eu-gdpr-and-the-u-s-cloud-act/"&gt;described in the US CLOUD Act&lt;/a&gt;. The CLOUD Act obliges service providers under US jurisdiction to comply with search warrants, regardless of where servers are located.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GAhkBE"&gt;As a Swiss company with no servers hosted in the US, Threema would not be obliged to respond to such search warrants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyRTPT"&gt;Given the strong privacy protections mandated by European GDPR regulations, privacy advocates and multinational corporations alike had hoped that records stored in the EU would be outside the purview of the US court system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sKzHh8"&gt;However, in January 2020, a New York federal judge ruled that &lt;a href="https://www.crowelldatalaw.com/2020/01/burden-of-compliance-with-foreign-data-privacy-laws-does-not-justify-withholding-of-banking-records/"&gt;compliance with foreign privacy laws did not negate an obligation to produce documents in discovery&lt;/a&gt;, in a case related to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/12/21256407/telegram-cryptocurrency-shutdown-sec-gram"&gt;SEC’s pursuit of the Telegram messaging app&lt;/a&gt; for not adequately registering its cryptocurrency token sale.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Fitness Plus is adding audio running workouts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An image showing three Apple Watches showing screens of the first three Time to Run workouts." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BQKgZ4tiPeuNw-R8ZustJzR4JJk=/154x0:1807x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70359412/Apple_fitness_plus_winter_update_TTR.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time to Run launches January 10.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I1pmVP"&gt;After launching Fitness Plus in December 2020, Apple has continuously added new features, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248678/apple-time-to-walk-celebrity-guided-audio-dolly-parton-shawn-mendes"&gt;audio walks with celebrities&lt;/a&gt; and new workout programs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385653/apple-fitness-plus-new-workouts-pregnant-beginner-older-users-jane-fonda"&gt;for pregnant and older users&lt;/a&gt;. Today, it’s announcing a few more additions, with the standout being audio running experiences dubbed Time to Run. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8tfTox"&gt;According to Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/01/apple-fitness-plus-introduces-collections-and-time-to-run-starting-january-10/"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;, Time to Run can help users “become more consistent and better runners,” and each session focuses on a popular running route in a specific location. The sessions will be led by Fitness Plus trainers Emily Fayette, Jamie-Ray Hartshorne, Sam Sanchez, and Scott Carvin — they all also coach the service’s treadmill workouts. Apple will also be adding another running coach, Cory Wharton-Malcolm. Each episode will also feature playlists to match the intensity of the run and chosen location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oNG6SR"&gt;Time to Run is set to debut on January 10th, with new episodes arriving every Monday. The series will launch with three episodes and locales: London, Brooklyn, and Miami Beach. Users will also be shown photos on the Apple Watch of “notable sights” along the route in each city. Apple says the episodes can be played both on outdoor and indoor runs. It’ll also be available for wheelchair users as Time to Run or Push. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CPjpUE"&gt;From the description, it sounds very similar to Time to Walk, which are roughly 25–40 minutes walks narrated by a celebrity guest and their curated mini-playlist. Audio or coached runs aren’t unique to Fitness Plus — you’ll also find them in other workout apps, including Aaptiv, Runtastic, Runkeeper, and Peloton. We’ll have to check out a workout for ourselves to see how Time to Run stacks up, though if it’s anything like Time to Walk, it’ll be more about an inclusive experience than hardcore intervals or sprints.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An iPad showing the new Collections feature." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I2AO77Hqu1b3jAXDHsqyY7mvius=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23152330/Apple_fitness_plus_winter_update_collections.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Collections are curated workout bundles toward a specific goal. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mIeq2v"&gt;The service is also adding curated workouts and meditations called Collections. The idea is to pick out a few selections from Fitness Plus’s library of 2,000 studio workouts and guided meditation that focus on a specific plan over a period of several days or weeks. There will be six Collections at launch: 30-Day Core Challenge, Improve Your Posture with Pilates, Perfect Your Yoga Balance Poses, Run Your First 5K, Wind Down for a Better Bedtime, and Strengthen Your Back, Stretch Your Hips. This is a neat addition, as one of the more annoying things about Fitness Plus since its launch has been limited filtering options. While you can search workouts by trainer, music genre, and time, you have to read each workout description to learn more about what each session is tailored toward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="501RBN"&gt;Time to Run and Collections aren’t the only new updates, however. Time to Walk is also getting a third season, with guests like Rebel Wilson, Bernice A. King, Hasan Minhaj, Chris Meloni, Ayo Tometi, Chelsea Handler, and Sugar Ray Leonard. Apple’s Artist Spotlight series, which features entire workouts set to a single musician, will add Ed Sheeran, Pharrell Williams, Shakira, and The Beatles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H627DY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Where to preorder the colorful new PS5 covers and DualSense controllers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/as5Q5hLxV1kitpTRhdhDRdNDYio=/0x0:1065x710/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70359394/ps5_galaxycollection_hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The five matching case and controller colors of the PlayStation 5.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D2cXWf"&gt;Ever since the PlayStation 5 was announced, opinions regarding its design and styling have been, well, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/6/11/21288541/playstation-5-ps5-sony-design-memes-roast-twitter-router-face-building"&gt;mixed&lt;/a&gt;. Many jokes and memes have been made about the gargantuan size of the PS5, and how its two-tone monochromatic color and stretched-out wings are reminiscent of an oversized router. Jokes aside, once Sony revealed that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21505598/sony-ps5-playstation-5-tear-down-hardware"&gt;the white covers are user-removable&lt;/a&gt;, there has been a demand for replacements. Enough people instantly wanted to own a blacked-out PS5 that a small cottage industry of third-party suppliers cropped up, selling unlicensed accessories until Sony came out swinging with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/16/22728936/dbrand-pulls-ps5-darkplates-from-sale-sony-threatens-legal-action"&gt;cease and desist letters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vnEDZ2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The PS5 Darkplates made me want to grab Sony’s upcoming black faceplates","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22832727/ps5-playstation-5-darkplates-2-0-dbrand-design"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="OVMbnC"&gt;Sony finally came around and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22831965/sony-ps5-covers-faceplates-colors-new-controllers"&gt;announced its own official replacement covers&lt;/a&gt; for the disc-based PS5 and the Digital Edition in December, dubbed the Galaxy Collection, and they’re arriving alongside matching DualSense controllers. The forthcoming faceplates come in black and red — matching the DualSense controllers Sony &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22433966/sony-black-red-dualsense-controllers-playstation-5-ps5"&gt;released over the summer&lt;/a&gt; — as well as entirely new hues called “starlight blue,” “nova pink,” and “galactic purple.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b7l7rZ"&gt;The lineup of colorful DualSense controllers and console covers has a staggered launch window, with some debuting in January and others being withheld as exclusives through PlayStation Direct until February; others are simply “coming soon.” Regardless of exclusivity and release timetable, expect to pay $54.99 for the replacement covers and $74.99 for the new DualSense colors upon their debut. Here, we review all the options on offer, including where you can preorder them and when to expect them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zCSlWS"&gt;We’ll update this post as new information on unannounced release dates is made available, as well as more retailers to buy from. And don’t forget to study the &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/replace-ps5-console-cover/"&gt;instructions for changing your PS5’s outer shell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ENVVA6vjVtnhtwSJzwoXFgnOVAY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23150854/ps5_galaxycollection__dualsense.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uMLEzA"&gt;Where to buy the midnight black cover and DualSense controller&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Lkc0BA"&gt;Quite possibly the most sought-after color for the PS5 is black (don’t you dare call us boring!). Sony already released a DualSense controller and Pulse 3D Wireless Headset with a black finish, and these console covers are the last thing needed to achieve a blackout PS5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fvvstz"&gt;The black DualSense controller is readily available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-DualSense-Wireless-Controller-Midnight-5/dp/B094WL86N5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgmdRL1ghY4" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fdualsense-wireless-controller-for-playstation-5%2F-%2FA-83377785%3Fpreselect%3D83374958%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergehowtopreorderps5coverscontrollers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FDualSense-Wireless-Controller-Midnight-Black%2F596005887&amp;amp;subid1=vergehowtopreorderps5coverscontrollers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergehowtopreorderps5coverscontrollers&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fplaystation-5%2Fgaming-accessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fproducts%2Fsony-dualsense-wireless-controller-midnight-black%2F294963.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt; for about $70. The upcoming console cover in matching black can be preordered from PlayStation Direct for the &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/accessories/accessory/ps5-console-covers-midnight-black.1000029754" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;standard PS5&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/accessories/accessory/ps5-digital-edition-covers-midnight-black.1000029752" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt;, with each costing $54.99. They are being exclusively released via PlayStation Direct on January 21st, with availability at other retailers expected just under a month later on February 18th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WeFxyp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10963526" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="6pxnSY"&gt;Where to buy the cosmic red cover and DualSense controller&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="X1JneG"&gt;The red DualSense controller came out alongside its black counterpart and features monotone red face buttons and a two-tone, red-and-black design. It’s readily available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-DualSense-Wireless-Controller-Cosmic-5/dp/B094WN6SY2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgmdR5DvgeF" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fdualsense-wireless-controller-for-playstation-5%2F-%2FA-83377785%3Fpreselect%3D83374957%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergehowtopreorderps5coverscontrollers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FDualSense-Wireless-Controller-Cosmic-Red%2F487490728&amp;amp;subid1=vergehowtopreorderps5coverscontrollers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergehowtopreorderps5coverscontrollers&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fplaystation-5%2Fgaming-accessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fproducts%2Fsony-dualsense-wireless-controller-cosmic-red%2F294961.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt; for around $75.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WGE0p9"&gt;The red console cover will allow you to take that red-and-black look to the system itself — like some sort of beautifully evil obelisk. It’s up for preorder now at PlayStation Direct for $54.99, sized for the &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/accessories/accessory/ps5-console-covers-cosmic-red.1000029750" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;disc-equipped PS5&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/accessories/accessory/ps5-digital-edition-covers-cosmic-red.1000029748" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt;. Just like the black variant, they also launch on January 21st and are exclusive to Sony’s online store until February 18th, when they will become available at other retailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JvyaJ5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10965059"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="qppZay"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10499071"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5Wxt4E"&gt;Where to buy the starlight blue, nova pink, and galactic purple covers and DualSense controllers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="56ZSW2"&gt;Here’s where things start to get a little more complicated. The blue, purple, and pink covers are not yet available for preorder. Sony still only lists each as “coming soon,” with no official release date given. Retailers do not have listings for them either, but the corresponding controllers are up for preorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pqV4Nz"&gt;If bright blue is for you, you can get it first in controller form beginning on January 14th when the blue DualSense begins to ship. You can currently preorder it at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-DualSense-Wireless-Controller-Starlight-Blue/dp/B09NLJGTHL?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgmdQiVbvhS" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fdualsense-wireless-controller-for-playstation-5%2F-%2FA-83377785%3Fpreselect%3D85561293%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergehowtopreorderps5coverscontrollers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FDualSense-Wireless-Controller-Starlight-Blue%2F844540146&amp;amp;subid1=vergehowtopreorderps5coverscontrollers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergehowtopreorderps5coverscontrollers&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fgaming-accessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fplaystation-5%2Fproducts%2Fsony-dualsense-wireless-controller-starlight-blue%2F328284.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt; for $74.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hrzALF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10965122"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5iSkHR"&gt;The pink DualSense, quite possibly the brightest of all these galaxy-themed colors, will also be available for $74.99. It’s launching everywhere simultaneously with the blue model on January 14th, and you can preorder it ahead of time at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-DualSense-Wireless-Controller-Nova-Pink/dp/B09NJNR716?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgmdRpKnoFX" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fdualsense-wireless-controller-for-playstation-5%2F-%2FA-83377785%3Fpreselect%3D85561292%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergehowtopreorderps5coverscontrollers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FDualSense-Wireless-Controller-Nova-Pink%2F331182846&amp;amp;subid1=vergehowtopreorderps5coverscontrollers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergehowtopreorderps5coverscontrollers&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fgaming-accessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fplaystation-5%2Fproducts%2Fsony-dualsense-wireless-controller-nova-pink%2F328285.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="oXQvu6"&gt;Lastly, the Galactic Purple DualSense controller is only available for preorder from &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/accessories/accessory/dualsense-wireless-controller-galactic-purple.3006396" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation Direct&lt;/a&gt; — for that same $74.99. This is the only controller that Sony is keeping exclusive to its own online storefront, though it launches the same day as the others on January 14th. You will have to wait until February 11th for it to be sold elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The 2021 iPad Mini with 5G support is $20 off today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x_PbK6QfFen4CTiTRd0NUmXJzL4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70359178/vpavic_210924_4766_0022_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPad mini 6 (LTE) is selling for $629.98 today.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IIKQDn"&gt;If you’ve been waiting for a deal to drop on Apple’s latest iPad Mini, today is your lucky day. Discounts on the LTE- and 5G-ready version of the iPad Mini are rare, but Amazon has &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G99C83X?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the 64GB model (usually $649.99) for $629.98&lt;/a&gt;. That is a small discount, but for context, it’s actually $1 shy of its best price we’ve seen yet for this model. The tablet, which released in 2021, is equipped with Apple’s A15 Bionic processor, a 12MP rear camera, and USB-C support. It also comes with Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams"&gt;Center Stage feature&lt;/a&gt;, which allows the front-facing camera to digitally pan and zoom in during video calls. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BUjtJj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10964801"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="cZqZCV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here’s how the new iPad Mini compares to the last-gen model","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22677944/apple-ipad-mini-2019-vs-2021-comparison-upgrade-worthwhile"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="xkoJUi"&gt;We’ve got another Apple deal for you, but this one may help you achieve your fitness goals, if you have some. While we’ve been seeing a lot of deals on the 41mm and 45mm GPS versions, we haven’t seen as many LTE-ready Apple Watch Series 7 sales. That has changed recently, as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09HFM35F9/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is offering the bigger 45mm LTE Apple Watch Series 7 selling at $509&lt;/a&gt;. That price applies to a few colorways with aluminum-clad cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7XFpDz"&gt;If you want a best-ever price, check out the 45mm GPS and LTE Series 7 watches that have stainless steel cases. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09HFGVDS6/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Some of those are selling for $629&lt;/a&gt;, which is a whopping $120 discount from their normal $749 price. The Series 7 features an edge-to-edge display, which is larger than its predecessor, as well as IP6X dust resistance. It can track statistics like heart rate, blood oxygen, EKG, and more. &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/26269955.4573/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIyNzIyNTMzL2FwcGxlLXdhdGNoLXNlcmllcy03LXJldmlldy1zY3JlZW4td2F0Y2hvcy1mZWF0dXJlcw/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03B0da29cbb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WkMSO7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10964902"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z78XRP"&gt;Shifting away from great smartwatches to useful and fun smart bulbs, right now, Philips Hue is taking 20 percent off some of its most popular smart light bulbs, strips, and more during its mix-and-match sale that lasts until January 17th. To get the discount, which applies to the total purchase cost, you’ll need to &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgmX9FIUoZ0" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;choose four items from this list&lt;/a&gt;. The new price will be reflected at checkout and your order will ship for free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NzxZDt"&gt;As for what the promo includes, there are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgmYa7ZbyWv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgmYbroZ5BP" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three packs&lt;/a&gt; of Philips Hue A19 E26 white and color ambiance bulbs, which typically retail for $79.99 and $134.99, respectively. If you need to stock up on several bulbs, you stand to save a lot of money today. Though, understandably, you might not be in a position to put down that much cash. So if you prefer to buy just one kit, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Hue-Bluetooth-compatible-Assistant/dp/B07QV9XB87/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is selling a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Hue-Bluetooth-Compatible-Assistant/dp/B08D9N7RJ4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three-pack of white and color A19 ambiance bulbs for $109.99&lt;/a&gt; (usually $134.99).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IYMVOK"&gt;These smart bulbs can pair to your phone via Bluetooth or to your existing setup of Philips Hue bulbs via the Hue Bridge, which uses Zigbee. That latter connectivity allows for the likes of Apple HomeKit and Amazon Alexa to be able to control them. These bulbs support several color temperature options, adjustable smart timers, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Sleepbuds are small enough to fit snugly into your ear." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gjNQfrOBCv32C7irpg2-e230IYg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22175615/akrales_201215_4331_0033.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nAwJSC"&gt;If one of your New Year’s resolutions is to get healthier, or practice better self-care, this deal on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22176950/bose-sleepbuds-ii-earbuds-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bose Sleepbuds II&lt;/a&gt; may help. Right now, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Sleepbuds-II-Technology-clinically/dp/B08FRR6Z1N?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the $249 earbuds are selling for an all-time low of $199 on Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgmGkKbWpgY" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Designed to help you sleep better, these small earbuds silence external sounds and replace them with a combination of relaxing sounds and music. Unlike its predecessor, which suffered from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/4/20899371/bose-sleepbuds-faulty-battery-issues-problem-refunds-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;inconsistent battery life and abrupt shutdowns&lt;/a&gt;, these are apparently much improved per Barbara Krasnoff’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22176950/bose-sleepbuds-ii-earbuds-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;. They’re also comfortable to wear, effective at silencing a range of noises, and you can even them use to set an alarm or to be alerted to phone calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jtvbaP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10965214"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SfO4a7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WFJKK2T?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Arlo’s Essential indoor camera is selling for $78.49&lt;/a&gt; on Amazon, an all-time low price on this smart home device that usually costs $100. It launched last year, and alongside two-way talk capabilities, the Arlo Essential indoor camera offers a privacy shield to cover the lens, a siren, night vision support, a 1080p sensor, and a 130-degree field of view. While we’ve yet to test it for ourselves, our smart home reviewer Jennifer Pattison Tuohy notes Arlo’s cameras tend to be of good quality. However, as you’ll need to pay for the monthly subscription to be able to get the most use out of it, this is more of a must-see deal for those who may already have multiple Arlo cameras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jO0kyz"&gt;If you’re looking for a standalone camera, there are better, more affordable options on the market. The Blink Mini is one example, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Mini-plug-security-detection/dp/B07X6C9RMF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costing $34.99&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9pF95d"&gt;Here are some other great deals going on:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="U1gbcp"&gt;Like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22859098/garmin-venu-2-plus-vivomove-sport-smartwatches" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recently announced Garmin Venu 2 Plus&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22524882/garmin-venu-2-fitness-watch-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Venu 2&lt;/a&gt; is a great pick that boasts an array of sensors, ranging from a barometric altimeter for elevation to a thermometer, although it lacks a mic or speaker (both are found in the Venu 2 Plus). If those omissions don’t bother you, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Smaller-Sized-Smartwatch-Monitoring-010-02429-02/dp/B0911XHHCN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is selling the Venu 2 for $349.99 instead of $399.99&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="52vf6c"&gt;Find your lost items quickly with the Tile Pro Bluetooth Tracker, which &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B2WLRWX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is currently selling for $29.99&lt;/a&gt; — one of its best prices yet, down from $35. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="igxs8I"&gt;If you’re shopping for a budget-friendly streaming stick, Woot is selling the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289197/amazon-fire-tv-stick-2020-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Fire TV stick&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13142092?sid=TheVergeDailyDeals162022&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Ffire-tv-stick-with-alexa-voice-remote-2020-release-8" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$19.99 (usually $39.99) until January 23rd&lt;/a&gt;. The device works with older TVs, and you can search for shows and movies to watch using vocal commands with Alexa’s Voice Remote, which is included in the price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>CES had a pretty good year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A BMW concept using e-ink to automatically change the paint color on a car from white to black and back again" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5bJO2NqWdUmUgjGuobP-7_cVb3A=/34x0:4929x3263/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70358935/37_SW_FinBMW_iX_eInk_Seite_02.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A BMW concept using e-ink to automatically change the paint color on a car from white to black and back again&lt;/em&gt; | BMW&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q83Crg"&gt;Another year of the Consumer Electronics Show has wrapped up, and it was a strange one: the weeks leading up to it were filled with cancellations due to Omicron, and as a result the show floor was virtually empty. The keynote presentations lacked the usual spectacle; the pomp was overshadowed by the circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O71uDU"&gt;Nevertheless, I &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/backlon/status/1478409885431730179"&gt;found myself surprised&lt;/a&gt; to realize that CES 2022 was a slightly better than average year for the show. There weren’t any industry-shaking products announced and shipping — but that almost never happens at CES, and the expectation that it should was always misguided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pUZvUh"&gt;Instead, we saw some genuinely good improvements on technology that will actually ship, which isn’t always the case at CES. Here are just a few of my favorites:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="uwTGGr"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://t.co/wrON4JItQp"&gt;Dell’s XPS 13 Plus&lt;/a&gt; is a bold (maybe too bold) reimagining of a classic laptop design. It’s too bad the company mixed some interesting ideas with one obviously bad one: dropping the headphone jack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wvf4QH"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://t.co/klh9SpUVJ5"&gt;AMD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://t.co/OU7KoJTwhC"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt; both had chip announcements that should lead to some solid computers (although an M1-level revolution isn’t on the table for PCs yet). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GZRgF8"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22870187/smart-home-gadget-ces-2022-roundup-samsung-wemo-eve"&gt;smart home ecosystem is gearing&lt;/a&gt; up for a big year with more ambitious products designed to actually work together with the new Matter standard. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lXt85I"&gt;There’s a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867790/samsung-odyssey-arc-curved-gaming-monitor"&gt;curved monitor&lt;/a&gt; you can rotate 90 degrees so it swoops over your head. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EGlBIJ"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22858402/home-robot-labrador-caddie-retriever-smart-self-driving-shelf"&gt;home robot that could actually be useful&lt;/a&gt; because it doesn’t try to do anything too futuristic, just provide the service of helping people with mobility issues carry stuff around. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UnuVa6"&gt;New &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865220/sony-a95k-qd-oled-qdoled-4k-tv-announced-features-explainer"&gt;Quantum Dot OLED technology&lt;/a&gt; that should allow OLED screens to be much brighter — plus there’s the CES intrigue of Sony announcing a TV with a Samsung-made panel before Samsung itself announced a TV. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Q7qdE8"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865673/samsung-freestyle-portable-lifestyle-projector-not-olds"&gt;portable projector that manages to solve for the actual hassles&lt;/a&gt; involved with portable projectors. It was almost like the product manager used these types of products and understood their problems. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OyO1R6"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866703/hp-elite-dragonfly-g3-chromebook-enterprise-laptops"&gt;Chromebook that slots into the high-end spot&lt;/a&gt; that’s been frustratingly empty for about two years now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="fUk2zN"&gt;Then there’s the stuff that will likely never ship but are worth examining as the concepts that they are. Not because they’re inspiring examples of hashtag-innovation, but because they reveal the id of consumer tech: companies that desperately want you to believe they’re innovative, environmentally friendly, and have multi-year roadmaps that are actually realistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2nb7Va"&gt;I’m talking about electric cars, of course. CES is just as much a car show as it is a gadget show — and the cars are all gadgets now, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9FqIj"&gt;There was one concept car that was just unabashedly fun because it was cool and because nobody pretended that it would turn into a real product. That would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22867090/bmw-color-changing-paint-electric-car-ces"&gt;BMW’s use of E Ink on the body panels of an iX&lt;/a&gt; to give it the ability to change from black to white at the flip of a switch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fYZA56"&gt;But we sit in a strange time where every car manufacturer needs to earnestly project that they’re switching to electric but &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/2021/12/21/22846960/electric-vehicles-car-companies-promises-ship-dates"&gt;most of them have yet to ship EVs at meaningful scale&lt;/a&gt;. Which means that CES 2022 was filled with more than its usual share of concept cars and paper-thin promises that in [insert year here], the company will be fully electric. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="tevrRd"&gt;The biggest car news of the show was undoubtedly the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22863648/chevy-silverado-electric-truck-specs-price"&gt;Chevy Silverado EV&lt;/a&gt;, but it has a target ship date of late 2023, which is plenty of time for plans to change. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="66TCRJ"&gt;Mercedes-Benz had a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22855555/mercedes-benz-vision-eqxx-ev-range-ces-2022"&gt;DB5-looking concept&lt;/a&gt; whose purpose was to convince us that 600+ mile ranges could be easily achievable in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Itu06e"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22868578/cadillac-av-concept-innerspace-ces-2022"&gt;Cadillac&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22862387/chrysler-electric-only-2028-airflow-concept-ces-2022"&gt;Chrysler&lt;/a&gt; both had concepts that aren’t really going anywhere (literally and figuratively, I suppose).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NLQ05S"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866219/bmw-ix-m60-electric-vehicle-range-specs-date"&gt;BMW’s non-E-Ink iX M60 looks like a rad performance crossover&lt;/a&gt; and its summer 2022 release date seems promising. But the electric crossover space is awash in announced-but-barely-shipped EVs and so the burden of proof is on BMW to make this thing at volume. (The same burden lies on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22868410/gm-chevy-equinox-blazer-ev-announced-ces"&gt;Chevy’s promised $30k Equinox&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0wVFsj"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866831/hyundai-robot-mobility-pnd-dnl-autonomous-ces"&gt;Hyundai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22867455/gm-sell-autonomous-vehicles-personally-owned-timeline"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22866190/volvo-ride-pilot-level-3-autonomous-subscription-california"&gt;Volvo&lt;/a&gt; each made bombastic autonomous driving claims when it would have been better to let the results speak for themselves when (or if) they actually happen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="o6Qr0z"&gt;Most egregiously of all to me, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867818/sony-mobility-cars-vision-prototype-ces-2022"&gt;Sony said it’s launching an entirely new company to “explore” getting into the car manufacturing game&lt;/a&gt; alongside revealing another concept vehicle. I would love to be proven wrong, but it read like a blatantly disingenuous grasp at attention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="zAUT81"&gt;So I am clearly put off by the concept cars this year — but I also have a modicum of sympathy because in this precise moment supply chain issues make ramping up any new thing difficult. CES is the place for tech hype, so it’s no surprise that car companies are participating in that. But when the hyped tech is a category of devices that could be an essential part of eliminating our use of fossil fuels, my sympathy doesn’t go as far as it otherwise would. We &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; EVs to be real and widespread, so looking at concepts that are probably vaporware stings more than if it were a fancy monitor or a weird pretend robot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BD24Pa"&gt;But look away from the concept cars (except the E Ink one — that one is still cool). There were plenty of pedestrian laptops, wearables, and various other gadgets that will surely come out this year and definitely seem like improvements on what came before. Nothing worthy of their own keynotes, but all in all a decent enough haul for a weird year at CES. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Fdshx"&gt;Here’s a representative example: one of the staff’s favorite announcements here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22856102/lg-97-42-inch-oled-4k-8k-qned-tvs-announced-features"&gt;LG’s 42-inch OLED TV&lt;/a&gt;. We loved it not because it was a massive, wall-sized TV but because it was small and useful. It fills a hole that needed to be filled — a TV with superb picture quality that works in a smaller room (or, alternately, a potentially cool option for a gaming monitor). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oSyryb"&gt;Here’s one more: L’Oreal’s created a hair gadget that combines a dye cartridge with a brush with vibrating bristles. It handles the amount of dye and makes applying it much easier. It’s not Wi-Fi enabled. There is no app. It doesn’t support Bluetooth. It seems great in part because it lacks those things — and the time that would have been wasted building that tech in was instead put into designing it for its actual purpose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RIVyVZ"&gt;That’s what I mean when I say it was a pretty good year for CES. There were more gadgets that seemed more useful this year, making the vaporware easier to ignore. Practicality: what a concept.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s latest Echo Show update adds more live video news providers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pvDM7VaiI_MvN54hQ20hgQyTyrI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70358744/dseifert_210219_4433_0012.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last year’s Echo Show 10.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qlwu7n"&gt;Amazon has announced a couple of small quality of life improvements for different Alexa devices. Its Echo Show lineup of smart displays are getting more live video news content in the US and an easier way to navigate news channels. Meanwhile, mobile Alexa devices are also gaining the ability to share your ETA while you’re using their navigation features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dW1DGQ"&gt;The new live video content providers for Echo Show owners in the US are from People TV, ET Live, and Bloomberg TV Plus. Amazon says it has more on the way soon. These new channels, as well as the Echo Show’s existing library of live video and on demand audio news channels, can now be accessed via a new provider list that’ll be displayed at the bottom of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1zVjEm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Live content from People TV, ET Live, and Bloomberg TV Plus is now available&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UoUyNC"&gt;As well as offering manual selection, compatible Echo Show devices can also personalize the news they show you by listening to your voice using Voice ID, or your appearance using Visual ID. Visual ID launched alongside the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22839220/amazon-echo-show-15-review-wall-mounted-alexa-tablet-kitchen-tv"&gt;Echo Show 15&lt;/a&gt;. The feature is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=23615589011"&gt;also available&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review"&gt;Echo Show 10 (3rd gen)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review"&gt;Echo Show 8 (2nd gen)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lkqaQm"&gt;If you’re the kind of person that uses Alexa for navigation on devices like the Echo Auto, Echo Buds, Echo Frames, or a car with Alexa built-in, then the new ETA sharing feature could be a useful addition. Amazon says asking Alexa to “share my ETA home” will announce your predicted arrival time to your other Alexa-enabled devices like smart speakers. If your mobile Alexa device is paired with an Android smartphone you can also send an ETA via text by saying “Alexa, share my ETA with X,” where “X” is the name of one of your contacts. Alexa’s navigation feature draws from the default navigation app on your paired smartphone, according to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html?ref_=help_search_1-4&amp;amp;nodeId=GA2XEQXBHZUAA6HJ&amp;amp;qid=1641559142721&amp;amp;sr=1-4"&gt;Amazon’s support page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Discord hacking is the newest threat for NFT buyers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7TICXBLmVGxyF_XOuxVRXsrpAeA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70358664/acastro_210106_4957_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;One compromised admin account led to two projects being scammed in a day&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="fWvBB5"&gt;On Tuesday, December 21st, two NFT projects fell victim to the same attack. Like many projects in the crypto world, the NFT collection Monkey Kingdom and in-game asset marketplace Fractal both engaged heavily with their communities through Discord chat servers. Both projects were about to distribute rewards to their community members: Monkey Kingdom through an NFT presale on the day of the 21st and Fractal through a token airdrop — essentially a free distribution to early supporters — a few days later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qZS5C6"&gt;Then, disaster struck. Posts appeared in the official “announcements” channel of each project claiming that a surprise mint would reward community members with a limited edition NFT. Hundreds jumped at the chance — but for those who followed the links and connected their crypto wallets, a costly surprise was waiting. Rather than receiving an NFT, wallets were being drained of the Solana cryptocurrency, which both projects used for purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XiSUnZ"&gt;In the space of an hour, a Twitter post, first &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MonkeyKingdom_/status/1473312369556213769"&gt;from Monkey Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/justinkan/status/1473328245030277122"&gt;then from Fractal&lt;/a&gt;, informed followers that their Discord servers had been hacked; news of the NFT mints was bogus, the links a phishing fraud. In the case of Fractal, the scammers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22848840/scammers-steal-crypto-nft-project-fractal-discord-hack-solana"&gt;got away with about $150,000 worth of cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt;. For Monkey Kingdom, the estimated total was &lt;a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/hong-kong-nft-project-monkey-kingdom-loses-1-3m-in-phishing-hack-launches-compensation-fund"&gt;reported to be $1.3 million&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Bhku8l"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the same techniques that hype up a sale can also open the door to hackers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r4nfzb"&gt;Neither attack targeted the blockchain or the tokens themselves. Instead, the thieves exploited weaknesses in the infrastructure used to sell the tokens — specifically, the Discord chatrooms where NFT fans gather. It’s a reminder of a persistent weakness in the growing NFT economy, where surprise drops have primed buyers to move fast or risk missing out. But the same techniques that hype up a sale can also open the door to hackers — and in this case, a single compromise can end up spreading to more than one community at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xUsofG"&gt;In this case, the NFTs thieves had targeted a feature known as a webhook. Webhooks are used by many web applications (Discord included) to listen for a message sent to a particular URL and trigger an event in response, like posting content to a certain channel. You can think of a webhook like a secret phone number, a unique identifier that can be “called” (or, in a closer approximation, “texted”) to connect to an application on the other end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7c06SM"&gt;By gaining access to webhooks belonging to the Fractal and Monkey Kingdom Discord servers, the hackers were able to send messages that were broadcast to all members of certain channels: a feature meant to be used only for official communications from the project teams. This was where the fake “announcement” had come from and why it had pointed to a scam address. In hindsight, the content should have raised some red flags — but given the distribution method, it looked just legitimate enough that many were fooled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="l5IiLd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“we are always working to make it harder for these attacks to happen and will continue to invest in education and tools to help protect our users”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TODSKE"&gt;Discord webhooks are used to automate messages based on activities in other applications: for example, the &lt;a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks"&gt;official documentation&lt;/a&gt; describes making a bot that notifies a channel of new GitHub commits. But it’s easy to lose track of those bots amid the various third-party service integrations, and crucially, there’s no way to switch off all of them at once if you’ve been hacked. The result is a major opportunity for attackers and a liability for any Discord communities who aren’t paying attention to their integrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J6tDQW"&gt;A Discord spokesperson said the company cautioned people to be careful when giving others access to their devices and personal information and pointed to guidance made available through its Moderator Academy &lt;a href="https://discord.com/moderation"&gt;resource center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PKP4j2"&gt;“Discord takes the safety of all users and communities very seriously, including social engineering attacks like these,” said Peter Day, senior manager of corporate communications at Discord. “While there are clear controls in place, we are always working to make it harder for these attacks to happen and will continue to invest in education and tools to help protect our users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="LuHYgv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is one of those things that really hurts you, both in terms of pride and professionalism”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WNBHhq"&gt;The origin of the hack appears to have been a service called Grape Network, which provides community management tools to Fractal, Monkey Kingdom, and hundreds of other crypto projects that used Discord. Roughly a week before the cryptocurrency theft, an employee of Grape Network going by the screen name Arximedis had been caught by a separate scam on another Discord server entirely, this one belonging to Solana. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u7UPQs"&gt;By first manipulating a Solana moderator, then Arximedis himself, through a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LittlelemonsNFT/status/1477923368053706755"&gt;phishing attack that involves getting the target banned&lt;/a&gt;, the hackers had managed to obtain an account access token that let them perform actions on behalf of the Grape administrator. It was enough to let them create an avenue to send messages to the Fractal and Monkey Kingdom Discord channels. With the groundwork in place, the hackers kept quiet and waited for a time to strike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ND5ctD"&gt;Grape Network founder Dean Pappas confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that his colleague had been the target of the initial hack and that this first hack had been exploited to create the webhooks that were used in the second. “This is one of those things that really hurts you, both in terms of pride and professionalism,” Pappas said. “It’s a very difficult situation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GZRRCB"&gt;In a statement sent via Twitter, the head of the Monkey Kingdom project (who asked to be referred to by the pseudonym “Monkey King”) said that additional security measures had now been put in place to avoid future attacks and ensure the safety of users. The Monkey King also pointed to the money raised by the project to refund victims of the scam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4nz8Zj"&gt;NFT projects are particularly vulnerable to this kind of attack because they move so quickly. Hyped projects often sell out within hours — or sometimes minutes — so early adopters are conditioned to act fast. And Discord, now the go-to platform for NFT communities, is where the early intel on presales and airdrops is released first. That means community members are primed to jump on any announcements that give them an edge, which, in turn, lets scammers leverage fake messages to devastating effect.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="E5XCGu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;community members are primed to jump on any announcements that give them an edge&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NMfTtu"&gt;In the most heated drops, making a successful transaction can be difficult even for the early movers. &lt;a href="https://go.chainalysis.com/nft-market-report.html"&gt;A Chainalysis examination&lt;/a&gt; of one popular project showed that more than 26,000 unsuccessful mint transactions occurred within the first hour after launch, each of which used up nonrefundable transaction fees. All told, more than $4 million was spent on gas fees for unsuccessful transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F0CBHH"&gt;There’s no indication yet that the NFT craze will slow in 2022, which means there’ll be no shortage of new projects looking to scale by using off-the-shelf solutions to build their infrastructure. There are signs that Discord, the beating social pulse of the NFT community, is also a goldmine for unscrupulous individuals looking to separate marks from their hard-earned coins — but perhaps as techniques of moderation and server administration in the community improve, more rigorous management of problem areas (like webhooks and third-party plugins) will reduce risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="amkDkT"&gt;The good news is that, for the two projects affected by this particular hack, there may be sunnier days ahead. Fractal, the game asset marketplace, &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/30/justin-kans-gaming-nft-platform-goes-live-rebounding-from-150k-discord-exploit/"&gt;went live&lt;/a&gt; on the penultimate day of 2021. And having reimbursed money that was lost by members, Monkey Kingdom is relaunching the NFT line that was interrupted by the hack. The community is loyal, the Monkey King told us, and fans are once again ready to pick up a deal.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>France fines Google and Facebook for pushing tracking cookies on users with dark patterns</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5mfthtfGqNbJOU581sdjTzStz_A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70358398/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5HD1YN"&gt;If you ever feel like websites have turned the simple business of rejecting tracking cookies into a labyrinthine task that involves close-reading of multiple dialog boxes, then France’s data protection agency has your back. The watchdog (CNIL) has &lt;a href="https://www.cnil.fr/en/cookies-cnil-fines-google-total-150-million-euros-and-facebook-60-million-euros-non-compliance"&gt;fined Google €150 million ($170 million) and Facebook €60 million ($68 million)&lt;/a&gt; for making it too confusing for users to reject cookies. The companies now have three months to change their ways in France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b9hHwC"&gt;With Facebook, CNIL &lt;a href="https://www.cnil.fr/en/cookies-facebook-ireland-limited-fined-60-million-euros"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that in order to refuse cookies, French users first have to click on a button labelled “&lt;em&gt;Accept&lt;/em&gt; cookies” (emphasis ours). Such labelling “necessarily generates confusion,” says CNIL, leading users to believe they have no choice in the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YiWiZx"&gt;With Google, the problem is one of asymmetry rather than mislabeling. CNIL &lt;a href="https://www.cnil.fr/en/cookies-google-fined-150-million-euros"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that the company’s websites (including YouTube) allow users to accept all cookies with a single click. But, to reject them, they have to click through several different menu items. Clearly, users are being steered in a particular direction that just so happens to benefit Google. (I’m well aware that &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t offer a single-click “reject all” cookie button either.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="njcxPa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google and Facebook are using dark patterns to push cookies on users&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QsmBEA"&gt;EU law states that when citizens hand over data online, they must do so freely and with a full understanding of the choice they are making. CNIL’s judgement is that Google and Facebook are essentially tricking their users, deploying what are known as “dark patterns” — a style of subtly coercive user interface design — to wangle consent and so breaking the law. Hence the fines and the demand that the companies change their cookie UI design within three months. Failure to do so risks additional fines of €100,000 per day, says CNIL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lak2rG"&gt;For anyone particularly interested in the details of European internet regulation (you poor fools), the case is also interesting in that CNIL is acting under the authority of a bit of EU legislation known as the ePrivacy Directive, rather than the more recently-introduced General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). 	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0mbZ5k"&gt;Over at &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;, Natasha Lomas &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/cnil-facebook-google-cookie-consent-eprivacy-breaches/"&gt;offers a great explanation as to why this is&lt;/a&gt;, which I’ll do my best to condense. The problem is that GDPR enforcement is funneled through the data watchdog of Ireland, where many US tech firms locate their European headquarters. That  particular agency has proved itself to be &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/29/apple-google-data-watchdog-in-europe-facing-accusations.html"&gt;a little &lt;em&gt;slow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in running down such complaints, which — only a cynic might suggest — is part and parcel of the friendly regulatory environment cultivated by the Irish state to attract US tech money in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hw1TAl"&gt;So, in order to get some timely enforcement (or any enforcement) France’s data watchdog has turned to the older ePrivacy Directive, which allows national agencies direct oversight in their own territories. It’s an effective workaround, and CNIL has previously used ePrivacy to fine Google and Amazon &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/france-fines-google-120m-and-amazon-42m-for-dropping-tracking-cookies-without-consent/"&gt;on similar issues&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, as Lomas points out, Google has yet to face a single regulatory sanction from Ireland’s data watchdog under GDPR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8CTamU"&gt;What’s the upshot of all this? Well, if you live in France, you may get a slightly easier option to reject cookies from Google and Facebook sometime in the future. Which is nice, sure, but hardly the sort of decisive action that — if you agree with the stated desire of EU’s fractured, multi-headed data regulation — is supposed to redress the imbalance of power between tech firms and average consumers. But that’s just the way the cookies crumble.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Stephen Hawking Doodle includes narration in the physicist’s voice</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lmC_lqCq0b63Z-E5qy4YhLknLyY=/0x0:1440x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70358338/Stephen_Hawking_s_80th_Birthday.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yX8vfu"&gt;This weekend, Google will release a Doodle celebrating what would have been Stephen Hawking’s 80th birthday. The &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Isim0ysZ6X4"&gt;two and a half minute-long video&lt;/a&gt; will go live in the US at midnight ET tonight (9pm PT) and includes a narration in the physicist’s own computer-generated voice (created and used with permission from his estate) outlining his work and painting a message of hope for the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mvOiu8"&gt;Hawking’s digital voice was one of the most recognizable characteristics of the late physicist, who used it to speak after losing his voice due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Although more advanced artificial voices were developed over the course of his lifetime, the physicist &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/01/intel-gave-stephen-hawking-voice/"&gt;continued to use the original voice&lt;/a&gt; with its American accent after having grown attached to it through years of use. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nUXg3U"&gt;The scientist’s children welcomed Google’s Doodle. “He would have found it important to show that he never allowed the challenges of his physical condition to limit his power of expression nor his determination to make an impact on the world in which he lived,” Hawking’s children Lucy, Robert, and Tim Hawking said in a statement. “We hope that his example offers inspiration and hope globally to all who face great challenges at this difficult time.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xeo515"&gt;Stephen Hawking passed away in 2018, at the age of 76, after living with ALS for over half a century. The Doodle was illustrated by Google art director Matthew Cruickshank.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft PowerToys gets a new Always On Top feature and launcher web search</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZUpvq9VCRJE0oy5-K-TYjOEMSl8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70358322/VRG_ILLO_4030_Windows_10_Guide_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M7tj0D"&gt;Microsoft is updating PowerToys this week to include a new Always On Top feature and web search functionality in its Spotlight-like launcher. Version 0.53.1 includes the two highly-requested features, alongside a long list of bug fixes and improvements to Microsoft’s 12 PowerToys tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0TnPw7"&gt;Always On Top, as the name implies, allows any app to always be in front of others, even if you switch focus to another window. While many apps already support this, PowerToys now ensures anything can be pinned, which is particularly useful for older apps that you might want to keep on top of others across multiple monitors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f_YF0yD2euC238pUQ8Msx_gZ60Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23152123/8Q8xsxu.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Always On Top PowerToy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nzTl3j"&gt;As games typically run fullscreen and on top of other windows, the Always On Top PowerToy even includes a Game Mode toggle, to allow games to run fullscreen above pinned apps. Other settings include the ability to show a colored border around a pinned app, and even play a sound when an app is pinned. You can also exclude apps from being pinned, and activate Always On Top using the Windows key + Ctrl + T combination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="It4DD5"&gt;The second useful addition to PowerToys is web search in the Run launcher. Microsoft first debuted its Spotlight-like launcher &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21262060/microsoft-windows-10-launcher-powertoy-spotlight-alfred-download-build"&gt;nearly two years ago&lt;/a&gt;, allowing Windows users to quickly search for apps and files across the OS. It finally has web search now, allowing you to quickly search the web using your default browser and default search engine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mi86D1t_BJLXh5XyHaVBStv61TY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23152124/7gTGBhV.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;PowerToys Run now has web search.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="szoaRJ"&gt;The default activation command for web results is “??,” or you’ll be offered search results if Run can’t find a relevant file or app. Alongside these two additions, Microsoft and its open source community of developers has also added in support for G-code thumbnails in File Explorer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vAMyRy"&gt;PowerToys version 0.53.1 is available now from Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/releases/tag/v0.53.1"&gt;PowerToys GitHub page&lt;/a&gt;, or through the &lt;a href="https://aka.ms/getPowertoys"&gt;Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
